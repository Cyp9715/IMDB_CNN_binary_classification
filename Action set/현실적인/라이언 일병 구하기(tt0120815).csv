i know its fashionable to trash successful movies but at least be honest about the trashing pvt was fiction but it was pretty good historical fiction the details were well thought out and based on realitythere was nothing stupid about the portrayal of the german army rommel did blunder in his placement of force the high command did think calais was going to be the invasion spot not normandy hitler didnt wake up until noon on that day and his aides were afraid to wake him the rangers did come in right behind the first wave and did take a beach exit by sheer will to get the hell off the beach the bluffs were the scene of heavy close fighting the german defenders were mostly eastern european conscripts from defeated areas note that the 2 men that tried to surrender were not speaking german there was a young man rescued from interior normandy after his brothers were all killed he was an airborne trooper the difference was that he was found by a chaplain and was removed from the frontthe battles inside normandy were small actions town to town street to street house to house small actions like taking the radar station happened small actions like a handful of men defending a river bridge against odds happened small squads of men formed out of the misdrops banded together ad hoc to fight there were all enlisted groups and all officer groups a general did die in the glider assault fubar aptly described much of what happened that dayand there were only americans in the movie because the brits and canadians were many klicks away in a different area this was omaha beach the story was an american one and monty did bog down the advance and everyone knew it and as for american stereotypes well those pretty much define america my college roomie was a wiseass new york jew my best friend was a second generation east coast sicilian  my college girlfriend was a third generation german my first wife was french and english im irish my boss is norwegian and i work with a navaho you get the pointso much for it being bad history it was in fact an excellent way to let a jaded and somewhat ignorantoftheirpast generation feel something of what their grandparents living grandparents went through it is perhaps less important that the details be exact as the feel be right even now the details are not fully known or knowable about that campaign it was too big too complex and too chaotic to be knowable there is not even an accurate casualty count of dday itselfnow as to the depth of characters what i saw there was the extraordinary circumstances into which ordinary people were thrown and what happened to them i saw the things that would mark a generation i have heard in my elderly male patients sentiments similar to what cpt miller was expressing when he announced his ordinariness i saw the dehumanization that occurs with war and its mitigation moment to moment man to man cpt miller didnt know anything about and he didnt care until revealed his humanity to him with his story of his brothers pvt reiban was ready to walk out of the situation until he discoverd his captains ordinariness and his humanity then he began to look to him almost as a father pvt mellish rightfully delights in his revenge for all the times hes had to take it because he was jewish by telling german captives hes juden nerdish cpl upham can stand alongside his bigger stronger braver ranger compatriots and describe the poetry and melancholy of edith piafs song then face his cowardice turn around and stand up in the face of danger and finally demonstrate the dehumanization of the enterprise he was enmeshed in by executing steamboat willie even though willie had no more choice about being there than upham did and in other circumstances would have made a friendi could go on and on with this but enough already ok perhaps it is not the best movie ever made but it is still a good movie and if one will take the blinders of fashionable negativism off they will see it finally this is not a patriotic story if anything it is an acknowledgement and thank you to all those old men still out there that did so much for us to them i say a deep and sincere thank you,reality
id heard a couple of startling things about this film before seeing it id heard that many veterans were having a hard time getting through the film without breaking down id also seen interviews with veterans whod seen the film and found the film to be incredibly realistic and consequently difficult to watch intriguing comments since we all know there is no shortage of films about war from this centurythere are not many films that ive seen that have actually made me physically react to the action on screen im not speaking of the threedimensional variety either what i mean to say is this film had me contorting and cringing at the gripping horrifying action on screen somehow the extreme violence can be justified as the whole world knows that this is an important chapter in human history and a startling graphic depiction only adds more weight to the seriousness of the subject matter id have to say this is probably one of the most important films of the 20th century because of its frank approach to one of the darkest periods of our time on this earth i am always deeply moved and fiercely proud when given cause to consider those that gave their lives to protect our way of life and liberate those that already suffered dislocation imprisonment and attempted genocide these soldiers were truly noble and deserve our deepest gratitude this sentiment is a common one and will go some lengths to explain why this film has meant so much to so manyeven with the attention to detail and care taken into how it was shot to accentuate to the fullest degree its realistic approach it is still hard to imagine what it must have been like to be part of a war but this film goes a long way to help your mind get around it its hard for me to say what kind of impact the cinematography would have on someone watching it on the small screen of a television versus the big screen but from my perspective this film really does benefit from a theatrical presentationwhat does extremely well is show the world the harsh reality of war without pulling any punches the story about a squad of soldiers sent to retrieve the surviving brother of three dead soldiers is told with competency and due reverence from all perspectives of the characters involved it is an uncommon and intriguing drama but it serves as an excuse to describe a setting rather than the other way around the story manages to move us through all sorts of different landscapes and scenarios giving us an unforgettable glimpse of a world unknown to most of us and terrifying to those who are familiar with it from personal experience,reality
to think that this movie did not win best picture is a crime director steven spielberg uses all of his talent and resources to give to the world the greatest war film ever madethough its true that this is not the type of movie you want to sit down with the family and eat popcorn the emotional drive of the picture the storys poignant messages and the fantastic acting of the cast draws you into a world that is both dangerous and unpredictablespielberg is able to take you into action and make you feel as if you are a participant in the movie and not just a viewer this is tom hanks best movie he ever did forget his performances in philadelphia and forrest gump though they were also good he should have received another oscar for the role of capt john miller a leader who must act strong in front of his men but must also hide his emotions from them  it would have been welldeserved if he won againi give this movie my highest recommendation is a movie that makes you realize how life is precious and how honor and duty though they are deep philosophical concepts that are praised in war can put you in jeopardy of losing your life for something you may not believe in,reality
i have never been affected by a movie the way affected me  that movie really took me out of my seat in the movie theater and practically had me believing i was really in the battle with john miller when somebody was dying in that movie it felt as if you could almost feel their pain  speilberg did an unbelievable job of putting realism into this movie with the camerawork and everything else  simply amazing  an all time great,reality
it gives a million reason why no one should go to war and one very powerful reason to go to war it is a soul numbing realistic depiction of what our grandfathers fathers uncles brothers and sons have faced in humanities darkest moments not just in wwii but in any war no one can see this movies without being altered in some way no one should miss it with the exception of those war veterans that have already been there the surround sound puts the audience in the middle of the battle steven spielberg has out done himself and effectively held up a mirror to civilization for events to which we should all be ashamed of rather than appalled at the movie for its real life depictions i suggest that this movie be made standard view for congress as well as the president each and every time the question of war comes up this movie would not stop future wars but i would hope the objectives would be much more clearly defined i say this as a us marine,reality
its been over a year since first seeing  its a worthy effort by speilberghis best since shindlers list by far youve probably heard about the amount of violence blood and gore and thats all trueits got the viet nam movie style violence and then some but its not gratuitous were it sanitized like early wwii movies modern audiences probably wouldnt take it as seriouslythe movie has that trademark speilberg stylethe structure is all tied up and unified from beginning to end the emotional symbols abound the music swelling when hes working at your emotions the hand held camera that worked so well in shindlers list to give you a feeling of participation camera angles and periods of silence to disorient you like shindler suspense techniques learned from hitch its a movie that stays with you for a period afterwardshanks will be the early front runner for oscar after this flickacademy members like him and it is his best acting job ever while speilberg will likely be criticized for attempting to manipulate the audiences emotions while keeping a distance from the inner core of his characters tom hanks reveals a really complex military leader in this story and does so without overactingsomehow it comes from within while you may not empathize deeply with many of the platoon you will still feel something because of the relationship that is formed with hanksafter the initial setup you will have the opportunity to participate in the dday operation and experience the horror of it those who have been in a real war can comment about how realistic or not speilberg captures its chaotic horror in this scenein my case i again feel very lucky that my draft number was high so i never had to face nam like many of my classmates speilberg reminds us brutally in that we all have a debt to pay to the brave souls who have sacrificed so much for us what tom hanks does with his performance is to remind us of this debt in a very personal way,reality
without looking i am sure other reviewers here have headlined their article best war movie ever made and i agree however before briefly discussing the film let me just say if you dont have a decent 51 surround sound system you arent going to fully appreciate this movie dvdits a great film to start with and sitting in a room surrounded by five speakers with bullets flying from all directions around you  as in that spectacular 22 minute opening scene or in the final 45 minutes of action against the germans in tanks  is an astounding movie experience the sound in this film elevates it even higherthe visuals are outstanding too ive never seen so many grays beiges and olivegreens look this good perfect colors for the bombedout french city where the last hour takes place perfect for the faces and uniforms of the gritty soldiers for the machinery the smokefilled skies etcmy only complaint is the usage of lords name in vain 2530 times but hey when you consider its tough men in tough times thats what you are going to hear in real life the profanity probably was worse than the film its hard to picture the brutality of war being any worse than you see here but it probably was this is about as graphic as it gets the violence and gore was shocking when this film came out in 1997 and still is when watched almost a decade later its unbelievable what some of the wwii soldiers went through but that can be said for any war i believe the purpose of this film was to pay tribute to the sacrifices these men made and it succeeds wonderfully hats off to steven spielberg and to tom hanks the leading actor in here both of whom have worked hard for wwii vets to get the recognition they deserve not just on film but in a national memorialanyway language or blood and guts aside this is still an incredible portrait of wwii the almostthree hour film is riveting starttofinish especially with that memorable beginning action scene probably the most dramatic in the history of filmas entertaining as those action scenes were i found the lulls if you will to be even better listening to hanks and his men discuss various things as they look for private was fascinating to me hanks is just superb in here and once again shows why he is considered one of the best actors in his generationthe most memorable and powerful moment among the lulls is the shot early on of the mother sinking to her knees on her front porch as she realizes she is about to get disastrous news from the war moments later harve presenell playing gen macarthur eloquently reads a letter by abraham lincoln that is so beautifully written so profound that it is quoted near the end of the film too and i never get tired of hearing itthis is a mans movie and shows the horrors of war as few others ever have to say it is memorable just doesnt do it justice it is the greatest war movie ever madeperiod,reality
the opening beach assault sequences were the most violent realistic and upsetting filming ive ever seen looked as though the thing was actual combat footage the shushing noises of rounds cutting through the air was the most chilling part of all perfect portrayal of the insane stupidity of war and the anguish of all who enter this most foolish of enterprises a must see,reality
during the normandy landings during ww2 two brothers are killed  in another part of the world another of the brothers is killed in action leaving their mother with one remaining son and three telegrams due to be delivered a group of men led by captain miller set out to reach private and not only break him the news but to safely return him for return to the uswhat can i say  it is an excellent film despite some minor flaws  the plot is based on a real life situation during ww2 and allows for us to follow a group of men as they take part in the horrors and humanity of war  this is the films strength and it is never stronger than in the first 25 minutes and to a lesser extent the final 20 minutes  the opening of the normandy landing is simply pure emotional power and is really well done  it is so powerful that the actual plot itself is a bit of a letdown  i love band of brothers because the focus was on the war and what it was like to be involved rather than a sort of soap opera story  here the plot is still very good but cant really follow that openingit also sinks into sentiment a tad too often  for examples mother lives in this sort of norman rockwell painting that is spielbergs vision of middle america  also there is a little too much use of gawkish dialogue as well  although its hard to criticise the death scenes for being emotional because they should bea minor flaw that is easy to get over is the lack of brits  like band of brothers which had a few cockney accents this is an american film  so of course they will focus on the american experience  however it would have been nice to have some british or any other voices or faces among the allies  i can understand why the film opens and closes with the stars and stripes and why the film focuses on the yanks but a little bit of perspective would be useful  theres nothing wrong with focus  but when it totally excludes huge bits of information then its a problem  it always makes me think of the way that michael caine took his children back to the uk when they were taught in an us school that ww2 started in the 1940s ie  when america joinedhowever this is a minor flaw as in fairness its an american film  why be surprised when its focus is americans  of the cast hanks is good  he is much more subtle than his oscar roles where he played to the crowd  he benefits from having a great support cast of good actors current actors old faces up and comers etc  sizemore burns and farina are the good current actors  damon ribsi diesel martini etc are all very good on the way up  although damon has one of the simplest characters  they may all be slight stereotypes of americans but its not a major flaw  just a screen writer wanting to cover all bases i think although it does grate that they cover all these backgrounds but cant squeeze any other allies in to the edgesoverall it is excellent despite some stereotyping us flag waving and the usual spielberg love of sentimentality  even if the actual plot is flimsy spielberg expertly puts us as close to experiencing the horrors and the humanity within war as i hope well ever be,reality
steven spielberg makes a unique motion picture in regards to the dday invasion of world war ii just in the gritty reality of the detail for more than twenty minutes he revives for us the landing at omaha beach no one was prepared for how horrific it really was no one understood what was going on the terror the chaos the maelstrom of bullets the neardeafening explosionsyou really got a sense of what these guys had to go through within that perplexity the focus settles on six soldiers under the command of capt miller tom hanks after theyve survived their terrible hours breaking through the first line of german defense theyre given a strange perilous mission to find one man pvt matt damon a paratrooper whos somewhere behind german lines for them its an abstruse order but they have to get it donethroughout the film spielbergs attention to detail is amazing for me the most chilling scene in the movie is the death of an american officer its one of the most intimate its also a slightly confusing moment because two german characters resemble each other so greatlytoward the middle a german soldier called steamboat willie is introduced by the end of the film he has become the bad german later in the movie another german is involved in the final fight he takes part in an exceedingly painful scene of handtohand combat with the american soldier the two german soldiers have similar short haircuts and black uniforms because they looked so much alike many of us have believed that theyre one character theyre not and the distinction of the two is very significant,reality

is a military movie based during world war ii the movie starts with the invasion of normandy at what is now known as d day captain miller who is played by tom hanks leads his troops onto the beaches of normandy against the germans once they are able to take the beach they learn of story of private james james and his other four brothers are scattered throughout europe battling in world war ii the united states headquarters learns that all of jamess brothers have been killed in action leaving james the only sibling to survive the united states military learns that his mother will be receiving all news that all three of his brothers have been killed in action in a plot to give his mother some type of comfort the military sends captain miller and his troops on a hunt to find private and tell him what had happened and to get him back homethe theme of the film is courage throughout the film the soldiers show tremendous courage in their journey from the beginning until the end the soldiers had to go through one of the most horrific and bloody battles from world war ii and had to show tremendous courage to make it and take the beach after they took the beach they had to go on a journey in order to find private they had to search throughout europe to find while going through several battles and their own battles with each other they lost many men including corporal caparzo all of those men lost just so that they could get private and send him home to his motherlighting and sound effects were two major techniques used in the movie to enhance and capture the attention of the viewer and to create a very lifelike impersonation of what those scenes were like in real life when caparzo was shot by a sniper the scene was very dark it was raining and there was little visibility for the soldiers due to fog the surround sound of the rain made it very intense and made it feel as if you were right there the sound of explosions going off at every corner captures the moments of war that make it horrible to be in it makes you after these scenes make you think to yourself what it would really be like in a war like that and if thats how it really wasis one of the best military movies of all time the courage that these men faced with themselves and to find someone that none of them knew was extremely heroic they made it possible to help with a grieving mother who had lost not one but three sons in the heat of battle in world war ii this movie is a must see so that we can try and understand what these young men and women had to go through and sacrifice in order for us to live in freedom,reality
this film is an absolute masterpiece it shows that war isnt always glamorous steven spielberg won a best directing oscar for his work on this film and the film went on to win four others it is gritty and bloody and it shows that wars arent won by weapons but by soldiers the cast shine as the group of soldiers tasked with finding private along the way they encounter the harsh truth and real meaning of war it boasts impressive battle sequences and the stylish cinematography makes the film truly beautiful the opening beach sequence is possibly the greatest opening scenes in movies tom hanks is spell binding as the commander who has no idea about the harsh truth of war overall a truly amazing film,reality
visually the best ww2 movie in other ways far from the best the movie is loaded with errors and falls into demonizing the german soldier and praising the american a few examples far from the reality the combat scenes show the germans acting like cattle without any strategy at all they just run and shout one funny part is the behavior of the german tankers they drive in a ruined village in a very narrow street like they have never heard of ambush one starts to think if the script writer has ever heard ofthe capabilities of the german panzer crews sscaptain michael wittmann attacked and destroyed 48 armored fighting vehicles alone in a single action the most absurd part is the macgyverrambo scenewhen capt miller and friends start to throw the mortar grenades slaughtering a few dozen germans the most unforgivable error is that there were no ssunits with tiger tanks operational in normandy at this point of time this movie is way overestimated,reality
in a historic and artistic context heres a question that would bother spielberg if he thought about it for a second what if there was no such thing as special effects if we take the special effects from his movies would they still be great what youre waiting for an answer just like every spielberg movie we find steve desperately clinging to special effects like a fish to water like bush to oil like uwe boll to a video gametomovie conversion last one is not necessarily bad by the wayjust like everybody else i was amazed by the realism of the first 5 minutes once you get past the battle scenes theres not much to work with im glad people as manifest in the growing number of low reviews here are starting to realize thislets set aside the absurdity of the plot i use plot very loosely thats just a vehicle a pretext an excuse to use special effects spielbergs one and only leverage the main plot is that a mother lost a number of her sons so the general or whatever his rank was thinks she shouldnt lose her last remaining son he reads a letter abraham lincoln sent to a mother who went through a similar experience during the civil war using musical cues and closeups spielberg is not trying to tell us how to feel hes practically begging us to do so after all he knows better than anybody that people will  during the course of the movie  realize that the battle scenes arent that numerous or long so there better be some story to back the movie upsince he knows that hes addressing a crowd that made movies like armageddon and independence day box office hits he correctly realized that the script needs to be comprised of one element only text so long as the script contained text it was good enough and he was right with enough flash and special effects he was able to appeal to the idiocy of the average american a tactic mastered by jerry bruckheimer michael bay and their likesnow back to the plot once you set it aside youll realize that this movie is trying to instill many ideas into the minds of the movie goers when he shows german soldiers he shows them from a distance so by not giving them a face a human side he teaches us that its totally ok to thrill at killing them bad german bad after our heroes free a german spielberg makes is very clear that he came back later to kill tom hanks spielberg is saying they shouldve killed him the first time the only good german is a dead one apparently astonishing dishonesty and malice on the part of spielberg not a trick was a spared to demonize every single one of themunlike masters of movie making a title spielberg will never come close to like scorsese and coppola he desperately needs musical cues to tell when to feel sad fearful excited etc his approach to emotion is so utterly sappy shallow and downright laughable that its virtually impossible for him to let the scenes and the story speak for themselves he must have very clear cues to give the viewers signals the music is like a slap in the face spielberg manifests in moments like tell me i lived a good life grabs you by the throat and orders you to shed a few tears insulting patheticthe only good part in the movie is the whole scene of the mistaken identity where they realize this whining little weakling crying his eyes out is not the they wanted other than that and looking at the chutzpah of the musical cues the absurdity of the plot the dehumanization of the germans and the hilarious warfare errors the movie is only good for another laugh albeit not one spielberg was aiming for,reality
war films can be broken into two basic categories the propaganda film which celebrates bravery and patriotism and the antiwar film which shows the suffering and futility of war the most extreme propaganda films are usually produced when a war is threatened or actually in progress and either demonize or belittle the individual enemy soldier this is useful for both inspiring the home front and for assuring it that there will be an ultimate victory while these films play well with a wartime audience they appear somewhat silly when viewed in a postwar environment an exception to this warinprogress concept was is cloaked in an antiwar facade this film was more typical of what would have been produced in 1944 its setting than 1998 its year of release under its thin antiwar facade of realistic looking destruction private breaks with the characterization elements that are essential for classification as an antiwar work almost by definition antiwar films use a faceless enemy paths of glory or portray the enemy soldier as sharing in the suffering and futility of war the enemy below often they are portrayed as victims of a fanatical leadership and the audience is invited to identify with or at least understand them the longest day this is because after a war both the victors and the vanquished have an incentive to portray their enemy as brave and determined otherwise victory is hollow and defeat is humiliating not so in private if the german battle performance and basic infantry tactics shown in the film were representative of what was actually practiced a single allied division could have occupied all of germany by the end of june 1944 the final battle scene alone makes the viewer wonder how facing such a totally inept enemy the war could have gone on more than a few days after the dday landings among the most obviousa sequence where american soldiers run back and forth in front of a tiger i tank without drawing the fire of the tanks machine guns these tanks had internally operated machine guns which would have easily cut down these soldiers knowing this the soldiers would not have exposed themselves to this fire tanks entering an urban area ahead of infantry driving down the middle of the town as if on parade instead infantry would flank any defensive position on the street and secure the area immediately ahead of the tanks so they do not come into range of antitank weapons these tactics were validated during early fighting on the russian front and became operational imperatives for all panzer units a hitler youth dagger found in the trench right after the first bunker is taken on the beach the men in these bunkers were mostly older secondtier draftees and ukrainian conscripts normandy was not expected to be the invasion target and its highly unlikely that a member or former member of the hitler youth would have been assigned to these marginal units but it was an excellent way to make the audience less squeamish about the brutality inflicted by the allied soldiers when these german units attempted to surrenderso just what is the first 24 minutes are a high budget remake of the longest day whose less expensive landing sequence conveyed more tactical believability about the process of securing a beachhead the next 90 minutes are a mistakeridden choppy and contrived remake of the big red one ultimately this overlong odyssey said less about patrolling behind enemy lines than kellys heroes a counterculture comedy whose serious scenes and character development were superior in almost every way then there is the finale a total ripoff of arthur pohls the bridge 1949 which focused on a handful of recently conscripted german schoolboys who fight for control of an inconsequential bridge during the last weeks of the war they were at the bridge because of a series of accidents and they naively stayed there because of their youthful idealism and sense of duty like private most do not survive the engagement what is notable is not that pohl was able to make a much better film for a fraction of the cost that is not particularly unusual but that he was able to convey more perspective four years after the event than spielberg could manage 50 years laterbut these criticisms of private are based on the assumption that spielbergs intent was to make a worthwhile war film and there is simply nothing to support this assumption more likely spielbergs agenda was make money while subtly refuting postwar portrayals such as das boot and cross of iron of the german soldier as something more than the sub human creature of wwii propaganda days or the cartoon villains of his own raiders of the lost ark series the genius of private is its success in packaging this sick message inside a commercially successful film at the time of its release and its almost universal acclaim this aspect of the film was largely unrecognized and unexamined by both audiences and critics in this respect it owes less to the war films it shamelessly plagiarizes than to early 1950s cinema where mccarthyparalyzed hollywood directors resorted to subtle themes that went undetected by studio executives and regulators only recently has its status begun to erode as individual critics more carefully examine its elements away from the euphoria that surrounded its initial releasealthough was popular remember that the rat patrol ran for 58 episodes watched by television audiences who were also entertained by similar silly nonsensethen again what do i know im only a child,reality
spielbergs continued descent into narrow arrogant lowbrow revisionism is at best a languid patriotic trumpcalling movie with nothing better to do than applaud the glorious morally superior american armed forces who were in actuality nothing but teenage thugs who beat german prisoners and raped french women and looted european cities he starts off with kleenex totting bravery and then leads us into brutal images that have no other point than to entertain the violent video game minded geeks of american malls he then regresses into heavy handed sentimentality that leads the viewer to conclude that americans were all good guys this is not the case history has shown us so americans for all their good intentions in world war 2 were just as loathsome as the nazis they had a deep segregationist attitude in the states which killed people because of skin color arrested and imprisoned innocent hard working japanese people and locked them in concentration camps kept black soldiers in separate units which often were the lowliest positions fire bombed nontactical european cities most notably dresden hired former nazis to combat the communist threat and finally dropped two atomic bombs upon an innocent japanese civilian population and after the war things got even worse the red hunt which resembled the trials in nazi germany in the 1930s occurred under a madman named mccarthy so if you want to be blindly led by spielbergs glorious war message that is simply propaganda then by all means do and watch this film which has no redeeming qualitiesit is truly amazing that people unaccustomed to great films should reveal this one to be the best wars film ever as if no capable director had ever attempted to bring the horror and stupidity of war to the screen perhaps instead of giving spielberg the automatic credit of creating the war genre they should go out and rent come and see russian the burmese harp 1967 fires on the plain 1959 or paths of glory 1957 truly far superior films to this hollywoodbastardization and candy treatment of war there is absolutely no plot in this uneven film and the whole landing at dday according to spielberg was in some way just a side show to with such a simplistic statement it is easy to see why most reviewers revel in the sense that action action action is equated with greatness i only guess that because they must be entertained that directors continue to keep punching out such opportunistic filth while most viewers who are safely tucked away in their houses waving american flags and discharging a few tears saying you german scum you german scum can truly appreciate blood and guts as cinema then there is a market for it after you get through the puerile premise then you can sit back have a few beers and watch heads explode in the carnage that has no intellectual meaning and is the most clichdriven rubbish that has ever been produced the scenes themselves are overdrawn stolen from previous war films from the 1950s namely the longest day 1962 which was a great film in itself the beach landing is too long and it shows only the americans as heroic while the germans are seen as evil hun scum tom hanks in his most idiotic and candid self seems out of place as a leader of a bunch of rejects that are entrusted to save private and in one completely absurd scene the remaining 15 americans defeat a battle hardened superiorly trained ss special unit group with just a few guns now if you know anything about history then you would know that the ss were not an easy group to defeat they were some of the most fanatical and welltrained soldiers of the german reich but since spielberg thinks we all are just a bunch of idiots hell continue to manufacture such inconsistent story lines this is only a tear jerker movie and it does nothing else i would suggest watching hell is for heroes 1962 with steve mcqueen because it is a lot better and we dont have to be forced to carry an american flag at the end,reality
especially that joe guy below there is a big difference between an ordinary german soldier and a nazi ordinary soldiers fought for their country just like the americans they thought it and their lives were in danger just like the americans many americans found out their enemy was just like themnow people the belonged to the nazi party and their own personal military the ss were the ones who killed the countless number of jewsanyway this movie was much overrated it really does demonize the germans i mean my father was one of those men and they suffered as well all he wanted was for hitler to die and for the war to end,reality
112017 update edited for corrections written as isof course the first combat sequence was great but unfortunately i was considered a sociopath for snickering at a man wandering around to pick up his dismembered arm while the camera is still shaking on the ground  it became obvious that spielberg tries too hard to elicit the emotions from a cynical person like me i eventually became sick and nauseated at having been forced to watch the ultimately annoying and repetitive guerrilla cinematography while the violence and mayhem prevails is it supposed to depict the reality of war maybe yes but all it does is always impact impact impact and i felt little or no emotion after the first sequence spr stooped for the lowest level  and i tried to keep awake during some tedious parts but i ended up snickering and laughing at a few utterly lame and manipulative scenes remember edward burns arrogantly stoic character and tom hanks capt millers speech one of the biggest problems with the film is that the audience at first showed disdain for the translator because hes a coward why the critics say this in their reviews is beyond me and then cheered when he shot one of the german soldiers to death just to show his courage  i found this disturbing after the final battle the music began to cue and there comes the greatest manipulative climax ive ever seen  from the slowly progressing and clichd morph scene to the banality of a final nationalistic scene with the us flag waving for another 25 seconds after i left the theater quietly i let out intense ribaching laughter all the way driving home this is what mr goldman observes as phony and manipulative to serve our country im sorry if i sound crude but i debunk spr for being blatantly manipulative and hypersentimental on par with patch adams another worse movie that yearthis is my honest opinion  to observe dissect and criticize  and i dont trust the critics anymore because they went overboard just for the realistic depiction of war violence calling the movie the greatest war movie ever made in truth older war movies are much better in terms of writing and acting paths of glory and the longest day  despite the fact that theyre tame for not being profane and goryand most importantly spr shouldnt be shown in english classes in high schools just as another critically overrated the clockwork orange shouldnt it only serves to desensitize the kids because of the war is bad propaganda coupled with the ussaluting totalitarianism the epitome of a doublewham hypocrisy just like the propagandizing nazi films,reality
if spielberg had resisted the urge to tack a big set piece on to the last 30 minutesimagine watching the same movie except this time it ends at the point that they catch up with privateup to that point spielberg had shown such restraint and subtlety it was disappointing to see it had been thrown away for a silly crowd pleaser the first 30 minutes of clearly demonstrates the sheer horror of war as well as the lives that are wasted in a way that no previous movie had even attemptedthe last 30 minutes on the other hand seem to follow the usual approach glamorising the whole experience with all the usual heroics and bittersweet sentimentality that we have seen in a thousand war movies beforestill having said that this is still an excellent movie and is well worth watching,reality
great film is an illuminating thing it shines its light into the dark recesses of humanity revealing the greed hatred and hypocrisy that fester there bad film is often just as revealing its existence and reception serve as a mirror reflecting the hearts of its intended audience is a classic example of the latter in the flickering light of its propagandistic glow the american people stand revealed for what they really are stupid selfabsorbed morally unsophisticated rubes ready to be fleeced by the first charlatan who comes along and tells them what they want to hearis typical steven spielberg fare a big budget spectacle bereft of style filled to the brim with childishly heavyhanded moralizing and peopled with facile characters who exist only as cardboard cutouts for the ensuing morality play even the films underlying subtext is an old spielberg standby  america goooood nazis baaaad the plot of revolves around a simple moral question is saving one life worth potentially sacrificing the lives of many this fourth grade ethical dilemma is played out for nearly three hours over the background of the brocage of normandy in the hours and days immediately after the dday landings and is handled with spielbergs usual wandering attention hamfisted lack of subtlety and babbling pop psychology spielberg being spielberg theres never any doubt how the question will ultimately be answered hint with saccharine sentimentality in front of a tombstone  because obviously the same scene wasnt manipulative enough when it was used to close schindlers list the film opens with thirty minutes of unremitting carnage as us soldiers assault omaha beach this opening scene has been hailed for its savage realism but it is in truth one of the more cynically manipulative sequences in recent memory full of irritating disorienting jump cuts pornographically gibsonesque attention to gory detail camera tricks and special effects artifices all accompanied by a deafening soundtrack designed to overwhelm our capacity to think about what is being portrayed on the screen and to push us to simply immerse ourselves in its reductive us vs them pov when i saw this film in the theaters the audience cheered when the first german soldier was killed then cheered again when american troops murdered surrendering germans in cold blood this im sure was spielbergs intenthaving bulldozed and buried any hint of the moral ambiguity of war spielberg gets around to the heart of the movie it has been discovered by the war department that one private matt damon is now the sole surviving son of a family who has sent five sons to war unfortunately was a part of the paratrooper drop that preceded the normandy landings and is missing behind enemy lines in a moment of supreme hokum complete with a quotation of a letter by abraham lincoln that wouldnt feel out of place in a ken burns documentary army chief of staff gen george marshall harve presnell decides that an effort will just have to be made to save privateat this point becomes just another motleycrewofexperts flick a team of caricatures is assembled the toughasnails seargent the feisty italian the pious southern sniper with talent on loan from god if the historical setting had been vietnam im sure this character would have been replaced by cuba gooding jr as the magic negro the remf pussy  all led by tom hanks in the role of tom hanks captain everyman call them the sanitized seven battles ensue some of the caricatures die does anyone really remember which ones the germans never miss an opportunity to remind us how evil they are one wehrmacht man  having been saved from certain death at the hands our intrepid heroes by the earnest pleas of the remf  returns only to slowly and sadistically stab an american to death oh those tricksy krauts in the end is saved and tom hanks is dying but it was all worth it cue the graveside maundering usa usa usathe problem with is the problem with everything spielberg touches more broadly it is the problem of the american commercial cinema lacking the courage of any real conviction it cannot offer any challenge to its audience instead it panders to that audience with easy answers impressive effects a soundtrack that booms and tinkles in all the right places and a nice moms apple pie pat on the back for every red blooded american whats missing is even the faintest glimmer of awareness that the world doesnt break down neatly into heroes and villains cowards and the courageous us and them in the place of subtlety it gives us spectacle in the place of art it delivers technically proficient propaganda,reality
every once in a while i go back to watch films that were celebrated in their time these have to be films i saw when they were newly nested in their warm buzz and which were conveyed as if they were a privilege this is such a film one that can perhaps serve even as the exemplar it was touted as at last a serious film by spielberg chapter two of his real film which marketed the holocaust it had hanks who it should be recalled was more uniquely respected then than now it dealt with a sort of real history with direct pulls on patriotism and something called valor in a way that would make sinatra and wayne blush or at least hiccup and its first 20 minutes was chocked full of effects that worked and conveyed a meaning of confused dread it moved us all  how could it not  and allowed the filmmaker to lazily move through an ordinary story staged as if it had a different production crewseeing this again in my own context and with the objectiveness of distance i am amazed at how effective that opening section is and how typically bad steven the rest is that first part is tense tight and close it is horrible without forcing us so close that we recoil you know one of the biggest challenges in filmmaking is to introduce the audience to the world they will live in for perhaps a few hours  the film and the long tail of recalled experience afterward usually the filmmaker has only a few minutes some  especially when a strict genre film is coming  can even do it during the title sequence we are prepared for this entry voyage it is part of the contract we make when allowing a filmmaker to transport us i cannot recall a film that took this much time to prepare us perhaps pans labyrinth but that setup was disjointed so i have to admire spielbergs craft in putting together a session that has impact though it is all tone and no narrative and i have to admire his ability to understand and exploit that twilight area where we are primed for such a thing and then 20 minutes in we start to ask why why engage us why open us to be ready for something that matters and serve us breadteds evaluation  2 of 3 has some interesting elements,reality
before i saw the film i have read the comments many of you liked spielbergs new movie but some of you mostly from the us write things like proud to be an american or part of american history or every american should see this moviefirst of all i want to say that this war must have been pure terror national socialism was an indescribably evil disgrace to humanity many of you have grandparents who fought proudly against the germans in world war ii but i as a 25year old german and others have grandparents who were bombed out of their homes at night and could not get a whole nights sleep ever since my parents were born during the war their first babyimpressions were gunshots and explosions  for years nowadays in germany it still is common to find old still explodable bombs when building a new housesecond this is not american history it is not german history it is world history  our history it is the blackest spot ever to be found in the history of the human racethird i dont mean to be rude but i think that many people have lost the connection to reality in the first place making a war movie has two major aspects making money bad and reviving history for educational purposes respectable but then feeling history is completely different in my very neighbourhood there was a concentration camp only some 53 years ago i have been to that beach in france and let me tell you just seeing the sea the sand the dunes really scared me rigid talking with my grandma she led a baby nursing home in that time thats history just sitting in a movie theatre listening to sdds and watching tom hanks cry is a different experiencewhat i want to state here is that there is quite a difference between a movie may it be as realistic as possible and real history this really happened millions of people were slaughtered in the most cruel ways by other people when i go to my university building i see the holes in the wall which have been there since the war they have never been repaired in order to give people something to think about from exactly that building sophie scholl and her friends threw anitnazi papers into the crowd and got executed only a short time lateri think the film is quite accurate actually it is not the most impressive war film i have ever seen thats  the bridge from 1959 but it shows how the war was like in all aspects anyway how can war films be good or best is an exceptional educational masterpiece it should be recommended together with schindlers list but it is only a movie it cannot replace realityso i recommend this watch the movie everyone but also think about the real people of any nation that were cruelly murdered in those years and think about those who lived through it even think of those who were with the regime and still walk the earth then book a ticket for europe see the normandie for yourself see berlin see dresden see munich see the wounds of history and see that being german is not the same as being a nazi after you get home to wherever you come from i promise you then will have a different view of reality,reality
i was hoping for an accurate war film for a change take a look at the battle of the bulge for a really bad example what spielberg shows us in his omaha beach scenes makes me wonderwhich omaha beach assault he is trying to portray those who know little about the battle thats almost everyone whos in the theater probably now have the idea that every other soldier who landed on the beach before noon was either blown to smithereens or badly woundedbelieve me the 1st and 29th divisions would have been annihilated if itwere as bad as its portrayed and would never have been able to scale the cliffs and rout the enemy by early afternoon which they did i wonder for example how wide most viewers think omaha beach actually was in the film it looks about a couple hundred yards it was in actuality almost ten miles wide the timing was also inaccurate  hanks goes up the cliffs at what appears to be 8am nobody made it before 11am another historical error is the implication that the events at omaha were similar to those on the other four assualt beaches juno sword gold and utah thats totally incorrect utah beach for example the other us assault beach took about a dozen casualties  many of those due to accidents during the landing rather than from enemy action but the worst part of the movie was the completely idiotic script here we have the us army sending a squada squad to march straight thru the entire german 7th army something two divisions with total air superiority couldnt do for weeks waltz around an area of 300 square miles and expect to find a guy named if they wanted to do any of this nonsense the army would have sent them in on the gliders that flew into the area the very next morning gliders what gliders  said spielberg thats what happens when you have a scriptwriter who doesnt know very much about his subject  a stupid stupid film what a waste of 100m or so,reality
this movie serves two purposes a glorify the american soldier from world war ii and the american nation in general and b help mr spielberg overcome his own neurosis about being jewish a task he started with schindlers list that probably makes him the envy of anyone who ever saw a psychologist to get paid for spreading out your psyche instead of having to pay for itthe first 20 minutes of this movie are amazing indeed very well captured is the sheer horror of landing on a fortified beach the disorientation the killing etc but after that this movie drops on the level of armageddon a mother has a number of sons all of them died during the war except one and the us military surely puts the life of half a dozen soldiers into peril to save that last one of course that is completely logicalthe german soldiers in the contrary dont seem to have mothers or anyone who cares about them they are ugly leanmeankilling machines shouting incomprehensible things and should be killed wherever possible they are also not just as scared as any other simple soldier on a battle field they dont have any feelings at all so what could have been a great movie with all the money spent for and stars on it playing in the same league as all quiet on the western front gets to be completely pathetic unrealistic superpatriotic and onesided steven spielberg once said that he often didnt feel he was a real american and was leftout because of him being jewish and that the past of his family haunts him it is ok to feel that way and i wish him he will finally get rid of both feelings but on the other hand he also was left out of getting an oscar until schindlers list that was a well done movie but on the long run it seems it didnt do spielberg too good somewhere he must have come to the conclusion that doing movies about wwii helps him overcome his problems and making them patriotic will help him getting an oscarif you are interested in a realistic look on war watch all quiet on the western front or das boot,reality
the problem with saving pvt is that is is basically afraudulent portrayal of the omaha beach landings every single detail may for all i know be authentic for the group portrayed which i assume was goransons company c 2nd rangers but that company with one notable exception experienced the worst that omaha beachdealt to the assault troops during the hours 06300800 thus you get an extremely biased view of the typical experience of those landing at omaha for example the entire 5th ranger battalion col schneider 6 companies landed at 0740 with a cost of only 4 wounded  it all depended on where your landing craft touched down or allowed it to touch down  col schneider was supposed to land right where hanks was  dog green but had the sense to order the craft eastward and capt hanks landedat the very worst spot on the entire 4 mile long landing area and troops walked up the slopes they didnt crawl up inch by inch etc nor where they under murderous fire ascending the slopes  very few casualties were taken during those actions total casualty rate for the first 14000 or so troops that landed in the first assault waves 06300800was not much over 10 far different from what you see portrayed in if you want to learn the history of omaha beach read the us army after action reports or go the us army historical site dont bother with this movie or ambroses nonsensical book or the longest day they are for made for entertainment purposes and only mention the disastersetc beside ambose has been known as a plagiarist and creater of nonexistent eyewitnesses its worth noting that he was hired by spielberg to authenticate the scenes hes a very poor historian and not very knowledgeable about wwii i found tons of errors in his books about d day and citizen soldiers anyone who sees pvt  comes away with zero knowledge of operation neptune at omaha beach after the beach scenesthe rest of the story can be summed up in a single phrase  call the 101st on the radio and tell them to pull from the line thats all that the army would have had to do to savesending a squad thru enemy lines to search a 100 square mile area for a guy named while fighting is occurring every 100 yards is about the most preposterous idea for a story i ever heard of but then thats spielberg anything to get the customer excited no matter how realistic the scenes may be i wonder about why those rangers are moving against a prepared position all bunched together  they would never have done that  the total picture provided the viewer is totally unrealistic one comes away from the movies knowing practically zilch about omaha beach thats a damn shame it was an interesting story although nowhere near as gory as spielbergs fantasy portrait as is obvious from the casualties taken approximately 2000 for the 24 hours of d day by forces o and b 60000 troops,reality
so many people loved this film that i actually rented the dvd to rewatch it i had originally seen it in a movie theater during its initial release and i hated it the second time was certainly not a charm possessing the knowledge of what was to come made for an even more boring movie experience this films much talked about opening lends nothing to the paltry narrative that is the rest of the film the movie meanders about aimlessly for what seems an eternity and almost nothing happens when something does happen it isnt anything that you havent seen done by the same old characters that youve seen before in countless other and better wwii films even the dialog is old hollywood corny then after being about virtually nothing for hours it ends with a hokey gimmick of the realization of who the old vet is meant to tug at our heartstrings nothing wrong with that but only elicited a groan and a roll of the eyes from me tedious with virtually no character development not recommended,reality
i will just start off with saying that this is an excellent movie tom hanks character is superb as he again proves that he is one of the best actors still going todaythe direction is magnificent bravo steven spielberg who shows that war is absolutely not glamorous spielberg can enthrall audiences like no otherthe battle on omaha beach was powerful extraordinary stuffwe start this movie with the attack on omaha beach dday 1944captain johnhmillertom hanksleads his regiment up on to the sands meanwhile being bombarded by nazi gunmenwhen omaha beach is seized by the american and british forces john is asked to embark on a mission to save a soldier whos three brothers had just died and who now has a ticket home to his grieving motherjohn agrees and begins the task of all the while his regiment wonder why they must risk their lives to save one manthis is a great movie but very intense and powerfulthe battle scenes are superba definite must see for any lover of great moviesgo watch this movie one of the best in its genre 1010  unmissable,reality
i was looking forward to seeing  i had heard many reviews that called it one of the greatest war movies ever made  i was not expecting to see something as poorly put together as this movie was  from the begining i found myself wanting to scream at the screen  i must admit the acting was good but they had little to work withjust about every other aspect of the film fails  it manages to portray dday as the smallest battle ive ever seen  basically the goal was two machine gun posts  sorry but that battle was not realistic at all and was intentionally bloodwashed worst than the friday the 13th movies  the film is loaded with mistakes including the rediculous helmet rank insignia they knew better because they told someone not to salute hanks because it might give away his rank  then they put bars on his helmet  structurally the movie was a disaster  it was supposed to be about the irony of many men dying for one man  in the end though it turns into the defense of a bridge and the main plot is almost totally forgotten  the soldiers are stupid they have to defend or destroy a bridge but dont leave the detonator wired up and someone who should have been to blow it as a last resort every war cliche in the book gets dropped into this film  save my child the wounded soldier just out of reach the sharpshooter who never misses im not leaving my buddies etc  they are all there  did they have to end the the waiving of the flagthe movie does not feel like wwii but rather feels like vietnam  lots of mud and rain what are we doing here a bungling military command  one of the most successful engagements in military history is portrayed as a confused poorly planned messthe movie is absolutely loaded with red herrings  hanks hand problem has no bearing on the plot and is not present when it might cause a problem they fight a machinegun nest for no real reason other than it provided a fight scene  was i the only one to notice that all of the towns were destroyed before we even got to them  didnt france surrender  the climactic battle is sure to be lost but is won when air support arrives of course they did not call for the air support  can you say deus ex machina  did we have precision guided tank bombs in wwii  did our protagonists really have anything to do with the outcomei was shocked that this movie was not ripped apart in reviews  it has everything possible wrong with it  is it now unpatriotic to indicate divel when you see it wrapped with an american flag,reality
the more i think about this film and read differing reviews about it the more i feel it wasnt meant for me im a finn not american i dont know if spielberg meant this film as a last hoorah for the gis but to me that is what he made all right the film does have something to tell for everyone in the insane theatre of war one should try to do the right thing have courage to do it that your actions have consequences war as a whole creates nothing but bad feelings and probably something else too but nothing that has not been told earlierand i suppose that isnt so bad i mean there have certainly been worse films but what does bother me is that spielberg set out to do a film about what war is really like and to me he failed yes i have seen the opening scene and to me it was more about exploitation and action film then about anything else and not even very memorable action even if one would skip all the omissions and strange things about the film in the landing scene no naval artillery support no air force support and the illogical german tactics in the final battlescenes to me the main plot is a strange curiosity that only serves to illustrate that the average soldier wasnt that interesting or important apparently with some links to reality the main plot remains distant and odd to mewith oscar blockbuster critically acclaimed material as ww2 with all the gore how could spielberg go wrong first of all the acting well i could not stop wishing there would have been some lesser known actors used maybe even amateurs a lot has been made out of the cinematography and yes it is good although to me it is not so effective when there is apparently too much money to make a film and then the camera work tries to make it look more realistic as ww2 films go this film is a far cry from come and see yes i do admit that flag waving is a common problem among ww2 movies i just wished that spielberg could have avoided it,reality
war movies have often been one of steven spielberg specialities this one achieved a huge public and critic success what drew the attention in this war movie are fight sequences theyre extremely violent and bloody we have been rarely so far in the reality of fights its difficult to forget the first half an hour of the movie during the normandy landings spielbergs sober and showy directing increases the phenomenonhowever you must admit it the movie is based on a trite plain even conventional story you could use this last word to describe the famous soldier indeed hes told that he can go home because all his brothers have been killed instead he wants to keep on fightingapart from this and in spite of a few weaknesses is a thrilling war movie,reality
    i thought that this movie was going to be a masterpiece topping those great antiwar films of apocalypse now the boat and all quiet on the western frontbut alas  what am i to expect from america  the truth neveryet another great expensive war film where the germans fight like italians  totally arrogant to anyone else  i mean honestly an american flag at the start and at the end  showing the american and french flags  the english and canadians did land on normandy too  the only reference to anyone else is an insulting comment about montythe germans may have suffered a bit more on the eastern front than the americans in france but that doesnt matter because they were on the wicked sidethis is the kind of film simply made to win another oscar for speilbergs already crowded shelf  not a ground breacker not a truthful film not even historically correct1  radar was a total secret  no american privates or captains would have any idea of what radar was2  germans especially those of the ss would never be stupid enough to attack a ruined village with tanks first it was common military knowledge for both sides3 the p51 d mustang which blows up the tiger tanks on the bridge  were never tank destroyers they were only used as long range bomber escorts during the invasion  the only tank destroyers being employed at that time were british  not american so of course the americans would take out this imperfect featurefrankly if youre american you can go get your gun an feel patriotic once again as you have done with the dirty dozen where eagles dare if youre not american avoid this and stick to the boat for your wwii viewing,reality
i remember when the hype when spr was first released  gawd its so realistic  it shows the true face of war  its like being there man i also remember that these claims were made by civilians with no experience of the military or combat  maybe the next time a film audience wants to experience the horrors of war the cinema might like to stick a sniper behind the screen to pick off sundry filmgoers that would be realistic  to this day i havent heard a single dday survivor comment on the realism of this filmyes i agree that the opening 20 minutes of spr are outstanding as is the final battle at the end but the outstanding visuals fail to disguise the very average script that is no different from a john wayne or errol flynn star vehicle theres very little depth to the story which seems at odds with the anti war visualsi will defend the film slightly from the allegation of pro american bias its an american film  made by americans  with american money for a primarily american public for a more subjective view on the normandy landings see the longest day  or better still read the book but the comment on monty was uncalled for  bernard law montgomery spent 4 years on the western front  191418  he was disgusted by the slaughter he saw there and made needless casualties his main concern i bet the red army wished for a general like that on the eastern front oh and monty won the battle of el alamein  thought id just mention itso just to sum up spr has some graphic battle scenes overcoming a flawed script its a good film but nowhere near being a masterpiece maybe if itd been set during the korean war and been a lot more cynical itd might have been a true classic but as it is its a case of a b movie script saved by a brilliant director,reality
steven spielberg jaws raiders of the lost ark et the extraterrestrial jurassic park deservedly won the oscar for directing schindlers list and he did it again with another world war ii film this time in the battle itself he was also won the golden globe and was nominated the bafta basically the film starts with the fantastic opening on ohama beach with captain john h miller oscar bafta nominated and medal for distinguished public service award highest us navy civilian honour winning tom hanks and his troops struggling for survival against the nazi germans after surviving this they are given a special mission that they dont understand the significance of to find one man and bring him home they are now on the search for private james francis matt damon and when they eventually find him he doesnt know why he is needed to get home this film may have its annoying chats and breakaways from battle probably why its four out of five stars but this still sticks closer to the truth than fiction also starring tom sizemore as sergeant mike horvath edward burns as pvt richard reiben barry pepper as pvt daniel jackson adam goldberg as pvt stanley mellish vin diesel as private adrian caparzo giovanni ribisi as t4 medic irwin wade jeremy davies as cpl timothy p upham ted danson as captain fred hamill and paul giamatti as sergeant hill it won the oscars for best cinematography best sound effects editing best film editing and best sound and it was nominated for best art directionset decoration best makeup best music for john williams best writing screenplay written directly for the screen and best picture it won the baftas for best sound and best special effects and it was nominated for the anthony asquith award for film music best cinematography best editing best make uphair best production design the david lean award for direction and best film and it won the golden globe for best motion picture  drama and it was nominated for best original score and best screenplay steven spielberg was number 56 on the 100 greatest pop culture icons tom hanks was number 3 on the 100 greatest movie stars and he was number 39 on the worlds greatest actor the film was number 45 on 100 years 100 thrills it was number 10 on 100 years 100 cheers and it was number 1 on the 100 greatest war films very good,reality
when i saw this movie in 1998 in england it was a big disappointment for me in many ways as not mentioned here for the first time the first 20 min of the film are technically impressive what follows then is just stupid onesided and is  at least from the viewpoint of a german  invidious i cannot understand that a man with over 50 years of life experience steven spielberg can make such a stupid film about second world war in 1998 or my explanation is that this man has no character the second disappointment perhaps the bigger one were the reports that in the united states this movie was received with overwhelming applause and ecstatic feelings of patriotism this is only a film but it also tells you something about what people really think before that i had thought the americans were at least since 50 years our friends after this film and especially the reception of the film by the broader audience in the usa as i had read about it in newspapers and magazines i thought they may be our collaborators in many ways but they are not our friends,reality
very good film  the landing sequence at the start was phenomenal the acting was of a uniformly high standard a couple of things spoiled the film a bit for methe germans are treated as nazis even when most wermacht soldiers were just serving their country like everybody else also they seemed to be targets that got mown down in droves and were generally portrayed as less than human i thought that went out in cinema a few years after the war endedfinally the only mention of the other allies is one disparaging comment about montgomerys failure in front of caen firstly he was facing most of the german armour that was dug into strongpoints and secondly on dday and for a period after the british and canadian troops out numbered the americans i wouldnt normally bother but americans seem to view these films as historically accurate representationswith the release of u571 this trend is getting even worse the capture of the enigma machine was carried out by a british destroyer crew  before america even entered the warthe new colditz movie is following this path there were very few american pows held there and none of those escaped by the wars end,reality
this is one of the single worst films i have ever seen  spielberg was once again intoxicated by his own sense of patriotic splendour the first major flaw in this film struck me the first time i saw it  i was in the theater and began to ask myself how could remember the dday invasion when in fact he was never therenow honestly how did spielberg expect to get away with that one it was never explained or followed up in any way secondly how did he expect to get away with portraying the germans as mindless bloodthirsty grunts  well they were werent they says the blindly patriotic american  this aspect of the film is a disgrace to germans and more importantly to the brainwashed americans finally i would just like to point out the fact that this was not a war to rescue individual men in order to preserve their family line this film makes a mockery of wwii by completely misrepresenting it  the only aspect that was accurately portrayed was the violence which sadly enough drew many people to the film two thumbs down,reality
its the world war ii era  and nobody smokestheres only one person in this movie who opposes war  his cowardice winds up costing livesfor a moment it seems theres one nice person in the nation of germany the merciful american soldiers let him go  this turns out to be a huge mistake as he returns days later with a group of his friends to kill them all  lesson learned  there is not even one reasonably nice germanthe movie ends with a salute to the american flag and blasting inspiring musicwas this movie made for twoyearoldswhen it comes to subject matter as complex as war i think simpleminded movies like this do more harm than good  id recommend a movie written at a more grownup level,reality
i finally made time to see this film expecting a visceral emotional experience  instead i was in order bored angry sleepy and bewildered is this the groundbreaking film that everyone was gushing over last year from all the talk i expected a headon assault at the beginning of the movie  what i did see was a heavyhanded and frankly uninteresting battle scene  from there the movie only got worse  i didnt care a bit for any of the characters least of all the tom hanks lead and the obnoxious matt damon  while the film looked spectacular thats all it was surface there was no depth whatsoever to any of the characters or situations  i feel like maybe there is something wrong with me that i dont see what all the orgasmic gushing over this film is about  plain old boring,reality

it may not be the most overrated but its certainly up there along with scream and fargo and theres something about maryoh what a battle scene  the fantastic motion sickness inducing cinematography the masterfully overhyper editing the gore oh the wonderful gore  and so forththe omaha beach landing was quite intense  it was brutal and affecting but people just cant seem to get it into their heads that one extended battle scene does not a great film makeafter that we get yet another version of a tired clichd mission movie filled with your usual stereotypes reminiscing about the good ol days before this all ever happened doing whatever it takes just to get home blah blah blah also painfully stereotypical are the characters we have the saddened captain who misses his normal job and life weve got the hardnut sergeant the italian guy the jewish guy the new yorker and so forth  and all the germans are skinheaded bastards  and by the way where the hell were the other allied troops  oh i forgot it was the americans that won the war flag shots at the beginning and end are just painfully sadthe middle of the movie is incredibly boring  pointless predictable setpieces are tiresome  the scenes in which the rattled soldiers tell little stories of life at home the medic talking about his mother talking about his brothers etc are awful attempts at evoking sympathy and sentimentalitythen theres the final battle  outnumbered the men revert to primitive tactics a bit like predator  quite unbelievably this lengthy fight is incredibly boring and the one at the end of young guns is far better5 oscars  obviously due to the beach landing bit they are mostly undeserved  best director  should have been peter weir or terence malick best cinematography  john toll for the thin red line without any doubt in the world  editing  out of sight deserved this even more than the thin red line  i suppose the two sound awards are justifiedfor people to call this the greatest war film of all time is just wrong the best is apocalypse now  this is not the best world war two film either  das boot is  this cant even be described as the best ddaynormandy beach landings movie either  the longest day kicks its a   to go even further  this is not even spielbergs best war film  schindlers list is superiorto summarise  great beginning but the rest sucked  if you havent seen it dont bother  or if you insist watch the beginning then leavepress stop  youll be doing yourself a big favour,reality
the greatest battle in the twentieth century took place at the shores of normandy and it was fought by courageous soldiers who spilled their guts and payed the ultimate sacrifice for freedomout there in that beach dog green sector omaha beach hundreds if not thousands of courageous american soldiers took and kept a vital position for an invasion to liberate the old continent their warrior spirit allowed them to gain a bitter victorytoo many young americans died in that battle for making possible to send other people free this source of american pride moves me in so many ways we love the american heroism and we share our admiration for the greatest warriors the american soldiersthis movie starring a great american actor tom hanks in the role of captain miller 2nd ranger shows the american attitude and the struggle they went through to achieve one of the greatest american victories in world history it is not easy to understand the huge victory it was for america and world freedom to win the most important war in history i will always love america for thatother fantastic american actors like vin diesel and giovani ribisi play an awesome performance as heroic kindhearted soldiers in the face of evil showing all the heroism we can expect from an army rangerall in all this movie is a mustsee and it is worth to buy the dvd the fantastic soundtrack and the emotional flagwaving at the end of the movie make your eyes to waterup you will never forget this excellent hollywood production and the wonderful story told will get you speechless for a while,reality
i really liked this movie  the realism was extreme what is i think a good thing i do not like spielberg since i was 1415 yrs old anyway i think this guy would be better in doing commercials for tv than making movie  just my humble opinion but if we forget some flaws the movie is pretty good  t hanks was also very good in it  he got my respectnow some stuff was bothering near the beginning why spielberg was making the little french girl say  i dont like those american soldiers  sob  are those us dudes will stop one day to think that the french are genetically antiamerican  thats ridiculous  i hate set ideas the german soldiers look dumb and wanting very eagerly take some us slug in the map  come on guys  the germans are just there to be shooted they act stupidly what cost them their life they have no survivng instinct  i dont buy it the landing scene seemed ended a little too fast and easily to match the reality i think imhoof course there may be a little too much us patriotism for the average european viewer we are not used to it anymore in our countries selfglorification i mean but after all its an american movie and they did change the fate of europe and the world so  let them do itanyway good movie i give it a 810 you should at least see it once  ,reality
is without a doubt the best war movie ever made and one of the best movies of all time i wasnt sure what i would think of this movie before i saw it i heard the gore and carnage was too much and i heard the story and action was greatwhen i finally did see it i loved it the gore wasnt as bad in my opinion as everyone said it was i thought the battles scenes were fantastically done they were entertaining to watch but with a certain sadness to it i also think the moments of reflection among the soldiers was very good too you got to hear their thoughts about the enemy the soldiers and the war itselfthe acting was great especially by tom hanks tom hanks certainly deserved the academy award for best actor even though he did not get it matt damon also did a great job as private watch for a great cameolike performance by ted dansonthe storyline was interesting most of all it showed what the war was like and how horrible it was some of the american soldiers were killed before they even entered the battlefield some before they could even fire back and some went down in a blaze of glory either way you felt pity for the americans and hatred for the nazisthe mission the soldiers were on was to find a single man private and bring him home because all of his brothers were killed and he was the last male survivor of the family you along with the soldiers in the movie will always be thinking about whether it is worth it to risk eight lives to save one man many things happen through the film that will keep changing your mind about itif blood guts and gore bothers you you really should not watch otherwise i recommend going out and buying it right away you will not be disappointed,reality
is an example of a genre of film making that should have died out long ago far from being anti war it is a glorification of war while the americans are righteous the germans are evil and spielberg invites us to enjoy the spectacle of their death german prisoners should be murdered or else they will come back and kill you so do it to them first,reality
lame revisionist crap what the hell kind of squad does no recon talks out loud and stays bunched together also many of the weapons esp the german m 60are improperly and fantastically used how can you use a sniper scope out of the box with no sighting in idiotic spielbergs enthusiastic portrayal of the murder of german prisoners is disturbing in the extreme,reality

you have to love a war movie which just like goonies is based around a serious of characters all of which have one defining characteristic and go on a quest finding out who they are along the wayas goonies had the fat kid the asian genius the smartarse has the religious guy the cowardly guy and smartarse among others as the goonies fought impossible odds so too do the american soldiers of the castand wwii is seen as it really happened with the heroic americans fighting for the cause of good singlehandedly against those crazy germans canadians british french and even commonwealth soldiers dont feature on this western front and nor would they with this being an american film starring tom hanks they should be neglected from such history theres only room for the central characters and there quest for flag waving glorywhen this film was first released it was sold as being so accurate it was a history lesson within a piece of entertainment but blood and guts dont make for accuracy and americans for whom this was meant only saw war as a glorious celebration of the starsnstripes to this day america has used wwii not as a warning but as a starting point lost in this film was the supposed antiwar message with nationalism the resounding lesson that this filth passed onto its american viewers george w bush must surely love this piece of violent film making at its worstforget about this goonies rip and just check out the original its far less offensive and a lot more entertaining,reality
is one of steven spielbergs most haunting and visually stunning films as the film opens you see an elderly man whose identity is not revealed until the end standing at a headstone in tears why you soon understand the story as we go back in timeit is dday june 6th1944 you are soon caught up in the battle on omaha beach and it is incredibly bloody soldiers are shot drowned blown apart or on fire during the battle on the beach against the germany army one of the soldiers fighting is capt miller tom hanks in one of his best performances who fights bravely but you can see the terror that engulfs him his hands say it all an uncontrollable shakingsoon after the battle miller is given a mission seems that 3 of the killed men were brothers a fourth is behind enemies lines and needs to be rescued and sent home to america with his team members accompanying him miller starts his search for private matt damonthis is not an easy mission every single man knows that they may not survive the trek through the countryside of normandy pvt reiben edward burnsbelieves that pvt is not worth saving at the cost of their lives but with courage and determination by the team although some members do lose their lives they find however refuses to leave because a bridge in a bomb shattered town needs protection from the german army with the assistance of the surviving team they take a stand against the army it is at this point that the surviving team members understand the importance of a lingering question through the film will their sacrifice make a difference by taking a stand to defend the bridge the answer is obvious yesthe performances of the actors are powerful including hanks burns and damon you have tom sizemore barry pepper adam goldberg giovanni ribisi vin diesel and jeremy davies john williams who always works well with spielberg provides a powerful score the battle at the beginning of the film is one of the most heart wrenching scenes in cinematic history and is not for the squeamish it is a very moving film and you will need plenty of tissue before you watch it,reality
ooooh steven spielberg and tom hanks  it has to be good and that is why so many fools actually think this movie is worth something they were told it was before they ever saw it  tom hanks playing the same character he has in every movie since philidelphia sans forrest gump spielberg trying to make us think this movie is as realistic as they get lots of bullets blood and heads blowing apart does not mean it qualifies as real  it cant be real  weve seen all of these characters in a hundred other movies  tough tobacco chewing sergeant  cynical mouthy private even the sniper getting shot through the scope  spielberg is ripping of a schlock tom berringer joint  but look at all the people dying and the young man calling for his mother this is a good movie  yeah right  do yourself a favor and rent hell is for heroes  a good movie although it might be tough for some of you because it is in bw,reality
spielberg set out to make a realistic depiction of the omaha beach landings to kick off  his film which is about a fictional mission of a squad to rescue one pvt of the airborne dropped inland behind the beaches one glaring idiocy of the film is why they would dispatch soldiers from the omaha sector to rescue someone droppedbehind the utah sector especially when 4th infantry div soldiers arealready in contact with a large portion of the airborne troops the answer is of course because that gives spielberg his opportunity to display the omaha landings rather than the utah beach landings next door which were too easy and lacked any bloody combat if the only thing anyone knows about the v corps landings at omaha came from this film then they would have been better off skipping the film or at least the opening scenes of battle read a book and learn what happened at omaha youll find that it wasnt anywhere near as bloody as spielbergs film leads one to believe omaha beach was considered bloody only because of comparison with landings at the other 4 beaches which were virtually walkovers the rest of the movie is not much to see with many errors in the combat sequences especially with respect to tactics that would have been used spielbergs film is badly flawed as history and the story is downright unbelievable  why not radio the 101st  and order off the line why send a few guys to walk thru the entire german 7th army and search in a 400 square mile area for some guy named the us army wasnt always the most efficient but they would never have sent off a squad on such a cockamamie mision,reality
is a top wwii film and ive seen it a dozen times as the film starts we are presented with a hundred or so ships coming across the sea suddenly violence erupts and soldiers are slaughtered on the dday assualt in the assualt captain miller tom hanks leads his platoon up and around the german lines for a flank attack across the ocean a mother receives three kia letters in the same day but is promised that her youngest son private matt damon will be found in france and sent home on the normandy beach captain miller and his platoon will be sent on a suicide mission across france to find private and battle across the german lines through the whole mission the soldiers are pushed to the limit with the death of comrades and questioning of the missionsteven spielberg works his magic again with the presentation of one of the most honored war movies in film history tom hanks is strong smart and above all good as captain miller there is also a surprise with one of vin diesels first roles as private caparzo the violence is brutal bloody and well crafted each character is interesting and their fears and weaknesses are each expressed in the filmstarring tom hanks tom sizemore edwards burns barry pepper vin diesel and matt damon4 12 out of 5 stars,reality
i think this film is terrible  the war scenes are gimmicky especially the flanging shakey camera work  some scenes are outrageously unrealistic such as when those american soldiers shot the germans using the mirror also studies have been done showing that only about 13 of american troops landing during dday fired their rifles  not all of these soldiers were hardcore killers like the movie makes them out to be  its laughable that people call this film realisticthe audience is given very little credit  the dialogue sounds like it is cut out of newspaper articles which editorialize the mission  its as though spielberg thought his audience was so stupid that the moral dilemma of the film had to be spelled out for them in detailit also overused action sequences  those in creative control of the film tried to make up for the lack of depth with gritty excessive scenes of violence  all in all this is one of the worst films that i have ever seen,reality
best war movie of all time one of my favorites and so onpleasethe beginning is awesome with amazing action scenes but then what its the usual usa saves the world with whowouldhaveguessedit heroes and nauseating flag waving and other clichs i just cant believe that this movie is considered to be the 14th best or 12th or whatever it is right now of all timewhats most surprising about is that all the americans who watched it could get out from the theaters with their big heads they cant honestly say that this is how they thought wwii was can they all americans and not a brit frenchman or anyone of another nationality in sightthis movie was made for an american crowd and to make money at the box office not to make a believable story about ddayits supposed to be really emotional when an american gets killed or injured but the germans are shot down indiscriminately this is sickening to me is an american life worth more than a german spielberg seems to think it is,reality
before i start let me say that this movie was extremely well crafted pushing the envelope in the technical aspect of filmmakingthis movie was really good if looked at in parts the opening dday sequence was beautiful the final battle was also great there were moments that really grabbed you the giovanni ribisi monologue especially but the film as a whole makes no senseit said nothing it simply contradicted itself over and over agian the great dday sequence tells us about the insanity of war and how awful and seemingly pointless it all is but after two hours of walking around to further build on the whole insanity of war thing the movie goes full circle right into hollywood the ending attempts to justify all the madness by saying that its all worth it because you are fighting for matt damon and of course your country as we fade out on the american flag mr speilberg and company what exactly are you trying to tell usnote this movie pales in comparison to terrance malicks the thin red linealthough i must say if it came down to this movie and shakespeare in love perhaps the worst movie to ever win an oscar oh wait thats titanic i would have to go with this one,reality
i am not as enraptured by this film as so many others seem to be  i sensed a disturbing hollowness at its center and i left the theater feeling as if my emotions had been manipulated  i found it ugly and shabby beautifully photographed though,reality
anyone who disagrees can run their car into a wall at a fatal 150mph this is the greatest war movie ever made 10 reasons why 1 great cast 2 great story 3 great set design 4 great introduction 5 great closing scene 6 great sound effects 7 great realism people die in war not everyone lives in this one 8 great score by john williams 9 great purpose 10 because i said so this movie is so good that i bought the dvd i dont buy many movies for three reasons 1 most movies get boring after you see them twice or more 2 rarely is a movie worth the 20 dollars 3 only a moron would waste money on a movie he or she would only watch once then throw it in a cabinet for the rest of his or her life anywaythis movie rocks end of story,reality
the movie is nothing but a dummy package under the guise of a feigned authenticity  the construction of unreflecting patriotism tearjerking worship of heroes a naive blackandwhite portrayal and a pathetic good against evil mentality  it does not leave a doubt that only a dead german is a good german tom hanks and the folks gathering around him may do a good job but still cannot avoid the old clich captain millers colorful troop is not much more than the regular bunch of war movie stereotypes who mutate to heroes where the vietnam movies of a oliver stone platoon or of a stanley kubrick full metal jacket mercilessly condemn do spielbergs shocking pictures justify all committed atrocities in retrospect therefore this movie is rather a tribute to the us world war veterans than an antiwar movie an absolution which illustrates the horrors of war but not its senselessness all in all this is a movie we did not need and we could have done very well without it,reality
whoa i have just read some of the other reviews and it seems that if you dont like this film you must be antiamericannow dont get me wrong the opening scene was brilliant but to me it quickly settled into being just another war movie albeit a well produced and shot war movie you know the good ol usofa rising up above  insurmountable odds to save the day blah blah blahi just could not accept the basic premise of the film that several mens lives were to be put at risk for the reasons given i mean war is war stuff like that happenshaving said that i could accept this scenario happening today re jessica with all the ensuing publicityi think part of the problem was my expectation i was expecting a real antiwar film one that leaves you thinking you know that war is bad this was just another good guys america bad guys germans type filmif you want to see a real and i mean real antiwar film you must see the 1930 version of all quiet on the western front ask me the ending of private and in three months i wont be able to tell you but our high school teacher made us sit through this when i was about 1314 and to this day the final scene still jars mego see it trust me it will move you more than look it up on imdb it has scored 82 tos 83but whats the use people who gave private a 10 will probably be bored with it because it is one war film that has little violence in it and it is full of shudder germans,reality
spielberg just about had it here at least for the first half hour or so he looked at the bonecrunching grisly history of dday and had the movie to put it on the screen with some respect for honest reality then with his hollywood sellout lack of vision spielberg decided to throw it all away on patriotic fantasy the true story the film may be based on has some chaplain in france discovering after word was passed along that his brothers had all been lost and the lad should be shipped back to america so his mother still has one child to work the farm or the story could be straight out of the writers head but it hardly matters the premise itself strikes the viewer as utterly ludicrous after a halfhour of complete slaughter the seas red with human blood and gore we are expected to believe that an army chief is sitting in his office and worrying over private and his family while the assault on normandy is costing thousands upon thousands of lives while the allied bombers are missing their mark up and down the coast and hitlers machine guns are just mowing down allies like grass what romantic rubbish and so typical of hollywood and the portrayal of the german prisoner is morally offensive the german people have never been less human than americans even when they were lead by an evil leader into a war  to portray them as spielberg does the prisoner a bumbling idiot who later becomes a murdering snake hissing shhh as he slowly sinks a huge knife into an american chest is lowbrow hateful stuff but nobody is going to notice believe me in fact we love to see the world in black and white simplistic terms  here come the oscars for spielberg americans and my own canadians too are generally not prepared to see the truth about themselves capital d denial reigns supreme especially at the boxoffice spielbergs big budget is spent to further anesthetize us while claiming to be trying to do justice to the truth if hed stayed on the beach at omaha hed have a nine out of ten instead he rates several points less for this updated version of that old tv series called combat please see amy taubins review at the following url its much more articulate and generous than mine httpwwwvillagevoicecominkfilm30taubinshtml,reality
is one of those movies you cant believe didnt win the picture oscar that didnt stop it though from reaching such a huge audience and touch the lives of millions the movie has one of the best introductions ever put on screen the attack on dday is immensely powerful and painfully well directed steven spielberg knows exactly how to make this movie strong and actiondriven while focusing on the psychology on the characters and the cruelty of warthe movie is about 8 men searching for a soldier by the name of james matt damon whos the last of four brothers still left alive after the attack of dday most of the soldiers still suffer the war syndrome and seem very doubtful of finding one person in a whole warzone back at homes mother gets a letter about three out of four of her sons dying in war and begs the soldiers to find her last oneits a beautiful film that depicts war as it should be vicious disgusting violent heartbreaking unfair and tragic spielbergs use of the handheld camera is almost breathtaking as he gets right into the action and swings left and right to create a sense of realism and panic his incredible editing and beautiful cinematography is unforgettable and is strongly influentialtom hanks gives an incredible performance as captain john miller a dedicated and loyal soldier whos on the verge of losing his mind the pressure from being a captain and enduring the worst attack in history sends him in mental torture trying to covering his pain and suffering from the rest of the soldiersthe story doesnt focus on the heroic aspect but rather the truth about war spielberg knows that even though you get to know the characters they have a chance of dying there is a unique subtlety in that these characters seem to have the drive to save private so they could go homedefinitely one of the best directed films in a long time is a bright gem in recent filmmaking robbed of the picture oscar the movie is a true representation of dday and post dday its a movie that inspires above all else,reality
the story happened in the second world war privates three elder brothers were killed in battles the us army decided to send back to home to alleviate his mothers pain captain miller accepted the task though he was not satisfied with it including other members it was said that was in germandominatedfrancearea every team member knew its hardshipthe opening battle that happened in omaha beach was fierce and unforgettable the similar scenes also occurred in wonderful tv series band brothers when miller led seven people to execute the mission that reminded me of the lord of the rings of cause the task in tlotr was more difficultlife is precious however a war can easily kill many people the war is ruthless so that you must be coldblooded or get killed in battlefield peace is really what we should cherishan excellent thoughtprovoking war drama 910,reality
here we have another in the series of spielberg formula drek  mr s has stumbled on a great gimmick  he makes films that may not be disliked because of some taboo or other  to dislike schindlers list is to not be sympathetic with the jews who were killed by nazis  to dislike forrest gump is to not be properly respectful of retarded people  give me a break  now were all supposed to like because if we dont it means we dont understand that war is bad or appreciate the sacrifice made by all the people who died during ww ii  spare mewithout all the emotional baggage spr is an awful movie  the plot is trite  the writing labored and formulaic and it in no way justifies the emotional bludgeoning delivered by the opening sequencei will admit that the opening sequences is probably the most powerful half hour of film ever to be projected on a movie screen  spielberg know all the emotional buttons we have and how to push them  he was a brilliantly manipulative filmmaker 25 years ago and hes only gotten better  that being said did mr spielberg forget to actually add a story  lots of movies deal with the ugly side of humanity  the shawshank redemption is a perfect example of how to show these things in the context of a riveting story  i guess the most disappointing aspect of this is that we all know that spielberg can do better  he has done better  he has made some of the greatest american films of all time  he of all people should remember that and remember that every time he makes one of these ponderous abominations he is desecrating the memory of films like duel and jaws and even the lost world  it was a far better movie than thison a scale of 1 to 10  i gave it a 1 only because there was no zero which was what it really deserved,reality
i cant be the only person who thinks this is starship troopers with the evil nazi scourge standing in for the bugsfor one the combat scenes are no more warishell realistic and bloody than starship troopers  its nice to see protagonists who arent superhuman but this is only a moderately original take for big budget blockbusters its hardly ground breaking cinemajust as in starship troopers the characters barely qualify as one dimensional and i cant be the only one who found them so irritatingly stereotypical that spr almost qualifies as a parodya particular point of interest is that mr spielbergs evil nazi scourge are portrayed only slightly more sympathetically than the bugs in starship troopers  if you get your knowledge of history from hollywood which a lot of people do then youd be forgiven for thinking that every single german was a soulless nazi who deserved to die and that wwii was just usa vs japan and germany  i do have a fair amount of sympathy for spielbergs stance but its interesting to compare his sweeping generalisations with 1930s nazi antijewish antiromany propaganda  its sad but not really surprising that spielbergs audience accepts his skewed message just as unquestioningly as the german moviegoers did in the 1930sthe idea for spr is actually sound but the implementation is just so overdone that i really cant bring myself to care about any of it other than to feel contempt for the brutal liberties it takes with history  if im going to watch goodvsbad fantasy id prefer to stick with starship troopers which at least doesnt try to pass itself off as something significant and profound,reality
this is by the most realistic and intense war movie i have ever seen the first 20 minutes really puts it into perspective what young men died for our freedom great movie 10 stars can be enjoyed multiple times definitely a tough watch at times,reality
i just recently had a chance to rewatch this film in a cinemaplex not exactly imax but it was a larger screen than my home tv and theatre audio was superb i saw this film when it originally came out in theaters in 1998 the opening sequence gained notoriety for its unflinching visceral photography and shockingly graphic violence i have watched this film a few times since then but seeing it on a larger screen i had an appreciation for the realism that spielberg insisted on if it was virtually any other filmmaker the expense of realistic production with extra attention to detail would not have happened instead we would have been presented something not as noteworthythese efforts were the reason it won several academy awards there is so much depth to the story the film zips along with small set pieces that provide some kind of insight to the enigma of war not only are there some classic performances there are classic faces bryan cranston vin diesel matt damon paul giamatti ted danson tom sizemore adam goldberg giovanni ribisi dennis farina barry pepper very recognizable facestom hanks now less of an a list star compared to the 90s gives a very natural performance he shouts commands as a confident captain taking part in the most incredible feat attempted by our country we get to witness these events partially through the gunshy eyes of corp upham played by a meek looking jeremy davis he reacts as most of the audience would to the cacophonous noise and chaos he flinches as much as anyone would with bombs going off right next to you he also represents the humane approach to the war which of course goes against reason at timesthere are accolades to go around including a detailed script capt millers unknown career back in the states searching through a pile of dogtags a glider landing that went fubar a genuinely funny anecdote about the brothers before the war coherent explanation of strategies and improvised weapons when confronted with a dilemma the script smartly explores it to find a piece of wisdom that the audience can learn from so we get a history lesson about the first few days of the dday invasion while being entertained with believable and memorable charactersthe cinematography can be considered a landmark in visceral storytelling the use of high shutter speeds removes the normal blur when there is an explosion in this case the explosion particles are vividly in focus and feel all the more real and lethal i lost track when watching the more technical aspects of the film of how many shots were done in a single take in the final battle there is a shot following upham from cowering from an explosion tracking him to another building on another block with a tank a soldiers approaching returning back to the previous street and ending with a conversation with sgt horvath sizemore there are many more long shots like this throughout the film that go unnoticed the shots are staged so well they feel like a documentary with no deliberate use of shaky cam neededlastly the density of the soundtrack must be noted there is a never ending barrage of gunfire explosions objects flying in the air footsteps weapons being loaded and on the immersion of the sound again with the advantage of hearing it on a well tuned sound system in a theatre makes the experience even more intense such as the quiet rumble of german tanks approaching the spare music score gives the perfect backing when the moment requires itthe 2 hour and 49 minute running time goes quickly with each set piece as part of the journey providing something new and intriguing as the squad of soldiers encounter the war the longer script gives character depth and glances at small details that might have been otherwise excised for timei give this film a 9 out of 10 and is not only one of spielbergs all time best films but a timeless work on its own how would i rate it as one of the best war films i would put it up there with perhaps patton but i believe that every well made film about war can each provide a unique insight into war such as apocalypse now is one the best war films in the way it shows the perversity of war,reality
in reading through the comments made on this page i realize that people had several interpretations and opinions of what this movie was supposed to be as people often do  however heres how i feel the movie was intended and why i say that this is by far the greatest war movie and one of the greatest movies of any genre the prevailing comments among naysayers is that the characters were too stereotypical and that a plot of one man being important enough to risk the lives of 8 was unbelievable thats exactly what spielberg wanted first the characters  they were intended to be stereotypical  how could you represent every man that ever fought in this and other wars without being stereotypical  unless of course you wanted to have a cast of several million people  the point was to show the trevails that every man went through in the war not to give a unique face to each and it seems he did this with his usual masterysecond the plot  the mistake that most are making is that theyre thinking of private as one man  he wasnt  he was everyone  every person that was sitting in that theater  every person that has ever been a part of this country   when he tells to earn this he is talking to you he is saying that were not here today by accident  it took normal men a schoolteacher for instance to make sure that we could someday go on imdb after seeing a movie and spout our opinions he is telling you not to waste the precious life youve been given so yes this is perhaps the greatest movie of all time shaky camera or not  and they fought so that i could sit here on my soapbox and give my opinion thank god,reality
the genius of steven spielberg is that he always knows exactly where he wants to take his audience and then takes them there if he wants to tug at our heartstrings hell make us fall in love with a brown and wrinkly space visitor we might otherwise find grotesque if he wants to make us inch the blanket up over our eyes hell crank up the grim orchestral music and put us facetoface with a toothy great white and if he wants us to truly understand an entirely different kind of horror hell show us small children leaping into a pool of outhouse waste to escape their murderous holocaust captorsspielberg continues what he does best with a film so graphic in its second world war battlefield depictions that many veterans have called it the closest thing to being there the explicit scenes of gushing arteries severed limbs and faceless corpses come fast and furious numbing us into the reality of the setting in fact if we didnt know spielberg as a serious artist with noble objectives we might be tempted to call him a shock artist obsessed with blood and guts and gorebut we do know about spielberg we know he would not take us down such a rocky road without a reason in the obvious rationale is to help us understand not where hes coming from but where the men we will ultimately spend nearly three hours with are coming from its in this hell on earth that cpt john miller tom hanks and his small group of soldiers fine actors like edward burns tim sizemore and barry pepper among them must not only survive with sanity intact but carry out orders and not all of those orders make sense at the time if ever case in point hanks and his men are sent to locate one pte james matt damon pte is no pow but a soldier still serving somewhere within the vast us forces  if hes still alive that is during the second world war with a communication system that is a technological dinosaur by todays standards its a mission ordered said than accomplishedthe mission is a tough sell not just logistically but emotionally pte is sought so he can be sent home to his mom who has just lost her three other sons virtually at once as he himself admits pte has displayed no more courage than his fellow soldiers why should he get to leave indeed that question crops up in the minds of hanks soldiers why is one mans life worth risking those of a group of men they ask its an interesting angle for a film about heroes we often think of soldiers doing the job with no questions asked happy to put their lives on the line for their fellow gi we forget they are rational humansand therein lies one of the biggest strengths of its a very human story told in extreme circumstances it covers all the traditional bases  inner turmoil terror carnage  but has a level of sophistication absent from most other war films particularly those inspired by the last great war hanks isnt patton but a schoolteacher who secretly cries at the enormity of it all the enemy fighters dont have horns but uniforms and feelings just like the americans the soldiers are heroes but reluctant onesspielberg is a master at telling the story of war and men is not his best but it certainly comes close,reality
i dont think anyone is ever going to argue how great that opening landing sequence is  just the shear chaos in which those men were consumed  i found the chaos comparable to the scene in platoon where they assault the vc bunkerhowever it does not any part of the movie in my mind match up the finale of platoon in which one is so confused your heart pounds and it is in the end more horrifying than any of the combat sequences in privatewhat really got to me about this film were several things thoughfirst and foremost is the dumb german syndrome which leaves me with a bias feeling  why in the end did miller and sarge have know problem mowing down the by passing germans then survive the same gauntlet with almost twenty germans firing at themanother thing is i couldnt help but notice how far people flew through the air whenever hit by a mortar or stepped on a land mineor hit by a grenadeso on so on  i wont pretend to be a warvet or someone whos witnessed this but it seems unlikely to me  however ill stress my own ignorance and say dont take my word for itall in all i found it to be a worthy action flick  comparable in my mind to the big red one  it has sad moments and moments of brutality but in the end just left me with impressed memories of some of the combat sequencesas a sidenote i think that the best ww2 films ever made are the thin red line and bridge on the river kwai two films that dont deal heaviliy with combat ttrl more so  tried just a little to hard to force feed it  i recomend all of these films but for your knowledge those are to me the best,reality
im afraid that i hated every moment of this film spielburg overused emotional hokum to try to give his film wieght when we actually didnt care whether private lived or died the first twenty minutes i accept are excellent but they are just a rip off of someone elses hard work  and frankly i would rather see the original footage from the second world war rather than the directors interpretation of it although it tried to be realistic and historical it was neither the history is faulty and the emotions of the rangers are not realistic i imagine that if it happened for real they would complain about having to rescue this mummies boy and hide out somewhere safe until it was safe to go back to base id rather watch the notoriously bad objective burma anyday at least it doesnt pretend to be true,reality
this is for those who think spr is realisticdday happened on 20ms and under 15 minutes oh yeah the us government is so kind that they risk 8 guys for only one this 8 breaks trough german defense lines every german soldier who fought in the war were an evil nazi who couldnt aim and ran into every single american bullet the only one they let to go is a bad nazi ss soldat who is hungry for revenge medics are used in frontal attacks against an mg americans are able to shoot into tiger tanks and throw grenades into them ss surrenders to a small little guy who couldnt even hold his weapon properly this movie is truly overhyped made for the americans as a propaganda if i would be an american i would rate this movie 1010 but im not beautiful photographics though but this wont save the movie101,reality
director steven spielbergs usual homey touch which infiltrated even schlinders list in its final act is thankfully in slight evidence here as wwii soldiers attempt to locate one particular man whose siblings have all been killed in combat the setup for the plot is a bit formulaic and layered with spielbergs need for romanticism but the very fine performances and exhaustingly exact scenes of violence remain haunting and memorable vivid cinematography and frenetic editing won oscars as did spielberg who deserved it i was rather surprised by how powerful this movie is given the feelgood reputations by many of the principals involved im not a lover of this particular movie genre but the film pulls no punches in detailing many unrelenting scenes of battle  from ,reality
i went to see this film back in 1998 with my father who is a wwii veteran who happened to serve in the pacific theatre on iwo jima while on line he struck up a conversation with another veteran who did happen to serve in the european theatre and they discussed old times but near the end of the conversation my dad said for what for what something that still resonates with many wwii vets who are still alive and saw that war was not the prettified heroics pumped out of the hollywood studios but a very real bloody and bewildering hell fought by the young and vital male and female alikethe premise of the film being a young man who has already lost several brothers in the service being saved by a platoon unknown to him has its basis in fact during the second world war many families had several sons who either enlisted or were drafted and went into different military units the five sullivan brothers all of whom were lost during the sinking of the uss juneau were the most famously representative of this tragedy and after the war the practice of multiple draft recipients from one family was eliminated does anyone remember the scene where privates mother sees an army car pulling up to her porch the serviceman and her local clergyman approach her and she sinks down struck by the horrible reality they are about to convey the terrible simplicity of this is deeply movingthere is also a brief scene in the beginning showing a secretarial pool for the armed services where letters for medals both posthumous and for the living were typed and sent to families around the country my mother worked in one of those pools and it was not an easy job to deal with day by daysome have asked  why no british soldiers here this is an american platoon on the omaha beachhead not one of montgomerys units the daily dangers and horrors of war are vividly portrayed the deaths arent pretty and some of the characters arent pretty but thats the way war is and was you were in a unit with all types from different states and your common goal was to survive  kill or be killed there were gloryboys and cowards and some are shown herethe only maudlin note and spielberg cant seem to resist injecting some sentimentality here is when the mature visiting the military cemetery with his family stops at the grave of his commanding officer john miller and asks in tears am i a good man in other words  why them and not me why am i here outliving everyone it doesnt seem justified to himthere are some terrific performances to take in  tom hanks as john miller matt damon as pvt tom sizemore and vin diesel to name just a fewthe sacrifices of our fathers uncles and grandfathers generation were exemplary they were the lucky ones who came back to lend their voices to history and without them many of us including myself would not be here at the end of the film i sat there next to my dad who was also in tears i would say god bless them one and all,reality
what a piece of trash if you want to see a war movie that is good see thin red line  spr is poorly acted the cinematography is below average and the entire movie is flawed with inaccurate and misleading information  this movie is an example of what is wrong with hollywood and the way big studio movies are made thier 1 objective is to make money off the movie at any cost even if that means turning out a piece of garbage that leads the public to believe this is the best out there when in fact the opposite is true,reality
spielberg has once again lost the plot this was a terrible war movie covering no new ground but instead recycling the same old war issues in a dull manner the opening scene was spectacular for five minutes and boring for the next twenty minutes enough is enough in typical spielster fashion the movie was too long and the spielster had way too much money in his budget i would love to see him use some creative material like his 70s movies such as close encounters of the third kind how humiliated the spielster must have felt after comparing the superb the thin red line next to his babbling messsorry spielster 2 out of 10,reality
is the first movie thats kept my eyes glued to the screen no lie for at least 30 minutes straight the opening scene in this movie is incredible ive never been in war but after seeing this movie i know i just know that thats what war is like its gotta be steven spielberg is amazing in this movie the performances are amazing everything is so well done sometimes the camera gets a little too shaky but you gotta picture it through the eyes of someone whos actually therei usually get bored with war movies because its usually the same crap but this movie sticks with me its gotta be hell to be a soldier the combat scenes were excellently done and even though the opening was extremely gruesome and gory it just had to be that way the movie is a little long almost 3 hours but its worth the entire watch the only scene i thought was a little stupid was when they spoiler found the wrong private and he started crying cuz he thought his brothers were dead but aside from that this is the best war movie ive ever seen make sure you see this movie fubar,reality
this is truly the best war movie ive ever seen eerytime i watch it i cannot stop crying i get goosebumps only by thinking of it what makes it so special is that private seems to have learned the lesson earn this it seems that he truly respected a dying mans wish about the scenes in the movie i played the computer game medal of honor  allied assault and i was surprised to see a lot of the movie scenes in the game normandy sniper city  caparzo the bridge or vice versa i dont have to tell you that mohaa is my favorite computer game ever all the respect to the genius of steven spielberg i mean its like he was therebottom line if you havent seen it yet your great loss,reality
i give this movie a four out of ten because the cinematography was good other then that it was crap the acting is terrible especially by vin diesel how the heck did he get that role anyway the plot was ridiculous and boring the script was very poorly written and over all i am disappointed in both tom hanks and mr spielberg now i know spielberg loves to make movies about that era of course he was too young for that war and too old for the next one but hey hes richer then god he can exploit anything he wants the movie follows soldiers in the 75th ranger regiment as they land on the beaches of normandy best scene in the movie tom hanks is then given an assignment to rescue matt damon and bring him home because all of his other brothers were killed in combat so almost every man from hanks squad dies but eventually gets saved the germans of course are all incredibly unnattractive brutish men in reality the war was fought by a bunch of twentysomethings on all sides who had no idea what they were getting into but the hanksspielberg team completely redeemed themselves with band of brothers so do yourself a favor skip renting this pay a couple bucks more and pick up all ten episodes of b of b its a true story based on real heroes of wwii and the acting is not bad thats all save your money if you want to see wait for it to come on abc,reality
i would have given a higher score had it looked at more issues abundant during wwii they could have focused on the various roles that each country specifically played in the war but dont get me wrong watching the movie you can literally feel the bullets hitting you tom hanks commands as strong a performance as we can expect him to and the rest of the cast also does quite welli guess that if the movie has any problems its in the characters themselves aside from the fact that the movie pretty much makes all americans out to be good and all germans out to be bad the americans are basically clichs theyre all wholesome hardworking guys out to make something of themselves moreover theres the wiseguy new yorker and the cowpoke southerner and pvt comes from iowa read americas heartlandbut otherwise its a very good movie and it goes to show what an incredible director steven spielberg is although i still wouldnt have given the movie best picture i would have given that to life is beautiful also starring tom sizemore edward burns barry pepper adam goldberg vin diesel giovanni ribisi jeremy davies matt damon ted danson paul giamatti and dennis farina,reality
i first saw this movie on tv one night with my father but only saw bits and pieces i decided to rent it one night and watched the whole thing in my basement from the start to the finish i thoroughly enjoyed the moviei had seen a couple other world war two movies but none of them compared to this it was interesting how spielberg made everything look like it was back then with the costumes weapons and scenery overall this movie seemed like one of the best out there and i personally think its spielbergs best if you havent seen it yet then i highly recommend you go out and rent it some time its a great movie and definitely worth watching,reality
i can not understand those who view it as an america win the war movie that is not the point of most of the war movies out there yes they may use american actors and show american fighting but look past that and see the terrifying experiences of war and the fear of the people back home who suffer the emotional trauma i felt gave a visual look at war it gave the best feeling of what war would be like that any movies have given but i dont think that any movie ever will be able to to give the exact fear that is within the people when they are in the middle of a battlefieldan excellent movie dignified moving and intelligent not a word used with many hollywood movies acting with a director that has shown everyone how it should be done,reality
up until this day there had never been a time where i was awestruck or shocked or amazed after seeing a movie never then i saw this movie without a doubt is the best movie i have ever seenis a very accurate presentation of world war 2 in a lot of the parts i felt like i was actually there it was all thanks to spielburgs camerawork which showed some scenes of the movie from the view of a soldier i felt like i was running along the beaches of normandy i felt like i was with them in the final battle wont reveal specifics thats how good it was now even though this movie is really good it is not for the faint of heart the first scene of this movie dday contains gratuitous amounts of violence and gore they do not hold back on the violence so unless you think you can handle it i would not recommend seeing this movie because it does have some very disturbing moments another thing they do not hold back on is swearing if soldiers shouting out the fword constantly doesnt appeal to you then you might want to skip this moviebesides all of that this is a great film i cant think of anything wrong with it at all i would definitely recommend this movie if you can handle the gore and language,reality
 out of five years can really put a lot in perspective at the time of its release was the talk of the summer it introduced a new gritty style of war filmmaking that was only occasionally glimpsed at before the acclaim was virtually unanimous id never seen so many critics place one specific film at the top of the yearendbest list five years later spr has suffered a minor critical backlash not too dissimilar from forrest gump or even titanic two movies that i largely adored as well its now considered the most overrated war film forget critics or the razzies immense popularity can do more damage than those two combined ever could in drovesthe question is how good is this movie ive seen it three times twice in theaters and another time on dvd after it became a perennial punching bag for spielberg haters who came to see it as all that represented what was wrong with the popular director for me nothings really changed its still a harrowing experience i still find myself quivering and shaking by the films conclusion but im not unwilling to concede the films faults five years of which ive become a more demanding even pickier moviegoer and three viewings have made that clear enough to memost people probably know the films basic premise so i wont go into a detailed explanation tom hanks stars as john miller a wwii captain who leads seven men into enemy territory to search for a private james whose three brothers were killed in combat their orders are to relieve him of duty and bring him back immediately unsurprisingly many obstacles hinder their search to the extent the men question whether finding the private is worth the sacrifices it will take to reach himthe central premise is what keeps the film standing out from the rest of the genre its rare to see a war film driven by plot when its usually a random series of events typically battle scenes that hold these movies together the premise is simple but its effective whether eight lives are worth risking to save one is enough to spark a debate that probably wont reach any satisfying conclusion everyones got their own opinion on the matter myself included but its to the films credit it at least made me question the topic viewers should at least be openminded enough to absorb the films moral quandaries theyre partially the glue that holds the film togetherthe camaraderie and interaction among the eight soldiers is that other piece that completes the film theres an equal mix of humor tension respect and pathos between these men robert rodats script lays out each supporting character nicely they may initially read like stereotypes but the performers bring them to life with that said spr boasts one of the best ensemble casts ive ever seen among the eight soldiers theres not a single weak performance in the lot even the annoying jeremy davies comes through mainly because his characters supposed to be annoying and at one point the lone voice of sanity in ironically a world that deems his actions cowardlyspoiler oddly enough the film later goes on to show him kill the man he earlier defended what this is supposed to speak out about his previous actions im not entirely sure other than war can lead to extenuating circumstancesthats not to say i liked every aspect of the films storytelling im not sure whose idea it was to give us those flashback bookends but while they werent grating im not sure theyre necessary either i even see the point of those scenes spielberg clearly wants to tie in our feelings in the present and connect us to the past in that sense the scene works and you do question who the old man is in the beginning but one gets the feeling its somewhat superfluous  spielbergs greatest criticism has been his need to display sentimentality spr is no different theres a bit of emotional manipulation in the final moments but to say it didnt affect me would be a complete lie i was endeared to the characters and their deaths were shocking sobering and saddeningthe battle scenes are virtually without peer the furious intensity of the combat footage surprised me prior to spr platoon was the most intense war film id ever seen and the battle scenes in that film almost look plain in comparison to the work accomplished here its gritty bloody uncompromising and disturbing exactly the way war should be the level of violence has been repeated over the years most recently in 2002 when black hawk down we were soldiers and windtalkers all aimed for the same level of graphic realism but has never been quite used as effectively as it has been here a lot of that having to do with attention paid to plot and characterin the lead performance tom hanks feels like an initially odd choice to play a us captain for some reason i keep picturing harrison ford in this role and who knows what he could have accomplished with it especially after seeing his interesting work in k19 but hanks is fine for all intents and purposes he delivers a great performance perhaps the most powerful one of his career but rodats script puts a few too many john wayneish tendencies into miller the man achieves threedimensional characterization mostly because of hanks touchesthe ads and trailers clearly show that the platoon finds i think i would have preferred not knowing that going into the film might have added to the suspense and certainly would have given an extra edge to the moral questions surrounding the plot matt damons performance as is quite good but yet again rodats script makes him into almost a cartoonishly unselfish and honorable character but damon is convincing enough that some of his more onedimensional actions didnt bother me muchfirstrate direction and acting go a long way in covering script deficiencies and while rodats script is definitely the most flawed aspect of the film its still a wellwritten story of welldeveloped characters who risk and sacrifice their lives not only to save a man but so that we could enjoy the freedom we almost take for granted these days lauding heroism in war movies is an easy sell to mass audiences but tough to win over the critics who generally hold the opinion that war produces no heroes maybe not intentionally but its undeniable that the men who fought were braver than i could ever hope to be,reality
even thinking about this film gives me the chills  welllike practically everything mr spielberg has done in his career  lifting the american movie into the cinematic heaven  hopefully  many movies are still ahead of him  the greatest artist ever no doubt there is nothing new to say about  after so many years  except that perhaps it ought to become the must study subject for anyone interested in military history or history as such  because friendit cannot go any gorier than this  that is any more realistic than this  watch rambo 4  when trumpets fade  windtalkers  saving pr has somehow created a new genre of films  that is ultrarealistic war movie that transcends anything solely written in fact  as has always been the case with mr spielberg literature gets its visual manifestation where even shakespeare would pipe down and bow in reverence  even 10 is not enough  simply no numerical quality unit  exists to describe the sheer power of this cinematic experience  not even the designation film itself can do this  angelic stratospheric  out of this dimension  mona lisa in cinema ,reality
winning 5 academy awards is without doubt one of the greatest war movies of all time director steven spielberg does an excellent job with this film the choreography  film editing sound and directing are superb specially the dday scene which veterans called a precise recreation of the real landing on normandy along is the powerful cast of tom hanks matt damon tom sizemore edward burns giovanni ribisi jeremy davies barry pepper adam goldberg and vin diesel which makes the movie even better the greatest war film of all time and one of the best films over all,reality
i try to understand why people like this movie besides the realistic gore i cant figure it out the story was not good at all in any way also it makes the enemies seem heartless and idolizes america what also makes me mad is the people who say it is the best war movie ever i could name so many more that are better like the thin red line paths to glory glory ran dr strangelove lawrence of arabia the deer hunter das boot the killing fields brave heart stalag 17 and in my opinion the greatest apocalypse now those are just a few i dont want to name them all because it would take to long,reality
all in all this isnt a bad war flick its got a good story that flows well and i enjoyed it for the most part there were a few moments that were dull and slow moving but on the whole it moved well and kept me interested however the dialogue is not up to scratch in some areas particularly when the band of soldiers first set out to find its very banal a major problem i had with the film and it is a fairly big one is the nauseating patriotism that emanates from it this seems to be a problem with others here as well its just irritating and spoils the whole movie for me its hard to ignore it because it is felt throughout the movie in some parts more than in others especially at the end there where the american planes bomb the german positions and the viewer once again has america to thank for saving the day i just cant stomach that really,reality
im starting to think that everything that speilberg touches turns to gold this is probably considered one of the greatest movies of all time and it is directed by speilberg the movie is incredable the beginning was horrifying i couldnt believe how accurate it was and painful it was to watch when i studied ww2 in high school i thought no one could ever recreate the beach of normady but speilberg did i felt like i was there with the soldiers i felt their fear pride and love for their country i couldnt believe how much dedication our armies put into fighting and winning the war and whenever i go to visit washington dc i have more american pride then ever i am more than proud to give this movie a1010,reality
together with schindlers list 1993 and platoon 1986 ranks as one of the greatest war movies of all time like platoon it gives the viewer an in the trenches experiencespielberg has hit another home run with this one the battle scenes are so realistic and gut wrenching that the viewer is left with the impression of what the real battles were actually like spielberg conveys the uselessness and futility of war as we follow tom hanks and his squad in their search for private following a devastating battle on ddayspielbergs two world war ii masterpieces schindlers list and should be required viewing at the high school level in order to instill in our youth a sense of the sacrifices that were made over a half a century ago in order to preserve our freedom,reality
wow i loved this movie my favorite part was when they stormed the beach on dday oh also when they hid out in the church that was good and when it was raining and the dude sniped the guy through the scope great sound effects and realistic warfare i felt like i was right there seeing all of it before my very eyes i also loved the final battle when they needed to protect the bridge and then they found the german soldier they didnt kill and in the end they shot him with a pistol ahhhhwhat a great movie i recommend this to all people who love to watch an exciting movieit shows that no man if left behind if they still have the will to live,reality
there was a time when spielberg felt the filmmaking fraternity had overlooked him those days may be over but the reasons why it happened sadly are not the lesson seems to be make a film about the holocaust and be magically transformed into a critical heavyweightthe sad fact is that schindlers list is in my opinion a very good film but not a great one  it is too heavy handed i am in a minority likewise bolt on 20 minutes of startling cinematography which was not part of the original spielberg grand plan and transform a fairly pedestrian unoriginal warisnaughtybutdevilishlyexciting flick into a major cinematic eventcan someone who loves this film as art i choose capitals for its ironic effect explain how it was that the film managed to spawn a whole series of computer games were spielbergs motives so noble so pure and so righteous that he had to further propagate his warisnaughty message to the fans of first person shootemups now you may argue that it is hardly spielbergs job to worry about such things this may be true  but you have to wonder why it was that is so eminently suited to such a transfer it is difficult for example to anticipate a thin red line or apocalypse now video game it would also difficult to paste scenes from thin red line onto say star wars the millennium falcon coming out of the sun for example and not be able to spot the differenceat best is a lukewarm melodramatic overly sentimental paean to good ole america good ole family and the importance of killing nasty germans before they kill you the beach landing is extraordinary  im not denying it but pardon me if im holding out for something more subtle 5 10,reality
the technical aspects of effects scenery  have been done in a really good way but unfortunately thats the only good thing to say about the moviespoilers aheadthe movie can be divided into two parts the landing at omaha beach and the mission to save privatethe landing is by far the better part and yet it fails the watcher doesnt get involved into the technically perfect action on the screen men are mowed down by machine gun fire and you couldnt care less and a war movie that doesnt make the watcher feel the cruelty of war is a failureafter the landing things become worsethe entire premise of the second part saving a private whos three brothers died is pathetic  and its even presented in a even more pathetic waythe main characters are faceless only tom hanks and jeremy davies roles got some profile and you dont really care about themthe enemy is not only faceless too hes also dumb his only purpose in the film is to mindlessly rush forward to be gunned down by gis making all the fighting feel faketoo many coincidences that pull the movie along is just where hes most needed the bridge gets blown away at the last moment possiblethe film is predictable making a lot of the search for private pointless and the discussions about the mission pointless private is not dead as anybody expects anyway no he did not return to base yes hes fighting the germans no he wont leave his comrades yes the rescue team stays to man the defenseit has all elements of a hollywood movie except the love scene a main character that proves worthy a main character that dies for what he believes in a man that proves manhood by killing for the first time the american flag at the end and everywhere else the treacherous bad guyend of spoilersconclusion its your 0815 american feel good war movie dont expect anything more if you want something more real watch full metal jacket platoon or apocalypse now,reality
yes i know lots of people regard this film one of the greatest war movies ever made blah blah blah but i personally found it one of the most grotesquely overrated pieces of crap i have suffered through in a long time as far as world war 2 movies go only the recent version of the thin red line was more torturous  while its portrayal of the horrors of war was supposed to be profoundly shocking i found it all rather amusing in a sick sort of way myself and during the initial scenes where the allies were landing at normandy and getting massacred i found myself inflamed with feelings of bestial warlust and smirking rather evilly at various particularly violent andor gory moments eg where that troop carrier opens up only to have its entire human cargo mowed down in seconds by german machine gunners  once this part of the movie had ended however i found the whole thing rapidly getting boring so much so that during the violent scene right at the end i found myself squirming and fidgeting in my seat wondering when it would all be overone of this films main faults is that it doesnt have much of a storyline to speak of and its whole premise while admittedly based on a reallife incident seemed rather ridiculous to me  stupidly going for the bad guys as is a habit of mine when watching movies also didnt help and i particularly detested all of the overt religiosity in the movie such as all those highly offensive scenes of crosskissing and all those equally nauseating comments by the americans about how god was on their side in the war quite frankly if god exists i dont think he cares about stuff like this  in addition to all of these other faults the final scene is vile last long enough to get to it and youll hopefully see what i meanin summary therefore a hundred megaton thermonuclear bomb,reality
the best thing i can say about this movie is that it is passable entertainment which if you know anything about the bergs intention for the film was not the point this movie was released to overwhelmingly consistent reviews which frequently referred to it as one of the best war movies ever made imagine my disgust when i saw itthe opening battle is undeniably brilliant in terms of putting you in the middle of the actionhorror but it relies solely on spielbergs ability to push the right buttons and is almost totally ineffective on second viewingpersonally i knew this film was going to be a disaster pretty early on to be precise i knew it when in the midst of this mindblowing battle sequence spielberg thought itd be fun to throw in a joke about sizemore being hanks motherwhy he had everyone on the edge of their seat literally i remember looking around the theatre and every jaw was dropped and he decides to lighten the tone by dropping in a fricking jokefrom here the film goes from bad to worse to utter garbage as we are dragged through a warishellbynumbers affair never one to miss an opportunity to manipulate spielberg makes us endure some pretty feeble philosophising ted danson trying to be serious yes ted danson a token death of the youngest soldier tragedy and some of the most sentimentally contrived dialogue i have ever suffered which never really stood a chance coming from the worst group of twodimensional characters ever assembled for a moviethen theres the premise a group of men is sent across the country to find one guy because good ol compassionate uncle sam thinks the titular soldiers poor ma has suffered enough in losing her other three sons is this a jokebut its a true story i hear you cry wrongo it may have been inspired by a true story but that doesnt mean that anything beyond the name james actually existed the words inspired by a true story dont mean a thing these days and let us not forget this is spielberglet us not forget indeed as stevie does inject some excitement and tension into the action set pieces even if they are overlong predictable and dangerously close to many a scene from many a war movie that came before it the final sequence falls on its arse before it even begins due to the hilarious ateam style montage that precedes it in which we see our applepie heroes create a stronghold from various items they find lying around a conveniently deserted village before the six or so of them defeat an entire platoon of those nasty germansperhaps the worst crime this film committed was being released against terrence mallicks the thin red line and subsequently taking the two oscars which by right belonged to the latter best director and best cinematographyryans privates pales in comparison not just to mallicks film as well as to spielbergs other classic manipulativetherapy session et but to almost every war movie i have seen cross of iron apocalypse now platoon all quite on the wetsern front even those which do not profess to be the greatest war epic of all time or even take themselves seriously mash kellys heroes where eagles dare the eagle has landed one great battle scene does not a great war movie make but try telling the academy thatbottom line dont expect more than a subpar spielberg offering and you wont be disappointed expect a profoundly moving war classic and youll be choking on your rage like i was when i left the cinema nine years ago,reality
between hobnobbing in marthas vinyard spielberg has as we know been trying to claim the holocaust slavery war and other ethical properties as his american own now there is an ambitionthe message for this film can well be construed as do what the general says because its the right thing to do feel good about agonizing over this question but do what the general says aka shoot and weep its an old my apologies fascist trick raise a genuinely important painful issue then sooth the pain with a quick unambiguous appeal to both duty and moral recognition the split between moral recognition and action here acts as the ethical seal of approval would we not all like life to be so simplesadly there have been other cases in more recent history where a similarly confident recommendation bear the pain of pulling that trigger with loyal pride seem to have landed everyone in serious trouble history may never repeat itself but spielberg is out to prove us wrongrating should perhaps be not quite 1 for awful but rather 10 for inducing shock and awe,reality
easily the worst movie ever made about world war ii and the normandy invasion on dday spielberg has taken the heroic story of the 5 sullivan brothers who lost their lives in the pacific renamed them moved them to europe and turned them into crybabies spielberg has said on tv that he never understood why america had to fight world war ii to begin with and this movie proves it the infamous first 20 minutes  was touted as a superrealistic hardline look at the horrors of combat hint look elsewhere such as in mel gibsons outstandingly raw combat scenes in we were soldiers spielbergs opening combat scenes are a dreadful special effects show and any viewer involvement falls flat for lack of either character development or contact with earth when fighting a war its better to not send cowards or airheads to do a mans job the same can be said for making movies about war spielberg ought to have evolved into a grownup at his age but so far hes just devoid of character and backbone this is sadly reflected in this dreadful unpatriotic movie,reality
im giving this movie 5 stars for its opening battle scene it loses the other 5 stars for being too stereotypical and clich first of all the actors all big name hollywood blowhards who have egos bigger than the movies budget was hanks character surviving the film because of forest gumps experience in nam and oh my god that lamoid matt damonwhat a joke the characters well did you know that every german infantry soldier was a cold heartless animal that held not a single ounce of compassion or humanity neither did i but thats what mr spielberg would like everyone who watches the movie to believe and what about the young american soldiers fighting this war in 1944 in the film they talked the way young people talk today this cant get any more unrealisticthe thin poorly written plot was just lucky that it was incorporated into film with spectacular special effects and incredible cinematography or else people would of noticed how thin and poorly written it was510,reality
when i first saw this it inspired me so much that i actually wanted to go back in time and invade omaha beach my point is is that this is without question the best war film ever created it is also steven spielbergs finest work of cinema he has ever created in his career he does a great job in honoring the veterans of the war and they deserve it because without them we wouldnt be here right now we would have hitler jr telling us to turn off the computer and go work and be a slave and whatnot and its not just that but the suspense when you can hear the faint sound of the tanks coming to ramelle and private jackson popping a hot one through the snipers scope my favorite part the sorrow and grief you feel when wade slowly stops living and the feel and sense of pride when the p51s bust the nazi tanks open and the germans retreating upham finally gathers the balls to pull the trigger this is a movie that i can watch over and over again and never get bored of it i will never forget about this movie in my life and if you havent seen it yet go see it because it will have a great impact to you no matter who you are,reality
this movie is one of the best war movies i have ever seen this movie is hard to look at if you cant stand gory scenes tom hanks plays his role extremely well in this movie along with other actors in here such as matt damon and vin diesel spielberg really got the costumes down pretty good as well as the graphic explosions of the tanks this is an adventure of capt miller and his crew to save this one pvt pvt this movie was made on the 60th anniverrsery of the invasion of normandy so this is the movie to see if you need to see a good ww ii movie another movie that might be enjoyed if you liked this movie is schindlers list,reality
this movie will rank in the top 100 movies of all time for years and years to come why because it helps shows war with real decency no one would want to watch a movie with only killing blood and gore no one really does this movie manages to let us the viewers watch virtually a firsthand take of what veterans went throughthe acting was phenomenal tom hanks was at his best yet with superb realism which he displayed good job to others tom sizemore edward burn barry pepper adam goldberg and of course vin diesselthe director steven spielberg directed the best movie he ever made this movie was unbelievably realistic i know that throughout this movie i did not and could not possibly think about anything that might take me away from the movie in fact the whole time i imagined that this was not a movie that it really occurredthe music director john williams made one of the best of alltime the beautiful piece hymn to the fallen soldiers raises the goosebumps from your arms extremely good job with that revisiting normandy and others also were profoundly beautiful the sound was amazing the sound of the tanks rolling warfare bullets under water etc really super sized this movie the sound tanks in this movie got me scaredthis movie clearly should have won best movie and best actori loved it and watch it once every month which i simply can not elude,reality
this movie is similar to the other stephen speilburg productions like the pacific and band of brothers these productions focus too closely on the individual soldiers sentimental personal problems combat strategy and the historical accuracy of wartime is significantly diminished with the slice of life theme adopted here consequently the poor screen writing matches the sentimental theme which is out of place for a wartime historical combat production was made using ideas from kellys heroes 1970and an episode from amazing stories about d day charlie sean and were put together to make a silly war fiction aka there is a scene in the movie where the squad of soldiers are seen casually walking in farmland of the french countryside near carentan behind enemy lines taken from kellys heroes the casual walk is grossly inaccurate to history it would have been impossible to stroll in the open french farmland near carentan as featured in private because the germans had sophisticated defense lines or belts constructed everywhere and where machine gun nests and large caliber guns were often placed at several locations to intercept the same targets which proved very deadly for the allies the squad would have been spotted and dealt with very quickly the allies had to use combined operations with tanks aircraft and artillery to destroy the sophisticated bunkers and dugouts the germans constructed everywhere the allies used high explosive shells to destroy enemy bunkers cluster bombs and special shells that would burst in the open air to kill soldiers caught in the openoperation cobra scheduled for 24 july 1944 was delayed because of deteriorating weather for 25 july 1944 however one squadron of us bombers which took off wasnt recalled general mcnair the most senior american general in normandy and hundreds of us personnel were killed when the squadron bombed too close to the operation cobra start lines is a silly wartime fiction movie similar to band of brothers and the pacific where there is too much emphasis with the soldiers sentimental personal problems the combat scenes recreated by stephen speilburg are devoid of combat strategy and historical accuracy the combat scenes in are just slugging matches i would prefer to have seen jerry bruckheimers productions of and band of brother and the pacific,reality
so overrated this film relies is saved by its gore and superb performances from tom hanks and tom sizemore i dont see what the deal is all about outside of jaws and the indiana jones trilogy he hasnt made an excellent movie in his entire career this movie is made cheesy by its use of a flashback to frame the story not only that it drags in parts by adding humor and trite dialogue where it should be focusing on the action i think most of the credit to this film should go to the director of photography the effect and makeup crew and tom hanks and tom sizemore too bad that stalker never made it all the way to spielberg,reality
when i first saw this film at the cinema i was like everyone else in the world blown away by the opening scenes and then mostly entranced by what followed upon rewatching it these years later the overall effect has been lessened by familiarity and possibly by being speilberged out after watching munich last week the battle scenes are still excellent  visceral terrifying and all too real  conveying the calamitous confusion of war in a way seldom matched in the movies when the action slows down so does the film and this often leaves you feeling a little disinterested as the characters lack of backstory and overly obvious attempts at making them look good woo ive saved a child boo ive been shot seem to jar with the realism attained elsewhere its still a cracking film though and the weaker bits have actually stood up better than the strong bits in my opinion although maybe im just more tolerant of schmaltz as i get older,reality
steven spielbergs masterpiece tom hanks most magnificent performance winner of 4 oscars unprecedented true to life combat photography dynamic 3 hour long story that elevates this movie into the best tribute to all those american soldiers who died fighting for freedom in europe during world war ii this is the ultimate depiction of dday when the americans freed western europe what a tragic yet glorious epic war classicthe story is literally about the rescueing of a private called played by matt damon from behind enemy lines tom hanks has to rescue the guy with a team of specially selected soldiers among which are giovanni ribisi and vin diesel their journey to find and rescue private is a long and bloody one but the true spirit of this movie lies in the fears and doubts in the minds of the soldiers this isnt a gung ho funny action movie this is how it really could have happpened with all the bleak and twisted soul shattering fears that soldiers have to conquer mentally the photograpy is stunning like i have never seen it before seen it many times now and it bewilders me every time how they have achieved such a level of true to life war combat photography even if you might not like the story which i would find hard to believe the action photography on itself is worthy of an oscar which it deservedly gotthe soundtrack is dark and glorious the sound effects are just sonically blasting my ears when the tanks start rolling editing is done with a fever pitch that keeps me glued to the screen i can go on and on about the superb technical skills with which this movie was made but the most important thing is that this movie has a got a pulsating righteous heart at its core this movie touches me profoundly only a few times during the last 40 years have i ever been this fascinated by a war movie incredibly impressive,reality
after scrolling through alot of the reviews i see you guys giving 110 here 110 therei asked myself how the hell can you be so ignorantor maybe the doctor dropped you on the floor when you came out your mommas womb was not only a well casted work of art it is one of the only movies to existence that visual provides the horrible anguish of war driven by an outstanding performance from tom hanks its brutalviolentand undoubtedly the most realistic demonstration of war we have ever seen on the big screen though this story in the war may be fictional the war in this story is not 910,reality
the 1998 movie is one of the alltime great war movies while much of the movie is a fictional account the premise behind capt millers mission is based on a true story that is the story of the niland brothers  edward preston robert and frederick  from tonawanda new yorkthe two middle brothers preston and robert had enlisted prior to the beginning of the war after america entered the war the oldest edward and youngest frederick known as fritz to his friends joined up in november 1942 because of the tragedy of the sullivan brothers aboard the uss juneau earlier that year the brothers were split up and sent to different units around the army edward became an enlisted pilot with the rank of technical sergeant of a b25 mitchell bomber flying in the burmaindiachina theatre preston was commissioned into the infantry and assigned to company c 22nd infantry regiment 4th infantry division robert and fritz both became paratroopers robert served with company d 505th parachute infantry regiment 82nd airborne division fritz joined company h 501st parachute infantry regiment of the 101st airborne division us army paratroopers are dropped near grave netherlands while livestock graze near gliders that landed earlier this was the beginning of operation market garden during world war ii which resulted in heavy allied losses as fate would have it three of the brothers found themselves preparing for the invasion of mainland europehowever before the brothers could start their great crusade to liberate europe edward was shot down somewhere over burma he was listed as missing in action but this usually carried a presumption of death at the time especially if he had fallen into the hands of the japanese then in the early morning hours of june 6 1944 robert and fritz joined over 23000 allied paratroopers in cracking fortress europe although fritzs unit 3rd battalion 501st pir was supposed to be the division reserve the misdrops meant they were thrust into action in ad hoc groups these forces were able to secure vital causeways bridges and locks allowing the 4th infantry division and niland brother preston to exit utah beach later that day us soldiers of the 8th infantry regiment 4th infantry division move out over the seawall on utah beach after coming ashore other troops are resting behind the concrete wall elsewhere robert niland had landed outside of ste mereeglise with the rest of the 505th as part of mission boston after the 3rd battalion was able to capture the town early in the morning the 2ndbattalion linked up with it to establish a defensive perimeter when a strong german counterattack came from the south robert niland and the rest of d companys 3rd platoon were left to guard the northern approaches to the town in a small village called neuville when two companies of germans came at their position they fought tenaciously to hold them off to buy time for their comrades to the south when the position became untenable robert niland along with two other paratroopers volunteered to stay behind and cover the platoons retreat toward ste mereeglisewhile manning a machine gun in the face of the german onslaught robert niland was killed in action that very same morning lt preston niland led his men onto the shores of utah beach as part of the seaborne invasion of normandy though casualties were relatively light for the men of the 4th infantry division on utah beach the battles beyond would be much tougher despite having made if off the beaches the men of the 4th infantry division still had numerous gun batteries of hitlers atlantic wall to clear the task of capturing the crisbecq battery which had already sunk the destroyer uss corry fell to lt niland and his men on june 7 niland led his men against the german position during the heavy fighting niland fell mortally wounded the rest of his unit was repulsed the battery would not fall until several days later to units of the 9th infantry division the niland brothers parents received all three notifications in a very short amount of time their only condolence was a letter from fritz informing them that dads spanishamerican war stories are going to have to take a backseat when i get home fritz was unaware of the fate of his brothers when the war department received word of the tragedy orders were dispatched to return fritz niland to the united states that task fell to the regimental chaplin father francis sampson sampson located fritz who had been searching for his brother in the 82nd and began to paperwork to send him home returning to the united states in 1944 fritz served for the remainder of the war as an mp in new yorkthis article was written by james elphick and originally appeared on wearethemightycom,reality
the movie is awsome i love telling friends about world war ii because most og them just joke about the war and the story of normandie is the battle i am most interested in and when i saw it was a special movment i loved the movie in the first 5 mins the movie gave me a picture of how the war was it gave me a picture of what omaha beach mite have been like but it also gave me a picture of real brotherhood i have said to all of my friends to see it because it really good i love the movie and i hope the people that watch the movie is gonna love it just as much as i did and do,reality
i saw this movie in the theater when it was released almost 20 years ago this is what i recall the first 20 minutes were pretty powerful after that not a particularly interesting innovative or witty script but still mildly entertaining considering its length what i remember most though is that the characters and some dialogue were clichsdone over and over through the years in american war films one guy is very scared another is super violent etc i dont remember the details now its been too long but i absolutely cannot forget sitting in the theater thinking wow this is pretty bad  is it going to get better strip out the first 20 minutes and the multi million dollar price tag mostly special effects expensive sets and pricey actors and what you have is an average 1950s war filmim not a spielberg hater i thought duel was fantastic i loved et as a teenager and schindlers list as an adult ive seen many of his films i cant say im a huge fan but hes obviously talented i just dont get the accolades given to this film,reality
itd be implausible to think that anyone who wasnt involved in world war 2 could ever understand the true horrors or hardship the men and women of the time went through in that terrible time over the years weve had countless documentaries novels movies games and tv series that have looked to offer an insight into what it felt like to be a part of the world war that claimed millions upon millions of lives and arguably the most visceral and heart pounding take of them all is steven spielbergs incredible saving privatea film unlike anything spielberg had made before or has made since with its as close to real opening stanza on the beaches of normandy and journey culminating in a speaker shattering finale in the crumbled ruins of the city of ramelle is a downright masterstroke of movie making craft that to this day near 20 years on from its initial release has lost none of its impressive and heartfelt powerspielberg accomplished his impressive feat by surrounding himself with the cream of the crop of filmmaking wizards employing the services of now famed cinematographer janusz kaminski who singlehandedly reinvented the way in which war films and action in particular was shot the keen eye of long standing editor michael kahn the screen writing abilities of the patriot scribe robert rodat and of course the musical accompaniment of a john williams score had at its disposal the ateam of hollywood and it showsall around is quality pure unbridled grace and confidence that fills the films every frame and it extends to its eclectic cast of established and atthetime up and comers which was led by the almost never better tom hanks after hanks leading man captain miller we have ed burnss cocky reiban barry peppers religiously inclined sharpshooter jackson the late tom sizemores gruff horvath adam goldbergs wisecracking mellish and jeremy daviss jittery language expert upham its a great team and when you throw in giovanni ribisi vin diesel and of course cinemas most rescued matt damon with added bit parts by a one armed walter white in the form of bryan cranston a slim lined paul giamatti a noncsi ted danson and even a baby faced nathan fillion acts as a whos who of recognizable actors that each for a small period or large period made sure the film was one of the most wellacted of the modern erafilled with heart stunningly filmed sequences of confronting warfare and a cast of memorable personnel is one of a handful of quintessential war films that have managed to somehow in various states capture what it may have been like to be among the countless wars that have raged over our planet in years gone bya deserving oscar winner that in many ways can be seen as a faultless exercise in big budget filmmaking and the perfect example of a men on a mission movie done well is one of if not the greatest film in steven spielbergs outstanding and loaded filmography5 greased up socks out of 5,reality
this is one of my favorite movies of all time is about a captain in the us army during world war ii who must risk him and his mens lives to rescue a soldier who has lost his three brothers growing up i was so fascinated with ww2 i read about all aspects of it so i had a pretty good idea of the horrors of combat but i got a very clear look at war with this movie the 20 minute opening of us soldiers storming the beaches of normandy is outstanding steven spielberg captures every bit of gore and and violence with young boys crying for there mother soldiers losing their limbs men having to muster every ounce of courage to survive the hell that is war with amazing cinematography and sound that puts the audience right in the battlefield we are shown how war can make even the manliest man weep like a child and what each soldier believes in and what they fight for for me there are a few scenes that make the movie great obliviously the beach scene is one of them after wade dies from the machine gun nest there is one german soldier who survives and the men let out there hate and rage on him forgetting what is the right thing to do the men have been so damaged by combat they then fight with one another whether letting the german go or not the other scene is in the last battle upham is responsible for bringing ammo to mellish but upham is so frozen with fear and when mellish is fighting hand to hand with a german upham is outside and able to save mellish but stays on the staircase crying and when mellish is dead the german wouldnt even kill upham this movie does a flawless in showing the terrible effects war has on humans this movie is so realistic that when it was released in theaters the army had to create a hotline for war veterans with post traumatic stress disorderconvinced1010,reality
as a younger man 22 ive grown up in a society was molded to fit babyboomer selfcenteredness  so perhaps i shouldnt find this film surprising  but i cant stomach the idea of another generation of people following their twisted view so here goesno matter how much you want to stoke your own ego there is no way that you can realistically equate the men who fought and died in ww2 to yourselves give up  this film is a terrible blow to our veteransspielberg tries to make the soldiers seem like theyre the same as you and me but they werent  all of the introspective musings in this film would make you think that these guys returned home after the war and started discussing sartres in their local coffeehouse  these are 40s people who are portrayed thinking like 90s people  at least in thin red line the film made no effort to portray itself as a truetolife salute to those soldiers  thin red line was a juxtaposition of a ww2 backdrop with vietnamera sentiments and it made to portent of being anything elsethe ww2 generation didnt feel this ridiculous desire to explore their feelings and share them to the point of fault  they didnt have to connect to their fellows on some mystical spiritual level  the entire war did not revolve around them as individuals nor did they feel the need to ponder some existential connection to the war around themthis film is simply another attempt by the babyboomer generation to prove that they are as good as any other generation before them  this is their selfcentered mythos  if a film actually showed the superior qualities of these american soldiers it would destroy that myth  in truth the american people felt a duty to their country back then  and they did not feel the need to wax philosophic at every turn in some attempt to justify the worlds existence in the face of how inconvenient it may have been to their own selves  this contemporary psychobabble had no place in their lives and spielberg had no right to put it thereas for the characters who dont partake of this attitude they are so paper thin that they add nothing to the film except to exacerbate the problem by making the mystics and coffeehouse types seem the more realisticif you have any respect for america pass this film by,reality
im a huge war film buff especially ww2 and this in my opinion is the best of them allthe thing that made this movie great for me was the realism and feelings for the characters you actually feel for them which imo only a few war films seem to bringthe opening sceneomaha beach i would rate up there as one of the greatest scenes in movie history the realism the camera swaying all over the place going in and out of the water the bullets whizzing past and the screaming its just bloody amazing and so full on that it cant be toppedi have watched this movie countless times and it still never gets old to me1010 a memorable movie that is a must see,reality
from the invasions on omaha beach dday to the final battle in ramelle this movie was as action packed and graphic as possible anytime spielberg and hanks team up its pure gold especially this time personally i was on the edge of my seat during the entire duration of this movie if youre a war movie fan i guarantee you that this will make the top of your list this is as real as war can get on a tv screen war movies completely changed after this film was released in 1998 it has influenced the film industry as much as any other movie out there in my opinion this is spielbergs best work ever as well as hanks there are so many realistic parts of this movie its insane after all it is based on a true story people said that the dday scene was so accurate it might as well had been real when it comes down to it this film is one of the most iconic films ever and arguably the best war movie ever created,reality
great movie was made by real actors and very professionals  it very wealthy icon that express courage war  and sacrifice for good purposes  each actor in this movie did a good job acting with all their possibilities  tom hanks as always did perfect dramatic performance  he succeeded to have our attention throw the war the motion picture was new to our eyes and graphics was made with great effort  it was quite well this whole movie was great in writingacting and directing ,reality
war is hell this movie rocked the opening scene of the movie was the best on the omaha beach the action kicked ass and the battles of the entire film was phenomenal but not only that the plot was as great as can be about capt john miller and seven soldiers looking for just one other soldier who all of his brothers were killed and return him back home the movie was also deeply sad and i kept feeling sorry for the soldiers and i always felt that i wanted to just go into the movie and fight for us this is the best war movie of all time and it will remain the same unless some other comes up and overpass it but for now this is a masterpiece1010highly recommend,reality
i went to see twice in the theatre i was very impressed the first time i saw it and the battle scenes were so haunting that i felt it would be worthwhile going again while i again enjoyed them they obviously did not have the same impact as when seen for the first time and this caused me to give greater attention to the remainder of the film it didnt hold up welli feel it would have been best for spielberg to have begun this film right off in the boat no advance warning no sentimentality it would have been perhaps the most amazing first scene in cinematic history but he had to overdo it the first graveyard scene can be accepted though it is undesirable but the second was insulting not just to me but to the film itself and the message it had attempted to convey he can understate well as the scene in which mrs is told of the fate of her sons provesthe rule which is so often broken by film makers today is dont tell show but they are so used to talking down to the audience that it is seen as desirable and normal i see it as manipulative and condescendingit also seemed as if i could actually see the seams in the movie the transition from one scene to the next it was obvious that it was written yes of course all screenplays are written but a truly good film can draw you in to the point where it is reality spr did not do that for me im sure there has already been sufficient comment on the stereotypicality of the characters and of course the scene in which there is an argument over whether or not to take the child along with themthere is a sense in which films like this are protected from artistic judgment because it is felt that the message they are conveying is so important i believe this is part of the reason it has received as much praise as it has while the battle scenes and cinematography are truly magnificent those things alone are not enough for a film to be considered the greatest film of all time nor even the greatest war film of all time,reality
the movie had incredible special effects and entertaining scenes however the movie is full of halftruths lies and propagandatruths there was a us british and canadian led invasion of normandy france in june 1944lies there was no private called who lost his two brothers however there was a airbourne soldier lost for 18 days behind german lines however he rescued himself after walking into us lines no one set out to rescue him and there was no giant battle in the fictional town of ramellepropaganda in this movie besides the opening scene in which hundreds of us soldiers were slaughtered on omaha beach the average us soldiers kills 50 german soldiers gets shot falls over dramatically in slow motion with stupid opera music playing then pulls out his pistol and kills another 50 germans and then dies dramatically saying something stupid like tell my wife i love her in this movie a platoon of 20 us soldiers takes out 100 german soldiers 2 marder iiis and 2 tiger tanks with improvised weapons like wetsock bombs and molotov cocktails real history accounts show that this never happened if your into entertaining and action packed war movies then this is totally your thing a great movie however 98 inaccurate when it comes to history,reality
to borrow from one of the more absurd lines in the movie maybe getting the dishes out of the way would be the one decent thing we managed to pull out of this whole godawful mess id have expected the producer of schindlers list to know better than to allow the actual line i reference to remain in a story about wwiiby the way having failed to have the good sense at the first one i certainly should have walked out at the second portrayal of a soldier on deaths door crying out loud for his mother as battle raged around him best war movie indeed in my opinion even if hadnt been irritatingly implausible it still would have been plain silly,reality
i have read most of the comments about spr and i must say i agree with those who resent and loathe the film i went to see it last week and i was terribly disappointed i was disappointed mainly because of the 1 the sentimental awkward frame 2 the vomitinducing score 3rotten dialog 4 moral hypocrisy but most of all i was disappointed by the predictability of the plot we all know from the beginning who will die and how it is no surprise that tom sizemore dies last followed by hanksmaybe this is the lovestory of the film when the best buddy dies hanks literally throws himself at the bullets american films dont really need women basically its all about bonding in the forceful wilderness if it isnt indians its germans and the rest of the world doesnt exist not even in europei know these comments may be a trifle vengeful or sarcastic but i love movies i am not one of those freaks who only watch french films and thinks everything else is crapbut i hate to be disappointed when ive had such great expectations i totally agree with the comment on the motivations of the geek character shooting the runaway german what was that all about wasnt the point of his release to show that the geek was more humane than the rest of them the knife scene seems rather erotized to me two men so close to deathand not the little one i may addand penetration whispering slowly slowly in german i find this extremely disturbing where does this fit in i dont have much else to say but i have lost my faith in spielbergs abilitieswhats the point of having a sniper citing from the bibleas far as i am concerned he hasnt made a thrilling scene since dreyfuss built that mountain in his living room in close encounter and that moment is far more realistic than any scene in spr  what is the difference between this film and other violent films that earn money the plot structure is exactly the same the characters are the same the music is the same the moral is the same pasted nicely to a waving american flag the only difference is that something similar so realistichappened in the past if people can become wealthy this way i have given my support to spielbergs bank account for the very last time the best war film ever made is still stalingrad but i guess no american will know this before someone makes an american version all i can say is  i hope it wont be spielberg,reality
why was this loved by all critics why was this loved by the academy why was this loved by anyone i think that this is possibly the worst movie i have ever seen steven spielburg remains to be the sappiest director of all time there was absolutely no point in showing the dday invasion at the beginning of this film there was no point to a lot of things in this film sure this film was realistic but i could care less about realism as long as the rest makes sense there were scenes in this movie that came out of nowhere for no reason besides a bunch of nonsense scenes this movie has a plot that drove me insane the us government risks the lives of 8 men to save one so that his mother wont be too depressed the worst part of the entire film however was the showing of private as an old man in the cemetery people were expected to weep through this entire movie i just wanted to leave but i stayed thinking itd get better boy was i wrong,reality
i was impressed by the brutal battlefield depiction which started the movie and im sorry to say its all downhill from there there was even a very appropriate moment of black comedy when the soldiers shoot the surrendering germans but not five minutes later they introduce clumsy private comic relief and for me the movie was over everything from then on seemed a pale clich of every other war movie ive ever seen and i havent seen all that many ooh the stars went through boot camp was i the only one who noticed how loud obnoxious and unorganized the troops searching for private were they would have all been dead in seconds oh yeah very realistic,reality
having read all quite on the western front just before seeing this movie i found a sour taste in my mouth while watching  to tell a story that so clearly dehumanizes the enemy in this day and age is shameful  it is to me propaganda  despite fighting for the side of the nazis most german soldiers were just people  we proud americans were just as evil and just as exploited during vietnam  until people stop believing that we are justified the holocausts will continue  to see a much more interesting film about wwii try midnight clear with ethan hawke,reality
how could such a movie get any academy award on the one hand spielberg did a great job with this movie but on the other the story is pure sh it is even not an antiwar movie because at the end the american soldiers are represented as heroes it is simply not true that an army especially the us army cares about a mother who loses their sons in the war they just dont care about it in the reality,reality
when i first heard of i was very exited since all my friends said it was an awesome and realistic war film the truth was far from that the first 5 minutes of the movie were excellent but it was all downfall after that since the storyline doesnt make any sense at all why in gods name would the us army send a small group of soldiers after a single soldier who is lost possibly behind enemy lines possibly kia or captured the whole operation would be a total waste of men and equipment also the rangers did not operate in such small groups on special missions and the lack of any intelligence ofs whereabouts would make the operation a waste of time also the germans dont seem to have any sort of intellgence this kissed good bye to realism alongside the 10 dead germans to 1dead american rule when an american is hit he dies usually slowly and dramaticly saying something like take this letter to my mother  etc etc when the enemy dies quick and is rarely or never injured the portrayal of the enemy is ridiculous the enemy doesent have a face a personality or any feelings the enemy is just a sadistic and evil killing machine does not differ from old propaganda films made during and slightly after the war the reason i gave it a 5 was that it had some decent action in it but movie is overwhelmed with spielbergsamericans propaganda i would not call this movie realistic under any circumstances in short good  first 5 minutes on the beach some good action scenes bad propaganda pointless storyline,reality
the greatest war movie ever  come on folks who are you trying to kid while spr is certainly a technical tour de force in emotional spiritual historical and narrative terms it stinks for the same reason most of spielbergs films with the exception of schindlers list marvellous stink  the man has no vision and little or no artistic integrity  why else does he churn out rubbish like jurassic park ii ill tell you why  moneyspr is dishonest silly and trite an insult to the men who died in the real dday landings  the story premise as others here have pointed out is risible the framing device unnecessary and stupidly sentimental  how anybody over the age of 9 can rate this film higher than genuine masterpieces such as paths of glory all quiet on the western front or cross of iron is beyond me  still a lot of people who visit this site think star wars and lord of the rings are the greatest films ever made which probably explains somethingwatch the first 20 minutes and then switch off  pants,reality
what a poor film it just consists of two very long battles with a weak plot linking them together  i didnt relate to the characters and didnt care that tom hanks was a teacher  so the battles were graphic and show the horrors of war in detail but this doesnt make a filmmay be my history lessons were wrong but i thought that there were more countries on the allied side than just america,reality
ive been put off writing this review for many years because i feared it would turn out to be a negative pile of invective directed against a man whose work i have largely admired for many years now though ive mellowed and with the film coming up to 20 years old and there being already more than 2000 reviews already on this website im confident nobody is going to waste time reading this review anywayso what can you say about the first 25 minutes probably the finest piece of action film making ever this opening ruined every war film i saw before and every war film ive seen since nothing comes close apart from bob of course exceptional and for me that is the strange thing about this film  part of it fills me with rapture while other parts make me cringe and irritatedbut lets get onto the story well im no military expert but sending a handful of men some of them high value experienced soldiers out into the french countryside to find a unit with a certain individual in it  well im not sure i buy it no the story is weak and disappoints as do the over familiar characterisationsalright then we move onto the inevitable and the source of all the carping from all the other nonus reviewers of this film  the lack of representatives from other allied nations well the answer the great man gave is very much the same as many defenders of this film provide on this website  that this is a war film concentrating on the us sectors and their german adversaries sounds reasonable enough  doesnt it its also sound film making as well as keeping it simple ensures audiences dont get confused with all those different uniforms and dodgy accentsthe only problem well only if historical accuracy of real events bothers you is that historians tell us the demarcation between the sectors wasnt that clear cut as james holland of cnn states by quoting the actual resources provided respectively by the us and the british if you were a gi there was a very good chance you would leave the english coast in a british royal naval vessel you would more than likely transfer into a british royal naval landing craft if you needed air support it would be almost definitely provided by the british royal air force or royal canadian air force while the night time air drops apparently deposited paratroopers all over the place and not necessarily where they should be remember this was the reason given for not knowing where was the statistics tell us this these are facts so although it is possible a yank could fail to encounter a limey canook or free french on june 6th 1944 it would be very unlikelyim reminded of an interview the great man did to promote the film in the uk for the bbc when he was challenged about this point he gave the example of the dambusters as a british war film that just concentrated on the double header of brits versus germans sorry steve not a great example unfortunately the young interviewer either didnt know his war films or didnt fancy irritating his esteemed intervieweethe dambusters features australians new zealanders south africans and rhodesians along with the englishwelshscotsirish theres a scene where they are selecting crews for the mission when colin todd as guy gibson exclaims hang on dont forget the english even the jingoistic extravaganza that was the 1969 film the battle of britain included a polish fighter squadron in recognition of the brave and resolute contribution they made to the defence of the ukthere is also a plot problem with omitting allies from the story in that you have nobody to portray as inferior incompetent and cowardly tick as appropriate to compare with your own brave square jawed heroes think the hurt locker and those useless brit mercenaries you dont want your enemy appearing pathetic evil yes but they have to be a worthwhile foe to legitimise the struggle towards victory so this film tries to get around this restriction by including a dig at the british general montgomery the overall planner of operation overlord dday but not a man universally popular even within his own nationwhile it is entirely realistic that troops from one army criticise the performance of another the way it is done here  out of the blue exposition and with no supporting evidence exposes this line for what it actually is a cheap shotso perhaps these facts explain why many reviewers have been disappointed about others nations exclusion in order to allow us audiences to identify with the film and others around the world some french and germans both have their own reasons for depreciating the role of the british but thats another contentious point history has been bent for commercial purposes to produce what looks to some including me a mean spirited and selfcentred productionthis film gets so many things right and gets them excellently right so the areas where they get things wrong stand out as really really wrong and that is the chief problem with this film it goes to great trouble and expense to present realistic events and situations for certain parts of the film but in other parts it is lazy and dismissivei wonder if mr spielberg was ever the slightest bit bothered by this international hoohah i wonder on cold winter evenings when hes at home polishing his knight of the british empire medal for taking advantage of the lower production costs in the uk erm i mean services to the british film industry he feels the slightest bit guilty of course not that is a ridiculous image cast it from your minds immediately he will have a professional come in and polish all of his awards,reality
this is a world war ii film about a group of soldiers who set out to find and send home a soldier whose brothers have been killedthe battle scenes at the beginning are very good  but thats the only good thing about this film the plot is ridiculous  the army wouldnt devote soldiers to finding and bringing home one ordinary soldier  no matter how many people in his family had been killed the film is far too long and a lot of it is slow,reality
the action scenes in this film are superb  gritty realistic and plain nasty however it remains a source of irritation that such good film making is washed down with an unhealthy dose of flagwaving patriotism what is the message of this film that occasionally you find something worth fighting and dying for or that its glorious to die for your country read owen for further comments on thissomething else it has led to is a number of american reviewers giving the we died to save your aes speach this itself is both stupid and untrue  the people who wrote those messages did nothing america got involved only when it was directly threatened by the nazis and not beforei am glad however that such views are in a minority from the american postings  its a pity that the many are tarred by the fewmillions of normal europeans died in this war  from bombings shootings torture starvation disease and the holocaust this film made only a token attempt to reference this  nothing morethe thin red line was a much better less commercial film with that very neccessary ingredient  a message  this one remains a catalogue of missed opportunities and a formulaic start and end,reality
in the late 1980s there was the vietnam war backlash platoon hamburger hill full metal jacket etcetera those of which were quite good and now in the late 1990s20002002 there is the world war ii backlash thin red line band of brothers pearl harbor etceteraonly what it produces is not near as high quality as the vietnam backlash the epic is no exception the usually great tom hanks gives a sour performance as does just about everyone else yet another bitter installment in the wwii backlash fad bud sturguess texas,reality
a wwii movie for people who have never seen a real ww 11 movie gross oversimplification of the facts highly unrealistic portrayal of the d day landing graphic violence to the ninesall in excruciating closeup shots and the most stereotyped nazis since mel brooks the producers film is good looking but like clint eastwoods flags of our fathers it just doesnt ring true but unlike foof which does have some truth behind it this one looks like it was made up as they went along tom hanks is ok in what basically is a noname actors movie spielberg spoon feeds everything to us like we have no brains of our own many ww11 vets criticized the events as portrayed while i was not there i tend to believe them saving pvt save your money insteadzero stars,reality
after reading some of the immaculate appraisals of this film i am compelled to explain why this film sucks sadly these days there is a declining number of people who can properly and objectively evaluate movies just as there are less and less movies worth evaluation first this movie did not win best picture why for a wwii epic from spielberg with this hollywood cast unlimited budget and the notoriety it speaks volumes about the movie itself that it did not win the movie had many aspects which merited praise but far more of it deserved our disdain and disappointment it is a shame that so few movie viewers can observe the following egregious flaws in a film trumpeted by most here as the best war film ever first let me say that the film had only one redeeming quality that of the battle scenes very impressive in every way thats it thats all its all downhill from here the main failure of this film lies in the fact that it does not draw in the audience there is no cohesion of characters zero empathy i did not care at all about any of the soldiers why mainly because they were all wellknown actors stupidly picked by spielberg and there were lots of them just read the cast of actors this is a huge distraction i cannot feel the soldiers pain and grief when they are all actors ive seen in movies and tv shows what a stupid boneheaded amateur mistake by spielberg every scene in the movie has a another actor i know pretty well and whose personalities distract me further all the actors seemed like they did not fit in the 1940s era they seemed too modern too anachronistic they used too many curse words which were not used in those days at least to that degree and were really cheesy they all seemed like actors not real soldiers and cheesy bad actors at that after watching band of brothers one can really identify with the characters all the characters not just the band but in there is literally zero compatibility with the actors they didnt flow together like fellow soldiers all seemed to be out of place hamming up the screen too much for viewers to take in again the fact that they are all wellknown actors and the cameos by ted danson and others made it really hollywoodish and corny essentially i just didnt care remotely about any of the actors simple another annoyance were hollywood touches like the cheesy prayer the sniper man made every time he aimed for a shot or the annoying jewish remarks actorcomedian goldberg made throughout or diesels toughguy mantra or tom hanks continuous confused look spielberg also displayed a disproportionate amount of antigerman efforts he made typical german soldiers not the ss out to be vicious monsters a lot of which might be true but the bias was very distracting in the movie seeing a freed german soldier return to kill tom hanks the one who freed him as well as the german who mercilessly and very slowly with a knife pierced the only jewish soliders heart as he begged for mercy and criedwas a very excessive and blatant antigerman effort by jewish spielberg upsetting mostly because it changed the tone of the movie in a very obvious way anyway the entire movie needed more development and the characters each of them were severely miscast it is an obvious hollywood production which lacks authenticity not in the action and special effects but in something far more important in any filmplot script good acting and empathy private misses the boat strongly recommended is band of brothers instead of cheesy tom hanks acting in it he directs and does a brilliant job the series is addictive and pricelessand it makes private look like a high school production thank god the oscars had the courage to deny it best picture but not enough courage to deny spielberg best director they wouldnt dare do that lol nuff said,reality
again yes again our friend mr spielberg does it  he takes a subject matter that needs clever acting and clever direction but rams it home like a 2 hour pop videowhy do people like these films the acting was awful the story was boring the script was something out of a 1950s b movie and people not just one but many are saying that was a great filmgo and see a movie that is cleverly made not just a five minute script that uses every clich in the book to ram home emotions and depth that arent there  i suppose this film appeals to the masses that dont have to think about a movie just accept it as arty as it had couple of drawn out sad scenes so it must be a masterpiecei wont bother to go into the racism in the movie the germans played as mindless morons that just walk into bullets and of course us stumbling europeans australians russians etc that actually fought through the entirety of the war010  awful,reality
overrated and sentimental doesnt have anything new to add to the genre retreads the wwii films of the 1950s and early 1960s films like to hell and back paths of glory sands of iwo jima porkchop hill the longest day the victors etc those films in my opinion were fine but i wouldnt want to watch them all over again thats how i felt sitting in the theater on opening day like i was sitting through each and every one of those films in the overwrought spielberg supplies his patented boyish sense of wonder something i believe is out of place in a genre that is often appropriately somber what im saying is i just want to see a war drama that appeals to the mind rather than the emotions a film like the brilliant introspective the thin red line,reality
this movie completely over rated dont get me wrong the acting is superb but its the storyline which angers me this movie favors the americans way too much i mean during the duration of this movie all you is is american soldiers and germans it makes it look as if the americans were the only ones fighting the warmy question is where are the british the canadians and the other various nations that were fighting this war long before the americans entered this movies storyline is completely ridiculous the american army would not spend that much time looking for one private they have bigger and better things to dofor historical accuracy it 55 although the props and costumes and terminology is accurate the entrance where the soldiers are scrambling for safety isnt americans did have air support but the american pilots were so bad at math the miscalculated and hit there own meni think this movie is a load of american loving bull and a real wwii movie should covers all the perspectives of every nation not just one especially not the one that came in at the last minutei say this as a canadian jtf2 corporal,reality
cut off the intro and the epilogue bits  start with the landing craft headed for the beach and end with the scene in the street and youd have a pretty good movie  i just resent it when spielberg pulls out some kind of emotional 2x4 to repeatedly hit me over the head saying feel this way ok now this way  lacks subtlety  i feel like im being very purposefully yanked around rather than being allowed my own reaction to the words and images,reality
the hype surrounding this film has been nothing short of ridiculous since the film is nothing more than a host of hoary old war movie cliches slapped on a cornball plot that would have been right at home in the 50s total lack of character particularly in hanks performance which relies more on the viewers perception of hanks as an allamerican guy rather than any kind of flesh and blood human the film tries to have it both ways war is horrible but hey we americans are great and kick butt especially against those nazi scum total manipulation from a master not that it would take much to root against the nazis but lets have it one way or the other shades of gray or black and white spielberg wants it both ways and what about the cheap tactic of using the old veteran who we later find out is linking back to tom hanks character how about basic continuity steve and the american flag at the beginning and end its as if spielberg thinks the audience is too stupid to know which side to root for one of the best movies ever made hardly not even a good movie period,reality

after schindlers list and amistad spielberg once again takes us to a dark path in one of his best works set during wwii dday he went through great lengths to make the film historically accurate though the movie is fiction much of it is based on real history at the same time he manages to give the film a soulit is not just historical events blood gore massacre bomb blasts and firearms but the viewer genuinely cares about the characters and roots for the platoon section to make it and feels sadness by the horrible death of each soldier alongside the director and writer credit goes to the actors for displaying a brotherhood where these ordinary men strangers to each other are brought together by a very unusual circumstance war can have a dehumanizing effect where people tend to get carried away and conflicts arise between the soldiers we see the men get more frustrated as their hope slips away every time they think they are near to finding when reality says otherwise but these men cope with it and move on furtherin a particular scene when private reiben is about to walk away miller for the first time reveals his identity his unknown identity had given rise to a lot of curiosity among his soldiers but upon hearing that he was an ordinary school teacher reiben is able to relate to that and he stays from then on he sees miller differently likewise with and miller and reiben and in one small subtle scenethere are two beautiful scenes one takes place during a night when the soldiers are chatting and they end up talking about their mothers in this scene wade tells his story as he slowly reveals how he wished he had spent more time with his mother the next day his brutal death devastates the soldiers fueling their frustration while they are forced to stay in control another wonderful scene is when an edith piaf song plays on the radio upham translates the lyrics and this amuses the soldiers and they are drawn into the song allowing themselves a moment of calmness it is such scenes that reveal the depth of these strong characterstom hanks arguably leads the cast as captain miller who is like the elder brother of the band this is one of his most restrained performances and he is great but his supporting cast members that include tom sizemore edward burns barry pepper adam goldberg and especially giovanni ribisi are at least equally excellent paul giamatti makes a strong appearance even vin diesel whom i normally do not like shows signs of a good actor as he impresses in a small rolespielberg makes remarkable use of kaminskis cinematography whether it is long shots jump cuts or various angles kahns editing is smooth williamss soundtrack fits the film the washed out colour has a harsher and rawer effect that stresses on the brutality of the war is not sympathetic to those viewers who prefer suggestive images because it is quite graphic and visceralfor me it was an overwhelming experience because i was so drawn into it many have criticized spielberg for heavily manipulating the viewers emotion well i prefer this kind of manipulation rather than the kind of effect melodramatic tearjerkers have on some people is a magnificent film its one of the best and my favourite of its genre,reality
considered by many to be a fantastic film i feel i must have missed something this film is certainly a good film by any standards the camera work is well done backdrops are excellent and the opening scene on the beaches of normandy is one of the most memorable in cinema history but the film does suffer from a couple of failingsfirstly it is strongly and unapologetically patriotic the film beings and ends with the american flag and the in fact the americans appear to be the only people in the film the only appearances from other nationalities are the germans and the only character seen is a backstabbing monster in contrast the american soldiers are all rough diamonds and each death scene for an american character is a tearjerking moment of sadnesssecondly the plot after the initial scene the plot becomes somewhat silly going increasingly downhill until the surviving half dozen characters end the movie fighting a battalion of soldiers and a squad of tanks i really dont understand how anyone can watch the end of this film with any seriousnessin conclusion id say that the only way this movie deserves the high regard it seems to have is if after watching the opening half hour the movie was switched off none the less i would recommend viewing this film as its qualities do outshine the flaws,reality
has to be one of the greatest films of all time and is personally my favorite movie ever steven spielberg has captured war as it really is all detail is considered to make this movie one of the most if not the most accurate war film ever created the actors performances are brilliant especially that of tom hanks this movie really focuses on each of the characters and the mind of a soldier in which many other war movies fail to capture after watching this film i have now gained a greater knowledge of what war really consists of and therefore gained a greater respect for those veterans who served during dday especially and in general wwii i would very much recommend it to anyone one of spielbergs best,reality
no movie will ever stand up to the ranks over just wow thats really all i can say flawless special affects definitely look real no other war movie goes into this much detail to a battle scene i can feel for the souls of those lost and sorrow for that poor guy with intestines hanging out screaming momma you think thats so typical but what would you scream when you were in his position crayola crayons ahhhhhh but seriously i sat on my couch staring at the screen 5 minutes after the credits were over shocked that the main character was killed but i liked it mostly everyone died trying to save pvt except wimpy clumsy umpham sp and reiben which was a little surprising but made sense the only flaw is that if you were a captain in the us army you would not blindfold the enemy and have him walk to somebody finds him 1 he could slip the blindfold off and run in the direction of a german platoon 2 he may come back to haunt youand if you just go out there and buy the movie worth every penny simply a classic and watch it youll know what i mean thats the only flaw i know of but it doesnt hurt the way i feel about the movie i just get this vibe that everything that happened in the movie just feels right and is perfect the way it unfolded will remain in my heart forever as well as millions of other this is steven spielberg and tom hanks at their best and everyone else who had to do with the slightest bit of this movie,reality
this was one of the first war movies that ive seen and it has to be one of the best steven spielberg has directed what has to be a masterpiece the movie is accuratealthough there are petty details that could have made this film better than it already is from the beginning of the film spielberg gives us a sense of the dramatic landings on omaha beach a view of the whole allied advance on normandy once the axis trenches and bunkers have been taken the way spielberg captivates each character within one another and yet be different from one another is superb i think steve spielberg has captivated the idea of brotherhood and comradeship which in turn has what i think led him to the making of the hbo miniseries band of brothers the cinematography has to be credited and the background music is fitting for such a film thats why i gave it 10,reality
i absolutly love this movie sure its a little gory but its a very well played war movie it mixes a little humour in with a very dramatic and tragic story it really captivates me every time i watch it is recommend this to anyone who likes a good story and can handle some blood,reality
when it came out was lauded for its realistic depiction of war and for its attention and sensitivity to the common man caught up in the sway of forces far beyond his control it was supposed to be a story about the men more than a story about the warunfortunately it was none of these thingsthe message of this movie seems to be that war is a very deeply affecting and moving experience as long as youre an american common everyday plain old american teachers as shown by tom hanks character are sent into the fray and forced to become fighting men we are shown however that the humanity of that teacher is still there even as he is fighting the evil bloodthirsy germansand this is where my problem lies how can a movie that uses cookie cutter nazis that treats german soldiers as simply the enemy even make the claim that it is a realistic depiction of war somehow only the americans in have a human component the germans conveniently having lost theirs compare this with the japanese soldiers shown in the thin red line and youll see that saving privates praise for being an understanding and sensitive picture of that war is little more than a jokenow im not saying i do not understand why the germans are depicted as so flat if i were jewish and had family members who had been in concentration camps i probably wouldnt be able to depict germans in anything but a dehumanized capacity either having said that however the dehumanizing of the enemy the labeling of a people and the flattening of their character and humanity is what allowed the germans to kill so many jewsthis movie is anything but a realistic depiction of the second world war,reality
with all the critical acclaim this got i expected it to be at least okay maybe it was all historically accurate but i didnt go for a history lesson i went to be entertained which i wasnt  it was like okay lets walk around  we still havent found the guy  now lets shoot and blow up some stuff  andlets walk some more after that  summation monotony broken occasionally with some real purty exploshurns,reality
amazing movie everthe first time that i watched this movie was in school and i knew that i had to get it for myself i love the way they had the affects of guns and grenades i cant wait for my son to be old enough to sit and watch it with me  i dont think any other movie about war would even come close to tom hanks and matt damon were a good pair and would be good to pair up again i recommend this movie to a lot of my friends they come back and tell me that it was remarkable then they tell other people to watch it i wish that i could shake spielbergs hand to say thank you for making an awesome movie and that im going to wear out my disc very soon,reality
i was born 9 years after ww2 finished and my father was a fireman in the midlands area of england during the war i do not know anybody who was directly involved in any fighting so therefore the only way somebody like me can be educated in what has taken place during any war is with documentaries books or a realistic portrayal of events in a war film i have read numerous reputable books and watched award winning documentaries about ww2 and viewed a long list of films featuring various parts of the war but nothing i had heard about this film prepared me for the opening sequence i doubt there is anyone on this planet who would not be affected in one way or another by it you can get a dictionary out and list the adjectives but those 22 minutes are infinitely more descriptive than centuries of books unrealistic films and fancy speeches the whole film is close on three hours and is and hopefully always will be an education for anybody watching for me this film should be regarded like a monument to all the people who have gone to war irrespective of when or where it took place or why it started in the first place i suspect that the real thing was worse than what is shown in the film but what is shown is graphic enough we have been killing each other for centuries but this like a select few other films lays it all out realistically i personally thank the director and the entire cast and crew for the result of all their hard work for anybody out there who has not seen this film please watch it and if possible stop reading this stuff i have written and lob the dvd into the machine and make your own mind up,reality
seen through the eyes of a squad of american soldiers the story begins with world war iis historic dday invasion then moves beyond the beach as the men embark on a dangerous special mission captain john miller tom hanks must take his men behind enemy lines to find private james matt damon whose three brothers have been killed in combat faced with impossible odds the men question their orders why are eight men risking their lives to save just one surrounded by the brutal realities of war each man searches for his own answer  and the strength to triumph over an uncertain future with honor decency and courage according to the films official synopsisonce again the steven spielberg and his crew of filmmakers climb to the top of the mountain and deliver a terrific motion picture this time its a hearttugging prowar significantly proworld war ii epic of astonishing power initially impresses with its violent depiction of the allies dday landing on the shores of germanoccupied france with waves of blood mr spielberg shows the human cost of defeating fascism  by what tv anchorman tom brokaw called the greatest generation although honestly every generation has its greatest this is a fitting termcaptain hanks and his squad  edward burns as reiben jeremy davies as upham vin diesel as caparzo adam goldberg as mellish barry pepper as jackson giovanni ribisi as wade and tom sizemore as horvath  are among the few to survive the invasion and are ordered to save mr damons for the reasons given above during quieter times the personalities of the men emerge with spielberg and writer robert rodat creatively painting human portraits the silhouette of the war mother dropping to her stoop as the military vehicle approaches is one of the films most simple and effective portraits it supports the films prime directivehanks and the men are a more complicated literary group of characters than they seem spielberg is obviously manipulating the story through them and their stronglydirected natural performances help make it work the films main message is delivered by schoolteacher hanks miller in his final words to student damons listen for them and dont miss the secondary message told by mr davies multilingual upham character especially watch how he pleads with hanks to set a german hostage free and note the consequences of their actionits tough to rank performances in an ensemble acting film theyre all stellar but for literary greatness youve got to add mr ribisis doctor wade to most memorable list he tells an incredibly introspective story about how he pretended to be sleeping when his mother would peak into his room note eventually ribisi goes home to mama also interesting is how mr sizemores horvath serves as the voice of spielbergrodat exalting and purifying hanks character he says both the films title and tagline except this time the mission is a manspielbergs use of flashback is one of the best youll ever see and he definitively defines the term gutwrenching decision  72498 steven spielberg  tom hanks jeremy davies matt damon giovanni ribisi,reality
i first watched this movie when i was a youngun it had an impact on me more than i could have imagined at that time i was still a kid then i wanted to join the army because i assumed that i could simply pull out a machinegun and blast everyone to oblivion this movie made me see the light now that im older and can understand films better i can fully appreciate the beauty of this film its gritty without being gruesome its brutally honest without overwhelming you its funny while it focuses on the drama its just plain brilliant it deserved every oscar it got and more in my opinion the cinematography alone is to die forall in all 1110,reality
i wish i could view this movie like the average moviegoer in that case i would probably have given it higher marks however i was in the army and know that dialogue such as is in this film would be highly unlikely no impossible to have been said in real lifethe hierarchy in the service is very clear privates do not contradict interrupt defy or in any way address their superiors as is depicted in this film i found a number of scenes to be pure spielberg fantasy the scene in which hanks doesnt provide the full name of the he is searching for which results in hanks delivering the wrong information to the wrong is hard to swallow the scene with matt damon protesting when told he is being taken off the front lines is also hard to believethe scene where oppem or whatever his name was protests against shooting the pow is absurd no way that would have ever happened some of the other unlikely aspects of the film tom sizemore throws his 45 caliber pistol at the german four soldiers pull the pins on their grenades and drop them in the tank turret yet none of them detonate the scene at the end when tom hanks starts firing at the tank with his 45 in real life he would have been dead by then after being shot in the back with what amounts to a high powered rifle the scenes after the germans bring their 20 mm cannon into action also didnt get very far past the gis first encounter with the fearsome weapon after it annihilates about six or seven gis from one short volley one wonders why the germans didnt make quick work of the rest of the gis after thatthe dialogue was also a bit too pristine for my tastes in reality gis curse up a storm these guys were a wee bit too polite and wholesome platoon gave a much more accurate account of how gis actually behavethese criticisms aside the action scenes are well staged and evoke a healthy pulse pounding for the viewer,reality
this is one of my favorite films of all time i can watch it over and over again it also has one of my favorite actors of all time tom hanks this movie should have been tom hanks 5th oscar but for some reason the academy has some bias against himmany people have said that the start of this movie is the most intense realistic capture of the invasion of normandy beach in addition the shooting of the first part of the movie puts you inside the action along with stunning 5 channel sound that places bullets bombs and screams all around youdoes not stop there there is plenty of action in this movie it shows many sides of humanity during the war and you even see the impact of all sides us forces german forces and by standing citizensthis movie to me was the best film of 1998 unfortunately 1998 was one of the most competitive oscar runs in history titanic shakespeare in love elizabeth and life is beautiful all competed that year and as always the loveydovey movies mostly win the oscar racesstill this movie was so great that it spawned a hbo miniseries that was equally great band of brothersthis is my favorite movie from spielberg,reality
spielberg mines a sullied gem with this bloody classic a family film i say a demonstration of brotherhood and integrity for me the decision to seek private based on the mothers loss simultaneously undermines and glorifies the honour of war and it is in this background that hanks delivers a compelling performance worthy of many rewatchesthe violence in this film is stark so many examples you can think of  from the escaped german prisoners revenge to the sockbomb victim  show the arbitrary nature of violence but the quieter moments between are tender and contemplative  fubar anyone not a realist film like platoon or full metal jacket but art to provoke like jar head and apocalypse now,reality
the first 20 minutes of this film is a brutal glimpse into the violence and complete uselessness of war we see people getting gunned down limbs getting blown off people blown in half guts everywhere it is not a pretty sight its this and many other things that make this one of the greatest war films ive ever seencaptain john h miller tom hanks and his men are sent on a mission to recover private james matt damon along the way many hardships are faced and overcome between these menthat is pretty much the plot but the movie is more than plot it is a journey through world war iis harshness and a journey with these men we come to care for these men they arent given huge amounts of development but they dont need it the actors really make us care for these people as does steven spielbergs skillful directing this is definitely one of his best moviesit is also a lot different if any of his movies contain violence there is very little of it this however contains some of the most graphic violence ive ever seen it truly shows the violence dirtyness and uselessness of war it doesnt offer anything but pain and misery john williams score also creates a very suitable moodthe only reasons i have for deducting the half a star is because of the very start and the very end the american flag flapping in the distance was a little too sentimental for me and i found it unnecessary45,reality
i remember when i first went to see this movie i was 14 and when i was going to turn 17 i was determined to join the army  u know spend the summer with friends learn new things meet new people and most importantly be a soldier for my countryall that changed in the first 5 minutes of this movie i have never had a movie impact me so much to all of you who are so full of yourselves that the only things you can say are so typical of american movies always making movies about americans or typical spielberg displaying the allies as the good guys and portraying the germans as the bad guys you people make me sick forget about your prejudice towards america just watch the movie and understand the message about war that its trying to bring out and for those of you who can honestly sit there and feel sorry for the portrayal of the nazis you are the reason i wanted to join the army in the first place to put people like you in your placeanyways terrific movie definitely set the new standard for war movies still one of my top 5 movies,reality
this movie is the greatest war movie ever tom hanks was a perfect captain and matt damon was such a great private the beach scene was such a great scene although it was pretty intense the way that steven speilburg directed that scene was truly fantastic another scene that was truly touching was when they had to tell the mother that her three sons were dead and they didnt know where her forth son was it made me feel like crying and im sure that all the other fans out there felt the same waythe ending is very dramatic but steven didnt go overboard when the old james almost starts to cry i felt the same way when tom hanks died that was the ultimate surprise or scene in the movie it was awesomely brilliant but very sad thats my basic overview and opinion on ashley,reality
will probably be remembered as a true classic the best war movie ever made that presented world war ii as good as possible for those who havent seen the movie  run run and dont look back go rent it and enjoy every minute of it the movie begins with the well known american invasion to europe in operation overlord at the problematic omaha beach never in filming industry had there been a better war scene so true so real making you actually feel like you are a soldier taking part in the invasion spielberg didnt censor what the war was probably really like by showing less blood less dead and less wounded in fact this scene showing zero regards to human life isnt just to make the viewers feel excited its true purpose will be understood only later after watching the filmfollowing the invasion cpt miller tom hanks gets another mission  straight from the top  rescuing a private parachuted deep in enemy territory after 3 of his brothers lost their lives in the war eight men rescuing one after the bloodsheded scene in omaha this mission looks rather stupid one life is it really worth endangering the lives of eight omaha beach showed how hundreds die like little defenseless mosquitoes how is one life that important without a doubt spielberg didnt randomly choose a mission to base a movie about this movie isnt just an action film it has an hidden message it shows that on the side of war with so much dead zero regards for human life we are all still human those who die at war arent just soldiers theyre men with lives desires needs  they have names brothers sisters  and each and every one of them counts omaha is war it presented it quiet good but the rest of the movie  well thats humanity suddenly one life does count and endangering the lives of eight looks rather right dont get me wrong the movie is all action true hardcore action the rest of the movie following the invasion escorts the small squad led by cpt miller as they search for one soldier private james in occupied france endless battlescenes action suspense  actual war i will stop here without spoiling any part of the film  this movie cant be described in words abseloutly amazing best movie i have ever seen  a must see although i doubt any true moviefan would skip watching this movie,reality
breathtaking spectacular incredible whatever words used to describe this film do no justice to what spielberg so masterfully created this movie is the only movie to have left me in awe in shock in sadness on all levels this film was perfect i do not know how historically accurate it may have been but i know one thing this is one of the most memorable films ever made and it should be recognized as the best war movie to date i am a proud canadian citizen but this film gave me a greater respect for what the americans were trying to do in europe i used to protest the fact that they joined the war late however this film has shown me that they suffered as great a loss as all the countries involved in that warthe film truly was an epic an epic that will leave me to think for some time,reality
thank you for taking the time to read this spoilers may be withini thought this movie was very very good one of the reasons this movie is so incredible is that it has the perfect combination of drama action graphic violence and my favorite no sex the omaha beach seen was so amazing and well shoot i almost cried because i felt like i was there and seeing my friends guts spill onto the sandi thought it was cool that they used the knife and a mirror to see what was going on those are just some of the reasons why this movie kicks serious ass negitave side it was too long and some scenes where a little pointless like how they got the wrong but it was still very funnyfavorite scene was the scene where the sniper shot the other sniper through the scope and his brains blew out the other side geniuscinematography review helped the movie seem much more realistic and helped you feel like you where there in other words the cinematography kick major ass you uneducated morons who are sick and wrongthe 2 words kick and ass should penitrate your thick skullsover all an amazing 4 over 4 or ten over ten,reality
take away the gratuitously gory opening scenes and what you have is an average war movie yes war is hell but just being explicit about what a bullet or shell can do to a human body isnt going to turn you against war personally i found this movie exploitativeif you want to see what the effects of the second world war were really like then ignore the movies instead check out the classic seventies series the world at war far more shocking and sickening than any hollywood blockbuster,reality
this film is absolutely the most realistic war movie ever made  some people have panned it because it doesnt show enough of the efforts of the other allied forces  it wasnt about the allied effort it was about  some people even called the allies the axis  how can you take their comments seriously when they dont know the good guys from the bad guys  tom hanks was remarkable as the ranger captain although it is hard to picture a forty something captain leading an assault team on dday 10 out of 10,reality
i heard so many great things about that my curiosity for this movie turned to pure shock as i watched it i have to say that i really do not like war movies so thats an obvious bias against this movie but there were sooooooooooo many things about this movie that just made it a laughing stock of me and my friends the cinematography in this film is simply amazing in fact id say some of the best cinematography ive ever seen but despite its technical excellence spr is a pathetic manipulative attempt by speilberg to make him feel better about himself the only character development in the movie takes place in the scenes before that particular characters death its happens in every case its like clockwork the ending is absolutely horrendously manipulative and in fact the whole story doesnt really make sense as a result of it spoiler alert  dont read any farther if ya dont want to ruin the flick for yourself at the beginning we have the shot of that old man at the grave then it closes in on him and his memory begins of what happened the only thing is that we find out the old man is really not tom hanks character so im wondering how has all these memories of the beaches and the rest of the movie theoretically shouldnt the memories start when enters the movie oh well i can see arguments against my point but the use of some certain camera angles really makes the point of saying that the old man is tom hanks i found this movie above all things even manipulative to be extremely boring heres another case of a movie that had a about a 12 minute story stretched out to infinity there are hundreds of little things that made me laugh about this movie in the wrong way and obviously i wont go into all of them but i do feel this movie makes the german armies look rediculous specifically in the tank scene there is many shots of the american soldiers running across open areas with dozens of germans shooting at them but they hardly ever get shot while the americans seem to hit somebody with every single bullet and three people with every explosive other humorous moments include tom hanks diffusing a potentially hostile situation by telling everybody that hes a school teacher and the weakpoetry lovingive never shot anybody soldier killing a guy for no real reason in the situation the performances were pretty good i guess but the script was so laughable that most of the things the guys say make you crack up no matter how well they say them if you wanna see a good war movie see platoon or if you hate war movies like i do and you feel like watching a war satire check out starship troopers,reality
its just hollywood after the beginning other movies are much better when it comes to the manuscript this one lack something like a story you can believe in sure for all americans its great risking many people to save one in order to not let one mother loose all her children but the other 812 americans who die what about their parents wifes girlfriends and childrenplease its has realistic battle and death scenes thats all,reality
this is tiresome hollywood propaganda that more and more people simply cannot swallow any more the myth of the good war the necessary war the war for freedom in which the good and the bad side couldnt be more easy to discernthis is a worldview steven spielberg would love to impress upon us but the narrative this film is based upon is rapidly being demolished as more and more people want the truth not myths about this horrible war that cost us so many dead peoplewhen will the likes of spielberg address the real root causes of the war when will they make a film about the bolshevik murderers who killed many millions of innocent people in the ussr the answer is neveri have to say i have zero interest in spielbergs propaganda i hate this film,reality
this was a piece of fictional propoganda showing how only the americans and i think the germans were involved in wwiiutter baloneythe series band of brothers put together by spielberg and hanks was tremendously real and honest their consciences must have been guilty over the movie they more than made up for it with the series,reality
stupid is maybe the wrong way to describe it but after hearing so much about it and reading here that its the best war movie ever i was sorely disappointedfirst of all the great exciting 30 minutes beginning nearly gave me an epileptic seizure with all that jerky camera movement im glad i watched this on dvd and not in the cinema because i could turn on the subtitles otherwise i wouldnt have understood a word of what the characters were saying because of all that bang boom explosionthe plot well the ridiculous plot has been discussed to death here by many others so i wont get into it the great surprise ending i saw that coming from the beginning but maybe thats because the movie isnt called but der soldat james over here that reminds me the germans when they were speaking german were pretty horrible i watched the original english version  i doubt those were authentic germans which is strange because spielberg usually thrives on authenticyfinally there was too much comedy especially that here i am james thing that was so weak for a serious war movie i can do with the bickering of the soldiers among each other but this movie was a bit overdoing it  its cool in an indiana jones movie because hey indys an action comedy but here it didnt work,reality
i have seen many wwii movies and this is not one of the greatest the opening 20 minutes are absolutely disgustingly brutal but the rest of the movie is a hackneyed rehash of so many better movie plots and ultimately we never know whether all the effort to save private was worthwhile was he inspired by his rescuers to be as extraordinary as those who died for him did he become a teacher,reality
the first several minutes after an introductory scene show a vivid description of dday on one of the beaches invaded by american forces anyone who has read corneliuss the longest day already has images like those in his head read the book its one of the best histories ever written  it starts the problem  theres too much of a jerkycamera effect  its acceptable in the battle scene but hardly in the rest of the movie rendering it unwatchable for people like mewhat i did see was a pretty fair fictional story based on a true story  of course a director like ss is hardly going to tell just a story but has an agenda hes working behind the scenes manipulating us into some snare or other where we have to accept his worldview on things  after all we just saw it  so it must be that way rightunfortunately i couldnt see enough of it because of the camera work to try to decipher his hidden agenda  i dont even know how the movie came out and frankly i dont care  cloying as ss is in all his movies this film is curiously unengaging and the characters show little advance nazi american gi from the indiana jones films which are still his best achievements,reality
read dedjims comments on this movie his are the best by far im sad to see that this sight is mainly a place where people come to express their thinly veiled political diatribes in the guise of a movie reviewthis was a great movie about sacrifice courage loss violence revenge folly and most of all the strength of character it took and takes to defeat evil the young people of that time defeated fascism and later communism their children and grandchildren would not have their character forged in a worldwide depression dovetailed with a worldwide war this reality explains much about the differences between the generations theirs was one of stoicism the ones that followed were less mature and generally lacking in accurate historical perspective  i say this as a retort to those who post on here mainly invoking their political bentsthis movie is a more accurate experience of ww2 than most movies made on the subject my next door neighbor for 15 years was one of the most gentle and humorfilled men i have ever known he never once mentioned to me that he was a decorated ww2 bomber pilot but he was he came from a humble background was wounded in the war lost many friends in the war and met his future wife army nurse during the war then he returned from the war and instead of letting his experiences ruin him and the country he and his compatriots helped rebuild a nation and a world i came to know him better after his death by talking to his family about the experiences he went thru during the turning point in history known as ww2this movie is a masterpiece made by one of the masters in hollywood,reality
overall this movie was well made i am not going to sit here and act like i know what happened over there because i dont this movie shows what the war was like through the eyes of the soldiers who fought in it it is a vivid and graphic portrayal of war during world war 2 the movie is intense but is important to watch the cast does a great job they put this feeling on you that is hard to describe in my opinion this is one spielbergs best films he does a great job of showing the intensity of battle between men the struggle for survival he also does a great job of adding some comic relief to make the film seem a little lighter this is one of my favorite movies because of the action plot and acting at the end of this film you might feel sad but not disturbed this film made me feel very patriotic and proud of the country i live in it also makes me appreciate all the men who went through so much in order to maintain world peace if you have a strong stomach and are a big fan of war movies i highly recommend this masterpiece,reality
this is a great movie if you did not see ww ii movies before  i have and this film is unoriginal  it is not that bad except the part with the jewish american fighting with the german over the knife  i never seen and american lose the knife strugle before in a movie  i guess that is why they do not make tj hooker shows anymore they have been so over done who would watch  in the end i like hanks but that is about it 410,reality
this gruesome bigbudget film from steven spielberg is saved only by its skilful direction i can honestly say that every single other aspect of this film was dgrade if you are looking for an excellent  modern war film pick up a copy of the shockingly underrated the thin red line spr is only famous because of its highly publicised blood letting the war scenes are highly graphic and exciting but it fails to shock us and reveal to us the true horrors of war  it is pretty clear that the writers took about 25 minutes on a sunday afternoon in between innings at the cricket to concoct this crap tom hanks the boring mainstream hollywood all american actor fails to please in this film same with every other film he has been in the rest of the cast are just as bland as hanks and fail to give us an interesting interpretation of their already pointless characters,reality
i have to agree this is really good historical fiction one note however there were guys on the beach that had what looked like a yenyang on their shoulder and on the back of the helmet which would be the 29th infantry division a national guard unit instead of either a diamond with a 2 2nd rangers which we saw or a 5 which we didnt see  as far as i can find only the 2nd and 5th rangers were in the first wave of the assault led by then ltc james earl rudder and thus there should have been no 29th inf at least not in the first wave  a couple of really good books on the subject is rudders rangers  the true story of the 2nd ranger battalion dday combat action and the liberation of pointe du hoc  the 2nd rangers at normandy june 68 1944  one thing that would probably suprise most people is that ltc rudder came onshore with his men and that his was one of the first transports to hit the beach and that he lived through it  of course he was a texas aggie that alone could be why his forces were able to succeed  read the books youll never watch spr the same way again,reality
blood dirt dying soldiers and others so scared that they are unable to move a dirty little war is going on and a great film to condemn war  well for the first half of the movie but what happens then turns out to be mr all american hero he doesnt waste a thought for his three fallen brothers he doesnt give a damn about his grievestricken mother she will understand  will she but insists on defending that little bridge after schindlers list and amistads not spielbergs best film in fact the second half makes private to any warfilm the pentagon or any other warministry in the world would be proud of just a little waradventure under the checkered flag what a pitty,reality
steven spielbergs is one of the those films that is a pure cinematic masterpiece  its gritty realistic and wellmade in every possible department  the film captured five oscars and probably should have won the best picture oscar for 1998  some things about the film that really stick out are the cinematography where approximately 60 of the color was faded from each frame the editing and of course spielbergs direction im not sure any other director working today could have done as well as spielberg did on this picture  tom hanks is also excellent  he is one of those rare actors who can dominate a film without dominating it in other words hes always there but he makes the supporting actors better  in many ways this may have been his best acting job ever  all in all is easily one of the top 10 or 15 films of the 1990s  its a film that will be remembered for decades to come  5 stars out of 5,reality
i will be blunt 2 out of 10 the only people who will rave about this are americans who have won this war but the first and every other war that has happened just watch u571 if you dont believe me and to think in really life and not films it was the british that got the enigma machine steven spielberg i would just like to say how believable the first half an hour was with the scenes on the beach someone as young as me can only imagine the horrors of what those brave men that is british australian french dutch etc went through in both world wars to me and the trenches of the first would be the most horrific these behind the scenes men would not care about one person and other men could not be spared to go and find him i know for a fact they do not as my great grandmother had to endure something similar in the first world war i also wonder if these script writers do any research or care about history the answer is no,reality
our veterans of ww2 should definitely be honored in fact for what they did we can never thank them enough they deserve parades memorials and everything else you can name unfortunately spielberg exploits our veteransinstead of giving us an honest story spr paints our military as fatherlike and loving the only true reason why the military would go out on a limb to save a person like is because if the story of his dead brothers reaches the public and the military manages to rescue the last brother they can pat themselves on the shoulder and all the newspapers in the usa will be swayed into making propaganda articles of how loving the military is in reality the army views a soldier as nothing more than a tool for winning wars spoiler alert and why were the german troops not humanized the steamboat willie character was shown as a human at first but later on he comes back and kills the jewish soldier in an awfully blatant  scene and later on kills captain miller i have news for you people who loved this moviethe germans who fought in ww2 were not nazis hitler and his nazis took control of germany and took control of the german army navy and air force just because franklin roosevelt was a democrat doesnt mean all our troops in ww2 were democrats and remember thisoscar schindler was a nazi but like some nazis he did not believe the lies of hitler and his supportersschindlers list was a truly great movie but spielberg has become a liar when he made this awful propaganda flick,reality
for people who say this is the best war movie i cant help but wonder if any of those people have some of stanley kubricks war films dr strangelove and the paths of glory imo are so much better than visually and technically is far superior to the other films but the story isnt a gripping story which feels like it has an very powerful message largely because its centered around ww2 which was a war which was necessary for the allies to fight in the more compelling films imo are the ones centered around wars and encounters which represent the costs of wars for little if any benefit id say that warhorse is a better film than toodoes display the real bravery and horrors of ww2 but that is nothing particularly new just about every ww2 film does that the main storyline of rescuing is what is the biggest turnoff to me the film even addresses the issue of their order to rescue its not smart to put an entire team of many people in danger in order to try to rescue one soldier in the middle of a battlefield many other soldiers die and even when found doesnt feel he deserves to be rescued he even insists that they keep fight off their enemy rather than leave right away my inquiry is that if our nation objects to too many family members dying in battle why allow so many of one family to fight probably my favorite parts of the film were the side stories not directly related to saving at all i like the story of the translator going from a coward to a killer i like the part of the film where they discuss whether its right or wrong to escape a nazi trap or put themselves and their mission at risk in order to spring the trap and of course the dday invasion sequence is incredibly powerfulthe film is certainly worth watching and many people its great but i just find it ok and certainly not one of the best war films i dont know if it would even crack my top 10,reality
ive seen my fair share of war films but its really surprising that ive waited this long to finally see in full what is probably the greatest wwii film ever made theres probably no amount of words that i could write that would do justice to what i feel like having seen this for the first time the only thing i regret is not having seen it on a bigger screen although to be fair i was 9 years old when this first came outthe plot as if anyone didnt know it by now is that an army captain tom hanks who just landed at normandy beach is charged with retrieving a private the last surviving of his mothers sons and returning him safely home of course as all of the characters point out several times throughout the film they run into a lot of fubar fouled up beyond all recognition situations and if theres one truth that this film gets at its that war is ugly original i know right still the call of duty is just as important to every single one of these men as is their devotion to each other they face a lot of moral quandaries and even make some questionable decisions but when it all comes down they have each others backs and the knowledge that completion of the mission will earn them the right to go home i cant really think of a stronger motivation than thatanother thing which this film does right is with its selection of story which also plays into the human element the mission isnt to take a hill or some other landmark its to rescue someone using wwii as a setting for this story allows the average person to really connect with it on a deeper level than if it had just been a typical war film with a large ensemble cast and by the way the cast in this movie is pretty insane granted there are many films before it the longest day is one example that comes to mind that did the same thing but the attention to character in this one sets it apart from the rest there are elements of clich but every main character is fully fleshed outthis film is also extraordinary for its cinematographic approach cinematographer janusz kaminski utilized a handheld style which puts you into the thick of the action and aptly portrays the chaos and confusion inherent in those situations this is also enhanced by a gritty look partially achieved by shooting on film last but not least there is an emotionally resonant score by john williams which punctuates the story at all the right moments yet is never intrusive or overbearing i also appreciated the diegetic use of the edith piaf song tu es partout before a climactic scene and which conveys to the audience the feelings of the people these men left behind in service to their country even though its a song about love lost and to be sure there were plenty of people who never came backoverall every single one of these elements including some i havent mentioned combine to create a brutally realistic and emotionally powerful depiction of war the heights of which has been reached by few and not just that it managed to do all of this without leaning too far in the direction of being pro or antiwar it presents it as is the good with the bad and doesnt demonize the enemy as so many films are apt to do hopefully this hasnt been too longwinded but this is an incredible film that deserves to be seen by everyone,reality
this film is a fantastic production with a quality cast you sure will not be disappointed watching this gripping film that is based on a true story many war films have been made but this is by far the best i have watched in a long time such a emotional film in which tom hanks could not be replaced by any actor if you like well made war films which are based on a true story and made to give viewers a lasting impression and something to think about than this film should be your choice also if you are a emotional person tears will fall the cast for this film has been well selected and suit their charactersyou will experience a authentic view into the life of soldiers who have fought during the dday landing in the normandy france,reality
this film gives you everything you could want in war film well choreographed battle sequences and some real human emotion everybody who has seen at least the first 10 minutes of this film then you know it deserved some kind of award just for that great depiction of the battle on omaha beach sure theres still 2 hours and 30 minutes left after that but it only makes the film better after the battle tom hanks and several men are assigned to a mission to retrieve private un harmed and return him home due to his two other brothers being killed leaving him the last son alive so now there is a good story for a war film and plenty of movie left for various battles subplots and all sorts of thingsthe film even without the battle sequences would probably still work thanks to the great emotional and raw scenes but it just wouldnt be a 10 this as you already know is definitely a film everybody needs to check out at one point your response to the film might be completely different from mine so you make a review and express your opinion youve acquired from watching the film thanks for reading my review and be sure to check this film out,reality
is one of the most pivotal moments in both steven spielbergs career and the war genre in motion picture historyit follows united states army rangers captain john h miller tom hanks and his squad tom sizemore edward burns barry pepper vin diesel giovanni ribisi adam goldberg and jeremy davies as they search for private first class james francis matt damon who is the lastsurviving brother of four servicemenmost notably to be said about the movie is the depiction of the omaha landings basically it was a war reenactment consisting of 1500 extras and 30 or so amputees spielberg did not plan ahead in terms of storyboarding but instead decided to place the camera where it was best suited for spontaneous reactions admist all the amazing locations and bombed out villages every soldier is relying on one solid emotion to get through the war hope which comes in the form of the missing private unfortunately that hope is tested as inevitable casualties will demoralise and divide the squadronthis film covers pretty much all aspects of war the tension nature and sadness of it all gets stripped bare as all stones are turned and the end result is one of poetic beauty however i never really found myself caring whether they found or not though the ending cant help but feel forced its certainly touching and has a lot of patriotism in mindfinal verdict definitely one of spielbergs finest i look forward to watching band of brothers 2001 and seeing what this man can do with more running time 910,reality
as the name suggests this a warmovie in which an agent named capt millertom hanks is sent on a mission to save a soldier named pvt jamess mother has already lost her three children in the same war against the germans movie starts with an approx 25 minutes of a thriller action sequence where the american forces are fighting against german forces at omaha beach director steven spielberg has made this scene one of the most epic real war sequence i have ever seen in a movie thousands of soldiers died in this horrifying dreadful sequence special effects by cinematographerjanusz kaminski also in schindlers list has made this a perfect sequence protagonist capt miller survived this war assembles a group of soldiers to invade german troops and find movie depicts the struggle of miller and his team to complete their mission movie becomes a little bit slow during the mission but still must be able to hold the audience togetherintense emotion scenes like whens mother is informed about the tragic death of her three sons might make viewers cry and arouse patriotic feeling in them movie showcase some good strategies teamwork breakdowns and courage all these things together complete this movie and makes it much more interesting than any other fiction movietom hankss acting has raised the bar of expectations further high steven spielberg has done one of the greatest job you will ever see realism in this movie makes it a must watch,reality
steven spielberg was the only directors name i knew for a long portion of my lifemainly because i was a narcissistic young lad and due to his first name i presumed he must be brilliantbut he spells it incorrectlystephen is spelled with a ph not a vanybody worth their salt knows thatis a lot like its directors first name  its a near perfect filmthe only blemish on this entire movie is the opening and ending ten minutes the two scenes featuring the old man revisiting the tombstones at normandy they are totally unnecessary to the plot of the film and hokey as all get outotherwise all of the narrative which takes place during world war ii is sensationalsure the scene where they storm the beaches on dday is a marvelous sight to behold but dont let that detract from the scenes that follow its all good stufftom hanks leads a cast of fantastic characters including edward burns tom sizemore vin diesel adam goldberg giovanni ribisi jeremy davies barry pepper matt damon dennis farina ted danson brian cranston and paul giamattiall deliver exceptional performances throughoutif youve been keeping spr in the back pocket like me let it out anytimeyoull enjoy this filmbut stop reading here im going to spoil a few thingsvin diesel is very good in this movie and it gets a little dusty when his character dies but it seems like there is some adr additional dialogue recording shoved into the scene directly precedingthe only portion of the movie that may ruin the suspension of disbelief is here when vin takes the daughter the scene is a bit unbelievable it only lasts a second but something is lost to the viewer i think the adr might be part of the reasonspeaking of when hes laying there and takes out the note for his father im almost certain there is adr because his lines do not match up with his lips or body languageanyway if i were to criticize that scene id be nitpicking it still gets dusty no matter what hes sayingto address my earlier criticism you might argue that the bookends the scenes in which we see matt damon all grown up having fathered at least two generations are necessary to provide redemption to the deceased charactersthis is a fair point but i dont think we need this kind of handholding i dont believe anyone would have wondered whether or not he went on to father children almost all of the characters are heroic especially private and we know that hes alive at the end of their missionthey are required to give him another chance and thats made apparent by his survival during the films climax the viewer can presume he will make the best of the life theyve sacrificed forbut this is all semantics leave the scenes in for all i careis a fantastic movie,reality
is a great film the films second scene which is based on omaha beach on dday really makes the whole film 1010 as if it wasnt for that scene i would have probably given it an 810 this is because of the action in the scene as steven spielberg shows a good example of what happened to the soldiers that day and what a struggle it was other than the dday scene the film is still amazing as it provides lots of drama such as the scene with the tense sniper game and the parents daughter being taken also the part in the destroyed town which is a big part of the story altogether is a spectacular film and i would recommend it to anyone,reality
a true classic and honestly my favorite spielberg and movie of all timestoryline the storyline starts during omaha beach were we somewhat meet are heros around 30 minutes in the actual story comes into play private jamess matt damon 3 brothers are all killed in the line of duty so captain john miller tom hanks and all of his crew are set to find him and bring him back homecharacters and acting the movie itself is powerful the characters are smartly written because they question the mission why would 8 guys go over and save 1 man tom hanks is as powerful as he ever is he portrays his character of a man who has suffered during times of war and his thats my mission speech always moved me in short everyone does a great jobother this movie is powerful and after watching it you want to take a shower and sing the star spangled banner because it is patriotic and it makes you feel proud and of course the first 25 minutes of the movie is so incredibly well done that it makes shakycam look like a masterpiece and this film is a masterpiece,reality
the fact that it didnt win best picture is outrageous it was great from start to finish the opening scene with the old man crumble in front of headstones is emotional the music score by john williams is amazing that image became the opening scene of directed by steven spielberg the film tells the story of a mission following the dday invasion the movie starts tom hanks as captain miller a soldiers soldier who must takes a small band of troops behind enemy lines to retrieve a private whose three brothers have recently been killed in action its a public relations move for the army but it has historical precedent dating back to the civil war his mission to find private james matt damon and bring him back to the united states so that it can save the familys bloodline and help softly the mothers grief some critics of the film have labeled the central characters stereotypes if that is so this movie gives stereotypes a good name tom sizemore starts as the deft sergeant edward burns as the hotheaded private reiben barry pepper as the religious sniper adam goldberg as the lone jew vin diesel as the oversize private caparzo giovanni ribisi as the soulful medic and jeremy davies who as a meek corporal gives the film its most memorable performance i understand the everyman quality of the average soldier there were also a lot of actors that you wouldnt have thought for once playing soldiers as supporting characters such as ted danson bryan cranston and paul giamatti who knew they would be playing soldiers in one of the greatest war film ever i like how the characters were written with everyday bluecollar joes it gives the movie realistic they are brave while scare good but also bit morally reprehensible a great scene toward the middle of the film represented the questioning of their own morals when it conflict the attitudes of the war when the group captured a german soldier all of them has to debate if they should just murder the man or set the man free its toward the middle of the film that the violence of the film dies down enough to get a few character development it was strong enough time to make them seem like people with the amount of screen time they got here some people thinks that the movie glorified war or its over patriotism i think some critics seriously misinterpreted this movie if they think it glorified war in movies that glorify war there are ridiculous outlandish characters that simply dont represent the soldiers who fought in war in the characters are downtoearthordinary this movie also shows that in war there are no heroes who are guaranteed to survive it portrays war as what it is violent and ugly as pure hell as for patriotism i dont believe that the film is patriotism there are scenes of american soldiers being as crude cowardly or just meanspirited as some of the germans soldiers i dont think the germans are portray unfairly about the fact that there were no allied forces shown was due to the fact that it is an american film presented to an american audience would it had been nice to see a british soldier in the film yes but it wasnt needed in the film the film made younger generations understand what happened that day and the sacrifices that were made in order to win that war while also telling the dangers and how bad the war really got the film was balance between pro war and antiwar themes yes there were a few historic accurates that wasnt corrected but overall many people have call this film to be the most realistic and maybe the best war film ever the first 20 minutes horrifically and realistically depicts the normandy invasion the visuals are grainy decolorized and filmed in a first person aspect that convey an adrenalin driven that been never witness in a war film before then and since after many directors have used for their war films the audio is astounding and actually had me flinching during the harrowing first twenty minutes of the film exceedingly realistic and recorded in perfect three dimensional positional audio that firmly plants you on that horrific beach landings after this movie came out i saw an interview with several dday survivors they all said that the invasion sequence was the most realistic portrayal they had ever seen it was like they were there again that is strong praise from someone who would know every teen aged idiot who fantasizes on war by playing console games needs to watch this film show them how it really was its not what it is overall it is a mustwatch its a story of normal average men forced into extraordinary and terrible situations due to war and how they survive it,reality
after the dday invasion of omaha beach ranger captain john miller tom hanks is tasked to put together a platoon of his choosing and find a paratrooper from the 101st airbourne named private james with the platoon of his choosing tom sizemore edward burns barry pepper adam goldberg vin diesel giovanni ribisi and jeremy davies sets off in treachorous wartime france to find private amongst a field of full of enemies and a split up 101st airbourneworld war i is often considering the great war or the war to end all wars but few military conflicts have caught the hearts and minds of the american and the world consciousness the way that world war ii has for the first time during a war films were made about the war as early as 1939 some of the greatest war films and tv series have been based on world war 2 from the sands of iwo jima to flags of fathers to band of brothers at the end of the 20th century with a career full of highly critically and commercially successful hits under his belt steven spielberg took another turn at the war film following 1979s 1941 with saving privateis arguably the greatest war film ever made the opening thirty minutes of the dday invasion is possibly the greatest scene ever committed to celluloid but its not just the harrowing scenes of war time that make this movie so great its the character building the camaraderie between the soldiers the devotion to duty and the bravery of these men in combat this movie truly depicts why world war 2 soldiers were possibly the greatest soldiers in us historyone of the great things about the casting in is the fact that they chose actors that look like everyday men rather than picking men that look like action heroes and because of that the acting in this movie is amazing tom hanks gives a wonderfully authoritative and still understated performance as capt john miller vin diesel hasnt been this good since and barry pepper as is sensational as religious sniper pvt daniel jackson even jeremy davies as the green cpl upham makes you feel for his character despite his very obvious flaws as a soldierthe one thing that drags this movie down though is spielbergs slavish devotion to sentimentality the bookends to the film are completely unneeded and drags down what is otherwise an utterly great movie dont get me wrong a former soldiers sentimentality for the ones who died to save him has its place i just feel as though that should have been more reserved for the former soldiers watching this movie remembering those who died with and for them then on the screen in this movie rather the movie should have just been devoted to remembering the bravery and camaraderie of the men who fought in the waroverall though in the scheme of things despite the minor flaw that i have with this movie it is definitely still the greatest movie in my mind dedicated to the men who have served our country i dont just recommend this movie if you havent seen this you need to watch it and now that its out on bluray this is the perfect time to pick up this movie and watch it or to watch it again455,reality
its been more than ten years since i convinced my mom to take me to see at the world premiere in 97 i was 16 and the movie had an r ratingneedless to say i had quite a surprise coming my waysince i was a kid ive always been fond of war history and i have read countless books seen documentaries and so on nothing however have ever opened my eyes like saving privatein this masterpiece spielberg puts you right there on the beach the excellent photography by janusz kaminski for which he won an oscar and amazing sound effects in the breathtaking opening scenes is probably the best sequences in a movie ever it really makes you feel like youre actually there in personwhere other war movies often glamorizes the soldier gives war that romantic hero touch hacks into your mind like no other movie it is rough chillingly brutal and beautiful at the same time it tries in no way to give you an illusion it simply tries to give the audience the feeling of how it was like to be therethis is where succeedsi dare say that no other movie has managed to put a given scenario into such a breathtakingly good movieas for the acting hanks does a fine job as cpt miller even vin diesel  mr testosterone  pulls of a convincing role as caparzo giovanni ribisi was for me maybe the biggest surprise of them all i dare say his acting style was perfect for the role of wadeall in all i cant find any war movie better and hardly any movie at all to compete from any category as for war movies apocalypse now is a masterpiece in itself but not even that comes close to spr in describing the brutality of wari used to love the idea of being a soldier after seeing this movie more than ten years ago i never dreamed of being one again,reality

is probably on of the greatest war films ever made along with paths of glory and appocalypse nowthe way that spielberg develops the characters throughout the film is very good my grandfather along with many other people who fought in ww2 would say it is very very very realistic especially in the opening scene at the beaches and the final battle at the endtom hanks is brilliant in it as well as the rest of the cast its brilliantly shot and very very well madeit shows what the life was like for a ww2 soldierand it shows the absolute hell of war and what is what like to be theremany people would say they cried at the end even men because it is just so moving to think how or why we do this and how could we have done this to each other and tom hanks last words made it even more moving it has beautiful music and is a gem of a filmi would definitely recommend it for 12 years and above and it should be shown to every child out there to teach them the reality of warif you havent seen this already go and buy the dvd now if there was a higher rating than 10 i would it a 100brilliant,reality
words cannot describe the greatness of this film hell if i type a long review of this film it might take away the films credibility so im gonna keep this review short sweet and simpleacting superb likable characters and they put you the audience smack dab in the middle of the war tom hanks is outstanding notable mention is jeremy davies who does a great job portraying the contrasting soldier uphamdirection excellent frenetic camera movement thrilling and extremely realistic action sequences spielberg is masterful as always he manages to show the audience how nightmarish war really isstoryscreenplay storywise it is uplifting and inspiring and during historical moments it is accurate and realistic screenplay slips into sentimental state during times but wed look over thatcinematography mesmerizing at times we look at the horrors of war with the nightmarish there goes that word again display of a blooddrenched beach and wartorn cities the color modification really helps the effectiveness of the cinematographymusic is put into places where it should be john williams does a fantastic job once againoverall in short definitely in my favorite movies list and on the critical side one of the greatest movies ever made this film deserves to be owned and watched by film lovers996610delton,reality
ok first off let me be clear on a few points i rarely if ever write reviews second i am not american im a proud canadian im not enlisted in our military nor am i a veteranhas turned out to be in my opinion one of the most moving films in the last 40 years so realistic that veterans of the war and in particular operation overlord or operation atlantic for the canadians participation on june 6 1944 have a hard time watching the movienow the events that the 8 soldiers in the movie participate in are an amalgamation of several different events that happened to different people throughout the real war while charlie company 2nd rangers battalion did participate in overlord they were at pointe du hoc not omaha beach as depicted here the rescue of sgt fredrick niland was not done by a group of rangers but rather by a french chaplain bridges were a common point of contention and it was not unheard of to see a small group of soldiers defending such an important transportation arterytakes these events and more and weaves them into an incredible story of the courage and honor that has left me stunned time and time again unlike so many movie characters these days i see a depth to these characters mellish is a jew miller is a schoolteacher jackson is a christian and of course the somewhat nerdy corporal uphamon the other side we have steamboat willie unfortunately the only german being german does not make him nazi soldier we see a whole lot of it is likely that like the americans he is only following orders as the nazi regime in those days recruited as many able bodied soldiers as they could  including pows like the czechsin addition if you think that the blood and gore is an attempt to provide entertainment value to this film then maybe you need to look up the real wwii in contrast spr is much more sterile in that respect than the war really was war is a bloody horrible terrible thing and spr comes very close to that reality blown off limbs spilled guts and blood are unfortunate realitiesif your looking for a film to watch for entertainment value dont bother with this one if on the other hand you want to watch a movie that is a worthy tribute to our veterans  american canadian british  this one is well worth your while start to finish this film gives me a sense of pride to think of all those people in our military who fight so hard and put their lives on the line just so ordinary people like myself can stay free and live our lives the way we were meant to my hats off to those people with a heartfelt thanks and prayerone last note i have heard of this film and even the real operation being paralleled and compared with the computer game medal of honor allied assault or mohaa for short let me be crystal clear on this point it was a good game i played it but it was just that  a game if you die you can start over until you win the same was not true for all the people that gave their lives during this bloody campaign none of them had a health bar of 100 and a start button for another chance at the battlemy hats off to steven spielberg and the cast for such a superb effort,reality
this movie is a masterpiece it is very rare to see a movie and truly be moved by it from start to finish you are so immersed in this film that you are feeling every emotion of every character as if you were them the true underlying message is often hard for most people to pick out but if you truly grasp what this movie is about you will realize just how beautiful a movie can bethe audio in this movie and the gritty unflinching realism grabs you and pulls you into the war that spielberg has so incredibly painted on the screen the opening scene of dday is perhaps the single most dramatic and immersive movie experience i have ever come across in my entire lifeunlike most films every death you witness in this film stabs at your conscience you truly feel the adrenaline of the killer the pain of the soldier and the sorrow of the soldiers friends every time someone diesthis is perhaps the greatest movie ever made even beyond the war genre every piece of this masterpiece is a work of art the terrifying and realistic sound effects the emotional and beautiful soundtrack and the flawless performance by the actors makes this movie unforgettable,reality
there are few movies in history that can deeply affect us and leave an undeniable emotional impression this film is one such i can remember exiting the theater on weak knees not from sitting for so long but from the emotional turmoil it causedcertainly an average joe like myself who has never served in the military nor ever faced combat cannot truly fathom the horror of war but since a number of wwii combat veterans who viewed the film were impressed by its realism i can safely say that my feelings in leaving the theater were more than justifiedits easy to criticize a war movie for being limited in scope as was but in my opinion it makes for a much more visceral intense and satisfying movie experience some films like patton the longest day midway and a number of others have tried to better represent the monumental undertaking that was wwii while i commend such efforts the focus therein is too broad  one cannot appreciate the individual sacrifice and emotion involved and its easy to get lost in the numerous characters and distracted by the overall scope of the filmryan focused not only on one theater of the war but in one geographically small area additionally it is seen through the eyes of a small squad of american soldiers i would not have wanted it any other wayspielberg has outdone himself here spotlighting his artistic range and reaffirming why he is one of the greatest of american film directors be warned  this is likely among the most intense war films of all time and is not for the weak of stomach or heartbut unlike many of the sanitized war movies of the past this one gives us a taste however small of what must have been a truly terrifying and devastating experience,reality
most of us will never know what it was like on omaha beach june 6 1944 has without a doubt been the most realistic war films ever made this is as close as most of us will come to know what it was like that day on the beach every character in this movie is perfectly cast spielbeg shows us once again that he is one of the best directors of his generation the way he makes every character in the movie seem like an everyman is so realistic because after all these guys arent superheroes there normal blue collar guys who work for a living this movie might just be the best war movie ever made it is right up there with patton the longest day and stalag 17 even if your not a war buff watch it for the history and as we all know if we do not know history we are doomed to repeat it,reality
is a ww2 film that begins on the normandy beaches of france on dday june 6th 1944 the first 20 minutes are the most intense and graphic depictions of war i have seen the dday beach assaults will never be recreated so elegantly ever again the noise carnage and chaos overwhelms and deeply disturbs the viewer unlike anything i have ever seenso far through the film you have been following captain millertom hanks and his company on the beaches of normandy after the intense battle the us army counts its dead three brothers were killed on that same day in normandy the 4th and youngest brother is james francismatt damon and he is not reported dead but his whereabouts are unknown private is a paratrooper who jumped behind enemy lines as a paratrooper the night before the landings he is the last of the sons that his mother still has the army wants him found and brought back home to safety captain miller is now given this task to find private and bring him to safetycaptain miller now travels across battle torn french country side to find private but he does not travel alone he travels with seven of his own hand picked men from his company on their journey they face hard struggles the mission becomes deadly and now the question is why risk the lives of eight men to save the life of one the men do finally find private but does not want to abandon his fellow comrades who he has been fighting and holding out with so now captain miller and his men stay with and the troops he has been fighting with in this bombed out town waiting to hold out until relief arrives the germans are advancing on the town with many more troops and with tanks captain miller and the rest of the men are vastly outnumbered but are going to try to hold on what develops is one of the most graphic and disturbing final stands i have ever seen in a war moviespielber masterfully directed the battle sequences the battle scenes attacked your senses the special effects were mind boggling to say the least the scenes were so realistic and brutally graphic so much blood and carnage that truly disturbs the viewer war is shown as what it is nasty the acting was very good all around except from i think matt damon but tom hanks never ceases to amaze me as he turns out one great performance the film also stars tom sizemoore and edward burns as part of the rescue mission throughout the film there are many great cameos from actors like paul giamatti and even ted danson overall the acting was very goodthe dialog was for the most part realistic but at some parts not as much captain millers character seemed to know to much about all the other operations that were happening in france and some of the lines although not many were a little clichi felt the film to be a little biased towards the americans which i hate to see in movies spielberg seemed to convey the germans as evil jerks german soldiers were just like the american soldiers there is a difference between the german army and the nazi ss so i was ashamed to see the german soldiers representing evil war should represent evil not german soldiers both sides are committing unforgiving violence not just the germanssaving privazte is a very good film everyone should at least experience it once especially if you are a ww2 buff very educational not the best movie of all time but still very good,reality
to be clear i like the normandy beach scene theyre actually quite brilliant but the first and last scenes are those on the cemetery with the old man and his family why are those scenes there they are totally obsolete i dont need to hear the old man ask his wife if his life was worth it if the movie itself didnt make this clear then the movie failed and the movie didnt faili saw the movie a thin red line a week earlier and at first i was disgusted by it just doesnt have the same weight but then again you shouldnt compare these two movies as they are totally different and when i saw this one a few times at later stages this became clear to methe story itself is quite simple and rightfully so a bunch of soldiers are send to save a last of four brothers it needs to be simple its the little things that make the soldiers so unique the little stories of matt damons tom hanks and other characters make this movie and the comradery between the men is portrait very good as well its not poetic but men which are fighting and trying to survive in an unforgiving wari dont know maybe its just me i just got a bit of a beef against steven spielberg lately when the plot has been clear he seem to insert several more scenes that explain the plot again and again he just needs to stop this it makes the movie unnecessary long and dull he does this with most of his movies in the last decade and dont get me wrong i got nothing against long movies but the length needs to fit the moviejust cut the first and last scene and all will be fine,reality
you both are dim bulbs to say the least the film is a fictional story and purports to be just that why people keep holding it to a documentary standard is beyond me but its stupid to do that and displays the limited intellect of those like twistedfieldofvision who do just thatcarmad you are not a writer and nobody who works in your ward on the psych wing believes your i am shakespeare proclamations im sure your equally impotent teen pal who thinks he is napoleon and occupies the bunk above yours believes you but consider the source on that onethis film is brilliant and is one of the top 3 movies ss ever made the speech where the general reads lincolns letter is touching and very appropriate ww2 was the moral equivalent of the war to free the slaves tom brokaw labels the fighting allied men of ww2 the greatest generation he is correct and their humility regarding what they did for mankinds future is part of the reason that label is accurate,reality
ive seen many war movies  in fact war is the genre that interests me the most  however  is a movie that stands apart from all others  as soon as the film starts you know that the movie is something special  there is something different in this movie as compared to others on the same subject  spielberg not only manages to depict the brutality of war superbly but also manages to blend this with the mission given to 8 american soldiers  if youre a fan of warfare and violence then the first half hour of the movie will be enough for you  it is an absolutely sensational and gripping depiction of what these brave men must have gone through  tom hanks is brilliant as usual  playing the role of captain john h miller flawlessly  some of his conversation scenes with the other soldiers are very well projected by spielberg who again shows how good he is as a director  all in all this is one of the best movies i have ever seen and certainly the best when it comes to a movie about war ,reality
this movie is truly the best war movie ever and one of the greatest movies over all of all time it is incredibly well made the first 20 minutes of this movie is one of the greatest scenes of all time it made people realize the pain and what it felt what it was like to be at d day it is truly amazing this movie is very well made the cinematography the sound and special effects the score by john williams this is easily steven spielbergs best movie ever he totally deserved to win the best director award at the oscars it should have totally won best picture over shakespeare in love in the end after the fateful battle at the end i will not tell what happens it justs leaves us with one question are the lives of eight men worth saving one probably not one of the greatest movies ever 1010,reality
the long opening dday battle scene in is a true shocker and youd better believe what i say i almost left the theater the first time i saw it on a big screen i can just barely stand it on a tv screen i cant watch without bawling and thats not like me at all how can i rate the damn thing when i cant even see it through my tears tom hanks as captain john h miller matt damon as private james francis ted danson as captain fred hamill jeremy davies as corporal timothy p upham and all the rest of the actors even vin diesel as shortlived private adrian caparzo stellar lineuplisten tom hanks always turns in a great acting performance even when the film into which hes thrust doesnt give him much of a chance i dont mean this film im thinking of an inferior screenplay like cast away even there hanks almost made it great in the screenplay and hanks are really truly greati dont hand out tens easilyenough said yes,reality
is in a word outstanding spielberg thrusts the viewer into the normandy campaign and you need a strong stomach to endure this the attack on dog green sector omaha beach is arguably the most realistic movie portrayal of battle notwithstanding that breakthrough actually took over three hoursa brilliant innovation is the colour reduction over 50 which makes you really believe it is 1944 music is used to great effect in moments of calm the brutality of battle is clearly demonstrated as is the sadness of loss of life yet the campaign is necessary to end the tyranny of hitler and nazi ideologythe storyline is a real strength and the characters  acting are superb captain miller tom hanks carries out his mission hoping to return to his wife only his shaking right hand alludes to the inner turmoil he struggles with from soldiers dying under his command he is well supported by sergeant horvath tom sizemore who maintains discipline within the squadbut some cannot contain their doubts and even anger that eight lives should be risked to save one though every man has a mother you cannot help feel that matt damon must be saved out of decency himself selflessly stays to defend his outnumbered brothers in spite of the disaster to befall his family finally steamboat willie humanises the germans when pleading for his life befriended by upham he is released yet returns to battle his death shows that men who could otherwise be friends will kill each other in waronly a few historical inaccuracies detract from the brilliance of spr often outnumbered the germans conquered most of europe by 1942 through tactical skill in battle something missing in their clumsy attack on ramelle and tanks had bulletproof glass over vision ports so driver and radio operator could not be killed so easily a role for the british was lacking sadly a hawker typhoon could not be used to bomb the tiger tank in fact a good knowledge of ww2 history is important in order to place this film in contextoverall this tactical and human story within the carnage of ww2 is a must see for anyone who watches war movies and dont miss the message in captain millers last words,reality
to begin i have to admit that this is one of the best war movies ever made no doubt tom hanks is splendid and he shows a real devoted patriot soldier who cares for his family as much as his mother country the war scenes are excellent one can hardly believe that it is a movie because the way they have pictured the film is more like a documentary the bloodshed at the beginning of the film and the cemetery yard with all the white crosses takes you up to the heaven it is too rare that one watches this movie and doesnt get shocked shocked to see so many innocent boys killed at war and all this in vain because the us has begun other wars in asia and other sites so for the sake of all those patriot boys and all captian millers do not rage another war to kill americas sons,reality
i usually watch and give credit to european movies and usually hate the hollywood production and i usually see a political statement in schindlers list which is commonly quoted as his best movie and the best movie about holocausthowever after seeing spr i must agree that this is if probably not the best movie ever made the most revolutionary war movie of all timethe movie structure is like a poem it shakes you in the beginning it calms you in the middle and it destroys you in the end verses first of all the first battle on omaha beach the moving camera the embeded reporter like camera following the soldiers to the beach the explosions arms legs torn apart the fear on soldiers faces the numbness the onandoff going sound after the bombs go off man after seeing it for the first time i went out of the movie theater and went to see it again for the second time there has never been a movie that glued me to the chair and made me stare for 25 minutes in silence well that was a romantic experience and i give spielberg credit for thatthe middle of the movie is exactly the opposite of the first its not loud and disturbing but silent and green i must say its the greenest grass i have seen in a war movie the soldiers walk and walk and speak about stupid stuff like they never went thru hell in the landing at omaha beach when i watched this middle section i almost felt good but it felt very unnatural and thats why after the assault on the mg42 nest i felt shaken again the dying red cross soldier shot in the stomach dying in the arms of comrades ufff some disturbing imagesand of course the last part the total destruction the panzers rolling thru the streets the sniper the selfmade sticky bombs the ruble of houses the fights one on one wow some serious sequencesi admired the photography the clean pictures however it is the moving camera that makes this movie revolutionary i think no director is able to make again a credible war movie without the spielbergs moving camera and thats why i consider him a genius i havent seen a war movie with static cameras after spr came outi must say that this movie can be judged in many ways you can always see a shallow characterization or even a demagogic view on the jewgerman combat in the house of course however if i exclude my political view of this movie i would say that this is probably one of the best i have ever seenonly the russian movie come and see orig idi i smotri made even a harder impact on my view on what war is and thats why i consider if not the best then second best war movie ever made,reality

i first saw this film in the movie theater the beginning of the normandy landing has not left my mind it is one of the most spectacular introduction to the film you have a cast that includes spielbergs favorite actor tom hanks matt damon paul giamati one of my personal favoritesrolf saxon in a nonspeaking role this film is mostly a maledominated film with little or no romance spielbergs best asset is creating a spectacular image and this time the landing on normandy was not for the easily sickened you will see the graphic display of the horror on that day which is what we should see he does not shy away from showing us human brutality at its worst but he later shows it at its best i didnt care much for the title about them rescuing one soldier to bring home i wanted steven spielberg to know that this is his best film to date about world war ii even surpassing schindlers list which i felt was inferior to this film the script was superb the movie is just a breathtaking spectacle to date it still should be seen in the movie theaters to show the effects and brutality and to remind us about how cruel war is on any level he won the oscar for best director but after seeing shakespeare in love there is no doubt in my mind that was robbed of best film sorry shakespeare in love,reality
during the opening sequence when i saw the mans face and i was preparing myself for a long flashback a growing sense of dread overcame me yet still i was not prepared for the horror that i was exposed to for the next 2 12 hours horror is the only way to describe this film i wasnt simply watching the film i was absorbed into it steven spielberg is arguably the most famous film director out there and for good reason too he can make a film like no one else everything here works so well the acting the action sequences the atmosphere and emotion its all here and highly energized this along with schindlers list one of the greatest films in cinematic history is spielbergs masterpiece one of the main reasons this film works is his cinematographer janusz kiminski the grit of the camera sets up the atmosphere perfectly and the lighting is superb because even when its a sunny day its still covered in darkness people have criticized this film for having a bad storyline thats not true not at all while the storyline is simple and nothing new its because thats what it would have been like in real life life is not a intricately woven storyline like say the silence of the lambs and the people with this film know that the key to making this film work is making it real and that it does,reality
i first watched this film in the cinema when it first came out and how to describe it then wow i was not the suitable age though being only 13 at the time and as imagined my impression of the film got better the older i got too many people brand their favourite film as the greatest film of all time but if you have seen this film you will agree with this common statement however deserves more than a common statement the action in the film is intense and the detail has clearly spared no expense the storyline runs really well with the film and what a cast to play in it this is tom hanks at his best not to mention exceptional performances from tom sizemore and edward burns matt damon did well however i felt he did not suit the part steven spielburg should be credited for being the greatest film director not from schindlers list but from saving private,reality
to say is a great war movie would be an understatement this movie deserves a place in the top 50this movie would have been nothing without the amazing directing of steven spielberg and im glad the academy honored him this movie is incredibly violent but it is to show us what the soldiers of ww2 had to endure without that it would not have been as powerfuljohn williams also delivers a very good musical score throughout the film i especially enjoyed the cinema verite technique utilized by spielberg to give us the feel that were on the battlefield with the other soldiersand of course there is tom hanks one of his best performances he is undeniably one of the best actors of all time im glad that he and spielberg teamed up for this it wouldnt have been the same without either of them,reality
many reviews i have heard about this movie that are negative all say something along the lines that it shows the americans as heroes shows the germans as evil killing monsters and that it basically is just a big american propaganda film lets be serious here ww2 has been over for quite a while we know who won the war we know who the bad guys werethe waffen ss and hitler so there is no need to have a ww2 propaganda film almost 60 years after the war had ended the wermacht soldiers they do battle with in this film are not shown as monsters they are basically not given any character just as the enemy that needs to be killed in order to win the battle which is exactly what the germans were to the allies in ww2 not to mention the soldier that confronts upham on the stairwell if the germans were portrayed as mindless killers then that soldier would not have had a seconds hesitation to kill upham this film shows the war through the eyes of a small group of us soldiers the germans are referred to as krauts and just as the enemy this is deliberate during wars to show the enemy as objects instead of human beings so it makes it easier for them to kill the enemyit shows the americans as heroesnot for winning the war but for the battles they fight in during the course of the film yes it shows the us soldiers taking omaha beach in 30 minutes when it obviously took a lot more than that but this movie is fictional it is only inspired by real events nor does it say anywhere in the film this movie is based on a true story it glorifies the deaths of the main characters because like i said before it is shown through the eyes of this group of soldiers therefore theyd be up close and have their friends dying in their arms and it would be emotional not that it was any different for the german soldiers but the us soldiers wouldnt know because the germans were the enemy to them if they were to make this film from the germans point of view then any american who hates it and loves this film is an ignorant hypocrite so before you chastise spielberg and the film itself just think about that,reality
 can contain spoilers  this movie is one of the most beautiful movies ever seen as a fan of ww2 based movies ive seen a lot of such movies but none of those movies can be compared with the beautiful story of a group soldiers in search of a soldier named james who they dont know and never saw willing to give their lives for the job to find him in the meantime a bond between the soldiers exists one by one their comrades die only to save one unknown one who is maybe already deadi can tell you a lot of this movie but the best way is to find out yourself and watch the movie youll not regret it its only not suited for people who cant stand blood in movies think about the first 30 minutes of the movie omaha beach if you like the turmoil and especially the drama part of ww2 then ill recommend you to watch this superb movie and of course its directed by steven spielberg p hope that my first review is alright dnow the only thing i have to do is to watch band of brothers d,reality
the movie has a lot of gratuitous scenes of violence dont need hollywood to show me that war is a violent activity the movie has a lot of stereotypical characters dont need hollywood to portray soldiers as being foulmouthed and grimy the movie has a pretentious story dont believe that even the u s army would risk 10 soldiers to locate one and an enlisted solder at that in the middle of one of the biggest operations in the history of warfare but what saves this movie from being a complete dud is tom hankss portrayal of captain miller hankss performance is not just wonderful it is superlative captain miller is a civilian who now finds himself in combat and the conflict between his civilian background and military responsibilities is what this movie is about because of this conflict captain miller suffers emotionally as well as physically we observe how captain miller goes through a process of breaking down as his situation becomes more and more untenable and when the private in question is found yet refuses to leave captain miller begins to completely unravel as he realizes that his mission has failed and that the men in his unit who died  under captain millers command  had died in vain captain miller literally becomes a nervous wreck but nevertheless he fights on courageous and strong till the ultimate moment arrives marking the end of captain millers life for captain miller is a hero and his character is symbolic of every citizensoldier who answered the call to duty and made the ultimate sacrifice for their country,reality
the plot of this movie was based on fact which means that the actual events that are depicted in the movie may not have happened exactly as portrayed but represent real events that did take place if many who saw this film complain about the lack of historical basis lack of minorities lack of whatever then get over it some events took place in world war ii that did not actually include members of all races or nations as for those who say the film is boring then i can only suppose that real life situations dont hold much appeal for you if youre that disconnected from the real world go back to your video gameworld war ii was a very grim time in the history of our civilization and it would be difficult to find anyone who actually participated in battle during this period to disagree with me ive known many soldiers and ive never met one that wished for the awful bloody sickening carnage that is combat especially the allornothing circumstances that were all to real in this world between 1939 and 1945 soldiers are simply people who are willing to fight for their country in world war ii many of the american combatants were drafted and some did refuse to fight as is the case in any war but most served with or without distinction or recognition but did what they felt was their duty infantry soldiers even ranger captains like john miller were often ordinary people very much removed from the lives they wanted to be living every country that participated in world war ii lost many john millers decent ordinary people that were just doing their duty to the best of their abilityfor those who complain about the stark portrayal of combat as being too brutal i suggest you just live in your dream world where when a steel projectile strikes human flesh the body just simply falls to the ground you are living in a dream world to think this is so combat invariably involves gruesome situations body parts are blown away blood and gore flies war is hell is not just a saying its the absolute truth depicts combat with more accuracy than most war films in the past have done watching this film will put the average person much closer to the actual feeling of being in combat than almost anything else as for those that hate to be reminded of accurate depictions of history there is a saying those who ignore history will repeat it this movie and the war it depicts hopefully have taught us some valuable lessons i hope we never forget themif youre offended by a movie that shows the american flag then dont watch it the realistic depiction of the usa as a patriotic nation in the 1940s might be a little too much for you,reality
is quite possibly the best world war iiinspired movie everi know its not at all historically accurate i know there are plot points that dont make sense i know and understand all these criticismsas a film however and as a statement on what war is and how war affects people this film is top notch and should have won the best picture oscar the year it was releasedthis film has exciting graphic horrifying and realistic battle footage the opening montage alone represents the best filmmaking possible regardless of technologythe cast is simply brilliant not a lame or hackneyed performance in the bunch tom hanks is again oscarworthy and if they had an oscar for best ensemble cast this film would have won handsdownthis film is absolutely nothing like the cheesy wwii movies with john wayne or henry fonda or ernest borgnine this film is not all jingoistic patriotism it is a real look at what real war is like with heroic soldiers and cowardly soldiers and soldiers simply trying to do their jobs and survive it shows the futility of war and the necessity of war and it pulls no punches in showing the horrors of warbeautifully shot wonderfully acted terrifically written truly an amazing piece of filmmaking10 out of 10 for an inspiring filmbarky,reality
it seemed impossible or was it inevitable but director steven spielberg did the unthinkable he made a war movie the creative and legendary mind behind such kiddie movies like et the extraterrestrial 1982 or hook 1991 and who had ventured into more mature territory with schindlers list 1993 made a movie that put a human face on the horrors of the world war ii conflict we know how personal wwii is to spielberg especially to anyone whos seen raiders of the lost ark  he just loves to stick it those diabolical nazis or the aforementioned schindlers list but after seeing 1998 our assertions at just how personal it is to him are revealed opening on dday june 6 1944 at omaha beach in normandy france the grainy cinematography and jerky camera movements are relentlessly imposing in capturing the graphic battlefield carnage of that day we watch in horror as one after one allied soldiers are butchered by the automatic weapons being unloaded on them by the germans that had taken up positions on the hills in front of them in the middle of the chaos is captain miller tom hanks as he leads his men from the sandy bullet and bodyriddled beach up to the top of the hill in the scenes that follow spielberg is unflinching as we see american soldiers as well germans become the casualties of historys costliest conflict the movie doesnt end there its only the beginning and the main plot of the film which is supposedly based on a true story takes shape it turns out that an american mother is going to receive three telegrams in one day each one informing her that her three sons have all been killed in the dday invasion but there is hope her fourth son a paratrooper the eponymous private matt damon in what could essentially be considered a cameo of the films title survived the problem is hes located deep behind enemy lines and itll take a small squad of american soldiers to bring him home as word of this small victory will serve the army good on the home front miller leads his squad which includes sergeant horvath tom sizemore private reiben edward burns private jackson barry pepper private mellish adam goldberg t4 medic wade giovanni ribisi private caparzo vin diesel and the unproven translator corporal upham jeremy davies deep into the french countryside to rescue private and bring him home it should be stated foremost that this is not an easy movie to sit through i remember hearing stories from when this film first came about out how wwii veterans who were at dday had to be escorted out of the theaters because it was too much for them to handle but still that is its goal is the most realistic gritty and horrifically violent war movie ive ever seen it does the impossible task of shedding itself of the stigmas patriotic flagwaving onedimensional soldiers onesided portraits of the enemy no battlerelated carnage etc that haunted many wwii films made during the 50s and 60s contrary to some reviews none of this goes on in this film the film is immediately effective in its portrait of soldiers on both sides of the wwii battle and the cost it waged on them the performances are flawless as spielberg is able to get commanding talent out of all the actors involved the action if you can sit through it will definitely make you squirm in your seat at how realistic it is it should also be noted that nearly every war film since this one has tried to mimic the style of but they cant ever live up to its originality and raw intensity is spielbergs wwii masterpiece and is my favorite war movie its no wonder spielberg was voted 1 director of all time this film proves why1010,reality
this is a definite must see move how come this rating thing only stops at 10im thinking 100from the opening scene i think the movie makes the best effort to capture the normandy landings on that cold gray morning exceptional stuff im a big fan on historic events and i think world war 2 put the world in a point in history that will remain in the minds of a lot of people not a lot of movies have been able to capture true and tragic events a lot of movies try and create a superman type character goes into the mind of an officer who experiences bravery pain and fear it captures patience and love i am lost for words,reality
to bob the moo this film won many awards and not only did it win them it deserved them too the reason it focuses on the yanks we do not like to be called this is because that is where and when the script was written introducing british characters would have probably interrupted the story line it isnt fair to the characters that are making there way threw franceimportant thing i have nothing against the british i thank god for the british but just know this if it werent for the yanks steppin in europe you guys would have been wiped out so there you go dont hate us because we have a bigger film industry than you guysmaybe this is an american film but it has every right to be its directed by steven spielberg for gods sake he was sird by your queen i suggest band of brothers for you they got lots of brities in thereto make perfectly clear i respect england for its longterm fight in ww1 and ww2 if it werent for you guys hitler would have made his way across the atlantic my great grandfather fought in ww1 and he was britishsincerely arbiter89,reality
i cant fault this film in anywayshape or form absolutely brilliant tom hanks once again proves that he still is one of the best actors of our generation and theres also a little part for vin diesel now just recently i have started my war film collection and now own most of the best ones out there but still this film has to be the most accurate and exhilarating one of them all private jamess three brothers have been killed in action and to save the heart ache of their poor mother even more captain john miller and his squad of highly trained soldiers are sent further behind enemy lines to find and return him to his mother safely as you can probably gather not everything goes to plan otherwise the film would be over before we finished our brews faced with impossible odds the men start to question their orders why are eight men risking their lives to save just one surrounded by the brutal realities of war each man searches for his own answer and the strength to triumph over an uncertain future with honour decency and courage if you like this and lets face it if u dont then u dont like a brill war film i recommend band of brothers which is a mini drama series on a para squad in ww2 tom hanks also present that too,reality
as of three years ago i have made a point of watching this film on june 6th every year so that the true meaning of this historic date will never be lost i know it sounds trite but with holidays such as memorial day quickly becoming an excuse for cookouts i feel the need to reinforce the terrible and awesome sacrifices that have shaped the course of history this movie does just that for all of its character development shortcomings it still ranks as simply the most powerful cinematic depiction of war i have ever seen and as a side note the whole character development issue almost seems moot considering the context in which most of these men knew each other ready to die for their brothers many ironically knew very little of each others personal lives except for snippets learned during the calm interludes when the soldier would share stories or letters from a world far away that is why the betting on what hanks character does as a civilian makes so much sense to many life at home was a carefully guarded treasure that served as a very personal and private link to sanity and hope if you havent seen this film make it a point to do so you will find a whole new appreciation for the ability of the common man who faced with impossible odds and true terror is somehow able to accomplish the extroardinary it will renew your faith in mankind while simultaneously horrifying you at mans folly,reality
being still a teenager i realize that i am still relatively young and may not fully comprehend the true impact of war if ever  i know that many have criticized this movie for not truly giving the sense of war or whatnotin my view this was not the purpose of the movie  instead i believe that this movie was made as a tribute for those lives lost in the war and to give the audience a more graphic taste of the battlefield  the viewer may only begin to get a sense of the horror felt by those involved but i hope that most will never have to know such feelingsmoviewise its terrific  superb acting exciting and twisting plot emotional moments and edgeofyourseat action  i came away speechless with a better view of the true loss of warwhile the feelings conveyed are not as realistic as some would like this movie is also not exactly a lighthearted take on war  i feel that hollywood has a responsibility to accurately reproduce the historical subject being represented to the best of their ability and this is achieved  the costumes special effects sounds and sets are virtually genuinethe bottom line  while unable to truly portray the experience of war the viewer still comes away feeling solemn and respectful with a true sense of loss for those involved  the excellent production values are only a bonus,reality
this is definetely one of my top ten it includes a great cast great action and a great story i never really knew much about the second world war until i saw this movie after i saw this movie i became more interested in history after watching this movie a couple of times i became more familiar with the second world war and how bad it really was this is an excellent movie i give it 10 out of 10,reality
overall this is a well made film that is not well written  sure the opening scenes normandy are dramatic and touch you deeply but as soon as the allies secure the beach the movie begins to failsurely there is a better script for a film about wwii in the european theater that would have served as a good vehicle for the dramatic first halfhour in this movie,reality
any movie that opens with a lengthy shot of the american flag has got problemsin general i thought it superficial poorly written and poorly directed spielberg has a penchant for thrusting his movies upon his viewers spoon feeding them morality in doses of banal righteousness i personally dont go to the movies to be treated like a schoolkid and taught a lesson so elementary vague and though ultimately true tritethose who see as a revelatory view of war obviously slept through high school history war is gruesome war isnt fun war sucks glad to see the truth spielberg but dizzying freehand camera shots pointless music the music sucked throughout and timed successions of loud booms gave me more of a headache than visceral enlightenment about 5 minutes into the dday scene when the cacophony of camera shots and dead bodies reached its apogee i asked myself  why did spielberg put this in did he have any real reason except to embellish the gruesomeness of war does this really contribute to the movie i found the answer to be nothen theres the plot and characters  wait what plot and characters here are 8 men meandering through french territory wondering why they are all such damn stereotypical and superficial characters theres the bookworm the italian the southerner the jew etc in the end i cant feel very much for any of these characters  cause theyre not even human to me theyre typecasts even tom hanks who does a worthy job remains distant and emotionally inaccessible due to poor writing so we know that his hand shakes and he teaches english bfd spielberg could take a lesson from say john sayles about character developmentthen theres the plot from the title i expected there to be more focus on instead the group wanders through normandy and the hunt for becomes unimportant and adventitious the movies impetus is seriously lacking and i accredit this to poor directorial focus spielberg had problems finding a point to direct the energy of the war to and instead directed it towards some vague moral standard unlike say apocalypse now where the search for brando has a singular focus on him the soldiers wander aimlessly and haphazardly stumble upon in the most obtuse and anticlimatic fashion possible on their way they go through a perfectly crafted sine curve of battles and traumas discoveries and enlighenments and as soon as i saw ted danson i couldnt help but drift to place where everybody knows your name and guys in pasty blue uniforms named cliff down heneiekens now thats poor focusin the end i could predict flatly what would happen yes its a true story so spielberg was limited but the presentation was just too flat the ending  is so utterly pitiful and righteous i wanted to puke so this is what the movie came down to i thought as the american flag waved me goodbye war is bad america is good death is bad life is good  drink bud,reality
the beach scenes are absolutely fantastic and im not sure if i did breathe at all during those sequences the sound and the effects are amazing the use of small hand cams gave the whole thing a documentary feeling of the hell that met the men who landed on the beach sadly after that it is not too good and the film quickly becomes a standard hollywood ww2 film with heroic americans and stupid german soldiers a better story and less sentimentality everyone understands that young men being blow to pieces is a tragedy and this need not be pointed out by the director the price for freedom is highwould have given this film a 1010 i think the men who laid down their lives on the beaches in the fight to free europe deserves more than this,reality
this movie has extremely high production values superb direction great actingmagnificent special effects are all present hereit is only the script that is lackingthe story is contrived and slight with sentimental and unrealistic dialoguethe opening thirty minutes are breathtaking and the movie is well worth seeing for this sequence which is one of the most convincing battle scenes on filmhowever the rest of the filmwhile good is just too longblack marks to steven spielberg for his unsympathetic portrayal of the german soldiersgeneration after generation of american filmmakers have portrayed the germans as cruel people in war moviesi would have thought a director with the distinction of steven spielberg could have seen the german army from a more human perspectiveit was not only us soldiers who suffered in the wardespite the realismthis was another movie where america and good ol american values win the day this is one movie that suffers on video and tvideally should be seen in the cinema to get the full effect,reality
if realism is no important point for you in ww2 movies if you like cliches of other nations and like to support directors who stress them in their own way if you never saw full metal jacket or first trials of your fathers shots of his v8camcorder at a beach if you believe that tom h could present a character who is introduced like eastwood and finally think that if someone has a big name in hollywood he is always great what ever he doesthen you will love this movie,reality
i could not believe how many historical inaccuracies there were in this film the us army refused to use the british invention of the sticky bomb saying that it was a waste of military intelligence and a waste of time then it saved the day in the movie not realistic at all plus the idea of the us army risking that many men so one mother isnt too upset her sons passed away absolutely ridiculous absolutely ridiculous horrible film i expected much more from stephen spielberg worst spielberg film ever if you haven not yet seen this movie do not waste your time it made me want to demand my money back from the cinema just dont waste your time,reality
what does everyone see in this film  im guessing that people described it as intelligent in order to justify their enjoyment of it rather than admitting that it is just a cheesy blockbuster  like most of spielbergs work it is trash masquerading as art  the only spielberg film that i like is raiders of the lost ark because doesnt pretend to be anything more than an enjoyable lark,reality
yes has very graphic action scenes which are more realistic than the average war movie but there are other aspects in which it fails in being authentic the attitudes behaviors and values of the people in the time period which the movie depicts in particular some of the major and minor characters of spr exhibit very selfabsorbed characteristics which would have been very uncommon among regular troops during world war ii sure people have some of the same feelings and other characteristics throughout history and soldiers frequently grumble and are cynical but the people shown in this movie tend to reflect much more what 1990s guys were like rather than 1940s men for a war movie which does a better job of showing 1940s troops try battlegroundlike many others here i like war movies to be authentic in depicting things like uniforms equipment and tactics and spr is successful in some of this but to me it is more important for a movie to be accurate in depicting character attitude and the actual events that occurred and in this spr is very lacking it does a better job of demonstrating spielbergs 1990s limousineliberal biases this is especially seen in the character depictions another kind of example which is comparatively minor is how the german troops haircuts in spr tend to look more like those of late20th century skinheads than what german ss and wehrmacht troops usually worealso i think that the reviewer james bowman makes a good point about movies such as spr and flags of our fathers perhaps showing too much respect for the suffering is not to show enough respect for the man for if we suppose as some of us still do that these men suffered for something  to wit their duty their honor their country  dont these thing deserve just a little bit of respect as wellto get an idea of what the normandy campaign was like you would be much better off reading nonfiction accounts of it and listening to comments by actual men who were there it takes much more than gushing blood flying body parts and the message war is hell to constitute a great war film if you want to see cinematic movies which do a better job than spr of depicting some of the general look and feel of war and the characters and attitudes of people of the world war ii period try talvisota and der untergang also a bridge too far is very good especially for a blockbustertype movie a bridge too far has a few very minor inaccuracies some composite characters and some simplifications of the real events but it does an excellent job of showing the characters of troops and civilians and it is mostly factual the longest day while it includes some hollywood flourishes also is very good it doesnt have the special effects and combat realism of spr but it is almost completely based on facts which counts for a lot with me and for which i rank it much higher than spr the longest day also has one of the most impressive largescale depictions of combat in any movie showing the storming of a german position by a free french unit,reality
ive long been a fan of war films but for some reason it took me eight years to finally get around to watch this the often undisputed classic war film of all time why not sure really  im not the worlds biggest fan of steven spielberg although ill admit that hes made some good films in his time still it was with some excitement that i sat down to finally watch this lengthy epic of a film in the best format possible  widescreen dvd 52 television and surround sound system unsurprisingly i was blown away by the productionat the heart the film recalls dozens of other war films from the dirty dozen to the longest day a squad of men are sent on a suicidal mission facing almost certain depth where the movie excels however is in the extra depth and layers that spielberg adds the characterisation is strong the dialogue harsh and heartfelt technically the film is perfect the colours are faded and washed out and the handheld camerawork is ten times better than that seen in the lord of the rings trilogy sound effects are excellent the best ive heard especially the incredibly suspenseful sound of tanks approaching at the films climax all these technicalities combine to make the battle scenes some of the most desperately realistic ive seen the opening twenty minutes on omaha beach which show the infamous dday landings are everything youve heard exhilarating utterly depressing disturbing exciting and gruesome this is certainly the goriest war film out there and its all portrayed in a matteroffact way blink and you really will miss it people explode lose limbs and bleed copiously from wounds only strong stomachs need applythe acting is uniformly great as youd expect from the calibre of cast on view tom hanks has never been better as the shellshocked hero with unforgettable mannerisms  the shaking hand still haunts me tom sizemore arguably steals the show as the gruff sergeant and his largerthanlife persona is well suited to a role than the one he plays here edward burns and adam goldberg put in solid performances but its jeremy davies who the film focuses on throughout  a rookie greenfaced communications officer thrown straight into the hell of warfare the viewer understandably sees the film through davies eyes and the subsequent journey is everything you would imagine it to be additionally the film boasts great turns from actors in lesser roles  especially barry pepper as the sniper and vin diesel at his best lots of familiar faces pad out other roles some in cameos dennis farina ted danson matt damon giovanni ribisi paul giamatti the list goes ondespite the nearthree hour running time the film never slows up or stops for a minute every second is crucial and beautifully crafted things culminate in a setpiece climax a fierce ambush in a bombedout french town our heroes attempt to destroy a brigade of nazi troops and their vehicles and heavy guns its sprawling explosive upsetting and by the last frame of the film incredibly moving so in retrospect is everything everybody says it is spielbergs best film by far and one of the best war films of all time,reality
released in 1998 and directed by steven spielberg spr is about the normandy invasion and its immediate aftermath from june 616 1944 the focus is on a captain tom hanks and his men who are commissioned to find a paratrooper matt damon whose brothers have been killed in actionno ones supposed to say anything bad about spr to do so is considered sacrilege but i have to be honest about what i like and dont like about spielbergs popular wwii war flick the initial beach landing shot at curracloe beach ballinesker ireland is outstanding as is the closing halfhour battle at the crumbling village of ramellein between these two great bookends are a few quality sequences but i didnt find a lot of the drama all that engaging or convincing the cast is notable also including tom sizemore barry pepper edward burns giovanni ribisi jeremy davies vin diesel et al but the characters never struck me as real for the most part ive seen the film three times and each time i was too often conscious of the fact that i was watching actors portraying wwii characters in a movie when you see a truly great picture by contrast you completely forget youre watching a movie eg the original apocalypse now 1979moreover too many of the situations in spr including the dialogue simply struck me as unreal or annoyingly treacly exhibit a is the moronic dogtag sequence which was supposed to be emotionally stirring but just made me roll my eyes but like i said no one can criticize spr and get away with it even if the criticism is legitimate its like youll be accused of being unamerican or something which is far from the case with me since i love america i just cant stand the corrupt government  politicians particularly the loony demonkkkrapsin light of my criticisms i simply dont get why so many praise spr as the greatest war movie ever made again the opening and ending battle sequences are great but the dubious dramatics leave quite a bit to be desiredive heard spr hailed on the grounds that much of it was taken verbatim from firsthand eyewitness accounts of the real normandy invasion ill take their word for it but this isnt what i object to i object to the contrived sappy questionable way spielberg depicted the dramatics and the fact that i was unable to buy the characters as real the aforementioned dogtag sequence is just one example others include the french fathers stupefying actions and the forced fight at the radar station and how its resolved ooh the captains a high school teacher whoopeenevertheless there is a lot of good in spr that makes it worth viewing you cant beat the battle sequences the cast and the convincing wwii visuals throughoutthe movie runs 2 hours 49 minutes and was shot in ireland england and france writer robert rodatgrade cb,reality
another movie in which the american fighting man is portrayed as weak stupid untrained and rebelliousthe captain wont help a family get out of harms way but has no trouble assaulting a radar tower stupid in one case take ten seconds and point to the avenue of escape in the other avoid the tower its not the missiona wellmanned squad has a sniper and a translator but not a radioman or a machine gunner what bullets slice easily through all helmets except one they wanted the irony of the guy pulling off his helmet and then getting the head shotthe star trek philosophy of the captain being challenged every step by his subordinates might be the way it works in space didnt happen in wwii more people die when you put it to a vote snipers die when they fire continuously not their job the german ate it because he tried to take everybody out the american did the samea snipers basic job in battle is to make the enemy keep low and go slow he takes out the head officers and radiomen the muscle mostly machine gunners bazookas and bars or the morale medics if the bad guys take out your chain of command take away your strength or take away any hope of surviving a wound you tend not to fight as wellif your man throws a hissy fit and wants to desert you help him not gonna happen even if you are a pacifist piece of crap like the captain you have to keep your unit cohesivetanks enter a hot zone in a city without firing a shot stupid tanks like planes provide massive firepower but also huge targets the queen of battle takes the cities tanks avoid them and fire at them from a distance tank busters wouldnt have been used in this situation they probably would have taken out the very bridge that both sides wanted to own but neither side wanted to destroyyou let the rookie hang back and cry no if you dont want to fight with the rest of us you can do your part by attracting bulletsthe way to infiltrate the enemy lines is to crowd together joke and sing while you walk along through the pretty fields stupid stupid stupid spread out keep quiet learn how to use the 1000 yard starea captain loses 96 men and rationalizes that he saved 10 times that amount not in our army i waited for him to say 104 that would have been believable but i guess this captain was leading a battalion not a company and somehow he ends up leading not a battalion not a company not a platoon but a mere squad most likely a buck sarge or a corporal would have led that squadnoncombat pencil jockeys call the shots as the normandy invasion is going on uh noif you have a prisoner you let him go while you dig graves no to letting him go no to digging graves during battle you take care of the living first and of the living you take care of your own men firstalthough communication was atrocious all platoons had a radioman and some squads did the proper place for a radioman is two feet to the rear of the captain at all timesthe horrid portrayal of the american fighting man goes on and on they werent wimps yes everyone was scared silly but they didnt challenge every fricking order if you are part of the 10 of the army known as line soldiers the chances are good that you are not coming back you know that going inwar is terrible you dont want to experience it but if you have to try to be like the sarge dont be stupid like the sniper cowardly like the translator conflicted like hanks treasonous like whats his name etcand private himself at that cemetery he should have been thinking about all the men he killed not whether he lived up to the captains standards he killed the captain and most of his men a fitting end would have eating a bulletthe screaming eagles puking chickens and the rangers were highly trained they werent wimps they didnt have anybody in their units who was untrained in rifle fire they knew that their job was to do the heaviest fighting and take the bloodiest losses every one of them knew how to fire how to bandage a wound how to use a radio bazooka garand bar how to lead when one went down another would take his place battlefield promotions were never more prevalent than in those unitsthose men volunteered to be in those units they might have been drafted but they chose to join the roughest and most courageous outfits that we hadi salute our fighting men although i was a ground pounder my contribution to american freedom was relatively small and insignificant i only hope that i could have acted like one of the few valiant soldiers portrayed hereand as to the movie itself shameful utterly shameful,reality
great is such a big word you can fill it with so many expressions like spectacular thrilling heartbreaking gutwrenching emotional inspirational etc etc my problem with is that it has all these elements but still  at the end i have a big feeling of emptiness its like all these things cancel each other outthe opening sequence is one of the most spectacular youll ever see in a war movie spielberg knows how to deal with visual effects and the sound editing the shaky movements of the camera gives a realistic depiction of the chaos dominating these battles even the word battle is too feeble to describe the intensity of the massacre the sky is gray on this dday the sea is reddened by the sacrifice of these young soldiers the air is a vicious enemy that can send you a bullet where it feels like to your life is as worthless as money in a lottery indeed this opening sequence was very promising but i had mixed feelings after i hoped the movie would stay in the same level of realism and greatness on one side on the other side i wished it wouldnt contain other sickeningly violent sequences unfortunately none of these wishes were satisfiedthe film flirts with fantasy right after the battle sequence where the mission of captain millers men is finally exposed they will have to save one soldier private the only one left to a family who already lost 3 sons his brothers to spare a tragedy for one soldiers family eight of them will try to find him and risk their lives we dont know this yet hes only a name a quest but we get used to these characters we follow them and have sympathy for them but at each step of their odyssey one will be killed it becomes almost a routine were not supposed to think of their family or the loss caused by this mission they just die and the mission must go on it seems thats life has more value at this point i remember schindlers list beautiful statement whoever saves one life saves the humanity but the people who were saved didnt choose their destiny they were victims the alternative was death wanted to be a soldier to fight he never wanted to be saved isnt the movie about duty wasnt accomplishing his so whats the point of risking the lives of soldiers who want to fight instead of looking for a man whos not a prisoner to save one who didnt ask for it nonsense and dangerous reasoning implying that some external elements make your life more valuable than the otherswhich in fact brings me to the biggest problem i had with the film lifes value the movies tries to be inspiring by making these soldiers heroes but to make them heroes it creates villains by totally dehumanizing the enemy when a war movie makes me cheer for one human being killed i feel manipulated and i become distant  when a coward like upham becomes rambo at the end and when steamboat willie revealed himself as the sneaky bastard they thought he was  i said okay spieleberg is pushing the manichean button a little too far of course when you consider the atrocities committed by the enemy its impossible to root for the soldiers equally but thats the challenge when you make a war movie you can make a manichean blockbuster easy choice or a disturbing masterpiece challenge  i disliked for the same reason i loved all quiet on the western front paths of glory apocalypse now platoon or das bootthis movie is great in all the meanings of the word and thats the problem its too great it tries too much  i loved the opening scene and another one will torture me forever its the scene where melish begs for his life when he lost the fight that part killed me  it felt so real i couldnt breath  literally to conclude a solid blockbuster movie with some unforgettable scenes but not the inspirational masterpiece they claim it to be,reality
count me among the group of dissenters that thinks is 20 minutes of technically expert filmmaking capped by 140 minutes of monotonous war film punctuated by treacly and typical spielbergian emotional histrionicsspielbergs attempts at meticulously recreating the omaha beach invasion that take up the first half hour or so of this film are stunning but the film grinds to a halt after that with a lame story and shallow characters that go nowhere spielberg wants us all to feel guilty doesnt he always about what soldiers in wwii went through but his way to do that is to throw brutal violence in our faces every few minutes the thing is its not the violence that makes other and better war films bring home the horrors of war to its audience its the depiction of what war does to a mans psyche its another film from 1998 set during wwii combat terence malicks the thin red line that stands as the years masterpiece about war but audiences ignored that film because malick wasnt willing to hold their hands and tell them how they should feel something spielberg could teach a class ingrade b,reality
lately when hollywood produces war movies they focus on the debacle of vietnam not director steven spielberg instead the incredibly versatile helmer of jaws schindlers list the color purple and jurassic park skewers a patriotic chapter of american history on a bayonet with his graphically realistic but otherwise sappy ranks as a secondrate world war ii movie with a firstclass cast and topnotch production values that pass inspection with some of the most savage combat carnage ever lensed as demeaning as this criticism sounds is one of the top 25 world war ii movies since swamped moviegoers with cutting edge combat action ridley scotts black hawk down and sylvester stallones rambo have eclipsed it with even greater cutting edge violence if the story had been as memorable as the kinetic bloodsplattered battle scenes might have been a classic essentially is a tenstar movie until the us army gets off the beach and into france where it devolves into just another standardissue gi joe war epic anybody who knows anything about combat movies will cringe the first time that they see the hero parading about in a helmet with the captains bars painted on the front like a bulls eye this is an egregious error during world war ii officers didnt advertise their presence in this manner for fear that an enemy sniper would single them out for a bullet in the head okay id dismiss this lapse of realism as a dramatic liberty except that the film itself raises the same point a seasoned dogface vin diesel warns a rank amateur to stop saluting the captain for fear that a sniper will shoot the captain downdispersed throughout the movie is the usual quota of hallmark speeches about valor loyalty and redemption these platitudes add little dimension beyond the obvious to the purely physical ratatattat spielberg could have trimmed much of this sappy dialogue and upgraded his movie running nearly three hours in length this rowdy often profane world war ii melodrama creates a deeper impression with is grotesque special effects than with its drab sometimes improbable tale told from the perspective of the infantry is a movie in the grand tradition of louis milestones classic all quiet on the western front samuel fullers the big red one lewis milestones a walk in the sun and william wellmans background granted none of them boasts the extreme combat that commands but they are solidlymade engaging war movies with deeply personal stories the muddled but highminded screenplay by fly away house scenarist robert rodat follows a unit of us rangers on a

eight lives to save one guy before grinds to its sanguinary conclusion the biblical theme of singling out an individual from a multitude for redemption grows tedious spielberg and rodat along with uncredited scribes scott frank and frank the shawshank redemption darabont seem confused are they making a fiercely repellent antiwar movie or have the drummed up a gungho hong kong style kickbutt actioneer they pile on enough violence for a platoon of war movies bullets zip and zing by the hundreds giving death an impersonal omnipotence presumably the filmmakers hoped their grisly depiction of combat would eviscerate the memories of those flagwaving john wayne propaganda sagas the sadistic horrors that occur in seems more commercially than philosophically oriented we dont think so much about how terrible war is as how miraculous it is to survivethe first 24 minutes of dwells on the famous dday landing at omaha beach spielberg shows the baptism by fire that befell the seasick gis as they waded ashore into a murderous third reich shooting gallery this is the best part of this movie and guarantees it an immortal place in the ranks of all great combat epics after the scary visceral dday prologue the film settles down long enough for miller to receive new orders eventually miller locates with a bunch of paratroopers guarding a bridge behind nazi lines refuses to leave his buddies in the lurch reluctantly miller and his squad prepare for the worst this part of has a lot of action but it cannot compete with the 1960s abctv show combat tom sizemore makes a credible sergeant but the usually dependable edward burns plays a soldier that would have been shot by his own men for disobeying orders tom hanks former teacher turned combat leader is a little too sentimental to be believable as is his inevitable demise many soldiers have commentedamong them retired joints chiefs of staff general colin powellthat miller and his men should have blown the bridge and retreated of course had our heroes shown this much common sense there would have been no climactic battlespielberg relies on elaborate visual gimmicks to strengthen his screen activities the astonishing combat sequences have the compressed look of a video surveillance camera the only thing that saves spielberg is the politically incorrect way that the gis shoot the surrendering nazi troops for all its obvious flaws still qualifies a movie any diehard world war ii fanatic should watch at least three times,reality
spielberg is a highly competent director who has a brilliant knack for making the right film at the right time this has resulted in a number of his works being overhyped to the point of the ridiculousis most certainly one of those films here we have a thin and totally implausible story shallow characters lack of historical authenticity yet a reputation confirmed on this board of being the best war movie of all timelet me refute that view on just a couple of pointsfirst we should be clear that while the opening dday sequence is certainly spielberg at his best it is by no means the best  nor the first  bigscreen depiction of the realities of war in fact its largely a ripoff of the equally good and much earlier beachlanding sequence in cornel wildes 1967 tourdeforce beach red spielberg modernizes the visuals very effectively but does not improve on that earlier work and in fact echoes many specific sequences within it wildes film is also far more powerful in the rest of its storysecond aside from privates many other weaknesses i find most glaring its unintentional irony what country in ww ii  other than the usa  could in its wildest dreams enjoy the luxury of bringing back one son merely because his siblings had died i can only imagine the jeers that must greet this idea when the film is shown in say russia  where tens of millions died with no such convenient reprieves and nowhere to flee in any case or in england where whole families had no choice but to soldier their way through the blitz the fact is the soldiers of the usa were relatively unique in having a safe haven to return to not only manages to forget that fact it somehow tries to make american troops seem the more heroic for iti say the irony is unintentional in fact i long wondered if spielberg had meant the storyline of private ironically but a recent interview on tcm convinces me that he did not thats a shame done deliberately this could have been a deliciously vitriolic statement on how the powersthatbe manipulate fighting men in the field instead its more like a slap in the face to the very men it attempts to honor i have no idea how prevalent the private reprieve really was but presenting it without context does a disservice to the entire forceon the positive side theres no denying the production is wellmounted i give the film 3 stars chiefly for the technical brilliance of the opening sequence  and for the presence of the alwayswatchable tom hanks,reality
oh come on this flick is nothing but patriotic filth the first twenty minutes are an accurate and meticulous portrayal of the normandy landing and the cinematography is just beautiful but the story the plot forget it i believe it is very unlikely that any superior in the military would send a whole platoon on such a bs assignment and when they finally find matt damon aka he heroically wants to fight on and not leave the battle field ridiculous this is popcorn bs for the masses and it makes me angry how spielberg exploits an actual event in history to make some entertaining overly corny and almost nationalistic movie out of it i think that spielberg displays a lack of responsibility because this movie has the following messages 1americans fought bravely against the nazis and all of them believed they were fighting for a worthy cause 2 american men are young and handsome and if not they are smart or wise 3 all germans are bad nazis and ugly too 4 the americans are superheros 5 there was no antismuts within the american army well people believe what they want to believe and the more simplified the message is the more they are willing to swallow it if you want to take a deeper look into the real character of the american army read books such as mailers the naked and the dead but refrain from spielberg who is nothing but a lowbrow trying to look smart,reality
instead of me picking this the best war film ever i choose it as the most overrated film of all time  an entire squadron would not be sent into uncertain territory just to bring back one man who really had no purpose to be saved  there were several others out there just like him im sure all of the people who didnt deserve to survive did this movie was just a load of it  definetly not spielbergs best and not hanks best role  anyone who picks this as one of the best movies ever needs therapy,reality

first of all i have to say i like the special effects of this movie thats why it gets 3 out of 10 what does this film show us  steven spielbergs masterpiece of a warmovie shows us how history can be changed just to show german peoples as backstabbing chickenhearted and dumb ok the war has been lost good im glad germany lost that war but the film does not display the truth we all know americans are the best soldiers best humans everyday when they wake up thinking about how to save the planet this time because they are the best peoples on this planet so you see that soldier running to the bunker because he is an american always ready to risk his own life for worldpeace if its the bad russians japanese or germans we need to save this planet from them i have one question who will save us from these intolerably americans ,reality

the first 30 minutes are great but after that the movie makes little sense aside from the totally ridiculous plot the actions of the characters is pure hollywood fiction the way they walk around nonchalantly the bars on hanks helmet why not a bullseye and the ridiculous notion of a sniper going anywhere near a bell tower are the things that bothered me the most why would they face overwhelming odds to save a bridge that the engineers could rebuild in a day denying it to the fleeing germans would have been the priority faced with the odds that they were up against even a corporal would have had the military sense to blow the bridge before the germans arrived and have everyone safely on the other side hey spielberg whats with the neonazi skinhead german soldiers i have never seen a photograph of a wwii german soldier with a haircut remotely resembling this i realize that actual soldiers were used as extras but you have to assume actors were given the speakingcloseup roles expected much more from all of the hype  sorely disappointed by all the hollywood glam,reality

summary 4413 men recorded dead in what is known as the turning point of world war 2 the day of days dday until there has not been a film that has come close to showing an entire audience through a cinema screen just how tragic terrifying and real this war was is story about a group of eight men led by captain miller tom hanks who have been assigned to bring one man home to his mother a mother who has lost three of her sons due to this war and to lose a forth is inconceivable a story of courage bravery friendship brother hood and belief there is hope for humanity where all hope is lost until there have been countless film adaptions of world war 2 but few have attempted to bring the harsh reality of war home to the viewing audience and make you feel as if you are there well spielberg has certainly achieved this for the first 27 minutes of the film we witness one of cinemas most historical openings to a film but also one of histories most tragic and important moments  dday you find yourself stunned into silence once the landing crafts door spins open as instantly you see young men mowed down by german mounted machine guns the sound of land mines mortar fire and screaming all adds to this horrific moment ignorantly you find yourself questioning and wondering why people are drowning not running and not firing back but then you remember you are sat in a cinema or at home and will never experience the shear fear and loss of humanity in moments like thatlike all directors spielberg is certainly not perfect and there are moments throughout this film that lack information and are in some respect hollywood such as we only witness the americans running up omaha beach but never hear about juno sword gold utah and granted the majority of the soldiers storming omaha were americans but where are the rest of the allies who assisted in the omaha landing after all usa won the war didnt they regardless of some minor factual eras this opening is none the less a cinematic master piece which won him the oscar for best director steven spielberg not only aimed to show the needless countless and horrific violence of this war he also has tried to show us as an audience that in these dark times humanity will find a way and that is the basis of our story although a fictional story it is a heart felt and beautiful story that will leave you on the edge of your seat throughout is a film that has been noted and criticised as being needlessly violent bloody and chaotic you cannot argue that violence blood and chaos are entirely apparent from the get go but you certainly cannot say it is needless spielberg has masterfully encapsulated a time in history where everything that was right was most definitely not cpt miller played by tom hanks who in an oscar nominated performance which lets face it you wouldnt expect any less will embark on the mission of finding private james iowa the fourth brother to bring him home to his grieving mother tom hanks is accompanied by an all star cast of seven men sargent horvath tom sizemore private reiben edward burns private jackson barry pepper private mellish adam goldberg private caparzo vin diesel t4 medic

by the throat throughout as far as war films go i can honestly say there has never been one so close to the bone that you are left speechless and feel as if you are a witness to something you have only ever read or heard about each characters struggle for survival and to simply make it back home will remind you how lucky you are but find also make you feel like you are part of this mission one of the most powerful moments in this film comes early on when the head of the us army hears about the mothers loss and decides it is right to bring the fourth brother home spielberg has included a letter abraham lincoln once wrote to a mrs bixby in boston during americas most tragic of wars the civil war although a letter written years before world war 2 it is written by one of americas most iconic and notable presidents whos vocabulary and inspirational writing is still ever apparent today the letter gives us a sense that somewhere in the mist of all war and unspeakable violence it is

the 1998 wardrama film directed by steven spielberg was an incredible film that was very realistic and had a storyline that kept viewers captivated until the very end the film was rated r due to its gory war scenes and use of profanity no young child should see the violence that this film captured to create realistic war scenes the setting of this movie was the invasion of normandy during world war ii the explicit scenes had blood pouring out of soldiers soldiers with limbs cut off men screaming and shaking and soldiers being shot all of this captured the brutality of world war ii in such a way that the audience could feel the adrenaline and fear that each one of those soldiers would have been facing out on the battle field the gruesomeness of the movie forces the viewer to have respect for the soldiers for moving forward with their duties even though they are surrounded by death of not only their enemies but their friends the special effects throughout the entire movie were incredible the explosions of fire and dust were very realistic to an actual bomb going off all of the sounds of gun shots gave the image of a battle field even when one closed their eyes it had to have taken a lot of effort to put together scenes where so many men were shot in various places the opening battle scene where the united states army was trying to secure omaha beach was almost as if world war ii was recorded and the real footage was put into the movie men had blood spewing out of their wounds where they were shot some of their limbs were completely gone and one man laid on the ground holding his intestines into his body another scene had a soldier being held by his friends after being shot many times each wound had blood pouring out of it so realistically that i had to turn away from the screen these are just a few examples of the almost too realistic wounds that could make the audience feel nauseous if they were too squeamish about bloodthe storyline to the movie was one that could capture the attention of a wide range of audiences it was a movie on history war friendships comradery and family several of the infantry members sent on the mission to find a man who lost all of his brothers to war could not understand why they had to risk their lives to tell a single man he was allowed to go home many of them started out their journey mocking the boy saying he would not be worth it when they finally found him and told him that he was allowed to go home and he refused to leave the men he was with behind it sparked a fire in the men that the audience could see the inspiration the audience felt when a man who just found out he had lost three of his brothers stays to help defend the people in his unit was overwhelming not only did he stay and so did the rest of the men who came to find him but most of those men died willingly to protect their country and save the young boy to give him a chance at going home alivetom hanks portrayed captain miller one of the main characters throughout the movie he did a fantastic job with presenting the characters mental dilemmas we see him struggling throughout the movie with an uncontrollable shaking hand but whenever someone asked if he was alright he avoided the question and just moved on we are able to tell that the war is taking a toll on his mental health because often we see him staring off hearing nothing when he is in the middle of combat the viewer sympathizes because we see the tremendous amount of stress he is under he sees all of the same things that the soldiers he is commanding are yet he has to remain strong and act as though none of the brutality phases him the movie ends in a heart wrenching scene where captain miller dies even though he had the chance to go home and see his wife before he made the decision to stay and help defend the small group of men private did not want to abandon his final words hit home to private and the audience as he tells private to earn it the impact that those two words had on private are taken throughout his life because at the end of the movie we see him getting emotional in front of captain millers grave where he asks his wife if he was a decent man it was a tear jerking moment as the audience got to whiteness a grown soldier asking for the respect of a man who died saving his life all 170 minutes of were captivating and exhilarating as i sat watching the film i felt as though i was on the battle field with these men getting to know each and every one of them each personality came through even if they did not speak many words this film is a 5 star movie and is worth seeing because it will have you trying to fight back the tears whether male or female at the end,reality
is beautiful its emotional its violent and its probably the best movie set in a war ever made it is a truly epic spielbergs directing here is phenomenal every cast member give great performances making every character memorable the set design is also marvelous as i said earlier this movie is violent and not just over the top violence that you may find in a quentin tarantino movie this violence is very real its horrifying to watch hundreds of soldiers die in the ohama beach scene but without that brutality this movie wouldnt have worked it needed to affect its audience it needed to provide a realistic look at world war ii and it worked,reality
this film contains one of the best war scenes i have ever seen i am talking about the dday the landing and the effort of the americans to break germans defenses it is so realistic plenty of shooting bombing killing really breathtaking i have read many history books and articles and i think the recreation of this battle is epic i can admit that since i first saw this movie when i read a new article regarding this battle the scenes of this movie come in mind only a few movies or serials have so intense battle depictionsone that comes in mind is the serial band of brothers of course not only this part of the movie but the whole movie is worth to be seen enjoy it surely recommend it,reality
this movie set the benchmarks of how world war ii was to a whole new level i mean if you look at how dramatic this movie is the level of realism and in fact how touching this story is youll never want to see another ww2 movieprimarily i like the big names in this movie they are not to bad in fact they are more than ok spielberg has managed to bring a crew together and make them act like they are brothers in armsthe effects are stunning the whole camera shaking dirt exploding the landscapes and the small towns i remember playing medal of honor back in those days and it was if they were made by the same person the exact outfits guns helmets etc,reality
ive been an avid fan of war films ever since i was a kid i was fond of seeing movies where soldiers are holding out on their own and winning against their opponent even though the odds are overwhelmingly against them thats why when i got to see spielbergs i instantly got hooked the realism of the movie is great and it showed me another side of the war  its gruesomeness it made me realize that no matter what rank or whether that person is of utmost importance it wont matter in front of a speeding bullet heading towards his head or a mortar about to land near him the way the movie was depicted blownoff body parts and all was very real that it sometimes made me shiver whenever i think that i was that person getting shot  lucky me huh the portrayal of each of the cast was unbelievably real especially that part where the general was about to send that letter tos mother and his story  i really got emotional right there well im not going to spoil you the details especially if you havent watched it yet the movie is a must watch and there are numbers that can prove it in a nutshell is a movie that deserves to be called the best,reality
one of the remarkable piece of movie marvel by steven spielberg if spielberg has added the directorial ingredient then tom hanks has ensured the perfect cooking of the added ingredient the movie scores highly on emotional content by balancing the war scenarios added onto that is the amazing music given by john williams which further takes the movie to new heights in fact the music resonates with the heart and soul of the viewer and delivers the essence of this fine art remarkably the last few words by capt miller james earn this earn it really leave the profound impact on the heart reaching out to the every nook and corner of it tom hanks has always been a treat to eyes and i was never disappointed after watching his movies and this movie escalates him to the newer heights at the end a worth movie to watch for ,reality
to call this movie a masterpiece is an understatement what spielberg has done here has transcended the viewing of a motion picture and created an experience in movie making this is emotional unbelievable storytelling and a depiction of a war that makes you feel like you are there now is this the most original story ever told no the storm of normandy has been shown before the story has been told before this is pretty much another story like that of the brothers sullivan who are talked about in the moviehowever  it has never been depicted like this ever the first thirty minutes of this movie will have you glued to the screen if there is popcorn in front of you it will not be getting touched let alone passed anywhere it is brutal real amazing shocking true and for a movie the most real battle scene ever put on screen spielberg puts you on the beach the sounds alone envelope you this is a movie for the big screen and surround sound also i must mention the amazing john williams musical score is nothing less then brilliant accompanying the visuals on screen that music alone tells such an emotional fantastic storyactual war veterans who lived through this part of our history said for the most part that what you are seeing on screen by spielberg is the closest thing ever depicted of that war besides actually being there some could not finish watching the scene so if you want to see a movie that is so much more then a movie see this it centers around one of the most important wars if not the most important for this country and the rest of the world to be clear though this movie is not just about that war the story is told during that time period of our history centering on this one battalions search for a manok how about the rest of the movie the searching and hopefully the rescue of private excellent you will be interested and want to know what happens a great cast and masterful movie making keep you glued to the end oh and mr spielberg does a fantastic job in book ending this movie with two wonderful scenes that tie it all togetheri original saw this with my dad on its original release in theaters after the movie i asked him what he thought he literally could not speak for like twenty minutes you walk away experiencing something so much more then a movie a small glimpse of our history and us as human beings enduring all the horror war laughter tears and ultimately family and love that keep us wanting to go on,reality
wow ive seen this movie once before and i decided to watch it again this evening and it had the same effect on me that it did the first time i watched it is a movie that stays with you long after you watch itit is affecting and moving gritty and powerful you watch this film and you see the hell that is waryou see what it does to people it dehumanizes them  it strips away their moral compass their valuesthe movie is violent and sickeningly realistic but its violence and graphic scenes are not numbing you are never detached from the what the soldiers are going through you watch the action unfold and you are there you are there feeling the pain of the soldierssteven spielberg has once again drawn us in emotionally to the story just as he did with schindlers list he uses his gift for compelling story telling and character development to immerse us in the storyto make us care for the charactersthe acting was top notch as well tom hanksas capt john miller did an amazing jobprobably one of his best rolesbesides forrest gump and philadelphia as did matt damon private the whole cast was perfect and fit right into each of their roles the underlying score of john williams one of my favorite score composerset jurassic park star wars etcwas used in the right momentscreating tension and at other times tugging at your heart stringsone of the best movies by spielberg and one of the best wwii moviesnot the best but one of them,reality
this movie is excellent historically accurate great cast i specifically started an account on imdb so i could write a review on this movie the only bit that made me cry was at the end when miller whispers to those words great film would recommend it to anyonespoiler alert the film is very strong emotionally in the death scenes especially at the end where miller dies and i cried a lot it is very gory in many parts especially the beach scene and the bridge fight which is very intense and results in 3 main characters dying unfortunatelythis is hand down my favorite movie of all time and would recommend it to anyone interested in those sorts of films,reality
growing up i knew that my family had a lot of history in the united states marine corps and the us army my grandfather and his brother were soldiers in the pacific and my grandmothers brothers were marines alongside them my grandfather would often be asked about what happened over there and he always just bowed his head swallowed hard and told half truths and besidethepoint stories to appease whoever asked never truly telling any of us what he and his fellow americans were heroesi had often wondered myself why my grandfather wouldnt talk about wwii but one day in my us history class in high school i got my answer this film opened my eyes to the horrors of war i sat in shock as the gore exploded in front of me wondering how soldiers and marines like those in my family lived or whats more were able to cope with the events that made them heroesmy point with all of this is that in this day and age we as a society are so accustomed to violence that we dont really realize what fighting men go through in times of war we see 10 soldiers killed in iraq on the news but it doesnt really register to us as civilians this was spielburgs goal in making this film he wanted to show all of us what fighting men go through for us you and me every american citizen should see this film to truly understand what it takes to keep us safeas far as the film itself goes it is absolutely amazing no film is perfect but the actors are incredibly convincing in their roles the emotion is there the battle recreations are realistic and as they were in life and the cinematography is outstanding its very obvious that everyone involved with this film was dedicated to making it a tribute to the veterans and it is without any shadow of a doubt the best war movie ever madeone thing to note is that this is not a film for your kids or a film to watch casually it is intense and should be treated as such1010,reality
i visited the forums read reviews in imdb read reviews of critics talked to the people around me and as i see people are not excited about the movie like me it means that they dont see the greatness of the movie or are there some other reasons i want to give the example of the terminator 2 if you have seen the movie you know that according to many people it is the greatest action movie ever made in imdb you cannot see an user easily who gives a low rating or says that it was not a very good movie firstly i want to talk about that why is not appreciated in its genre war like the terminator 2 people are very cold towards this movie as if it is just an usual but good or pretty good movie or they say that omaha beach sequence was cool enough but the rest was bad now at this point i want to say that now i am writing a review on the movie which to me one of the greatest movies of all time this is pure cinema maybe not a work of art but a truly cinematic experience direction the cinematography editing art direction sound sound editing and visual effects briefly miseenscene are great the shots are great you know if a war movie includes action people say that disliked it because it was not an anti war movie and also it shows war artistic but what if this is the style of the director the thin red line was also very artistic but is this really a flaw returning to the content or the messages of the film people say propaganda militarist one sided etc as a person who got sick of hearing historically inaccurate or this movie is propaganda i dont care about ideology while thinking about this movie as for one sided criticism always the same it shows the enemy side as evil does somebody have to make two movies like clint eastwood if he makes a war movie well if you ask me no by the way the scene which the german soldier sings an american march is criticized so people say spielberg humiliates germans if you want to read it like that do it but to me it was an unforgettable and tragicomic scene the best or the most horrible dday interpretation is here at this point as said before a lot of people think that just omaha beach sequence was just cool i think it is more than that also the structure of the movie is very different than many mainstream movies which is another success lastly in the middle of the movie there is a sequence it rains and later they find a little girl that sequence should be taught in cinema history lessons especially for the people who are planning to be a director,reality
best of war movies i had ever seenexcellent story line  excellent acting from tom hanks he should have received oscar for the film vin diesel role is a not that much highlight in the movie but he played his part nicelyits the one of the greatest war movie ever made this movie comes in the line with black hawk down  we were soldiers another excellent movie from one of the best director in the world stephen spielbergwith inclusion of some sentiments with the war the 1st 30mins in omaha beach looks like realistic war so i recommend every one to watch the movie for the people who are interested in war moviesover all 1010 must watch movie,reality
steven spielberg accomplished something here something that may rival schindlers list as his masterpiece and the greatest work he ever did in his extraordinary career here with this film he shows a side of world war ii we all have read about but never saw while he couldnt completely make it a reality watching this movie is about as close as any of us will get to experiencing such historical events like dday that being said this is so much more than just a film that chronicles the story of eight men sent to find one in the germancontrolled areas of france spielberg here paints a picture of the price and the consequences of war and certainly doesnt glamorize anything the first half hour of the film is almost exclusively set right in the middle of the action as us forces storm omaha beach and try to stay alive amidst the torrential downpour of bullets and bombs this scene alone earned spielberg the best director oscar and makes this film one of the great war films of all time still he takes it to another level and gives us characters that we can view as simple everyday men on a mission that they dont believe in trying to find a man they know or care nothing about to be frank this is more than a film it is more than an experience it is a lesson on war and the complications it brings and the sacrifice it requires that is what makes this a classic and maybe the best war film ever made these men gave all they could and something most of us will never have to worry about they gave their lives and in turn saved so many,reality
many of us cant truly say we know what world war ii looked like but i would venture to say that steven spielberg gives us a pretty good idea with spielberg in his second attempt to capture the wwii era on the big screen has made a movie that plays out like the telling of a war story and in the combat scenes latching back on to a sense of harsh reality with violence and the death of many soldiersworthy of the most praise is the incredibly welldeserved second oscar win for the team of spielberg and janusz kaminski the two have done everything together and this is certainly a high point of their partnership the cinematography really captures a war that is both dark and in the case of dday legendary rarely do most films capture a spirit of war that is scary and also beautiful without glorifying the war or its soldiershere is wear succeeds as a truly strong war film and probably the best depiction of world war ii battle in history the characters are strong and while they seem to be more like characters when they dont fight they react like people when they are forced to do their jobs not like super soldiers with the exception of barry peppers character but that only makes the film better by rounding out the way different soldiers viewed the warthe themes are incredibly strong thanks to this depiction of violence the universal idea of fighting for something or obeying orders when you dont understand why is perfectly interpolated by the band of soldiers sent to find private and in that way it requires every viewer to forcibly reconcile that which a soldier in any war must do those of us who arent veterans should consider ourselves fortunate to only have to ponder it and not actually come to terms with it,reality
this is one of many of my favorite tom hanks movies and also steven spielbergs too this is movie is rated as the best war movie ever made and i felt same after watching this moviethe especialty of this movie is the characters in the movie and all the actors played their part with par excellence the movie is very much able to show the grief of the mothers and families major attraction of the movie also includes the combat scenes from the moviealthough people can say that tom hanks character as the lead or main role of the movie but i say that all characters were major in this movie and that was because steven spielberg distributed the screen space so well between all the characters of the movie that you never feel that any of the character is left out or suppressedtom hanks character is filled of different shades where he shows his intelligence with some brilliant strategy to win the battle at the coast then at the same character can seen weeping in the middle of battle field remembering his life post the warthe dialogs in the movie are also very touching i personally really liked the scene when the army supreme dont remember much about him reads out a letter by president abraham lincoln showing condolence to the a mother who lost all of her kids in the war for the nationif you have not seen this movie due to any reason then i would recommend you to buy a dvd and watch it with whole family,reality
just leave it up to the genius of a master like steven spielberg to depict ww ii in all its gruesomeness chaos and inhumanity this is about the only warmovie that i have ever seen where you just simply become stunned overwhelmed and shocked by a pandemonium of apocalyptic pictures sounds and dialogs who ring nothing but true this film doesnt shy away from stating a simple message the message that war dehumanizes the human mind and bares open a bestiality that ponders on the verge of uneducated seaweed in terms of emotions i congratulate you steven spielberg for being brave and courageous in your way of showing us that war is hell that it is tedious brutal sometimes even boring but most important of all definitely no laughing matter this honest and depressing examination of the human condition should definitely have won the bestpictureoscar in 1980 oh wait i just realized that this isnt the commentboard for 1941 sorry my mistake,reality
great movie from a great director but what else is new i really like the movie and i will tell you why but let me first quote the even greater charles bukowski you begin saving the world by saving one man at a time all else is grandiose romantism or politics well lets emphasis on the romantism because romantism is the genre of this movie why what do the soldiers represent in the war  the simple man the simple man in extraordinary circumstances  romantism a genre in literature the war is the extraordinary circumstance and the one man at a time is private now most of the negativism about the movie comes from the grandiose story but spielberg presents the story with historical facts so the film doesnt feel too distant or too hollywood the camera follows the actors in the sand and the piles of dead bodies we see guts blood limbs we see from their point of view while the battle unfolds spielberg has always had an eye for the photography but here he puts it to the limit his vision is undeniable because its personal and because its a movie it brings out a world before the viewers eyes and they cant judge the characters who by the way are perfectly created by the actors tom hanks in a blowingourmindsofperformance because its an extraordinary circumstance in which the simple man tries to figure out a way to survive or to do the right thingin the end the old ask if he has lived a good life if he is a good person if he has earned it as capt miller aka tom hanks told him before he died in a way the movie is philosophical but i think that it is more like a book you read it and think about it  what it means and what it is about in contexts means because its a great movie it does what a great movie does  says what it suppose to say,reality
in my opinion is the most entertaining and realistic war movie you can find to have been released it takes place during ww2 and starts out with the invasion of normandy known as dday shown as excruciatingly violent right after this 8 men receive a mission to find a private because his other three brothers have already died in the war the men begin to wonder why the 8 of them are risking their lives to save just another soldier tom hank gives a very good performance as the leader of the team who keeps the group together when things start to go wrong tom sizemore is the second man in command ed burns is the soldier who doesnt like the mission more than anyone of them adam goldberg barry pepper and jeremy davies are three other soldiers in the group vin diesel and giovonni ribisi are the two men who die before they find private played by matt damon the movie is 2 and 34 hours long but move along fast and ends before you know it if you have not seen this movie then you are missing out on something special,reality
is such a powerful and necessary film and one everyone should watch at one point in their lifeits a simple story a small group of soldiers are given a mission to retrieve the last surviving of four brothers from behind enemy lines in france the symbolism of this story and of himself are profound and personal for all of us today who are partakers of the rights and freedoms given to those liberated by the allied invasion of europe the graphic depiction of what these men went through to establish that freedom gives us a difficult reminder of how much we each as individuals owe these men  veterans that are still with us actually went through this i remember feeling so grateful for their sacrifice and i left the cinema not so much entertained but shaken the depth and accuracy of this film remains a testament and a tribute to those brave people and not the filmmakers themselves the acting is honest and superb and the characters are as rich and interesting and ordinary as the real soldiers they could represent the first time i watched this it was difficult to watch and there were several times when i had to just look away a technical marvel an incredible achievement for steven spielberg who remains for me the greatest filmmaker ever,reality
after directing such films as jaws et and schindlers list i dont think that anybody thought that steven spielberg could do anything betterwell he didthe greatest war film ever made is undoubtedly spielbergs masterpiece forget that it lost the best picture academy award to the utterly forgettable shakespeare in love this film transcends all other war films before it and will continue to be the standard for all war films after itfrom the very first gunshot on the beaches of normandy which is still the most shockingly brilliant scene in any movie in history until the final shot is fired in the small french town at the end of the movie quite possibly the 2nd most shockingly brilliant scene in history the movie grabs your attention and refuses to let go you squirm as the camera follows brave soldiers into the heat of battle out of fear of being shot yourself and you feel each soldiers pain when one of their own falls in combat after privates thank you to captain miller at the end of the movie we cant help but thank captain miller along with him and we thank spielberg too for creating one of the best films of all time for us to enjoy,reality
this is a film nobody will forget if your not a war film fan like me you will still love this amazing 5 time oscar winner master piece by steven spielberg all of steven spielbergs film i basically loved and that is why i saw this film because steven is a god in filmmaking he is coming out with another film this year transformers and i cant wait to see it because i know it will be spectacular when this film came out on dvd i immediately went to buy it this is probably my brothers favorite film ever made but i still have to wait and see what i see to make my final decision this film is so realistic about the war that when i first saw it it made me cry in some parts,reality
i have read several critiques of this movie claiming that the opening sequence and continuing doctrine are unrealistic these experts claim that the opening scene is far too bloody and doesnt accurately describe what the fighting would have been like and that the standard operating procedures of the squad are hollywoodi challenge these experts to put aside their ideology and bias and look at how a military operation actually works and what is involvedthe normandy invasion was the largest movement of troops and personal in the history of the world and that mere accomplishment stands with the building of the pyramids or the hanging gardens it was a classic case of being willing to pay the butchers bill for a victory saying that there were only 10 casualties is accurate but it is an insult to the bravery of the 34250 men that landed on the most heavily fortified real estate in the world and especially to those going in the first wave where casualties were known to be the highest in some cases over 80 34250 men dont all step off onto the beach at the same timeopens with the first wave of troop carriers going on to omaha beach the defenders are there waiting for them and therefore the casualty rates among these units will be high the opening scene accurately describes this my grandfather was part of the second wave onto omaha and his eyewitness testimony confirms thisthe breakdown of us casualties was 1465 dead 3184 wounded 1928 missing presumed dead and 26 captured in the annals of american history only antietam ranks higher in american casualties suffered in a single dayseveral airborne rangers ive interviewed including my father  grandfather remark on the realism of the squads interaction these were not people sneaking through a jungle afraid of being ambushed these were men that knew that surrounding territory was largely abandoned or populated by french that are hoping to be liberated virtually any patrol they encounter would be mechanized and be audible miles awayas for being able to pick up a radio and contacts unit to get him out units in world war ii were often out of radio contact for days occasionally weeks at a time and had to operate autonomously there were no gps satellites and no cell phones many soldiers didnt understand french or german getting lost was common and a wrong turn would mean hours of delay and confusion while i cant say the mission made a lot of sense to me from a military point of view once the mission was ordered this was about the only way it could have been carried outand yes rank insignia was displayed in muted color on helmets of officers just as it is today,reality
this is my favourite film of all time by a long shot steven spielberg got this movie spot on it is the most real seeming war film i think there is to date with the horrific dday opening scene blowing me away i really do feel for the american and other allies that fought in wwii i pay great respect for fighting for our freedomother note is the soundtrack again john williams has done this spot on in fact the soundtrack to this film was the first movie soundtrack i brought it is a very emotional soundtrack which i have listened to many times all ten tracks are amazing and its very hard to pick a favourite from them although 1 hymn to the fallen 2 revisiting normandy 3 omaha beach 4wades death are most probably my favourites this is a must see and must own film i rarely rate films 1010 but this sure means that score 1010,reality
wellas a girl i thought that as a war movie i would hate however it ended up being a very gripping and powerful movie the cast the directing and everything is just amazing and o my gosh i love all the actors in it edward burns and tom sizemore are my favorites personally bet the entire cast really went well together it was jipped when it didnt win the best picture oscar for 1998 i mean shakespeare in love is a great movie but i think that the patriotism exemplified in is far more worthy of an oscar than a romance film this is a great movie and i highly recommend it to anyone who can handle violence and would like to see war portrayed in its most realistic form,reality
after the assault on omaha beach a group of us soldiers led by cpt miller hanks are sent on a mission to retrieve the sole surviving brother damon success will earn them the right to return homeafter giving a definitive representation of the holocaust with the excellent schindlers list and of slavery with amistad spielberg surprised the world again is a synergy of old men on a mission style war films yet completely redefined how conflicts are to be portrayed on film the film set a tone of savagery violence and futility that has marked all war films since and was perfected in ridley scotts awesome black hawk down as a visualist and action director spielberg can count this film as yet another resounding triumph whenever the tension goes up as in the horrific opening battle cinemas most visceral 20 minutes or the closing siege surpasses almost any war film in existencethe film is sadly not without its problems and it is truly regrettable that robert rodats script isnt up to the standards of spielbergs direction whenever the tension dies down and leaves room for character moments the film comes dangerously close to silliness or sappiness ticking many of the worst genre clichs in ways that could make it seem like a flagwaiver despite the obvious overall absurdity the film tries to convey it is a tribute to the acting talents of damon burns ribisi sizemore and especially hanks that the film survives such moments even if a lame last scene undermines the films powerdespite its flaws has proved its importance and relevance through the considerable influence it has had on cinema action,reality
is not meant to glorify war rather it tries to show the audience the pain and suffering of not soldiers but peoplebeginning with the fateful dday which has influenced popular video games and other war movies a company of soldiers is given the mission of pulling a private out from the war front confused and annoyed at this objective the soldiers travel across normandy in search of someone they never knew let alone cared aboutthe band of soldiers have a hard time coming to terms with such an obscure mission however they cannot bail out of the objective after all they are in the army obeying orders can be the difference between winning or losingsteven spielberg masterfully creates a duality in the characters at once they are soldiers yet at heart they are only civilians the cast of characters are exceptional captain miller played by tom hanks keeps the group together and just wants to get the objective over and done with pvt daniel jackson barry pepper is the godfearing soldier who believes his lord has given him such talent with the sniper rifle pvt richard reibens edward burns is the one who questions the authority and feels the mission is unnecessary and the rest round up the company beautifully these men are not cookie cutter soldiers they talk with each other have feelings reflect upon their actions spielberg brings out the other side of the men at war and this is what the audience especially war veterans can relate tothe direction is great spielbergs shots are moving war is dirty and horrifying and the bonding between the soldiers are sensitive scenes the cinematography is excellent some of the best i have seen from any movie the sound aspects are just as good if not better in depicting the harshness of waris a movie not to be missed partly because it is arguably the greatest war movie ever made and partly because it will deter those from the idea of another great war,reality
im a high school student and recently before a trip to visit the dday beaches in normandy we had a vet who was a medic on dday come in and talk to our class we asked him about his experiences at dday and he was disinclined to talk too much about it but said that the first 20 minutes of were like a newsreel he even told a story briefly about trying to save a man dragging the man behind him only to discover after a little ways that he only had the top half of the man and that the rest had been blown off which was actually depicted in the movie i really appreciated the artistic qualities of the movie as well the muted color added a somber atmosphere to the movie and the way spielberg used realistic equipment and sound effects really impressed me his set for the invasion was incredibly accurate when i first viewed the movie i thought it had been filmed on location thumbs up steve,reality
to see both the horrors of war and the evolution of warfarebut more affecting is the individual and group interactions of the ensemble in spr  spoken and unspoken  and spielbergs direction which made war real in its terror ambiguousness and heroismtom hanks as cap miller is the commanding officer you dream of warts and all and his command comes together around him loyally even in fubar situations in a group of outstanding and heartbreaking performancesthe final scenes are among the most suspenseful in war filmmaking i still get chills and feel fear as if i was on the front lines myselfif youre a vet watch with caution there are triggers if you are not a vet then make a point to watch these two movies so you can know what our vets and soldiers endure in war,reality
im usually a big fan of spielbergbut in this film he comes across as a bit to antigermanhe may have his reasons and i think he has made them clear in schindlers listand i understand his feelingsbut i think for a big epic like this it would have been better to have an unbiased portrayal of germans so the film would have been universally admiredinstead its coming across as antigerman propaganda especially when there is so much american flagwavingbeing english i have the same problem with braveheartscotsgood englishbadthis is really one dimensional character studywhich just teaches people to live in ignorancewe all need to learn to move onsurely its better to make films every culture is going to relate toflag waving just promotes arrogance which leads to looking down on othersthe other big problem i have with this film is that the brits are not mentionedor if we are i must have missed iti must have blinkedthis was a decisive battle and i know like thousands of other brits we were involvedso whats the big ideait would be like us making a film about the somme or ypes and not bothering to mention the canadian and australian involvementthat would be unforgivable,reality
i got this film on dvd for my birthday and i couldnt wait to watch it because i had heard some stuff about the movie being very good after i saw it i had a much better understanding of how bad war really is i mean you show a seen at omaha beach on jun 61944 and the moment the ramps go down already the first three or four rows of solider literally get blown to bits after that you see more solider get shot killed and wounded until some solider finally get up to the bunkers and take out the naziss and to top all that off you see the beach after it covered with dead bodies and big puddles of blood then you hear that 8 men have to save 1 man who lost all three of his brothers and after more violence you see that of the 8 men sent out only 2 are still alive i cant think of any reason why you couldnt be moved by this film this is a must see film for anyone interested in war films,reality
i am a harsh critic of movies i bash everything there is rarely a movie that i can sit down and watch and enjoy because most are crude and bland i never pay attention to the hype i dont carei judge a movie on what it is about what it is portraying and how well it is made before i saw it didnt interest me i liked dramas and war flicks and stories but i was just never interested in seeing because of the titleone day however my mother rented the flick and i decided to watch it manthe opening scene was a shocker it also really showed how that day went down i find it fascinating how capt john miller takes charge a soldier asks him wheres the rallying point miller respondsanywhere but here i mean thats how you feel right there like they need to get off that forsaken beach its neat how you get to see the characters in action on the beach before you even get into the main plot so many different things happen in the movie i pay attention and every time i watch it i see something new ive probably seen it 2030 times i dont know why anyone would want to bash it it is well directed and well acted it takes place during a time that should be well respected it wasnt weak because it left so much of the other fighting in the war out it is called not the documentary of world war 2 even though it is almost like a documentary its about a mission that is unlike other missions its about finding a soldier and getting him the hell out of there its not about fighting with the british to save france and the whole allied powers from hitler it was based on something smaller but at the same time larger a mothers love for her son and how even in the military they respect that we all got mothers and how terrible would they feel if they lost all their sons even cpt millers squad was taught respect from the matter they questioned it and some disagreed and sure they would rather be out fighting the war but that was their orders and they had to follow after all if they found and made it out of that forsaken crap whole of a mess maybe then they would all earn the right to go home anyway i would just like to say i think all the characters are great it was vin diesels best movie i think his only good movie even though he was the first of millers men to die pvt jackson i think he is many peoples favorite the way he takes down the sniper that kills caparzo diesel and battles in the church tower at the battle for the bridge nothing can describe the way tom hanks reacts when he sees the church tower get hit by the tank round he feels sorrow because of the loss of such a fine sniper but he just keeps shooting i like how reiben doesnt care about the mission at first and even steps out of line he learns what its all about though and he even saves at the end from a tank sgt horvath what a great actor tom siezmore hanks couldnt ask for a better partner you can really feel the relationship between miller and horvath like when capt miller steps out to create a diversion and machine gun fire rains down but miller gets out of the way in time and horvath sayscaptain if your mother saw you do that shes be very upset then hanks repliesi thought you were my mother loli believe out of all the men in millers squad horvath is hit by the most rounds he showed the mentality of a brave soldier that died for his men obviously upham was the sensitive type that finally killed someone in the end mellish portrayed a good soldier that did also seem a bit sensitive as he cries while finding a hitler youth knifehe is jewish so i guess hes not really sensitive just effected greatly by the events because of his ethnicity of course wade was also well portrayed when he died it was the saddest anyway in the end captain john miller tries to blow up the bridge but a tank round launches debris and sends everything into chaos miller then tries to retrieve the detonator and is shot on the bridge where he falls he then sits up and takes his pistol out and starts shooting at the tank that is about to cross the bridge the tank explodes and in amazement miller looks up to see the angels on our shoulders p51 tank busters fly over head then with his last breath he says to james earn thisearn it and then it goes to james as an old man in the memorial in france with thousands of crosses and he is of course kneeling down in front of millers cross with the rest of millers squads crosses trying to make peace with their sacrifice for his life james then looks at his wife and says tell me ive lead a good life tell me im a good man then she repliesyou are and it really makes me think about how i should live that those died to save me that i need to be a good man and respect what i have because so many others lost their lives just so i could go home to wrap it up had everything some comedy drama love action and even some good looking dames you cant deny that jamess daughters were some good looking ladies anyway i didnt know a movie could be that good until i saw go stephen spielberg,reality
where to begin i have to say that is a modern masterpiece and that negative criticism is basically aimed at opportunities which failed to make this the greatest movie ever madethe plot is simple  captian miller played by tom hanks and his squad of soldiers are given a new assignment following the normandy invasion to find private james played by matt damon who happened to be a paratrooper of the 101st airbornethe war scenes despite being truly upsetting and gruesomely realistic are visually fantastic the attention to detail by spielberg is fantastic the full frame is filled with explosions and whizzing bullets not to mention with the main subject however there is not one british soldier in france not a single soldier this definitely doesnt overshadow what i personally think is one of the best movies ever madethe movie has no message the movie is more sentimental acknowledging the past and what our older generation went through in order to keep our country safe as well as to protect our current or their future generation we all know we owe it all to those soldiers all we can do is mourn our losses and appreciate with all of our hearts the soldiers that made it back home and in a way this film brings people together dont watch this with elderly family members otherwise youll embrace a several sad and soppy momentsthe acting is brilliant watching soldiers cry is extremely disturbing in my opinion they fight against their will to survive in order to complete their mission and fulfil a strategy and when you are told to duck you do duck fantastic movie if you liked band of brothers and felt thin red line could of been better youll faint by the effort poured into this excellent filmpocket yourself with cash and rent it now,reality
best film ive ever seen ive seen it so many times and i never get bored touching action filled and so true this film is the best and greatest film to be made in a long time this is one of the true masterpieces of our time ive herd people saying that all these modern war films our better but i still stick to the old true original classics this is one of spielbergs greatest films to be produced a timeless classici hadnt seen it in quite awhile today my brother put it on and i just sat and watched not caring about anything else if u havent seen it go now1010,reality
giovannis acting was wonderful in this moviethe best ive seen when he died he made it so real i cried for 15 minutes and im not exaggerating at all besides hes hot who likes it when the hot guy dies i know i dont hes very talented he was very good throughout the whole movie really the only reason i started this account was to comment on him sorry i keep babbling this has to be 10 lines long have you seen gone in 60 seconds that movie is awesome and have you seen him on friends as frank jr hes really airheaded but so adorable but this is definitely the hottest ive seen him so bottom line is hes really hot especially in saving private,reality

i dont care what anyone says about classic movies and im all for the classics but this movie is definitely in the top 10 of all time seeing this movie in the theater was absolutely hypnotic i felt as though i was going through everything the characters in the movie went through and when i was walking home i distinctly remember feeling a sense of what is probably shell shock i remember thinking whats the point to everything which is something people often struggle through after going to war this work is more than a movie its an experience sadly its not possible to get quite such an intense feeling when watching it at home unless you have a terrific home theater the giant screen i saw this movie on added to the incredible effect of the movie which fully enveloped me in the world of the storythe opening scene is one of the best scenes ever put to film if you dont already know what the scene is about or even if you do and you have not seen this movie go out and rent it right now turn out all the lights and make sure you are absolutely comfortable and ready to give the movie your full attention the opening scene is one you will never forget it felt like i was right there next to em,reality
i commented on this in a different thread but i thought that it deserved mentioning again how can any of you think that the german soldier upham shoots at the end of the movie isnt the same one he convinced cpt miller to let go earlier aside from looking exactly like him and dont reply some crap about that being just a coincidence and thats what all germans look like he says uphams name when he is pleading for his life how would the soldier know uphams name and dont reply he read it on his uniform just to try to make a point just because a smart ass idea popped into your head and you are more than willing to start a fight over the internet you fat attention seeking nerd  the german obviously said uphams name in a desperate attempt to get upham to let him go again aside from that all of a sudden for no reason upham grows balls and decides to kill this one german and let all the rest go he shot him because he recognized him as the same german from earlier and thats what allowed upham the nads to finally shoot someone yes i know that im being redundant by calling those who seek to pick fights over the internet fat nerds please no replies telling me this,reality
this academy award winning best picture of 1998 contains the grittiest most graphic war scenes ive ever seen on film on top of that the film quality is pristine and the highspeed equipment used to shoot the movie is nothing short of groundbreaking in the war genre that being the case does the artistic quality of automatically overshadowsurpass the other movies of 1998 like american history x or run lola run for example perhaps sostill as i attribute the entire 8 stars to artistic merit the last two gaping empty stars must be addressed the premise that the movie is based upon namely the mission of bringing back one soldier to his mother mandated by the war department is simply something i cannot swallow whats the word i want to use to describe how i feel about the impetus for the movie its not cheesy nor is it saccharine i feel as if its an insult to my intelligence let me spell this out word for wordfirst of all i simply dont understand why history has been racked with so many wars im not rabidly antiwar per se i just want to understand why the people of one nation collectively want to kill the people of another nation imdb is not the place to discuss such issues at length so lets assume for now that wars are fought for any of a million reasons defense propagation of freedom power resources territory maybe the utter lack of something better to donow here is my gripe with which otherwise is a masterpiece if the war department is focusing all of its energy and machinery on the above mentioned war objectives is it plausible for them to really care about one kid or his mother i am curious how the parents of american soldiers killed in iraq feel when they watch this movie i just cannot for one second believe that the american defense department would go to such lengths for any single individualrather than swallow this implausible premise hook line and sinker i would more enjoy a film that exposes the real modus operandi behind bloodthirsty war machinery platoon or apocalypse now are considered classics and rightly so given the grimy mood each depicts but despite is technologically phenomenal production is too heavy with the flagwaving patriotic dreamworks score and tells a story youd only find off the shelves of disney corporation  one that is sugarcoated at the core and just plain fantasyjyjimboduckdotcom,reality
as i started watching this movie i was grabbed by the battle on omaha beach because of speilbergs vision of the scenario as always spielberg will get you excited with his movie and not let go he will add in wonderful visuals and just simply amaze you with his realistic perspectivewithin the first scene i thought i wouldnt see another gun battle that great in my whole life but likely enough there was an even better one at the end of the movie when they find privatdamon and he says he wont leave his men behind after tells them he is not going hanks has to prepare for another battle probably the most exciting and intense one everone thing you have to take into perspective is that john williamscomposer of film was one of the people who made this movie intense with his wonderful score to keep you intrigued throughout i was happy for spielberg when he one best director for the second timeprevious for schindlers list but i thought this should have won best picture and best actor for hanks if you have not already seen this movie i suggest you see it asap because it is absolutely amazing 10 out of 10,reality
spoilerswhen that legendary british statesman winston churchill stated never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few he was of course referring to the battle of britain skipping forward through the war and eventually the allies would succeed in that momentous occasion of dday landing on the beaches of normandy the british american and other allied forces would eventually free europe from the tyranny of the fascists war has never been simple however and once in a while a form of publicity mission might take place an incident where during all the blood loss soldiers would take risks to save one man just so his mother doesnt loose all of her children its always been a strange american military policy in the eyes of many but as shows there are times it happensin spielbergs epic war film tom hanks plays captain john miller former school teacher and now war veteran miller survives the dday landings only to be ordered to go and retrieve a private john f matt damons three elder brothers have all died in the last week and the army aware of this wants the remaining brother to return home against millers better judgement he travels with about nine men to find and return him safely to his motherrightly earned steven spielberg his second directing oscar and arguably should have won more this film is a powerful piece which is at times moving at times strenuous and always going to keep you glued to the screen with an enormous cast of well known actors some which youll know the names of and some youll recognise the faces the film is never short of someone who can deliver a line its not these lines which really hit home as much though as the most crucial and most powerful scene in this entire movie is the opening thirty minutes during the landings themselves theres no way someone who was born forty years after the end of the war is going to be able to tell you how realistic this film was but if the events were anything like the film depicted then the younger generations should be immensely grateful to have never had to taken part in anything similarperhaps the one problem with is an element of bias theres always someone around britain who claims the rest of the allies could have won the war without america just like theres americans who claim they did the majority of the victory and are owed everyone elses eternal gratitude the truth of the matter is that neither person is right if america had never got involved then it is likely that just like the rest of europe britain would have fallen to germany ultimately however with american help the british still played a massive part in the war and earned praise as much as any country the problem is that this film seems to ignore this fact if tom hanks soldiers had travelled around the french countryside and met mostly americans but also a few british there would have been less problems the flaw is that this film appears at times to imply that the entire second world war involved purely the americans the french and the germans there is not a single british person in sight in this entire film churchill would not have approved and countless other brits dont eitherthis lack of british involvement has perhaps slightly hampered at times but this is a mistake whether this film is extremely over patriotic or not beginning and ending with the american flag for example that does not take away from it as a beautiful piece of cinema with amazing cinematography excellent acting and sturdy directing is understandably in the top ten war films of all time if perhaps a child is ever to act ungrateful about the age in which we now live in his or her parents should show them to shut them up life was hell for so many people during the war and it feels that perhaps sometimes we forget that this film will be talked about for decades to come,reality
not only the best war movie but probably the most realistic movie where man confronts death i have seen every movie on the subject of violence gore war etc and though this is not a gore fest just for the sake of showing blood the blood and gut aspect rates up with any for realism such as it is war is bloody and this shows itlet me make one thing clear this does not mean the movie isnt top notch every where else in fact thats the reason the bloody fighting is so real because the acting and directing brings it to life spielberg has to be totally commended as i cant think of one director aside of maybe ron howard who could have brought the realism to film that this winner doestom hanks is absolutely outstanding it is in his 3 top best and may be his finest thats up for others to decide never the less he is superb but he is not the only one tom sizemore who i think never gets enough credit is fantastic as well as is ed burns in fact i have to rate this as the best supporting cast in any movie i have ever seen they are that good they just feed off each other and it shows in every scenespeaking of scenes there are literally dozens of outstanding ones in this but the one that really got me was when jeremy davies who plays cpl upham he played his character so good i wanted to strangle him for his cowardice cant muster the courage to go up the stairs and help adam goldberg who played pvt mellish another outstanding acting job in his fight with the german soldier i actually was holding my breath when the german was slowly plunging the knife into mellishs chest and whispering to him to shh shh shh thus killing himwithout doubt a movie for all time as far as realism and just plain great acting direction production sets etc etc etc this is as good as any there has ever been made i rate it 5 out of 5no make that 6 out of 5 awesome is the only way i can describe it i have watched it at least 5 times and never get bored,reality
best war movie ever made  please  go watch full metal jacket platoon ran apocalypse now das boot or any other film made by a director with a true understanding of artistry in filmmaking  spielbergs sycophants make me sickis best when spielberg sticks to what he is actually good at to wit action  i wholeheartedly admit that the two big battle scenes are breathtaking  however two scenes do not a movie make everything else was  duller than dull  no profound insight  nothing but cookie cutter characters cheesy dialogue and mindless flag waving  if this film was the only source of knowledge about americans that someone had she would come away with the conclusion that americans sure are a bunch of cornballs  but we can shoot people pretty adeptly cant wespielberg go back to making et and raiders of the lost ark and save the heavy stuff for real directors  that is all610 the two battle scenes warrant a 6,reality
three brothers in the family who have enlisted to fight in the us military in wwii have been killed in various theaters of war  as the military prepares to notify the mother of the deaths of her three sons they discover that theres a fourth brother  private james matt damon  a group of soldiers led by captain john miller tom hanks is sent to northern europe to find him if he is still alive and send him home  the film follows there long hard trek to find this man and then get him outthis is a great film like many of spielbergs are but i have to say it is a bit overrated  there are many great war films and i wouldnt quite but this one in the top five  definetly the top ten better than most war films but not quite the top fivethe action scenes are groundbreaking this was a first in what was considered acceptable in cinema  spielberg only focuses on this though we see what the troops go through physically but not mentally every now and then we get some strained expressions on their faces but spielberg never uses his proven film making skills to put you in these guys shoes to let you know what theyre thinkingconsequently we only get half the story  how can i put this in the top ten then  because the other half is just done so well  there are also good performances here  this is the only time i liked vin diesel remember im not knocking this film  i put it in the top ten best war films ever made  definetly a classic  i just think its stretching it when people rave that this is the best war film ever  dont let this fool you  buy a copy of this on dvd,reality
maybe my summary line was a bit harsh is not an average movie but i dont think its as great as the rest of the world seems to think yes the various battle scenes are gutwrenching but the movie overall was slightly disappointingfirstly the film is completely uscentric i think one nonamerican character a german soldier who is begging for his life at the time gets a speaking role in the film there is no indication that soldiers from other countries took part in the dday landings the american soldiers die horribly tragically heroically dramatically the german soldiers just die bang grunt thud another dead germanwe see all of the tension and fear experienced by the americans yet none of that which must have been felt by the opposing germans they were after all one and the same merely servants of opposing political masters yet the movie completely misses the chance to humanise the enemy to show that they too are just ordinary people in extraordinary circumstancesis in short a hollywood blockbuster with gory battle bits the american soldiers are the human good guys the german soldiers are the inhuman bad guys war is hell but were better at it than youi didnt hate this movie i just didnt think it was worth all of the plaudits which it has received tom hanks is of course always watchable the story rolls along nicely the battle scenes will keep you on the edge of your seat or possibly under it and the antiwar grittiness does outweigh the proamerican good vs bad slant for the record i thought the spinoff tv series band of brothers was marginally better,reality

i dislike the movie for the following reasons1 it is unrealistic 2 it is one sided 3 it is manipulative and sentimental 4 it is patriotic in the wrong way till the point that makes one puke and sympathize with the germans 5 it demonizes and dehumanizes the germans 6 it is actually a very bad movieas said this is another rubbish film about the good americans versus the evil germansthe plotif you may call it that is so flawed and biased that i could not help it but sympathize strongly with the germans and wish for the immediate and violent death of private again this resented personspielberg is exorcising his inner demons and portraying the germans as cruel monsters without a soul it was never that wayi sometimes wonder if people in usa go to school read books or are capable of impartial and independent thought are they i want to believe that there are still intelligent people in usathe rambo scene in which the americans throw mortar grenades to the german tanks made me stop watching the movie i finished it other day i found it insulting and utterly repulsive but of coursewhat can some poor evil german wretches do against private and his mariachis of course nothing entire panzer divisions would perish against this stronghold of decency morality democracy values etc now please hold on a second because i need to pukei am tired of the growing level of immorality and perversion displayed by spielberg in his movies it is all so one sided that makes you sicki actually would like to watch a movie in which a few dumb german soldiers behaving like idiots and chewing gum destroy with stones an entire american armored division this would be good fun because this is exactly what spielberg tries to convey in reverse really bad movie bordering immorality in his depiction of the german side we did not need this movie,reality
call me cynical or perhaps heartless but on second viewing of this overrated film i saw straight through it when i first saw it i was 13 years old i was angry and angst ridden and utterly impressionable the film affected me it made me rant for weeks about what evil bas the french must have been during the war and resent my french and german lessons i didnt question it because before then i hadnt even seen a movie that reached the standards of the shawshank redemption not that this is a bad film on the contrary it is beautiful and fantastic but the point remains that i was decidedly naive when i saw it fortunately i have seen the light i am now a film studies student and i have fallen in love with movies that make this one look well empty its nothing really to be honest that stanley kubrick didnt do better in full metal jacket ok i admit that the first scene is well choreographed well photographed well conceived and genuinely moving however it seems to me that there might have been better ways to go about it really someone else would have made a hugely better job of this and well done spielburg for jurassic park but i can never forgive him for inventing the blockbuster movie with jaws paving the way for big familyfun actionadventureexplosionfests grrrrrrrrrr the film was sickeningly sentimental to the point of being really corny in every american sense of the world this is accelerated by the string score which like in most big films that want to pull the heart strings it tells you tells you exactly when you should be feeling sad eugh and what exactly is with the american flag filling the screen whilst blowing in the breeze and fading to the dday landings this is such a blatant and screaming use of patriotic symbolism it doesnt make me proud it doesnt make me relate to the story it doesnt do anything but make me puke seriously dont eat me i love you really,reality

i had to watch this movie for a ww2 class in 12th grade it may not be a true story but it was still a wellmade movie the soldiers still maintained a sense of humor even when their situation looked bleak at the beginning of the movie one of the soldiers said i thought you were my mother i thought that was a great comeback and that it showed said humor also there wasnt as much gore in it as i originally thought yes there was a lot of blood but it was just the right amount for me to not get grossed out i understand that there is a lot of gore during a war but im glad spielburg limited it im not one who gets scared or grossed out easily but its not impossible for me,reality
i some times wonder if spielberg is one of those contributors to modern antisemitism in the sense that everything he does is so incredibly cheezy so oldschool outdated cinema style with all that long soggy melodrama those telltale musical effects or whatever one calls that ambient background music that changes along with the scenes in the movie this is funny because one can guess without looking at whos the director by just listening carefully 1020 minutes into the movie that spielberg is the director its literally that obvious i am not sure if uncle zoid from that one futurama episode was a deliberate satirical stab at spielberg or the same kind of outdated directors as he is but that one episode summed it up perfectly anyhoo unlike the shoah cashcow shindlers list which was made with such severe historic digressions that even shindlers actual real life family complained about it  in this movie spielberg takes on what is possibly one of the best paying gigs in the entire usviewer oriented genres of movies feelgood american war heroes not just that but in the finest way possible as in a handful of guys take on half of wehrmacht who are of course complete morons who have no idea how to shoot straight and the main aim of their heroic kd ratio of 1001 in the movie is us patriotism intensifies to save a private whos already advanced very far in the war because uncle sam said enough of his family members died ugh and while uboot was the antithesis of this movie in absolutely every regard spielberg took no notes what so ever the same way how usa today makes up historical drama about what it did or did not do the same way does spielberg make moviesso all that being said if one is not as critical then the movie is okay good enough entertainment if one closes an eye and does not think too hard but its eons away from other war movies that do not depict war the same way die hard depicts hostage situations,reality
the best and most powerful war movie everits been hailed as the best and most realistic war movie ever and it isthinking that war was this horrifying is unbelievable but it was like this and shows it in every detail this is one movie i would recommend for parents to show their kids kids need to know what war was really like instead of watching war movies where they portray it as bullet dodging  jumping through explosions fun overlooking the gore i think kids should watch it to understand and appreciate the war veterans more it sure made me appreciate them morethe opening scene is one you will never forget i am referring to the ohama beach scene of coursewhich is the most powerful scene in the movie although it is the most graphic it still is a strong sceneafter a mother loses all her sons except one eight men go behind enemy lines to save him and bring him back home to his mother guided by captain john miller the men journey into the heart of war and make it their mission to bring private home to his motherevery actor did a great job i was greatly surprised by vin diesal he did a nice performance tom hanks was excellent and matt damon was good as privatei recommend this to everyone and i mean everyone if you dont have this movie i would run out and borrow it910,reality
we saw as a family my husband who watches the war channels constantly to the extent that i walk by teasing him that ill let him know the end  the germans lose thought it was a fresh spin on traditional war movies by showing the doubts of the soldiers i thought it was just a color wwii movie as young uns refuse to see black and white movies these days i could match that this actor was playing the william bendix role this one john garfields this one roberts this one montgomery clift etcthose movies were restricted by the hays code and the need to spur war time spirit that they couldnt show doubts though i remember some revisionist movies made after about the impact on berlin another with robert taylor vs the japanese on some island or even bridge on the river kwai so they werent all jingoistici walked out of saying gee war is hell edward burns was excellentthe cinematography was terrific and compelling originally written 8261998,reality
this film displays spielbergs childish wiev of the world a wiev that has done him good in so many films but is fatal for a war epic he simply is nave in displaying the friendship the combats not to mention the actual plot which is near to being silly that combined with the lame overall acting makes this a grand disappointment 410 because of the cinematography,reality
the first time i saw this movie was in the cinema the surround sound at the landing on the normandy made me ducking scared in my seat i was panicked and could feel the soldiers fear i saw it today for the second time on my vcr i was alone but this time all my tears broke loose i now realized the lack of sense in all this killing all this waste of life these hundreds of young men dying on the shores of france a stunning and precious experience in my eyes this is the best antiwarfilm ever made no palliation no exaggeration,reality
i cant believe that this film currently rates on imdb higher than both paths of glory and platoon the latter is one of the best antiwar films ever made  by a man who was actually therespeilbergs technical mastery may be great but his characters are cardboard and his understanding of mens motivations is fatally flawed as oliver stone recognises in platoon soldiers fight for one another not a great cause as the platoon sergeant says in hamburger hill regarding the death of one of the men he died taking out that automatic weapon for you and third squad  and dont you give him anything less,reality
is an american movie from 1998 so this one will have its 20th anniversary next year the director is steven spielberg and this one is from the years that many probably consider his very best years in filmmaking it came out half a decade roughly after his probably careerdefining schindlers list but while i really love the latter this one here did not make a lasting impression on me at all i already stated in the title of my review that this may be due to personal bias as war movies are just not exactly my preferred choice knowing how it is considered such a classic however i thought why not give it a go nonetheless but i had more than just a few problems with it let me mention some the very long introduction of hanks character early on could have been left out completely if you ask me and the movie could have started with the scene where we find out that mother lost all her sons during the very same day which is admittedly not very realistic even during the days of world war ii and still it was one of the better scenes nonetheless i believe probably also because of my aforementioned bias and i was grateful for every distraction that offered more than gun shootings solider uniform and people crawling through the mud i am also not a fan of band of brothers another spielberghanks collaboration hanks was probably the biggest film star on the planet at that time after having won two oscars recently so yeah given spielberg was maybe also at the peak of his popularity this certainly could have become something tremendous and i like hanks a lot actually which makes me even more sad this one here did not turn out to my liking at allone reason may be the runtime it actually comes pretty close to the 3hour mark and i felt that it dragged a lot and that there were many lengths and also that they kept introducing new characters all the time instead of elaborating on the old ones in a memorable manner honestly i felt like i knew almost nothing about all the soldiers in here it is somewhat interesting because they are played by famous names like diesel ribisi damon giamatti or farina at earlyearlier stages of their careers so the cast is not the problem at all and hanks also does a solid job with what he was given the oscar nomination may have been a bit too much but well thats bearable looking at everything the film won spielberg best direction nah then again the technical categories are something that is tough for me to judge so perhaps these were somewhat deserving but the nomination for the script sure was a joke and i am not surprised at all that writer robert rodat never came close to writing a great screenplay again as obviously he hadnt done here either i am not mad that the oscars eventually went for the lighter shakespeare in love over this one and i am baffled by how many people still say spr should have one that year anyway i am on the la vita  bella bandwagon anywaynow back to this movie here i think i have elaborated enough on all the many reasons why i did not enjoy liking this film at all the story may be its biggest weakness the references here are actually truly simple like the group of soldiers finding accidentally the wrong soldier james at one point this was also a weak scene and still it was far more memorable than the at least 90 minutes of battlefield action it gets a bit less towards the end when they find still a long time before the film ends the frame with the funeral also only works if you enjoyed everything inbetween to me honestly it felt a bit on the melodramatic side to be honest but again i was somewhat grateful for it because it was not just boring random war action as a whole i give a thumbsdown and i am baffled how people also imdb raters consider this one of the greatest 50 films of all time i strongly disagree watch something else instead and id only recommend this one to the very biggest war film fans oh well i guess they have seen it already anyway,reality
i successfully avoided this until seeing band of brothers which raised my previously low interest in spielberg productions having seen one too many of his mawkish sentimental pieces of malarkey instead it turns out it was wise to skip this for almost a decadea troop that has just landed at normandy is diverted to move 100m into france and find a single private whose value has just gone up and sure they walk the whole way never even hitching a ride they encounter provisioned troops every fifteen minutes along the way any of which would have been more efficiently tasked with the mission and they find not alone  lost behind enemylines maintaining radio silence or in imminent danger but amidst another platoon also provisioned and ready to take on a mission against 4 german tanks and about 80 germans really what a bunch of schlockwhy do people make up stories to tell about ww2 to show their respect for those who fought it make up characters invent a phony mission that never occurred what the hundreds of thousands of personal stories that exist didnt have enough dramatic range this is a brazen slap in the face to all who fought spr is just so much retrograde 1950s storytelling and spielberg doesnt have it in him to recognize cinematic cheese when he smells it theres so much time for soldiers pouring out their hearts  having profound discussions that its a wonder they even had time for a war spielberg is only a shade subtler than flashing subtitles every now and then that say cry now and wave the flag im as susceptible as anyone to patriotism but come on the 3 stars i gave it are for the battle sequences every time the action slows  spielberg needs to come up with something dramatic he delivers a pile of corn and earns a barrel of lemons structurally this feels like a grabbag of scenes made for an even longer movie they find private almost effortlesslyand whats with the allstar cast hanks giamatti diesel damon danson hines ribisi i cant imagine any of these guys are ww2 figures because theyre all so overexposed in the current timeframei didnt need this giant pile of malarkey and all its cheap sentiment to make me feel a debt to the allies in ww2 i have reality to do that,reality
the basic techniques of this film are sadistic gore and portentous heroic cliche it is a revolting mixture dozens of times we see the faces of people realizing they are about to die and then brutally slaughtered as often as possible cruelly and whilst attempting to surrender all except the hero who dies like a hero in an opera and then the american flag flutters over the screen and the dewyeyed veteran remembersperhaps this is realism but so what we choose what we want to watch and what should be put in movies and regarding the last battle sequence do armoured divisions really attack one at a time perhaps this is why the germans lost,reality
the most intensely boring longwinded uninspiring movie i have ever seen spielberg can brilliantly bring a childhood fantasy to life but he has a lot to learn about making a deep and inspiring movie schindlers list must have been a one off the gore was pure hollywood and once it was over the movie began a gruelling downward spiral involving the rest of the poor suffering audiencethe acting of giovanni ribisi was the only consolation soothed but did not heal and tom hanks peformance was tolerably mediocreall in all a terrible waste of time sure the people of our generation need a much needed history lesson in the bravery of our ancestors sure we need to see a fullon assault of the gore to fully comprehend the horror of war but as an audience we also need a film with a sense of direction than endless gunfire combined with lacklustre dialogue please do not insult ourintelligence we are not so stupid that we cannot perceive the central message by sitting for 25 hrs watching this tripe a subtler approach would have been much more effective or since apparently we need to witness first hand the shocking violence for the full impacta movie with the gore but toned down compressed and concentrated not splattered whereever it felt appropriate giving spielberg the oscar for this showexhibition was like giving the nobel peace prize to monica lewinsky i could definitely see the agony of war but the agony of watching this filthy excuse of a film was a greater tax on my forebearance,reality
on the wake of the golden globe awards i feel it pertinent to point out the horrendous nature of this film how anyone can believe this is a mediocre film let alone the best picture of the year is beyond normal human comprehension i feel that this poor attempt at a film disparages the importance of the world war 2 and all the people who died i think the director could have made more of a visual impact if he had used one of his old camcorders in fact ive seen student films that have crisper and more defined images it is obvious that for the subject nature of this film the filmmaking was totally incompetent i expected so much more from such a good director as steven spielberg hopefully in future endeavors they will edit the film and remove the grainy and amateur images,reality
with all the hype about this movie i expected to see a realistic portrayal of war i also expected to see a true story which all the trailers claim this movie is this movie has as much basis in fact as that cheesy soap the xfiles spielberg is trying to mess with everyones head again and thanks to this movie there will be a whole generation of people who think really happened luckily they teach students better in school if you want a hardhitting realistic portrayal of war try arliss howard in full metal jacket charlie sheen in platoon adrien brody in the thin red line meg in courage under fire or heck anything else this movie had the potential to be one of the greatest war movies of all time the scenes on the beaches are not only gruesomely real theyre breathtakingly brutal as well as soulstopping if the rest of the movie had one tenth the shockquality or realism the first few minutes had this movie would have been one of the best war movies ever madehollywood glamour has ruined this movie thankfully people are too smart to be sucked in by what this movie claims truly happened but there are already some schools that are discussing using this movie as a way to teach students about war why not use starship troopers its just as realistic and unlike can actually educate if you walked away from this movie feeling dissatisfied and cheated check out some of the other war movies i mentioned they are all far better depictions of what war truly is and unlike spr they dont claim to be the truth for a truly realistic war movie that deserves every award its been rumored for check out the 1998 remake of the thin red line,reality
definitely one extreme case of well people told me it was a masterpiece so it must be the best movie ever syndrome the problem with spr is not that there is much to be looked down upon but that there is very little to be impressed by i felt sick when i saw that this film made it to number four on the best movies ever list although i like spielberg and he has made many great films even a few masterpieces this is a truly mediocre movie blah all the way,reality
if you have read any of my posts then you might have detected a slight promilitary bent then you probably think that i liked think again it stank i muted the first 20 minutes of the movie where they depict with gruesome relish the effects of concentrated machine gun fire and artillery explosions on the human body i preferred spending my time reading a book to watching that once that carnage was over i was treated to typical foul language but nothing i havent heard in my tour of duty that i could have forgiven but what they did with the storyline was absolutely dreadfulclearly the people who wrote this script have no sense when it comes to military behavior or military tactics for instance the troops were going to mutiny to the command decision by their captain to attack a machine gun nest well i would too with an idit like tom hanks character leading a charge in broad daylight directly into the line of fire of said machine gun even an english teacher turned captain would have more sense than that then they captured a german soldier so what do they do with him they blindfold him and tell him to walk 1000 paces before taking off the blindfold well what a surprise when he turns up later to fight against this squad and tortuously slowly impale one of squad soldiers with a bayonet all while one of the squad cowers in fear while his fellow soldiers are getting massacred around him what a nice way to depict the soldiers oh and then the same cowardly soldier somehow finds his courage in time to capture some german soldiers including the previous released prisoner this time however he coldbloodedly shoots him revenge i wont even bore you with the stupid decision for a light infantry squad to hold a bridge instead of blowing it against several tanks  armor with infantry support it was a stupid movie and i am only feeling better now that i am able to give vent to my frustration at having watched it im only glad that i didnt pay any money to watch this crud i hate movies that blank me off when i watch them there 3 out of 10,reality
the audio engineering and sound effects are the best of any war picture ever  this is among many valid reasons why saving pvt is a mustsee movie  however do not expect perfection  do not expect this film will live up to all of the hypebriefly stated members of the wwii generation spoke with a formality not captured in  unlike hanks et al rock hudson jimmy stewart earnest borgnine and many oldtime actors served in wwii  even more future writers directors and hollywood producers served as well their later film efforts accurately captured the feel of the times  the difference is rather striking  please view any movie or even a tv production created by members of the greatest generation and see for yourself how it compares to    as unlikely as it may seem one can even hold out hogans heroes  a light tv comedy set during wwii created in the early 60s by men who had experienced wwii  as a hollywood production better capturing the essence of wwii era interpersonal communication  the characters in hogan naturally and automatically interacted with each other with the yes sirs and no sirs personal respect and greater formality common in the 1940s  looking further any hollywood film produced in the 40s and 50s captured the essence of the day even betterwhere a lightweight tv comedy succeeds shockingly fails  characters in interact with the casual ease of 1998 and not with the formality common in the 1940s  rather than appearing to be part of the greatest generation the actors in private seem to be following the motivations of modern hollywood producers who know only todays post vietnam contempt scorn and cynicism  speaking of cynicism the subplot of the generals high class transport plane was completely made up in  made up by a post vietnam hollywood,reality
this movie is very realistic  but thats more or less everything it has it tries to give the impression of having been filmed on the spot and acquires the drawbacks of documentariesthe soundtrack is too loud even the sound of the waves at the very beginning of the first scenethe story is weak as dull as an average real life war storythe camera moves during actions give one a headachethe storyline is paternalistic and moaningmilitary enthusiasts can love it  action fans had rather go watch starhip troopers and forget about saving private,reality
watch for first 20 minutes after that just a casual money spilled storytelling,reality
this films concept is about to rescue a man who is but this is actually show off the power of american army i think this film isnt so attractive for who want the watch creative artworks,reality
this film is amazing spielberg is able to create suspense in like no other keep you on the edge of your seat with every muscle in your body tenses upthe opening scene of the storming of the beach is an iconic moment in cinema and becomes the measuring stick of how to open a film this particular scene has been duplicated many times in film television and video games but nothing compares to this films depiction of war showcasing all the different reactions people suffer in war and makes me thankful i was born in the time period i exist in now the dialogue is phenomenally written being displayed during the scene in which they discuss their opinions on their mission after just setting out you find yourself connected to this group of men almost immediately the cinematography is beautifully shot and depicts the morality of these soldiers decisionsi would highly recommend this film to even the most casual film fan it truly is great and arguably spielbergs greatest work,reality
this in a long list of big films is probably spielbergs greatest accomplishment it has so much heart humanity and raw drama that it will most likely be in the top tier of films for all time its just spectacular in every way it throws you into the biggest armed conflict of our time while deftly and carefully drawing you into a very intimate story that puts many aspects of the war into perspectivereviewing a war film is difficult for someone who has never been in one i dont think any serious critic would pretend to know what its like to be in such a horrifying event i think the best you can do is speculate and even then you risk treading on some serious ground by giving such films a reviewthat being said the film looks feels sounds and moves perfectly from start to finish technically its a masterpiece the lesserknown stars give as good of a performance as the bigname actors which is a sign of terrific directing the personal storyline weaves effortlessly within the big drama of the war and the whole thing is written beautifullyas im writing this i can think of no flaws some people give spielberg a hard time by being overly sentimental but i just dont see it in spr the emotions all seem appropriate for the environment the action is riveting and often brutal characters fall of the radar quickly the war is overwhelming it all makes sense in contextthe best films are like statues solid powerful and eternal this one will stand for a long time even if lots of spielbergs films get taken down a notch for sentimentality and overblown spectaclemaking this one wont and never will,reality
 a film related to world war ii directed by spielberg received critical acclaim upon screening the upsurge of is not only because it is realistic visual impact what is more important this film led to an argument about livesduring world war ii the us and uk army landed in normandy on june 6 1944 to insure the victory private james matt damon and his troops 101st airborne division are airdropped behind the german frontlines unfortunately all his three brothers were killed in action at the same time in order to prevent the unfortunate mother from losing all her four sons the us command decided to send a special squad to look for james and take him back safelyjohn miller tom hanks was chosen as the caption of the rescue squad he hurried to pick several excellent soldiers and a staff officer who could speak german and french as the squad members when other soldiers were resting millers eightmember squad began to look for who was in the unknown area controlled by germanswhen facing all kinds of dangers and death of teammates one by one the squad members gradually began to doubt the rationality of this task is it worthy of saving one soldier at the risk of losing eight soldiers lives the journey of salvation tested every members value of human nature,reality
the first 25 minutes or so is something extraordinary and i dont know how steven speilberg pulled it off the first 25 minutes is basically a war battle but if you really think about it the amount of technical detail you have to put in it is extremely difficult but it is not just the technical detail that makes the scene amazing but you feel what the men are going through and in some cases make you feel like you are actually in the battle when wade dies it is very disturbing and hard to watch but it is also very powerful the plot of the movie is to bring back home to saftey because 3 of his brothers have died in combat so a group of soldiers are out looking for him tom hanks gives a incredable performance and i found him once again extremely likable tom sizemore is surprisingly really good and so is giovanni ribisi edward burns adam goldberg berry pepper and jeremy davies are also good and hold their own this movie is also good at representing its soldiers more as ordinary people as oppose to a soldier with no flaws and all he thinks about is serving his country i am not gonna lie i cried at the end of this movie when cpt miller dies and that is because i grew attached to his character the character of john miller is a teacher and just wants to go home and he is forced into a position he does not want to be in this movie is about characters in a awful situation and seeing how these characters react to war many people point out not giving the other countries a huge amount of characterization is a flaw but i personally viewed it as how we view other countries when we are at war and our perspective on them great war movie and this is one of steven speilbergs best,reality
in every time period and almost every part of the globe there has been war many bloody wars have occurred in our worlds history but none of them can match the magnitude of world war ii there were eighty million casualties as a result of the war which includes deaths from warrelated disease and famine one of the wars biggest turning points occurred on june 6 1944 when over 160000 allied forces invaded france which was heavily occupied by germany at the time the movie called accurately depicts this massive invasion this movie is a mustwatch because of how realistic intense and moving it is from beginning to end even though this movie was spectacular there were some critics that wrongly criticized the filmwatching is a once in a lifetime experience this movie is considered to be not only the best war movie ever but it is one of the best movies period in the 71st academy awards they won five of the eleven awards they were nominated for the five awards were best director best cinematography best sound mixing best film editing and best sound effects editing is a world war ii movie that recreates the infamous dday invasion and the following push into france in the summer of 1944 the movie revolves around a squadron from the 2nd ranger battalion led by captain miller tom hanks and their mission is to find private first class james matt damon to have him sent back home since all three of his brothers had died in the massive invasion this kind of rescue mission was common in world war ii a soldier who lost all of their siblings in combat was forced to go back home by the military for the sake of the soldier and his family the squadron encounters heavy resistance throughout the movie before they finally find private first class toward the end of the movieis a mustwatch because of how realistic and thrilling it is in both the action and nonaction scenes everything that happens in this movie is based on true events from world war ii and they are very accurately presented in the movie the action scenes in the movie are very intense and have the audience on the edge of their seats in fact this movie was so real and intense that it made war veterans walk out of the theater due to having posttraumatic stress disorder the dday scene in the very beginning of the movie is the most notable of them all since it is considered by many to be one of the greatest movie scenes ever german machine guns were blazing explosions were everywhere and casualties were occurring left and right this intense fastpaced realistic scene was one of many in the movie the second component of this movie that makes it a mustwatch is the nonaction scenes war movies that have great nonaction scenes are a cut above other war movies and this is the case in two of the best scenes in this movie were the scenes in the very beginning and end of the movie in the beginning private visits a beautiful cemetery that holds thousands of soldiers who passed away fighting to protect their country one of which was captain miller and in the end he makes a moving speech and salute to captain miller that leaves every viewer in tears these two scenes are just two of the many good nonaction scenes in the movie there has been no other movie that i have seen that is more real and moving than saving privatecritics have made the claim that the action scenes in make the german soldier seem inferior and praise the american soldier and examples from the movie have been provided to back up that claim however this is simply not true the germans were not acting stupid without any strategy during the ambush scene some critics described the critics made it seem like the germans were stupid for pushing their vehicles and troops through the streets of the town but this was a proper tactic the best way to clear a town is to send as many reinforcements as possible straight through to overwhelm any possible resistance the movies critics were also outspoken on how the movie depicted the german tank crew to be inept in all fairness this was an ambush against them and not a planned attack during a battle the element of surprise is huge in combat and unfortunately for the germans this element was not in their favor saving privates critics made a claim that was irrational and not supported with logical reasoning,reality

bookended so deftly with genuine and heart felt honesty this film is one of spielbergs most important and is definitely in my view the most important and impacting war genre film ever put to celluloid from the gritty in your face representation of what the normandy landing was like to which veterans in theaters often had to clear out for that harrowing opening such that the depiction struck too real to trudging into the unknown throughout wartorn france that hanks character and his band of brothers face this movie hits a combination of humanity and the brutality of war that everyone should see in their lifetime not for the violence of it but to honour the men who laid so costly a sacrificea technical feat of filmmaking as well as respecting the lives and the bravery of young men in battle against a threatening foe hitlers germany this tributes their legacy in a truly human way without cliche without glorification nor a hint of faux emotion john williams score drives this humanity throughout every scene especially in the transitions to the next sequence of events and spielberg guides these performances with precision to deliver unforgettable and harrowing moments throughoutthoroughly deserved sound design editing and director oscars for a masterpiece enthralling engaging relentless in bursts but will give you a handful of breathers and close on a tragic if not reflective ending that shows the cost of war,reality
honestly i dont like a lot of war movies but there is the odd one that grabs my attention this is definitely one of those one of my favorite actors of all time tom plays his character with control but through his eyes full of emotion the story is heartfelt and shows the terror that these young men faced a must watch if you have not already,reality
the movie starts off with an epic opening scene in this scene captain miller and his squad have to take over the beach during this invasion two brothers are killed their third brother is also also killed of but in new guinea after they have taken over the beach captain miller and his crew get another task they have to find private the fourth brother he is the only remaining brother so miller has to get him and bring him back to his mother it turns out to be harder than they taught saving ptivate is directed by steven spielberg he did an amazing job at directing this movie he did something special he made it seem like the main characters stood out it looked like they took a black and white movie and colored it in it gave a pretty effect the cinematography was also perfectly handled janusz kaminski has worked a couple of times with spielberg i get why spielberg had chosen him as the cinematographer the opening scene with this i mean the opening fight scene was just shot amazing every shot was just stunningly beautiful the set design look realistic the effects in this scene were flawless you were tense even though you didnt got the chance to know the characters yet everything was fantastic the realism of the movie was also good when the camera goes under water in the beginning scene the sound mutes this really makes you feel like you are there with the soldiers also still when the camera is under water when the bullets hit the water they slow down and you can see the path that they make through the water when someone takes a grenade and they explode they literally blow up into peaces you can see body parts fly everywhere what is also good about this movie are the effects and makeup  in the movie there is a lot of gore and when someone loses a leg or a piece of their skin and there intestines are shown it is in the movie it looks so real and after the first battle sequence the camera flies by the battlefield and you can see all the dead bodys and the water that has become red of the blood of the soldiers this was a very touching scene the acting in this movie was also very good everybody did their best lets star of with the main character the main character is captain miller played by tom hanks miller is the captain of his squad a little bit further on in the review i am going to talk about the squad he is a broken man due to the war but there is one thing that keeps him going completing the mission and to keep his squad alive someone else from his squad is caparzo he is played by believe me or not vin diesel i really didnt recognize him i was surprised that it was him he was so good in this movie i just couldnt believe it there is also jeremy davies he plays upham he was also very good you can really see how afraid that he is of war wade the medic of the crew is played by giovanni ribisi he was good too and when he dies there follows a painful silences and that was hard to watch not because it was a bad scene or something no it was just such a sad moment there is also mellish played by adam goldberg he was good nothing special about him and horvath is played by tom sizemore when he died at the end i didnt feel sad and i dont know why in the squad there is also jackson he is played by barry pepper he was a very skilled sniper and it was shocking to see him die when he got blown up and last but not least matt damon he played private the soldier that miller has to get back home i liked his character a lot he is a loyal friend who is not willing to leave his crew behind this covers most of the characters i am sorry if i have missed one there are a lot of characters in this movie the writing of the movie was handled perfectly there were funny bits but that doesnt change the mood of the movie it keeps its darker tone you could really feel the friendship of the crew and this was due to the good writing what i also liked about the writing even though this does not relate much to th writing is when miller goes away to cry this was a powerful scene and gave the character a more relatable person it made him feel more realthe part that i loved a bit more than the beginning fight scene is the final fight scene i loved watching how they prepared themselves and the bridge for an upcoming attack the whole bridge scene is just so tense full and when they finally attack you just start screaming at your screen because upham doesnt dare to do something becaude of him some characters died that he could have saved but when the battle is over and he has his gun pointed at some german soldiers he recognizes a soldier it is the soldier that killed wade when wade was killed they let that soldier go but first they are planning to kill him then at a certain point upham says what is happening when they want to shoot the unarmed german soldier and i think that he means with this what happened to us how war has changed them this is a positive thing but when he holds the gun pointed at the german soldiers he pulls the trigger and kills the man out of revenge also a powerful scenethe ending is beautiful i would recommend watching this movie,reality
is a masterpiece and one of spielbergs finest movies the battle scenes performances and the film keeping true to world war 2 makes this a brilliant but tough watch heres whythe story is good but couldve been better it follows a bunch of soldiers who lands on normandy france and successfully defeating the germans on their first encounter they must track down a survivor of the normandy incident that happened earlier before they arrived by the chief of the army so captain miller and his soldiers must get private james the survivor back home and end the war in normandy and world war 2 itselfthe films ending is something i have to mention its so emotional and one of the most best bad endings of all time where captain miller does deus ex machina on an upcoming tank and somehow saves his teammates but he himself dies and in present time james francis goes to his funeral and also tells his wife to say he is a good man for all his work during world war 2 its sad but impressive overallthe battle scenes are impressive with some of the most realistic depictions of war ever put into film each battle scene is at least 10 minutes which adds to the overall excitement of the films slow pacing the films performances are stunning especially tom hanks all has their own emotion which makes each character interesting and refreshingthe films direction is as great as previous spielberg films here its all done in a serious matter where world war 2 is pretty accurate in this movie than it is in real life the orchestral is impressive john williams is always the king of orchestral music the deaths are pretty emotional and even myself feel sorry for all of the teammates dying despite the characters being fictional and i still had a hard time seeing these likable characters dieis a benchmark for film entertainment and it is one of my favourites to this day direction characters performances music realism world war 2 accuracy ending and the overall emotion to the death scenes makes this a mustwatch for anyone willing to watch a great war flick the only weakness of this movie is the plot its simple and has to have more focus on some of its locations like ohama beach and that it is kinda flat in the middle part of the movie other than this minor nitpick check this movie out1010,reality
film reviewdo you want to watch an excellent dramatic action movie then you need to watch directed by steven spielberg this film is magnificent as it provides such realism and such a serious tone throughout the entire film the movie starts with a reenactment of dday the horrific wwii invasion of omaha beach normandy in which our country came out victorious in and shows how truly brutal it really was as the soldiers progress further onto the beach that they soon take over a group who is led by captain miller tom hanks assembles as they receive another mission this new mission is to search and rescue private james who is apart of a paratrooper platoon that landed in an enemy zone just out of contact as they are proceeding on this search and rescue mission they come across numerous issues and initiate a few fire fights along the way as always a few of the fellow soldiers die as they come closer to reaching their target and things begin to get more and more out of hand as they come upon their target they once again face incredible forces and have to defend themselves until backup arrives as it comes to an end they become victorious and control the area they fought for but are faced with a very dramatic outcome this film really gives you the idea of how intense war really is and just how accurate the outcomes would be likewhats so wonderful about the accuracy of this movie is that it is based on the true events of the normandy invasion of wwii and shows how gruesome it really was the landscaping of the beach along with the architectural structures it has prepared was almost ideal to the actual beaches layout when they go through the movie scenes where they come across enemy platoons the way they go about surrendering or killing is very accurate whereas some films break out into some huge fake fire fight and start all over the movie is precise on keeping you intrigued and keeping the tone serious so you will keep watchingkeeping the tone serious keeps the movie going all the characters in the movie are extremely serious and the language they use show it it is a war movie so you expect the language and actions to be aggressive and serious and thats exactly what you get the actions are flawless and the way they go about things such as the death of fellow soldiers is great they dont break out and make it a big deal they put dirt in a can with the name of the dead soldier on it and go about the mission they went about death very well and stuck together as a unit and kept it very realisticthe realism is what keeps this movie alive the action is so intense the gun battles are incredible and the sound effects are just phenomenal and bass dropping the sounds of the different weaponry are so realistic tying into the accuracy and acting of the film the gore and blood of some battles may be disturbing to certain viewers because its so brutal and gruesomeoverall i would recommend the movie private for all movie lovers the accuracy of the actual events that transpired on omaha beach were historical the seriousness of the actors portraying the soldiers in my opinion is done with respect and honor honor to all the soldiers who lost their lives that day defending our country as you are watching the battle scenes the realism in the acting sound effects and special effects makes you feel like you could be right there on the battlefield with the soldiers again if youre in the mood for a good war movie based on actual events this is the movie for you,reality
this movies opening scene is one of the most brutal horrific yet accurate representations of war i have seen this scene sets the mood for the whole movie while the rest of the movie is not quite as intense it quickly involves you in the characters and you sympathize with them because of what they have endured you truly care for them and are interested in their well being the realization that what they have experienced is only the beginning of the story is a grim one indeed the war is not over and thus it is not finished shaping the men in focus they will be molded and formed in innumerable ways as the war takes a hold of their psyche and their lives in conclusion i believe this is the best war movie of all time and one of if not steven spielbergs best films,reality
the best film i have ever watched it includes action and drama and these are combined with a proper way every one should watch this film with a good surround and vision system so that it influences you more like me  of course it will be best to watch this in cinema but not possible right now i suppose especially some scenes are really unforgettable by watching this film you can understand how bad a war is especially when it is a world war i still couldnt understand how couldnt win the best picture award in 1999 american beauty isnt as impressive as this film deserves to be in top 10 in imdb please watch and decide yourself,reality
a film with more than 2 million reviews on this website so what more is there to say other than these words thank you steven spielberg for telling this story to the world and making a memory for all of the world to cherish and remember till the day we all must die i mean what more can i say just unforgettable editing and incredible direction it is an incredibly powerful and restrained film and it is also a hauntingly beautiful requiem to all the men who fought for us so we could live our lifes it is so haunting the opening 25 to 30 minute dday scene is so haunting and emotional it almost feels like it is june 6th 1944 today i am serious and the last 30 to 35 minutes are unforgettable both of those scenes are like bookends you have 1 huge set piece to begin the film and then you have 1 huge set piece to end the film the film starts with james as an old man and ends with him as an old man it is like a bookend the score by john williams is haunting and restrained like the film and the film does not rely on the score so much but the hymn to the fallen is the most haunting piece of music i have ever heard and should be played at all remembrance services but is not why i have no idea just a unforgettable film and yet again like the color purple in the most unjust oscars ever did not win best picture steven spielberg won best director but what beat to the best picture award shakespeare in love crazy and a disgusting unjust decision the worst decision the oscars have ever made that and the color purple not winning best picture are just wrong decisions just wrong they knew they were the best pictures of 1985 and 1998 and they got it wrong so wrong the third time this has happened actually with et losing to gandhi in 1982 just wrong decisions anyway i want to finish by saying thank you to steven spielberg and john williams yet again you have directed and composed another masterpiece together and this film is a haunting and beautiful requiem for all the men who gave their lifes for us and for that i hereby award this film best picture of 1998 even if the oscars will not,reality
one of the best army based movies iv ever seen  beautifully shot  so realistic at that time  great cast and full effort emotional and energetic movie  the movie is awesome 3 i watch this movie many times but every time there is a joyany movie which is based on true story is always close to my heart but this movie takes the lead ap log is movie ko watch karna pmarvelous acting  love to see v diesel in army suit  tom hanks was awesome  matt y,reality
its a very well made movie i especially enjoyed the part where they are enjoying the beach together even though the weather is badthe movie starts with buddy army guys getting on a boat to travel to france together and enjoy a lovely summer although the beach in france is already occupied by angry german visitors that polluted the beach with their junkits the army their task to clean the mess up and tell the president of germany that their country tourists are pigs and need to clean up their messit could be a summers best if they left out the angry germans but without them it would be a silly movie,reality
after the most amazing recreation of a war epos in one shot or how to compress a wonder movie like the longest day in 20 minutes tom hanks graces us with a personal travel through normandy based in personal weakness and group strengths how a literature teacher with experience in summer basket teams can cope with the horrors and unsensical situations of a total war just following the logic of the situation field manual up to the core and thinking that every life lost represents ten saved angels on our shoulders will grant us the possibility to earn a full life do we deserve it only a row of marbled crosses will be able to answer why then not a 10 simple i have seen german war graveyards where each cross is shared by 3 persons per side with people from early 50s to those that barely reached 18 war is hell for all not only for private,reality
this movie is in my opinion spielbergs best and when it comes to war movies a strong contender for the best war movie ever the storyline makes you question the mission and the sacrifice of lives in war throughout the whole movie the story is touching and made me angry at the same time the great cinematography and equally great special effects emerge you in the story the cast is great and works great as an ensemble typical for a spielberg movie john williams made the music and didnt disappoint it brings war and all its terrors to screen in a more emerging way than any other movie eg the opening d day scene an absolute must see movie especially for war movie fans,reality
best war movie out there although band of brothers is better but that isnt a movie but i highly recommended that to anyone this is hollywood best film that portrays war to date this movie doesnt show glory of war im a huge ww2 buff and my grandfatheron my mothers side served with 691st tank destroyer battalion during the european campaign with the us i also had family member who was a us marine that died on the uss california during the attack on pearl harborin the end this a well made film fore every film lover because it is an excellent war drama that puts you in the war with really develop characters who are not portrayed as heroes,reality
is the best ww2 film out there it starts off with a memorable 25 minute opening sequence which is arguably the best scene in a spielberg movie it is highly realistic for its time and its tense from beginning to end at the end of the sequence it shows you a dead soldier from the family later we find out that 3 of the 4 members of his family died and capt john miller tom hanks and a group of 7 soldiers are sent to bring the remaining brother back to his family before he dies as well with an unforgettable story the plot is quite moving even just thinking about it the movie was also expertly shot and acted every action scene is realistic as it is bloody after soldiers are killed off it makes the soldiers question if the mission is worth it and it often creates conflict with them the final battle has a big buildup and carries on for just the right lengththe ending is tragic and it gets me every time but its emotional resonance sticks with the viewer after watching it this is one of the best films of the 90s due to its impact on the viewer,reality
one of the most important movies of the 1990s and a triumph for steven spielberg helping to keep alive the story of the greatest generation and remind us of the sacrifice of warspielberg takes time to introduce us to a small band of soldiers getting to see the end of world war 2 through their eyes the movie follows the last days of the european war as the american forces push into france against a nazi army that is not yet ready to give up to say much more would be giving away major plot developments but the plot features several major surprises and gripping battle scenesalso features an incredible cast including tom hanks matt damon and many cameo appearances from nathan fillion ted danson and others,reality
this film is lauded as one of the greatest films of all time and i do believe this film is fantastic but i believe that it is not a ten out of ten film for a few reasons that i will explain this film is based in ww2 and the start of the film is the invasion of normandy better known as dday after the battle a group of 8 soldiers are sent on an important mission to rescue a private whos other brothers have been killed recently now tom thanks is now established as one of the best actors ever and it is films like this that is why his performance as the commander felt real it felt like he knew his duty but he was relatable to us because of the way he acted in certain situations this man is a superstar and he truly encapsulates everything that this commander has to go through the supporting cast all also do a really good job this film is not a character study film but everything the characters go through make you feel for them and empathise with the characters now the story is where i actually think this film slightly misses i do believe it plays up the war part of the story well and also the social issues that are explored should be applauded and are very good however towards the middle of this film it just felt like 3040 mins could have been cut out because nothing relevant to the story happens and it could have been done in a better way the script is really good with the dialogue feeling natural among war buddies and it also makes you feel like you are in battle with them the style is great i applaud spielberg for making this film more realistic with the brutality because that was how war really was a lot of directors try to pc it but not a top director and it adds to the realistic gritty feeling that this film possesses this is a heavy film and it can be hard to watch sometimes but it is a fantastic film that truly delivers on its message and does indeed deserve a lot of praise,reality
gripping horrific firstperson experiences in the thick of world war ii as youre already no doubt keenly aware its held up exceptionally well over time most likely due to the great lengths taken by spielberg and company to stamp it down in a specific era and remain steadfastly historical the normandy beach landing that opens the action is still as powerful and haunting as ever an effects showcase like none other that puts us right down in the middle of hell itself i couldnt help but pontificate about the futility of ground warfare here faced with row after row of doeeyed teenagers unceremoniously mowed down before taking so much as a single step on enemy territory which is part of its message no doubt  though thats somewhat countered by the tales of bravado camaraderie and character that sprawl out over the next two hours a richly rounded war story it enjoys a mess of acting performances even stronger than the work of the effects team tom hanks is at the top of the mountain as captain miller a demanding role that he owns from moment one supporting faces pop out of the woodwork at every corner most of us remember vin diesel and adam goldberg in early roles but quick shots from paul giamatti ted danson bryan cranston and more left my jaw agape how did i miss spotting these guys the last time a true epic profound and moving with plenty of action but just as much characterbuilding and adventure also in the mix one of spielbergs  and hankss  best,reality
this movie maybe is not in first ten or twenty movies on top 250 list but its worth to be watched like many best rated movies its just my opinion great drama very realistic war scenes it is enough for me to be one of my best watched movies ever i watched this movie much time ago and i think that all time later there is no movie which leave such strong impression on me like movie won five oscars absolutely justified and 34 on top 250  all that is sufficient recommendation to be watched tom hanks play the role like always  brilliant also and complete film crew deserve all the praise world war 2 thematic with all these realistic photages insight you in all misery and suffering of this war,reality
well the movie starts with what was a part of omaha beach called the normandy memorial now filled with the graves of allied soldiers who fought and died in the normandy invasion he finds the gravestone along with his family of soldier john miller and then recalls the fateful day of the invasion in his mind there are reminders of the cheesy movie known as the longest day as the omaha beach invasion scene in private takes full swing over 15 minutes of terror fright and bloodletting as heavy german resistance with mortars and endless sprays of machinegun fire rained death on the allied soldiers who landed on the beach with their landing craft the allies get stopped by the heavy and deadly resistance but finds their way to get through the enemy in the beachhead with bangalore torpedoes flamethrowers and sniper rifles when all was over we see that daniel fell dead on the beach and we get the first words on threes who fell in world war ii but not james francis we get word on the parachute misdrops that were part of the normandy invasion which meant james francis did not know that all of his 3 relatives died in combat so a rescue mission deep in the germanheld front lines of france is in store we then get the first scenes of john miller who is picked to find a small platoon for the mission he finds soldiers and then the mission is on right into the french countryside first skirmish against the germans is in a small french town in a heavy rainstorm where one of the platoon soldiers mr caparza finds a french baby whom a french family wants to liberate caparza takes the baby but because he was mistaken as a nazi soldier he was really an american soldier but he was baldheaded a french resistance soldiersniper takes caparza down with one shot in the chest the platoon realize this and decided to find the sniper but have to leave caparza alone and tell him not to move or he would get shot again fortunately the sniper was taken out but caparza eventually dies on the groundmore small skirmishes against the germans were in store upon finding james francis in one lull in the fighting they almost got the soldier they wanted who was james but with a different middle name which was regrettably patrick so the search continues then after a german prowler a halftrack was destroyed in another french open field as the search continued the platoon finds another platoon that destroyed the tank  it was the platoon with james francis the platoon got their man the final thing was for his survivors  the platoon itself and the surviving to fight against a small german army that almost outnumbered them in the town of ramelle the firefight had to be creative because they used ammo that was just left  not too much james does survive and the firefight ends when the p51 mustangs finished off the germans but john miller gets shot and dies in the combatjames survives still looking at his fallen soldier on the normandy beach memorial thinking about his duty for country that he had done on this major turning point in world war ii,reality
greetings from lithuaniai can not really say anything about 1998 that was not said before countless of times im just going to praise it one more time is a masterpiece of moviemaking its true almost no other war film cant take you to the place like this picture does apocalypse now and are the best war movies ever very different yet very similar on the note of antiwar ideas now back to the opening scene is  well you all know its a jaw dropping experience and i mean experience  for a 20 min you can partly feel what is war and how it was to a soldiers on that day this scene alone is a excruciating masterpiece the film settles then in to a journey through hell picture it still remains unforgettable no matter how many times you are watching it grabs you from the opening scene and does not let go this the very last image as i dont think there are people who never saw this film i can just say watch it again ita a film to remember and to learn ita a masterpiece on all levels,reality
this is my favorite war movie i like it except the final battle our troops totally got ripped to shreds cpl upham he is a coward i know he isnt used to this combat but he is essential to all the other troops he is carrying the extra ammo he was too scared to help that private fight that enemy troop and was to scared to give the troops more ammo to the mg if i was him i wouldve been scared too but i wouldve done it anyway for my brothers also in the beginning when they opened the door to get off the landing craft you are already dead i think thats crazy plus when they confronted the real private he refused to go home isnt that a rule in which if all your brothers die you are supposed to go home,reality
sacrifice is often challenging for men in dangerous positions no eight film characters besides the eight soldiers in steven spielbergs war masterpiece have dedicated more sacrifice in the history of film ww ii was a harsh war that caused many fatalities and tragedies entire families like the boys were sent out to war in we see four brothers loose 75 of their legacy leaving only private james to live when captain miller tom hanks is sent out with seven other soldiers to rescue private so that the family would have one last child to hang on two as the eight men try and rescue private somewhere in the battlefields of germany they encounter extreme war situations causing fatalities and conflict between the eight men many argue with each other loose hope show strong emotions and complain about how the eight of them have to risk their lives for one man however some positivism is derived from their mission many friendships are formed between soldiers as they connect with each other and help each other through battle steven spielbergs directing is extremely superb and magnificence he takes you into the line of war liken no filmmaker and has extremely intense and realistic battle sequences to show how much sacrifice the brave men of ww ii gave in order to promote peace and liberty the battle sequences are perfectly made with amazing editing sound and effects that are entertaining for the powerful soul purpose and to make the story strong bravo to the actors tom hanks edward burns matt damon jeremy davis and tom sizemore for giving powerful performances as soldiers throughout the entire film and never getting off guard in the film the main theme of is not only to give the first hand experience of ww ii battle brought to life but to show a story of sacrifice the mission to save private is a metaphor for how soldiers throughout history give of themselves for others and how their sacrifice can never be thanked enough this is the best war film ever made,reality
this movie was an immense gathering of suspenseful actionbased dramatized scenes i saw this film when it came out but i was just a kid i saw it again and again for years to come only to like it more every time the rawness and originality in the art of the battle scenes is just amazing the gore the sadness the cinematography its all there im not even a big fan of spielbergs work and aside from schindlers list this is the only other film that i love by spielberg i give it a 9 for its long driven awesome plot with well developed charactersmain supportive etc and gruesome battle scenes the use of foreign languages when needed was also there an overall well written work of art,reality
ive never been in the military let alone been in any type of real combat situation despite this i feel like i have a semirealistic idea of what it would be like and that is absolutely horrible i cant see any good that a soldier can take away from combat and this film does a remarkable job of depicting the ugly truths of this in a way that almost anyone over the age of 12 can appreciate if you are attempting to shield your child from the ugly truths of life on this earth and specifically american history and war then dont show them this film when watching this film i can actually feel the pain of the protagonist as he fights his way towards his objective obviously this pain is nowhere near the level of what the soldier whom this film was based off of and all others directly involved actually felt but i feel it is as close as you can get without being involved this film incorporates fantastic writing cgi cinematography setbuilding acting and basically every other level of production to create the most realistic world war ii normandy depiction i have ever seen the only reason i would not rate this movie any higher is because that would make it a 10 and i believe perfection is impossible in the art of film production but its about as close as it gets without 3d or any other realism enhancing technologies watch this film and gain a better understanding of what many of americas young men were experiencing at the time of the second world war and also how they were mentally and physically effected from the horrific events which ensued,reality
is the mission worth the man this question must be answered by captain john miller as he takes his fellow platoon of soldiers deep behind german fortifications in occupied france following the infamous dday invasion captain miller and his men must traverse the dangerous nazi infested countryside to find private james so that he may return home among the chaos that is warnot only one of the finest war movies ever crafted but one of the finest human dramas ever filmed through the backdrop of world war ii spielberg delivers us right into the action suspense and heart felt drama filmed in a guerrilla style like approach helps to enhance the realism of this film perfectly acted by hanks and company one will find themselves immersed and truly caring for these characters as the film plays on said to have made veterans weep during its release and during its intense first thirty mins as its depiction of the events of dday upon the beaches of normandy to be the most realistic and finest ever captured on film the world of war torn europe and the brave men who fought there is brought to life with not only the masterful direction of spielberg but with the haunting and heroic score by john williams hanks delivers one of his finest performances and this movie is one of the finest to ever have been made,reality
steven spielbergs 1998 war film is a monumental picture it portrays the rawest most realfeeling vision of war that i have ever seen though the grave portrayals and subject matter exclude from being a traditionally entertaining film it is still very engaging it falls prey to some issues characteristic of war films and some issues characteristic of spielberg films but those do not take away saving privates claim to greatness that it rightfully deservesthere is not an ounce of blood nor spray of bullets from beginning to end that doesnt feel real many highly violent films lose their impact entirely when the special effects are less than convincing and when character deaths feels too complicit to the story thankfully has incredible mainly practical special effects and the film is not afraid to kill even its most sympathetic characters in addition to literally boat loads of extras the opening flashback to omaha beach is an incredible feat in cinema and likely the best subjective view of warfare caught on film when the doors of the boats open and german machine guns mow down the us soldiers without a moments hesitation it is truly shocking for one shot the camera is in the position of a soldier near the back of a boat his comrades in front of him the doors open and all the soldiers in frame are ripped of their lives by an unstoppable hail of bullets the fact that i would be dead if were there is effectively disturbing some other shots take place underwater down there the screams of the dying pounding of artillery and incessant chatter of machine guns are muffled for a second i felt calm and safe before a couple bullets penetrated the water and the soldiers beneath it calming their struggle and causing plumes of blood to rise to the surface the scene continues in this fashion for an extended time as it follows a group of soldiers fighting their way up the beach eventually to victory for that specific skirmish the omaha beach scene sets the mood for the rest of the film and the final battle of the bridge matches it providing a nice bookend for the rest of the story to play out between some death scenes are truly disturbing they force you to look at your own mortality right in the face i should mention that the direction is superb the audience is able to achieve a new perspective on war from spielbergs outstanding ability to link action and build a sense of omniscience coupled with harsh subjectivity i didnt detect a false move in the entire film while the film is a true achievement its reliance on shock causes its impact to decrease with subsequent viewings ive seen it thrice but i still recognize it as a great film one thing that detracted from conflicting with the realism was its sentimentality driven by john williams seemingly ubiquitous score the sentimentality felt out of place and left a bad taste in my mouth i could almost call the film cloying at times thankfully during the parts that really matter there is no music and no forced emotion only what happens right before your eyes which is enough to change you by itselfwar films tend to be very pure many times they are almost exclusively about survival an objective and the nonromantic relationships between the soldiers fits into this category for me this excludes a certain aspect of cinema that i crave it excludes a sense of culture artistry and beauty the film is too raw for my liking whenever the characters come to a new town they find it in a state of wreckage the once beautiful architecture is reduced to rubble and potential strategic positions of course relies a great deal on realism and the decision to maintain its purity as a war film certainly contributes to its realism nevertheless my complaint standsfor what is essentially an existential film manages to the fill its running time with engaging scenes one after another there are many incidental almost arbitrary occurrences the taking of the french girl the knocking down of a wall to reveal a platoon of enemy soldiers the list goes on yes these scenes are sufficiently engaging even if each one does not contribute to a central story thrust more than that they add to the sense of mayhem and disarray that surely accompanies soldiers embroiled in such a conflict whereas i might be tempted to label this style as fluff or meaningless in other films the existential mode fits very wellis a great film it is an achievement in cinema and also fascinating to watch while a few issues prevent me from calling it a masterpiece i can confidently say that i will watch it again someday3340,reality
note this review is a mashup several reviews written by students in an english class at lyce henri cornat in franceduring the second world war the family loses three sons and one is missing three of them died in the fighting one of them is missing in the cotentin his name is james their mother receives a telegram telling her about the death of her sons captain millers mission is to find private this absence of action gives me a patriotic impression which may be a little bit ridiculous especially when the camera is focused on tom hank s eyes an excellent actor to me because of his great career the trailer depicts the soldiers as courageous and brave heroes it remind of famous french saying  un pour tous et tous pour un  that is to say soldiers are very unitedone of points i appreciate is that the trailer doesnt show any frames of the film at the beginning but only archived to the ww2 i think its a good thing because the trailer doesnt spoil the film but at the same time after seeing the trailer i dont really know if it was focused on the action or on the military brotherhood here the soldiers are shown as brave courageous and selfsacrificing they are depicted as heroes we find brotherhood loyalty and friendship they are portrayed as heroes because we can see and suppose that they fight with the suffering in the end of the trailer we see a dark landscape with a hill and only a man who is a soldier because he has a gun there are clouds and the sky is dark in the closing image we can see clouds it may be to show all the soldiers who had lost their lives and it reminds us that death is all aroundthis amazing representation of ww2 stresses the emotional dimension of war if you want to see a movie about war only dont watch this film because the most important in the story is the mission of some soldiers and not the fight against nazi germany overall we can say that this trailer makes people want to see this original film about the war its not a shocking trailer and mainly the touching side is shown a war film for girls,reality
within the opening 30 minutes into steven spielberg simply rewrote everything there ever was about warfare filmmaking destroyed many hollywood clichs in the process completely redefined the combat genre  permanently cemented this films place amongst the greatest examples of war cinemathe movie opens with the devastating but successful invasion of normandy by allied powers during the second world war  the main plot surfaces after that it concerns a band of soldiers who are assigned a new mission to go behind enemy lines in order to retrieve a missing soldier whose all brothers have been killed in actionsteven spielbergs direction this time challenges  breaks every barrier of action filmmaking as this film is his all out assault on the film audience psyche  takes them right into the battlefield with all the blood bullets  limbs flying around add to that the camerawork with its desaturated colour  point of view shooting gives the plot a heightened sense of realism toojust like any other spielbergs movie is pretty much fine tuned in its technical departments as the editing visual effects sound  everything is topnotch although john williams score doesnt have much to contribute to the whole film the performances by its ensemble cast are also very good with hanks impressing the most with his swashbuckling performanceyet in spite of all the praise  it putting up perhaps the most harrowing depiction of war on screen it isnt a flawless work  comes with its share of disappointments the biggest drawback about is that after its unforgettable opening sequence the film is never able to reach the same height for the entirety of its runtime  even drags in the middle of its story only to rise again in the endanother major problem i have with it is the films relentless emphasis on glorifying america since some reallife events depicted here completely ignore the aid us received from other allies during the dday landings plus the extremely biased manner in which it portrays the german soldiers is absolutely insulting its specifically made for american audience  doesnt have a universal appeal like many other films of its genreon an overall scale presents its esteemed director at his brutal best and with its unflinching take on the horrors of war delivers an extremely intense powerfully moving brutally realistic  truly unforgettable cinematic experience it may not be the greatest war film ever made but its contribution to warfare filmmaking has been immense and for that alone it will forever be remembered as one of its genres finest works,reality
if this isnt the greatest wwii movie then its close i would say it is definitely the greatest except platoon is such a close contender for methe action is gutwrenching real and the scene of the storming of omaha beach is truly a frightening spectacle if spielberg was out to eradicate romantic notions anyone might hold about war he succeededthe decision to rescue is in my mind a poor one but something similar actually did happen and looking for the grave of his beloved captain who saved his soul could have been mawkish but while a little too sentimental it did work for methe entire movie was a corroboration of shermans comment that war is hell just to make sure his point is driven home one of the ironies spielberg embedded in the movie is every act of mercy would have lethal consequences for the soldier who showed compassion,reality
spielberg during his career has always shown a certain interest for the world war ii in movies like 1941 empire of the sun schindlers list and of course raiders of the lost ark and the last crusade that was perfect clear he affirmed that in a interview that he considers the wwii one of the most significant events of the last hundred years and always sought to portray it somehow it took the screenwriter robert rodat and tom hanks to show to spielberg a story almost like apocalypse now inspired by an event of the civil war taking place during the second world war to the master retract the war in the best way possibly ever madeis takes place soon after the invasion of the normandy at omaha beach on june 6 1944 with captain john miller tom hanks getting a mission coming from the general george c marshall itself to rescue a paratrooper private james matt damon who lost three brothers in combat two on dday and one in new guinea now the captain along with 7 of his best men have to travel in the middle of the war in france and cross enemy lines to save the life of a man who doesnt even know but the dangers and sacrifices will bring challenges and moral dilemmas to the soldiers and their missionwhen i said that spielberg retracted the wwii in the best way ever made i wasnt bluffing of course he showed the consequences of the holocaust in a terrifying and brilliantly in his masterpiece schindlers list but here spielberg completely redefines the genre of war films forever what was always shown except for apocalypse now always with a romantic and patriotic story spielberg manages to show its brutalitymany today consider this film the best war movie ever made and others think apocalypse now already occupies this place both films follow different paths and tones but tell a story very similar with almost the same dilemma the sacrifice of many lives by one live but coppolas apocalypse now went much further than that exploring the psychological and disturbing side of the vietnam war including its origins without ever taking a patriotic side as spielberg does here momentarily so apocalypse is by a far superior filmwhat spielberg and screenwriter robert rodat do is follow a simpler path but still excellent showing for several moments in the film dilemmas about saving a man in the middle of hell and that leads to relationship of the soldiers that early in the film was a brotherhood of partnership begins to fade with the sacrifices being made by a soldier who they never saw or met and it is probably dead but there is where one of the few of the problems in the film appear some of the characters deserved a better development but anything ruins our feelings at the end of the filmwell so far ive only been talking about moral dilemmas and comparisons now lets cut to the part where spielberg revolutionizes everything in his direction coppola gave in apocalypse the classic nalpam bombing of the village followed with marines stealing surfboards and surfing spielberg gave the best battles and shootings ever made and put in a war movie literally putting us in the middle of the flying bullets and explosions hurting our ears and for the people that still criticize spielberg for making childrens and cheesy films get ready to see bodies being mutilated and blood splash on your face showing the terrible reality and brutality of war the real hellin the performances level the film doesnt disappoint at all each of the 8 9 if you count at the end of the movie oh spoiler since barry pepper as the best sniper in a movie since robert de niro tom sizemone as the best partner to have in a battlefield and tom hanks as tom hanks is simply brilliantwhile not be the best war movie ever made thanks to coppola is a essential viewing film spielberg through another magnificent direction shows the cruel reality and brutality of war coated with bright dilemmas thanks to rodats script presented with yet another brilliant performance by tom hanks is not perfect or the best war movie ever made but it is sure a timeless war and movie classic1010,reality
steven spielbergs world war ii drama is more of a drama than a war film the war in is the stage setting up a playground for a number of individuals caught in a singular situation forced to make singular choices as a character quotes in the film war educates the senses calls into the action the will perfects the physical constitution brings men into such swift and close collision in critical moments that man measures man is about all that it explodes into life with an assault on the senses will or the lack of it drives characters and the story along with them and collisions are aplenty the strength of lies in its characters who are more than mere foot soldiers in this theatre of war the film starts off with the landing of an us battalion at normandy  soon the storyline swings to an unpredictable path and the viewer is engaged in the thoughts and actions of a group of men whose paths both literally and figuratively are laden with uncertaintyhowever the reason that is a remarkable chapter in cinema history is not just its storyline characters and their acts but the theatre of their play itself spielberg brings out the ferocity of war to tremendous effect the viewer is bombarded with gruesome sights and shellshocking sounds the violence is captured with immense skill but true to what is perhaps one of the themes of the film as well as its maker is never glorified or even rendered aestheticas for the performances nearly the entire cast is terrific rendering the movies exceptional circumstances a credibility which wraps the viewer in its webthe setting of ww ii has deeply influenced cinema and directors from lands far and wide in the gallery of those films there are quite a few masterpieces most of which are united by the fact that they are more than mere war films or war stories binding in tales of the human spirit effortlessly belongs to that top drawer,reality
steven spielberg once again won a best directing academy award for this powerful filmbased on fact that opens with the dday invasion on normandy france and the battle to secure the beaches as the first step toward liberating france the battle itself is the most realistic portrayal of actual battle conditions ever put to film so authentic is the chaos violence and impact bullets and explosions would really have on limbs and bodiesno sugarcoating or censoring here that it is both fascinating yet disturbing as well tom hanks plays capt miller who is in charge of the platoon and once the beaches are secured he is ordered to locate and return home a privatematt damon because he has just lost three brothers in battle and the army doesnt want the bad publicity of a grieving mother mourning all four sons though he and his platoon are astonished by the order they obey it and the rest of the film is their journey to find and still fight the warthe first section of the film on the beaches is so powerful and realistic that the search for almost feels anticlimatic yet this film still works because of the realism and superb storytelling involved though the prologue and epilogue lack the dramatic fireworks they were aiming for they are still moving enough,reality

to everyone else would be a career defining film both a critical success and a box office smash but for steven its nothing more than another stone in the pillar of greatness that is spielberg  just when you thought he had laid out all his cards on the table he finds a way of surprising us again and again as with each passing of a decade he is constantly reinventing himself with the like of et schindlers list jaws and close encounters of the third kind he has successfully cemented himself as the greatest living directors in the world and is testimony to that a truly gripping and harrowing war film unparallelled in the last 20 years blending breathtakingly stunning cinematography skilled and controlled camera movements and sublime storytelling that is now regarded as a staple of all spielberg films but not too forget the help he received from an almighty performance by tom hanks star of such films as toy story 12 and 3 forrest gump and most recently cloud atlas from the gecko we see instantly know why spielberg won an oscar for best director as near the beginning of the film when the troops land on omaha beach on dday in the midst of a horrific and bloody tug of war with the germans  in a scene lasting for a staggering 24 minutes but i would have gladly sat for another 20 on top due to the share epic that it was from the start of the scene the camera work is somewhat very unstable spielbergs use of handheld camera movement during the scene helps add the effect of confusion and a rush adrenalin so from the very start we are almost swept into the scene and immersed into the carnage the instability of the camera movements perfectly reflects the total and utter chaos that the soldiers experienced and i love this because it showing us rather than telling us through 10 minutes of the soldiers talking about how bad the war is making it far more captivating  a smart move from steven it is also interesting to note that the opening sequence is filmed in de saturated colours emphasising the negativity of the situation making it seem more morose this visual pathetic fallacy continues with the dark stormy weather making the death seem all the more cold and devoid of emotion i could easily just review the opening sequence because it was just that good it should be taught at film school as a manual on great cinematography eventually amongst all the anarchy we discover the dead body of soldier with written on his backpack then fast forward a few days later army chief of staff gen george c marshall harve presnell reveals to capt john miller tom hanks that all three brothers from the same family have been killed and he tells john to find the fourth pvt james matt damon so his mother can have at least one son alive so she doesnt have to go through that pain of knowing all her sons are dead john miller then brings together a troop of trusty soldiers to aid him in this quest consisting of cpl upham jeremy davis sgt horvath tom sizemore plus privates mellish adam goldberg medic wade giovanni ribisi cynical reiben edward burns from brooklyn italianamerican caparzo vin diesel and religious southerner jackson barry pepper what follow is a heart wrenching journey for both us and the men as spielberg cleverly draws out of us all the colours of the emotional wheel as weve laughed with them felt regret as some of them die on their journey we have been scared as the ever looming germans approach we felt anger frustration and the occasional breathtaking triumph but what the performance i love the most out of that list of talented actors a superb performance is was performance of tom hanks outside the storytelling and the cinematography it truly stood out for me from the first time he pops up in screen during the being on omaha beach when we move on to one landing craft in particular through a series of close ups we see the share terror in the eyes of some of the soldiers then we shift to a close up of tom hanks hands shaking and from that moment you could tell this was going to be a stellar performance from tom and he certainly didnt disappoint because he was just playing the character he was living the character as hes attention to detail throughout the rest of the film helps us believe that is a hero who plays a good front for his soldiers but is as sacred and consumed with a feeling of trepidation and fear just like the rest of them to conclude cinematography spielbergs geniuses and tom hanks performance are the most vital areas that needs to be covered when reviewing a spectacular film such as but most spielberg because without his brilliance and nonchalant camera angles may not have ever won 5 academy awards or never would have become a modern classic as it unfortunately came after the superb likes of the deer hunter platoon full metal jacket and apocalypse now so the academy could have thought there wasnt another worthy story to come out of a war film due to the amazing stated but steven breaths ingenuity and intelligent filmmaking to add new life to the war epic standing up tall next to the greats of the war genre,reality
this is my favorite movie words cannot describe how good this movie is the opening scene is so well done everything is so perfect everything from the sound effects of the machine guns to the camera shaking around like youre actually there with them all the performances are superb but tom hanks really stands out his speech convincing reiben to stay is phenomenal barry pepper is incredible as the sniper private jackson even jeremy davies as cpl uppahm is good even though i hated cpl uppahm steven spielberg does a great job directing and has crafted another masterpiece the ending scene is packed with emotion and this is easily the best movie ive seen,reality
is considered by many the best war movie ever made and i admit that is true this movie is an absolutely breathtaking and affect all the people that see this film it affected me so much this movie grab your neck and doesnt let you go and makes you to stay in your seat you feel the pain of john miller and his men spielberg did an unbelievable job of putting realism into this movie with the camerawork and everything else everything is great about this movie great actors great battle sequences and a good ending simply awesome an all time classic movie i think the main purpose of the film is to honor those who fought and died in the struggle against the nazis in ww2,reality
is about a band of brothers who give up their own lives to save the life of a single soldier in the chaos of war the controlling idea that brotherhood is worth dying for is well told and thematically supported the contradictory notion of risking the lives of many to save the few resonates well with the idea of war in general that the values of freedom family and human rights are ideals worth dying for even if these values are preserved only for a few survivors the hope is the survivors and the viewers can go on to live a good life and treasure their freedoms that others died to protect the question is that in a democracy where human rights and freedoms are valued why would anyone in their right mind choose to sacrifice their life and limb the answer these soldiers choose to do it to protect a brother and these armies choose to do it to protect the basic human rights of the citizens of fellow nations this seems to suggest that the very fabric of democratic society rests on the fundamental respect for each other and the rights of others and that these rights and freedoms are ideals that much be protected to the deathgreat film told with what i count to be three major external plots to save to win the war and to save the lives of the men the lives of the men are lost to achieve the first two thus proving the controlling idea that brotherhood is worth dying formy major complaint is the film is too long three hours is a long time and the episodes of peace are not so interesting since not much relationship or personal development takes place the brothers are good from beginning to end and their relationships are good from beginning to end of course there are minor plot lines like opums compassion for pows and reibens questioning of millers judgement but they dont create serious turning points in an otherwise externalaction focused story i think the story would look substantially the same if you cut out the middle the carparso dying to save a french child the radar assault that loses wade and the church restingmy story chart of the movie is at storychartsca,reality
if you are watching out for action and suspense the is a perfect movie for yousome of the scenes were so emotional that i found it hard to hold my tears its a movie worth watchingthe most interesting scene was when captain miller was shooting at the tank with his revolver and at that moment aeroplane bombarded on the tank and the tank exploded and captain miller looked at his gun if there was some miracle happening but then he looked at sky and there was pleasure on his faceit had a sense of humour in it at the crucial point of the moviebut the thing about movie is that you watch it and find it out that you liked it is that kind of movie which you just watch and find out you have liked itso have added it to your watch list,reality
is the best second world war movie ever madethe good almost everything could be listed here as exceptional but ill just mention what really makes this a master piece first and foremost the fighting and how its depicted you feel the same stress terror and confusion as the soldiers there are some heroics but its normal man heroics men die by the score theres no favorites its dirty its loud its dangerous its inhumane beyond that youve got an incredibly compelling story amazing photography a rich scenario very attaching and real characters as well as interesting thoughtful dialogsthe actors there are so many excellent ones and a number that were on the cusp of their stardom tom hanks is of course in one of his best incarnation ever tom sizemore is the perfect solid loyal sergent paul giamatti has a small role but without contest one of his best by playing his normal edgy style in a war context with a thin veneer of authority and calm edward burns is just right as the loud mouth new yorker and you cheer barry pepper as the god blessed sniper now for a few surprises giovanni ribisi playing a bit far from his usual role is excellent as the overwhelmed caring medic dennis farina which i normally do not like is a stoic senior officer with an calm aura you can also see a young nathan fillion in a quick cameo here one might argue whether matt damon was given a large role or not but he did carry it out well if a bit subpar for him however the truly big surprise is the appearance of vin diesel playing something completely out of his usual affectations with credible resultsthe bad its a near perfect film but theres one thing that irked me the family of the veteran was either badly chosen of badly directed when he starts to cry they all act as if it was a big surprise really what did you think he was going to dothe ugly nothingthe result be ready for some tough bloody scenes and youll love this realistic representation of war,reality

five stars out of fivesteven spielbergs epic world war ii film from 1998 earned him his second academy award for best director although it failed to win best picture being robbed by shakespeare in love in one of the biggest upsets in oscar history and certainly my lifetime next to maybe crash beating out brokeback mountain in 2006 its still considered one of the greatest and most realistic war films ever made though being praised most of all for its opening 27 minute normandy landings scene which was named best battle scene of all time by empire magazine its one of my favorite war and spielberg movies ever and probably my favorite film of 1998the film was written by robert rodat and inspired by a monument memorializing soldiers killed in battle from the civil war to vietnam which lists eight siblings killed in the american civil war revolves around a soldier private james matt damon whos three brothers are all killed in world war ii in order to relieve distress to his mother army chief of staff george c marshall harve presnell orders eight soldiers to find and bring him home to safety theyre lead by captain miller tom hanks who just survived the normandy landings tom sizemore edward burns giovanni ribisi jeremy davies adam goldberg barry pepper and vin diesel play the other seven soldiers the film was criticized by some including filmmaker oliver stone who felt movies like it helped influence the iraq war due to world war ii being portrayed as the good war i dont really agree with that assessment but i can see their point the movie is a masterpiece in my opinion and i think everyone should see it as a tribute to all the soldiers whove died in war the first time i saw it in the theater was one of the most memorable film going experiences of my life who could ever forget those opening 27 minutes it portrays one of the most nightmarish images ever caught on film i think this movie is spielberg at his very best in my opinion its a greater achievement than schindlers list even to say i like it more than his more fun movies like jaws et or the indiana jones series would probably be a lie but it is a more important film and one of the very best of 1998 definitely better than shakespeare in lovewatch our movie review show movie talk at httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvne8awcfo3a,reality
this is the greatest movie i have ever seen knowing that i have seen schindlers list and citizen kane that is a bold statement but this movie is filled with complex statements about men at war it goes beyond an antiwar film war isnt just hell in this movie it isnt just brutality and violence it is about the toll on the soul the burying of identity and the hope that it will be for a reason it is about the bartering of war one man you knew for twenty people you will never see more over at its core this isnt even an antiwar film because the film is searching for something that will justify the bloodshed justify the absurdity of these soldiers situation war is hell unless something good comes from it the acting is on point and many of the characters serve a distinct purpose in the screenplay which is extremely well written there are symbols that register without thought and the speeches delivered serve to add to the absurdity surrounding the soldiers i doubt any filmmaker will come close to the achievement that this film is watch this today,reality
considered by many as the best war movie ever made and considered by most as one of spielbergs many unforgettable classics in its 150 minute run time tells the story of a group of soldiers who have been sent by the american government to find and recover a lone soldier after his brothers were wiped out in warbeing released in the year of 1998 when movies like american history x and shakespeare in love came out it is an absolute spit on the grave insult that this movie did not win the best picture award instead being handed to movies of lesser kind such as shakespeare in love however that being said there is so much i simply love about the movie the acting is great with tom hanks pulling off another blinder of a performance the rest of the cast all do a great job the writing is great often being witty and clever and spielbergs direction is almost perfect what do i mean almost perfect this scene is everyones favorite scene when dealing with the movie and is regardedas a great scene but this is one scene that i do not hate but do not enjoy much either that is the omaha beach scene that drags on for 20 minutes 20 minutes of depicting what war feels like i can understand it being 10 minutes that would be a blast of a start but the scene really pulled me out of the movie early on but thankfully recovered after the quest had begun with such amazing scenery brilliant cinematography and superb special effects along with some great action scenes and very emotional scenes as the movie progressed another thing that adds to the greatness of the movie is definitely the characters as all soldiers who were focused on in the movie were very interesting especially capt miller another part i enjoyed was the ending scene though it may feel a bit cheesy and corny i found it reasonably emotional and the scene does make you feel its worth sitting through a 170 minute moviei can say in conclusion that this is a movie that i would easily recommend to anyone there is no doubt in my mind that this is a classic and that it will live forever the reason i had to drop one point off my rating is simply the 20 minute beach scene at the start of the movie which dragged on and threw me out of the movie but i can easily tell that everyone else will love that scene so go aheadwatch the movie great film a classic and perhaps the best war movie ever,reality
 more of its kindto all the international reviewers complaining that only americans were shown in the movie only the most uneducated americans truly think no other country had a hand in toppling hitler the movie is amerocentric to be sure but its not about america personally i would also like to see spielbergs treatment of the raf in the battle of britain as well hopefully a quality british director will take up that cause if spielberg doesnt its not that we dont know that europeans and especially russians werent essential in winning the war its that this movie is following a group of americans dont like that make your own id pay to see it ,reality
this is my second favorite world war ii movie after schindlers list which was also made by steven spielberg is captivating and also shows the whole events that war carries the movie is well acclaimed for its graphic realistic depiction of world war ii since i wasnt there during it if this is what war looks like i pray to god that there is no world war iiithe movie is about a united states army rangers captain john h miller tom hanks and seven other soldiers under him as they search for a paratrooper private first class james francis matt damon who is the lastsurviving brother of four servicemen and has been ordered by the president to be brought home as his family fears losing all five sons to the warthere is just one thing about this movie that cut my attention after hanks character captain john h miller drags he crew through the war losing many on their way in crude ways all in the name of finding private they finally found him and refuses to go back with them claiming he doesnt need saving miller and the remaining of his crew then joinss course if i was miller i would have knocked him up the head and drag him homeis a war epic film done by steven spielberg who has been involved in some world war ii films before this like empire of the sun and schindlers list to prep the guys for the film the cast except from matt damon were sent to a ten days boot camp for training and work on the film set to prepare them for their roles the reason damon was excluded was for the other cast to develop a form of resentment towards him which will help in their reaction to him during filmingcritically noted for its portrayal of world war ii this film was released to a high positive acceptance and earned a whooping 11 nominations in the academy awards going home with just 5 including winning spielberg his second academy award as a director the movies cinematography too has to be praised the movie shots during the world war ii fight on omaha beach is a classic to see that scene has been noted as one of the greatest tv scenes of all timewas also a commercial success making more than 6 times its 70 million production cost and its home video sale was massivethis is a movie that i can bet my name on that you will enjoy the depiction of the war sequence the sad end to lives during the war the repercussion of cowardly behavior all added to the drama and the fun you will get while watching this war classicwwwlagsreviewscom,reality
this is simply the best war movie bar none so far anyway this movie set a new standard for the film industry when it comes to recreating combat scenerios the dday scene is the most brutal realistic depiction of war ever produced when you go to a movie war movie or any movie the filmmakers try to give you the sense of watching that scene play out in real time in front of your eyes in this one though spielberg grabs you by the shirt pulls you in and makes you be a witness to the scene as it plays outeverything about this movie was outstanding the cast was perfect and gave performances of a lifetime the effects were second to none the photograph was mind bending there was not a detail left unattended to simply perfect this is what all movies should strive to be,reality
before there are any misconceptions i do like this movie i find it one of spielbergs best one of the unforgettable period films of the 90s with the likes of tom hanks barry pepper tom sizemore edward burns and a surprisingly good performance from vin diesel cant believe i said that the acting is pretty damn good its recreation of dday is probably its strongest scene by far setting the tone perfectly sacrifice the many battle scenes are done without a hitch and there are great strides in the history of war film effects john williams music is encompassing and well done not one of his best but still very goodi have but a few problems with the movie one its moral quandary is supposedly the sacrifice of many for one however the question honestly seems selfdefeating why you probably ask because the movie seems to seal this moral lesson in quite frankly one of the most obnoxious characters ever upham played by jeremy davies  im not sure what the point of his character was for some time hes a morality tale lifeboat who boast about the indecency of killing soldiers who surrender fine and dandy living up to the codes of conduct and what not however during the big finale this character proves to be little more than a coward whos failure to act cost the lives of many and i know i know it in a way simply portrays tragic irony and the confusion battle brings but the end result with upham finally doing what he shouldve done in the first place seems dare i say pointless after the whole movie seemingly supporting mercy what was with the sudden redundancy of the message it seemed the majority of the characters died for reason not even our film makers understood or mixed upive been told this is what you call a prowar movie and to an extent it is all in all despite its mixed up morality the film is still one i enjoy though,reality
i recently wrote a review on the thin red line terrence malicks war epic that was badly timed and unfortunately forgotten in that review i mention how it was released around the time of the best war film known to man so i stand by thatis the story of a group of soldiers led by a captain played by tom hanks one of his best performances who are sent on a mission during wwii to bring home captain jamesmatt damon a soldier who is unaware that his three brothers have died in combatthe film has such a great story and it really brings us into the action and into the characters states of mind yet it is three hours long but for me that three hours just flew by steven spielberg went home with an oscar for this film but the film lost the best picture award to shakespeare in love a wonderful film that isnt as good to be honestthe cinematography is marvelous and the action sequences are riveting the acting is something that i cannot leave out either is a captivating and sad film experience that really makes you feel for the characters and makes you feel a longing to be homespielbergs film is spectacular remarkable and definitively unforgettable a filmmaking spectacle on the grand scale this is one of his best works probably on his top five you definitely have to see this at some point or anothera,reality
out of all the nominations for best picture in 1998 at the academy awards im still baffled how this one isnt the movie to take home the statue instead you have some lame shakespeare in love get that honor that no one in this century even remembers you dont see sil getting replayed on cable all the time like spr does you dont have a great half hour opening scene like in spr with the normandy scene which is one of the best scenes in motion picture historyspielberg and hanks with this and then followed up with the miniseries band of brothers and the pacific basically reinvented what a depiction of war should look like on film,reality
spielbergs 1998 war movie about the story of a group of men setting out to find the last surviving brother in a family of four is timeless tom hanks plays the lead of captain john miller a schoolteacher and supporting roles are given to barry pepper tom sizemore matt damon and edward burns among others who all act very well the opening battle scene is my favourite movie scene completely capturing the horrors of not just world war 2 but every other war as well furthermore spielberg accurately captures the soldiers emotions in the war an aspect some war movies lack the audience is able to put themselves in the soldiers shoes very easily particularly in the scenes comprising of american deaths i found this film excellent and i hope anyone else who watched it did as well,reality

i read four or five pages of reviews for this film on the imdb boards and most of them fall into one of two camps  those who felt it was the best or at least one of the best war movies ever made  and the spielberg bashers who decry the very fact that america and its allies had even the slightest audacity to win the war granted the concept of good americans versus evil nazis is a bit too simplistic when it comes to cinematic treatments those viewers who want to read so much of that into the picture are missing one of spielbergs main goals  how do you find decency in the hell of warfare that question reverberates around the central plot the mission to rescue a sole surviving brother whos three siblings have all perished in the same war already for the eight members of the rescue team the quandary is presented in terms of moral prerogatives  why potentially sacrifice so many soldiers at the expense of just one who may already be dead anyway moral dilemmas abound in the story ed burnss private reiben challenges captain millers tom hanks decision to release a german soldier on his own recognizance to turn himself over to an american patrol private caparzos compassion for the young french girl in the bombed out town is seen by the captain as a life or death threat to his unit and must decide for the greater good of his men even when millers rangers finally achieve their objective and find private matt damon the situation does not play out in straightforward fashion resolutely refuses to be rescued instead seeing that alternative as abandoning his own men by what right should he be so singularly absolved of his duty to serve and protect his country my summary line above captures the essence of millers response and observation knowing that his duty and his humanity are in obvious conflictthis conundrum creates another dynamic in the story reverting back to the character of private reiben when was anonymous it was easy enough to dismiss him as some nameless faceless soldier who didnt warrant any special kind of treatment up close and personal however proves his value as a soldier in battle side by side with reiben in the german tank ambush at rammel these perspectives are not typical in your average war movie and make the film far more interesting than if it had taken a more documentary like approach as in the opening half hour of the film with the landing on omaha beachperhaps the most complex character and the one i had the hardest time with was corporal upham jeremy davies by virtually all of his responses to battle conditions and enemy encounters he was an outright coward his singular moment of bravery was enacted with some measure of revenge against steamboat willie the german soldier whos life was spared earlier in the picture willie provided upham with a reason to overcome his distaste for war by abrogating an implied trust they shared over a cigarette upham had his reason and motivation to kill willie while allowing the remaining germans to escape for upham the war had to become personal for him to take action and thats no way to survive in conflictso for me isnt just a war film and if you view it through that lens the film loses much of its impact even with the brutality of omaha beach and the tank battle at the bridge to be sure the picture succeeds at capturing the intense horror of war but its power as a film goes deeper when it identifies with its characters and examines their relationships with each other as soldiers and men how do you find decency in the hell of warfare one man at a time,reality
well the trailers and poster are very misleading though before seeing this movie i read the content advisory and even though it said that this movie is extremely violent i was kind of expecting a positive energy from the characters throughout the film boy was i wrong still though i like really depressing and serious moviesmajor spoiler i love movies where one character dies for another i find it absolutely moving i loved how in this movie hanks didnt die to save damon but died to teach him to be a better mancritically this movie was amazing the acting was fantastic the writing was very welldone the characters while they could have been developed a little bit better were still developed just fine in my opinion the directing was great overall this movie is very moving and i recommend it to everyone who can sit through blood and guts,reality
in the late90s there were two particular films that redefined their particular genres was one of them the other unfortunately was the matrix almost every war movie that followed spr right down to 2008s rambo seemed to be no more than a pastiche of spielbergs hectic stylespr proves what an inconsistent filmmaker spielberg can be the man has had his fair share of misfires hook anyone but this was his last truly great effort war of the worlds and munich were good though hardly as revolutionary but the terminal catch me if you can and the movie that called itself indy iv were all just too gutless and inoffensive youd never believe they were from the same director if you didnt know bettera lot of critics have repeatedly praised spr over the years but they all praise the same things the documentary style the realism etc simultaneously a lot of people have dismissed it as shallow badlywritten and void of any thrills beyond the 30minute mark but look beneath the surface and youll find that spr does actually have a tight screenplay despite going through the motions on few occasions the wide and diverse cast including paul giamatti ted danson dennis farina and dale dye do good with the material its refreshing for a war movie to move beyond the point of view of one man clichjanusz kaminskis desaturated gritty highshutterspeed photography is full of deep blacks and high contrast this look has been imitated to death over the years but coupled with spielbergs hurried almost unscripted approach to the action it adds an element of authenticity to the film that the copycats have not been able to emulateyou really have to feel for all those poor soldiers who were massacred on omaha beach all men i should point out but what a badly planned mission no flack jackets no smoke screens to cover their landingwarfare has come so far in 65 years it would be insane to send so many hundreds off to die like that now many of them were pure cannon fodder and the military knew it the film certainly does not hold back on the bloody carnage most wwii movies up until that point were sanitized and bloodless hardly realistic at allthe 169 minute running time passes fairly quickly the film certainly doesnt deserve the criticism that nothing interesting happens after the beach invasion as it has been imitated many times since some of then innovative moments such as the silent war is hell amid battle chaos  which this film does three times have become clichs but dont judge spr for itthe film won 5 oscars but lost the best picture award to shakespeare in love which is absolutely insane i meanwhat were they thinking spr is most certainly a classic and one of the most innovative and important war films of the past two decades while shakespeare in love is largely forgotten,reality
havent seen this one since it played in theaters i didnt think all that much of it then it actually improved a bit on rewatch though i still find that my problems with it back then have not at all disappeared my main problem is and was that spielberg really seems to think this film is some deep antiwar statement some extremely important existential story and its just not at heart this is very much like the wwii classics the story of gi joe and battleground both directed by the great william a wellman about a group of fairly stereotypical and not all that well defined soldiers who risk their lives for a greater purpose sure they are constantly asking the question is it worth it but spielbergs painfully corny wraparound story with private visiting arlington national cemetery answer that question with a resounding duh not to mention that the whole existential crisis why should eight men be sent to die for one is a fabricated one anyway as it is after all fiction and during the films release we were told over and over again by everyone involved with the film and very gullible film critics that this was an antiwar movie one of them who could see through that just saw fit to tell us how much more awesome joe dantes completely forgotten small soldiers was so he seemed kind of like a crazy homeless person yelling at a wall yeah its so not that either the proof twelve and a half years later exists in the slew of wwii themed video games all very clearly inspired by the film that have ruled consoles in the past six or so years i clearly remember roger ebert saying that this was the first film that did not make war seem fun but damned if people arent having a ton of fun shooting up nazis on their tvs id guess that has done more to recruit new soldiers than any army of one commercial ever hasso yeah it misses several of its main aims however while you can castigate steven spielberg for misunderstanding his context you cant say a thing bad about his technical work on the film sure the handheld aesthetic that he uses in the battle sequences has inspired a lot of very dire copycats over the past twelve years try not to laugh during the big battle at the start of gladiator but it was pretty brilliant at the time and it really puts you right there war might be fun but its also damn scary and i found myself shaking with some tears in my eyes after the gigantic beach storming that opens the film i try to forget the arlington sequences exist finally comes to an end the slower more personal moments arent the best partly due to the variable cast which ranges from fantastic jeremy davies to acceptable tom hanks to terribly annoying edward burns and paul giamatti but theyre mostly fine and always beautifully shot i love some of the smaller moments of the movie especially the slap that the little french girl gives her father when the gis are able to hand her back to him after the extraordinarily tense sniper sequence all in all while the film is kind of a mixed bag i do think that the impressive moments far outweigh the overall ponderous nature of the movie,reality
realistically if a masterstroke even by spielbergs standards is renowned for anything to the unfortunate global margin who have not yet witnessed its awesome might it is the opening battle scene at omaha beach in a graphic unflinching and intelligently crafted 24 minutes of intense combat hanks captain miller attempts to lead a scattered battalion up the normandy dunes where the germans have strategically set up a prime and virtually impenetrable defense made up of turrets and other artillery which they fire unceasingly at the landing soldiers this sequence has been lauded justifiably as possibly the most realistic not to mention enthralling wwii battle scene ever made a nonstop actionpacked spectacle of epic proportions this opening absorbs the viewer to the extent that the experience becomes a predominantly visceral one where everything on screen is felt rather than seen or heard when the soldiers begin to yell military jargon to each other amidst their chaotic surroundings much of which is either inaudible or incomprehensible the instinctive understanding between the characters and the viewer is mutual were getting shot at so shoot back harder during these times when the characters take time to stop and confer with one another it is refreshing to see spielberg defy war movie convention by not also causing the turmoil around them to cease many a soldier is cut off midsentence by an unfortunately aimed bulletmortar shell and as if positioning the camera in amongst this pandemonium would not suffice spielberg goes to great lengths to ensure that the audience feels not only like a spectator to this event but a borderline participant techniques such as allowing a freefall of water and blood onto the camera and the incorporation of a smouldering grainy effect on the lens that seems to elongate and redefine every stroke of light and colour on screen add to the experiencespielbergs meticulous attentiontodetail is a distinctive aspect of his directing style that informs much of the omaha beach landing as theres a strong notion while watching that every one of the hundreds of extras on screen is briefed on the scene as fully as possible being instructed on precisely when and where to shoot scream fall die etc this amongst other spielberg traits is the mark of a brilliant director and a quality that no doubt won him his second best director statue along with his uncharacteristic choosing of such mature subject matter as in his previous win for schindlers list five years earlieris at its foundation a thrilling and rewarding film that succeeds in exhilarating the audience and fulfilling the needs of any adrenaline junkies who happen to be watching what sets the film apart from a vast category of movies that also achieve this merit is that when the action stops the viewers interest doesnt this is attributed to the snappily flowing and probable dialogue that never degrades itself enough to be necessary if any quality of a film is ever more appropriately ordained necessary as opposed to entertaining rest assured it definitely couldve been better granted everyone could have gone without hanks speech about the horrors of war and his longing for home the only truly disingenuous moment of the entire film manufactured solely for usage at awards ceremonies as a short to accompany hanks nominations but this single scene try as it might thankfully does not derail the rest of the films engaging at times funny and insightful script in fact in being surrounded by such brilliance hanks monologue even becomes somewhat endearing with repeat viewingsa gem in its own right is heightened to further planes of excellence by a cast of great variety and at the time predominant obscurity with the exceptions of hanks tom sizemore and matt damon nevertheless each and every one of the mainly young and inexperienced actors that make up millers unit are given a chance to prove themselves worthy of their time on screen modern day action hero vin diesels dying caparzo pleading for one of his friends to shelter a letter for his father the eerily captivating ribsis wade speaking of his longtempered guilt at having deceived his mother davies upham silently crumbling into a selfloathing hysterical mess unable to summon the courage to shoot an enemy soldier virtually anytime that goldbergs mellish and peppers jackson speak with their casual humour stoic sorrow and startling arrogance that is as involving as any other character ed burns as reiben the largest supporting role initiates the first of what has resulted in a typecast career and a slew of hardened defiant almost badboy roles he shatters this faade only once to speak of a beautiful and most pertinently curvaceous woman he knows back home whom he thinks of whenever he finds the war around him too much to bear sizemore is walking familiar ground as the toughened and ripened authoritarian support but at least there is a dimension to his character unseen in the illfated pearl harbour matt damon in the brief role of private is outstanding in his ability to connect with the audience especially the anecdote he tells involving his three brothers persuading surprisingly comfortable laughter and a touching sense of loss tom hanks fine portrayal of captain miller is a truly original character in which there is no hint of the tender forrest gump or the jaded but honest charlie wilson miller is a testament to hanks wide and impressive spectrum which is made abundantly clear anyway by virtually every film he appears inan audiencepleasing endeavour that offers as much excitement as it does quaint and unexpected intimacy is a war film that never seeks to glorify itself but rather acknowledge that great things can sprout from even the shttiest situations,reality
ive seen this film 2 weeks ago and ive never forgotten this dramatic film its not only a normal world war ii film movie but a movie with a very moving story and many impressive scenes its a mus seen film because you really can imagine that you were accompanying the search troop which was looking for james some parts are filmed with hand cameras which have the effect that youre much more on the edge of your seat and thus it takes the character of a realistic documentary film but also the typical war music makes you feel some shivers with the actor tom hanks as captain john miller you see a convincing major who plays his role as if he had never been doing something else personally i think that this is the best and most dramatic war movie ive ever seen it really pushes you to think about the situations in war and about the army and all this stuff i recommend to everyone who likes war movies with partly true and impressive stories and who isnt scared if he sees sometimes some blood,reality
i admire this film on many levels the acting is absolutely superb especially the performances given by tom hanks vin diesel matt damon and all the supporting actors as well as the other leads i dont have preferences but i only mention these off the top of my head the direction by spielberg is confidant and calm when it needs to be but also ferociously intense when there is a need for it for every explosion and gunfight there is a quiet moment between the characters which is just as worthwhile if not more and robert rodats screenplay is pitchperfect janusz kaminski is one of the finest cinematographers alive and he brings the story alive in exquisite detail the first twentyminutes which show the famed dday landings is one of the most spectacular and haunting pieces of footage ever caught on film there are many reasons i love the film but what brought the film down for me was essentially the story there was no lack of it or too much of it and it was interesting but when spielberg is fighting for believability in these shots i did not believe it with the story as a backdrop the story goes that after damons brothers are killed around the globe on the same day the army wants to send him home to his mother and sends a group led by hanks to find him and send him home while something that is decent im sorry but the government is not that decent and i didnt believe it for a second which constantly brought the film down,reality
a group of us soldiers cross enemy territory to take james damon home to his mother who has already lost 3 sonssteven spielbergs brutally honest war drama tells the story of a brave and emotionally uplifting idea of family that exploits the nature of the second world war in a highly realistic and flinching manor that has won over fans all over the worldthe jaws director instantly sets off by cementing the main characters at the heart of the battle of normandy this opening battle is a mark of true leadership from spielberg you simply have to look and see the vast collection of people main actors extras stunt doubles all crowded together to see the work and effort put in by the man and it all works in perfect synchronization to create a devastating feel of realism the silence of no music and the cries from soldiers and shouts of orders and heavy breathe give this opening a very eerie feel a necessity to make the feel of the film which continues uninterrupted throughout the entire durationthe action sequences of this 1998 release are the key element to its realism the use of various weapons the direction of tanks and boats all comes together to create a hardship for the script and emotional feel of battlethe script adds a great sense of drama that coincides with the films ambitious outlay the inclusion of emotional soldier sub stories adds an extra dimension to the already dramatic element of the second world war matt damons ad lib for his brothers spying game is a fine example of the emotional core at the heart of the situation other elements including friendship and family are well included and portrayedthe story itself a story within a bigger story is great this rescue attempt to save private included numerous twists shocking action montages and a battle of personalities withstanding emotion that gives this film a true sense of realism in context justifying what it would truly be like going to war and dealing with unthinkable consequencestom hanks leads strongly from the front and though not his strongest role gives a fine leading performance inspiring the likes of other soldiers in his group to follow suit matt damon as ever is perfect whilst the religious side story to barry peppers protagonist is perfectly emotional and balanced with other sub storiesspielbergs direction extends to more than just big battle montages such as the shot of a hand through dying eyes the emotional core of doing the duty the high shots from towers the character recognition the director has created something utterly remarkableat times the film can slow down a little too much and is quite long but then the relevance is significant of the true battle as with the filming the shaking camera and unsteady feel with the colour ratio changing adds spice and a uniqueness to make a groundbreaking and deserved oscar winner,reality
easily the best war movie ever not including apocalypse now as a war movie has a great yet simple plot a very powerful and interesting story the characters are all very believable and some relatable it is an epic film not only the best war movie ever but one of my favorite films tom hanks is very likable tommy s is a bad ass paul giamatti is great even vin deisel is good his most suiting and best role speilburg can really do a war film the cinematography is great it is the most accurate and raw depiction of omaha beach on film period great film great war movie if you havent seen it where have you been make sure you see it,reality
i wont summarise the film or talk about its technical and artistic brilliance it is a brilliant film which depicts ww2 as it was not the sanitised versions we were used to seeing from the 50s onwards but to me there is a more important lesson to be gained from this filmi went to see this film in a suburban cineplex here in australia on the night there was a huge audience and a large group of teenagers whod wandered in because the film they wanted to see had a full house i overheard them saying this they were boisterous and noisy and sometimes obnoxious as kids can sometimes be at cinemas but after the first five minutes of the film they were dead silent and they remained so for the rest of the filmi looked at their faces as they exited the theatre at the end of the film all were ashenfaced drainedsome clearly close to tears i was happy about this because a film had hammered home to a bunch of modern kids the reality of war without them having to experience it first hand thank god all at once they learned that war is horrible sometimes necessary and best avoided im sure they learned to look at the elderly survivors of this time in human history with a newfound respect in short they grew up considerably and without any physical pain as a result of watching this masterful film and for that i thank spielberg profusely bravo sir,reality
absolutely a top notch movie i personally think it is a top 20 film of all time the acting was exceptional the special effects where exceptional and the plot was not bad at all very realistic i liked how tom hanks portrayed a common man  before the war and came to be a very uncommon man during combat if we look back at the greatest generation valor was common to many american sailors airman marines and soldiers the intensity of combat or better yet the intensity and urgency of the mission to bring the last son out of france combat kept a tension built up all around classic and rare film this film hit on all cylinders,reality
first off i have heard some reviewers say the germans are treated like they were born to die that is definitely not true in the beginning they show multiple scenes in which the americans shoot surrendering germans out of cruelty they show the sniper in the tower show forgiveness as he was about to shoot caparzo vin diesel in the head german also at the end of the movie showed forgiveness to upham and walked past him even though upham was actually armed ok now to the movie it was one of the best movies i have ever seen this movie is very disturbing and graphic but it isnt bloody to be bloody it has a purpose behind it and that is to show what soldiers had to go through at one point the scenes in the beginning with the beach was disturbing the hand to hand combat knife scene at the end of the movie was revolting yet it demonstrating what hand to hand combat is in war you will do anything to live even if you have to kill someone like they do in the movie ok just simply put this is the best movie ever,reality
is one of the best war movies ever made period from the intense harrowing opening battle sequence to its explosive yet touching climax grabs hold of you and never lets go acclaimed director steven spielberg brings this movie to the big screen and he continues to prove that hes one of the best filmmakers in hollywood today with a great cast including tom hanks edward burns tom sizemore matt damon barry pepper and vin disiel a relatively unknown at the time in a small role all turn in terrific performances for those of you who havent seen it yet i wont say anything else about the film its one of those movies you should see without knowing too much about it because that only enhances the experience the battle sequences are jaw dropping hard to watch at times and realistic giving audiences a look at what these courageous men went through back then the running time of 170 minutes did make the movie feel a little slow at times but thats a minor flaw and the good more than outweighs the bad if youre a fan of spielberg the cast or war movies than youll love its one of those films that can be missed,reality
when you see certain movies like rambo commando or predator you see a warrior going out in the jungles and taking the whole enemy army down single handed the truth is that while such movies are good in their own right because they allow you to escape into a world of fantasy the movies are misleading because war is nothing like what is shown in them you do not survive a war because you have muscles which you can flex you do not survive a war because you are more skilled than the other those are the days of ancient warfare when you would fight with swords but modern warfare is all about luck you survive only if you are lucky that of all the thousands of bullets and debris flying around not one strikes you or even if it does it strikes you in a way that it does not kill you nobody goes into a war without fear nobody remembers a country when fighting a war all that matters is survival  survival at all costs and that is the true picture of war that manages to show so beautifullythe movie opens with a very brutal war sequence based on the ohama beach war it is difficult to imagine how the movie makers managed to plan the filming of this entire sequence it is so realistic and will forever dispel the notions of any exuberant youth who thinks that war is glamorous there is nothing glamorous about war and there never ever will be i have heard rumors from my friends that some people vomited in the cinema hall due the extent of violence portrayed in this movie and so i must warn you that if you are someone who is easily affected by blood and gore pray do not watch this movie or at least this sequencespielberg along with the rest of the crew does a stupendous and a beautiful job of showing a rescue mission that leads the leading group into the heart of war to rescue one man  private who has already lost three of his brothers to the world war operations an order has come in from top authorities to extradite the last of the four brothers how does the team assigned feel about it needless to say they are grumbling about it but as we should know a solider is nothing but like a pawn in a game of chess the moves of which are determined by people far from any pain and without any proper understanding of how painful war is in realityfor any person this movie is a mustwatch it is a mustwatch for many reasons you must watch it because it will remind you of what the world has seen in world war ii it will remind you that war should indeed be the last solution that a nation must resort to it will remind you that there is no honor and glory in war there is only one thing  miserable death this movie will prove to be a lifechanging experience for most people it might even leave you with some sleepless nights yet it remains a movie that i believe one must watch in his lifetime,reality
from the word go i felt immersed in the scene of the dday landings these scenes were indeed frightening but terrific all at the same time the camera work was just excellent and the acting was superbone thing i noticed from people leaving comments many people hold a hostility towards this film because it makes americans look like heroes this is totally understandable as we do often gratify ourselves too much but this movie was based on the lives of americans in the war and the writer and spielberg tried to make it as unbiased as they can but the fact is more people look at the american fronts more than any other this is a sad fact as nearly all countries suffered from this great but yet horrible war it is clearly seen in the movie that surrenders of the german side were horrible because our american troops executed some of them that stirred me in the wrong direction but yet it is trueand as for previous comments the english and canadians did help clear the beaches but didnt play a huge rolesetting the issues before aside this was possibly one of the best movies ever made i know spots can get dry sometimes as will all movies but other than that it kept me interested and entertained,reality
ive just seen for the first time and as occurs when i first see a film i quickly check imdb to see what the haters and lovers of the movie say in their reviews first the hatersany time any movie portrays america as savior of europe in world war ii the result gets panned by these groups and if theyre not yet organized they should be as they deserve each other 1 america haters from any country notably a germany we werent all bad or b the uk we carried the burden until the tardy selfinterested yanks decided to enter war which by the way was almost won when the us came in and 2 hard leftists everywhere how the left is anywhere entitled to credibility is utterly beyond me hey germany you were bad hitler was constitutionally elected and brought to power by the german electorate only too happy to see the jew and the occasional bolshevik blamed for everything afflicting weimar germany hey uk we love you but sometimes your hard right and hard left are hard to stomach pssst you our british cousins had lost the war by 1941 it was over ended caput stickaforkinem done winston well knew how critical it was that america enter the war  which it did and which it won we are delighted that winning the war was largely an effort of the englishspeaking world but it was the englishspeaking worlds largest country that led the way turned the tide and won the war stop with the idiosyncratic reasons why exactly the us simply joined an already successful enterprise she didnt britain was sunk and defeated with precious little industrial capacity left  industrial might had to come from the us and canada but mostly the us isnt propaganda  it contains critical truths and sometimes truth makes for excellent propaganda,reality
the brilliantly directed spielberg world war two epic saving private1998 completely redefines combat action films up until this point whether you are one for extreme realism or just like to watch things blow up this movie is the epitome of all things good and pure in war movies there is no compromise in this film it seamlessly joins drama and action to form a movie that mom and dad would like it follows a rag tag but elite squad of army rangers through their historical landing on omaha beach in normandy france to their journey to find and bring home private  matt damon of the 101st airborne their mission was to find and retrieve damon and send him back to the united states after the tragic news of his three brothers dying in combat the army thought the loss too great for his mother to bear however this was a reoccurring point in the movie is the life of one worth the lives of many the squad leader tom hanks delivers an oscar nominated performance that is unforgettable while acting side by side with tom sizemore as sergeant mike horvath and edward burns as private richard reibenthe movie left me wanting more war movies of the same quality immediately recognizing the world class directing cinematography and editing the emotion and intensity is captured by the shaky camera shots to the low and high angle pans of the battle scenes and really brought home with the close up of the characters grief and pain the directing really made this film it not only enthralled the viewer during the movie but powerful scenes left the viewer thinking long after the film was over no matter how i describe the intricacies that make this picture great none do more justice and give more description than just one word spielberg the credibility is in the name sure enough as credit is given where it is due the movie received five oscars three of them being best director steven spielberg best cinematography janusz kaminski and best editing michael kahn it also won oscars for best effects and sound effects as well as best soundi would recommend this movie to anyone if youre the ardent movie critic or just an average joe there is something that we can all appreciate about this film and leave with the same expression wow this piece of art is nothing less than the silver screen at its best i give this film two thumbs up more if i was humanly capable and my full approval,reality
the first encounter of spielberg with tom hanks was amazing and i almost cried for the moviespielberg is able to take you into action and make you feel as if you are a participant in the movie and not just a viewer this is tom hanks best movie he ever did until terminal forget his performances in philadelphia and forrest gump though they were also good he should have received another oscar for the role of capt john miller a leader who must act strong in front of his men but must also hide his emotions from them it would have been welldeserved if he won againand what more is a great war tale nicely drawnthe first scenes in the movie was enough to tell about it9610,reality
after seeing this movie for the first time last night the only word that can be used to describe this movie is spectaculari chose to rent this movie simply because of the outstanding reviews everyone who saw it said that it was a masterpiece so i knew that i had to see it ive seen plenty of war movies some bad some excellent before i move on i have to say that this is the closest thing there is to band of brothers after watching band of brothers countless times my expectations for were extremely high but it met them in the end the only major problem i had with this film was the fact that i had tons of trouble renting it due to me being 15 years of agethe first scene of the movie shows as an elderly man visiting an american wwii cemetery in france and i think that the movie could have done without that scene that scene tells you right of the bat that private lives through the movie and that someone close to him in the movie dies putting that scene aside the first combat scene takes place on the shores of omaha beach the most gruesome battle of all the beach heads when it shows the 101st airborne preparing to hit the beaches in the boats you almost feel as nervous as they are and as soon as the boat hatch opens you feel helpless almost as if you were on the beach left to die the entire scene is absolutely jaw dropping and it drags you through the beach showing you all the hell and carnage that took place that daythe rest of the movie is very straight forward a small group of men set out to rescue a private they barely have any idea who he is or where hes located all they know is his name and why they need to find him the acting is really great and tom hanks was as great as i expectedbut there were a few to many conflicts between the soldiers that really shouldnt of happened and the soldiers in the film dont realize that the germans are people to and they are killing americans for the same reason theyre killing germans but i guess soldiers back then didnt realize that either so it doesnt matter but it will get to you while you watch the film overall this move was of course spectacular and it definitely deserves a purchase,reality
mr spielberg used all of his directing skill and research into the picture to perfect true war experience a real feat for a man who had never tasted the terror and insanity of war before even fire live rounds into hunks of meat to create the best sound of getting shot now thats devotion the story line is a heroic one a day for all american citizens to stand up proud on veterans day 60 years on yet lacks that story line that delivers on all aspects maybe im being untrue comparing a movie to a tv series but band of brothers also by spielberg is a better fulfilling satisfying storyline a company of soldiers travelling from curahee in georgia usa to berlin the ones who made it the ones who didnt you remembered so has changed war films forever thank you,reality
saving privateby daniel rosado directed steven spielberg cast tom hanks tom sizemore edward burns barry pepper adam goldberg vin dieselgiovanni ribisi jeremy davies matt damonis movie about a captain and his men going on an unusual mission to retrieve a soldier and send him home this movie takes place during world war ii and is quite different from other war movies you might have seen in the pastwhen you first see captain john h miller tom hanks hes trying to invade a beach with other soldiers dying all around him everywhere you look theres a soldier either being shot through his helmet or someone blowing up medics such as irwin wade giovanni ribisi desperately try to save the soldiers but many of them also get killed when the first battle is finally over you see dead men of all ages some missing limbs you also see the water near the beach has turned blood redmiller and the survivors tom sizemore edward burns barry pepper adam goldberg vin diesel giovanni ribisi jeremy davies of his crew are later on given a mission to find a private jason francis matt damon and send him back home to his mother his three brothers have recently died and he was the last of the boysprivate richard reiben edward burns along with the other men feels that risking their lives to save one man is very unreasonable but no matter how much they complain about the mission miller tells them that its their job to complete itwhen they do find the real one he refuses to leave he said that his comrades were his new family and he wasnt going to abandon them but miller wasnt taking no for an answer he decided to have his crew help complete his final assignment all of the actors put on good performances for the movie they really did seem like the type of people you would see go to war and when one of them would die you wouldnt feel like there goes another character dying you would really feel what the soldiers felt when they would lose a comradeis movie unlike any other you might have seen in the past you really do see what the real soldiers had to endure during wwii and why you honor them for what they did3 out of 5 stars,reality
this movie was an instant classic everything about this movie was perfect i could not find a single flaw in the acting storyline effects etcfirst theres a perfect cast tom hanks was the perfect choice to play capt john miller tom sizemore filled the part as millers sidekick sgt mike horvath very nicely edward burns was very good as the antagonizing pvt richard reiben barry pepper was great as the sniper pvt daniel jackson adam goldberg was good as the emotional pvt stanley mellish giovanni ribisi was excellent as the shy medic pvt irwin wade jeremy davies was actually funny and good at the same time playing the clutzy peaceloving nervous pvt timothy upham even vin diesel gave an excellent performance as the tough pvt adrian caparzo matt damon was great for the limited time he was in the movie as pvt james francisthe gore and special fx were first class everything looked so real it was as if they were in the actual battles dday landing at dog one was particularly gory and well made this movie must have had one hell of a huge budget and it payed off big time the sound score went excellent with every scene it really made you feel for the events that were occurringthe story was also great usually war movies have a pointless storyline but proves them wrong with a story of its own this movie was perfect spielberg at his best it deserves its place on the top 250 i recommend this to waraction movie fans of all kinds 1010,reality
bullets slash through the air everything explodes around you your men are getting shelled to death everywhere you look blood goes in your face you lose your sanity in war you dont know what to do or where to go this is sprs depiction of omaha beach on dday 1944 and an absolutely brilliant one at that not since spr has any filmmaker with any budget churned out an action scene as horrifyingly real as this films brutal depiction of the normandy landings even if for nothing else other than the first halfhour you should still watch this film from the moment you see nervous recruits chuck up inside the higgins boats you can tell you are in for a stunning action scene though after that the film wont ever be as intense or shocking in its action it is still something truly special the desaturated colours abundance of shouting swearing and explosions tell you one thing  this is war though black hawk down is easily as intense as this it just doesnt have the gritty feel of spr and you cant exactly care about the characters but on this you can  theyre all real people leading real lives back home  no horrible sacrifices or acts of heroism  just ordinary guys like us thrust into a world that they didnt like and in which they knew death awaited them at any corner i doubt anybody will ever make a war movie that will recapture sprs dizzy heights flags of our fathers didnt do the job and letters from iwo jima though it is looking promising just isnt intended to be a boxoffice smash though spr is full of warmovie clichs it is far better than most movies and besides it is hard to like a movie without an emotional or sentimental side  every film needs a heart and the war memorial scenes at the beginning and end of the film show us what spr wanted to be all along  a respectful homage to the soldiers of wwii to be honest with all the intense and bloody action scenes in this film putting us in the thick of battle it is good to have a bit of emotional contemplation once in a while war is brutal and unforgiving but war is also saddening and tearjerking  uses both those sides to its advantage forget major plot twists or superbly intelligent and brilliant scripts clever plots that lose you and amazing hero characters  realism is the place to be in war cinema that may explain why did so well for itself 1010,reality
okay first things first this movie is violent realistically violent that is not good for a movie there are violent films then there are violent films that are unpleasant to watch dont get me wrong this is a great film but lets face facts you cant watch this movie more than once it got to the point where i stood up in tears yelling at the screen stop it stop it much glorified violence in the film which i hate steven spielberg in my opinion is a very sick man his films always feature innocent people being slaughtered in some realistic manner whether it be being eaten being vaporized or being inadvertedly blown up by a bomb also it messes with your head big time you watch the death scenes and you watch the americans getting slaughtered and your like yeah get those sons of b but then they capture the nazi and hes only following orders then they kill him and you ask yourself well whos the bad guy here adam goldbergs death was chilling and incredibly painful to endure at which point i realized he just wanted to make a violent film after witnessing that over the top violent and completely unnecessary death i wondered why i was watching itthis film emphasizes the horrors of war though this film is useful it is a wake up call to all those conservatives who are trying to shove american customs down iraqs throat our soldiers have been suffering this horrific ordeal for years and why wwii was for a better cause this film is a one time thing it is a wake up call mostly but other than that it was graphic realistic and over all very painful to watch unless your the violent creep who gets off with violent movies in that case go crazy,reality
when i say clichs i mean the stuff like the flag waving in the sun an old man crying at the beginning etcwhen i say showing off i am specifically showing the first portion of the omaha beach sequence in slow motion that was very irritating i want a war movie that will just throw the gore and horror at you not one that is trying to deliver it in slow motionthat is absolutely ridiculousmany will disagree but that is why i am very fond of the movie black hawk downno cliques no showing off straight to the pointall that being said is still a masterpiece and i will go as far as saying one of the best films ever made it is realistic it is sad and it does workthe acting is great the screenplay is great the visual and sound effects are great the cinematography is greatthe movie is a masterpiece910 just because of the clichs and showing off,reality
a film that has been hailed by many as one of the most realistic ww2 dramas to date both in its context of battle and of its initial atmosphere few ww2 dramas are unable to capture the harrowing battle that was of ww2 but incorporates the power that churns your stomach as minute after minute you will see soldiers being instantly blown to piecesas you most probably know is a steven spielberg film and spielberg himself admitted that he has a selfobsession with the ww2 context as many of his earlier films such as the oscar scooping film schindlers list and empire of the sun are typical examples of films that are to do with ww2 and by in large they have very similar elements in common with each otherhas quite an unusual storyline for a ww2 picture but it does stand out basically after the historic dday invasion on omaha beach a captain who goes by the name of john miller must go along with seven other men to search for a missing soldier known as private james whos three brothers had been killed in combat and for most of the film you will be seeing sequences of how the men proceed to find him and what they must risk to get to him the storyline is successful in leaving a huge impact on the viewers but for the most part the storyline is not that attractive for one thing viewers just prefer to see for its action and realism rather than for the fictional story that has been laid out in itbut even though this film possesses a disputable story there are actually a host of notable actors in this film that do a good job of backing up the films rather sensitive storyline tom hanks gives a riveting performance as cpt john miller well as the films main supporting actors edward burns tom sizemore and of course matt damon in the role of private give some very excellent portrayals of their characters in the films premiseall throughout is an excellent film it includes some very realistic physics in terms of its action and the characters themselves really stand out but unfortunately the films storyline can be quite slow and offhanded and appears to be a little too innovative and overrated but if youre seeing private for the first time then the storyline might be the source that will entice you to watch it to the bitter end,reality
after the dday invasion captain miller hanks an his squad of seven other soldiers go through normandy to find james francis whose three brothers were killed in action as the squad searches to find private they asked the inevitable question why are they risking their lives to save one soldieris the best film to react the dday landing it is both horrific and gruesome it really shows how the landing took place unfortunately the film never gets better than the first 2025 minutesthe plot is good and is something i have never seen before in a war film the characters are also very good though it seems like speildberg just threw in every military job there is in this film the motley crue includes a sniper a medic a linguist and many morethe directing and dialouge is very well done it just seems like it takes itself a little too seriously at times it also seems like some scenes drag on a bit to longin my opinion hanks does a fantastic job as does everyone else the only one i thought didnt act as good was matt damon as private he has a fairly short role and didnt live up to itall in all it is a great war film with good directing a good cast and a good premise its just too bad that it dragged on a bit to long and took itself too seriously other than that it is a great movie to watch if you need a war fix just dont expect anything revolutionary in the genre810,reality
the opening scene alone should remind us that war never results in winners only the living and the dead and the traumatized and the maimed and the powers that be that send them out to fulfill their agenda will we ever learn this movie is a mustsee for all who not only want to end war but want to honor those who have been sacrificed and bravely died hoping to end all wars for all of us we are reminded that while war is not honorable human beings both the good guys and the bad guys are and every soldier has a home a family a history that is remembered by someone somewhere reminds us that they should be remembered by all of us with hope that the war to end all wars wont be the end of us all tom hanks is his stellar self tom sizemore is perfectly cast and giovanni ribissi sp proves to be a perennially underrated gem of an actor thank you steven for this incredibly realistic and important film,reality
great movie from the standpoint of emotional trials and tribulations of war and especially wwii but no soldier or officer in that war ever wore his rank in to battle on his uniform helmet flag overcoat automobile never ever the first person shot by the enemy is the one wearing rank if you want to die quickly wear your rank into battle this is an old lesson learned in the war between the states the pickets snipers of that war learned quickly to shoot the highest ranks first this rule is a very logical assumption and for the life of me i cannot figure out why a detail man such as stephen spielberg of all persons would ignore such an important detail for me this detail takes away much of the realism intended and i had to deal with it another way,reality
i just recently watched this film again for what must be the nearly 30th time and i still find myself numb and shaking like i did leaving the theater in 1998 i remember that night every time i watch this movie nobody spoke leaving the theater a lot of people were crying and i believe everyone had the sick sensation in their stomach and shaking hands i didpersonally i dont believe there has been a war movie that has ever captured even closely what its truly like to be engaged in actual close fighting and then came along this film yes the characters are fictional but the events their story takes place in are real and portrayed as accurately as could be humanly possible to recreate on film the action is intense and completely realistic and sickening to imagine anyone could have endured such events and survivedi find myself crying during the dday invasion and various other points during the film most notably when capt miller sits down on the rock after they take the german nest and cant control his hands and starts sobbing anyone who remains dryeyed after asks his wife to tell him hes lived a good life at the end must not have really comprehended the filmi consider this technically the greatest war film ever the set decorations are unbelievable the modified tanks are more than convincing the weapons 100 the real item and little details abound throughout the film such as the shot surrendering soldiers during the initial invasion actually being czech soldiers who would have been forced into the german armymost importantly i think this film is important to show in educational settings yes its violent yes its full of language and even shows us soldiers in questionable moral situations like shooting the surrendering soldiers aforementioned however if it can educate upcoming generations to what horrors war really presents to those participating then perhaps there will be hope for mankind after all when my daughter inevitably comes home from school one day and asks me what war is about i plan to sit her down and show her this film and make her watch the entire movie no matter how uncomfortable she getsmy favorite spielberg movie and one of in not my favorite movies of all time id give it eleven stars if i could this is one ill watch regularly until my grave,reality
this movie owns ive watched it over 20 different times and every time my heart is racing they need to make another one like this i really like the first part the whole rushing up the beach and all that is sweet as hell but the best battle by far in this movie is the last battle with the bridge and the alamo and the sniper lol that one guythe runner guy is so scared all the time  its great and some information about the guys in here they are all 2nd rangers obviously but that runner is in the 29th infantry division  im saying this because i play a video game called day of defeat and im in a realism unit if any of you want to check that out the website is 29thorg salute pvt cavallo  29th infantry division  116th regiment  1st battalion  charlie company  2nd platoon 2nd squad,reality
oh my god this is such a good film i cant explain what was shooting through me as i watched this i didnt think it would be this goodhonestly tom hanks as always was astounding matt damon as always was amazing and the supporting cast couldnt be more perfectspielbergs directing was on the nail obviously going for a newsreel approach as in they were news filmers in the action and happened to stay alive i love the saturated colour i love the simple story i love how emotional it is even for a guy that has never cried at a moviemeas a screenwriter myself the script was unbelievable perfectly capturing warand on its own for its absolute magnificence is the dday landing oh my god how good i was on the edge of my seat definitely undoubtedly one of the greatest action sequences everthe one annoying thing was that there were no british seeing as tho i am one and we did actually do 2 thirds of dday that irritated me but no matter this is my favourite film of all time watch it please,reality
is the best movie ive seen it shows what war was like and what the men had to go through its about 8 men risking their lives just to save one man steven speilburg did an awesome job directing this movie i cant say one bad thing about this movie i was just amazed i cant believe this isnt in the top ten of the top 250 movies if you havent seen this movie you are missing out this film has a great cast and a great director the greatest war movie ever is the best movie ever made speilburg does a very great job at recreating the dday scene there is only one movie you have to see in your lifetime and that is 1010 stars,reality
may not be a completely accurate portrayal of the western front in ww2 but it does have something in common with its equally great descendant band of brothers what this film does is make it feel like you are there from omaha beach to ramelle no other film does that its almost as if they went back in time and filmed this its almost genuineone of the things that stand out most in this film is the effectsyou experience the sound of bullet whizzesexplosionsand the eerie sound of approaching tanks on a quiet little bombed out town the films opening scene has been billed as the best dday scene of all time and it rightly deserves thatnowthere are a few historical inaccuracies people have noticed such as the church tower in ramelle whichaccording to german tacticswould of have been destroyed as it would give an advantage to the enemy but i dont think it will detract from the film the question this film poses is if it is truly worth it to sacrifice the lives of many for one person i think with the current situation in israel with the kidnapped soldiers this question has never been so apparentsoalthough its not a great way to learn ww2 historyits a great way to experience itlike many others this film got me interested in the period,reality
where do i begin this instantly became my favorite war film no other film has done it the way hanks and speilburg did it was just amazing even though i didnt see it in theaters i was blown away with the realism of it all what makes this film so intense is that speilburg filmed it himself with small onehand cameras to give you a first person glance at the battle at hand even though it was nearly three hours long it was simply amazingthe plot begins after the dday invasion when captain john h miller charlie company second rangers is given an assignment to take a squad of eight behind enemy lines to rescue prive james 101st airborn 506th whose three brothers were killed in combat during wwii as miller leads his squad through occupied france he begins to question the mission and if what there doing is worth risking the lives of his menthe reason why this movie did it for me was because its based on a true story where you cant mess anything up or your movie is shoti recommend this movie to mature audiences because of the intensity and anyone who is interested in history and anyone whose not,reality
this film supposed to be one of the most acclaimed movie made by mr spielber after et you can see the improvement of the sound effect the reality of war that you can see to the other movie i like this movie because of the story its amazing how mr spielberg got some big actors to play to the characters he madethe battle in the beach is one of my favorite part in the movie you can see the reality and truth about the warthe other one is the part of questioning their leader why 8 men risking their lives to save just one ive noticed that you will always follow the order or before you obey all actors was great such as tom hanks matt damon specially giobanni belluci and others this movie is one of my all time favorite,reality
this movie by far is my favorite the terror and bravery you see in the soldiers eyes and feel in their hearts really brings out the character in them the acting for this this was astonishing spielberg has really outdone himself this time as so with shindlers list the cameras and sounds made you feel as if you were part of the action tom hanks played a great role as cpt miller i am not the type of man to cry during movies or ever have but after seeing this i felt tears in my eyes the intensity and emotional aspects of this film made this film a favorite of mine and many others i salute all ww2 veterans and vietnam vets for their amazing bravery and pride in our land i spit on anyone who think this film was a waste of money and was crappy loud and stupid that think it is only a bunch of men shooting guns nonstop and frankly to those of you who do think that i would even pee in your direction if you were on fire,reality
i first saw spr back in april of this year in my 11th grade history class and it stunned me even now i still get chills thinking of some of the scenes the opening landing on omaha beach and the scene where private mellish adam goldberg gets stabbed were enough to give me nightmares for weeks afterwardthe sounds of battle were so real during the initial landing scene that i covered my ears and put my head on my desk it was as if me and my classmates were storming the beach with the soldiers getting shot at and shooting backeven so i wanted to see it again not for the blood and gore but for the characters wade was the one that i identified with the most the kindly medic would do anything to save a soldier even when he was already gone the two parts that really have stuck with me are the scenes where medic wade and private mellish die mainly because those are my favorite characters yay for giovanni ribisi and adam goldbergwades scene had me in tears it was so touching how they were trying to save him even as he was going into shock and hallucinating they kept up a steady flow of chatter to distract him as they put pressure on the wounds it made me cry even more as i heard what jackson was whispering to him as wade was fading out of consciousness shhhhhh youll be alright wade shhhhhh it was beautifully tragic how jackson comforted him in his last moments whispering to him and rubbing his foreheadand the other scene mellishs death was an absolute knockout hes fighting this german ss soldier guy and he gets overpowered and pinned to the floor as the soldier starts to kill him mellish pleads for his life and do you know what that soldier does next he soothes him as he stabs him to death give in    you have no other choice  make it easier for both of usthe war is over for you shhh rest now shhhhhhhh its easier for you this way that one scene made me so sad and angry at upham for being a coward and not helping mellish that i wanted to break somethingeveryone in my class thought corporal upham was a cowardly bastard who should have been shot when they got a chance and i agreed with them but i could also identify with him he was relatively new to combat and inexperienced scared of what he had to do if i were him id be scared toothis movie has shown me what war is really like its hell on earth the glossed over hollywood fluff of war movies of the past is dead to me ive always been a very empathetic person and i was warned before watching this that it would be very very gory and if i needed to i could step out and get a drink of water i didnt leave i watched through clasped hands biting my lip to keep from crying i didnt close my eyes to the horrori would have to say that every high school student in the united states should see this movie if not all of it they should at least watch the opening beach landing scene teens these days are so desensitized to violence that they dont know what real violence is this movie will change their minds i know it changed mine,reality
the story raises hard moral questions relating to the relative value of human lives and the overwhelming debt that may be felt by those who benefit when others sacrifice but the movie falls short of excellence because it doesnt so much explore these issues as finesse them in an actionfilled climaxi first watched this movie on the day it came out on the cinema and since then i have not seen a better made film this is without doubt the best war movie of all time and one of the best movies ever tom hanks gives one of the best performance i have seen him give and the other actors give a brilliant performances,reality
in ten or so years there will be no living veterans of world war two unlike all the wars since then this was a truly defensive war by the united kingdom france russia usa canada australia etc etc in the face of unprovoked aggression from germany italy and japanit is important that future generations think about the sacrifices made by the 53000000 people that died in that conflictspielberg has helped us understand what infantry combat in france might have been likeand what the families and friends of the dead gave up and what they were left witha truly excellent use of art to remind anyone that the history of the twentieth century shows that war is the last resort,reality
this is a truly awesome film in terms of special effects and it really makes you feel like you are in the action this is the closest i have seen to any war film in getting you feeling you are actually their sounds special effects and visual experience is superb although the video footage quality on dvd doesnt look so good on a larger screen for some reasonexcellent dvd demo disk the landing sequence at the beginning is simply breathtaking and really shows you what they went through the use of sound is amazing with bullets whistling past you band of brothers is pretty much the same but slower in pace due to the tv series lengthverdict fantastic a must own film to showcase visual effects and surround sound systems,reality
i believe that is a wonderful melancholy story of basically true eventsacts in history having researched the german ww2 army specifically and ww2 in general i found the uniforms flawless and the tactics in which the germans fought to be relatively correct most if not all of is great acting in which leads most into believing it is what most military men would due in world war two i personally think that this movie would be a perfect thing for people to believe is correct this movie shows that war is a lot more gruesome than most think parents if u have a child that thinks a life in the military would be nice or loves collecting war militaria or anything related i believe no matter what the rating parents should show there child this and tell war is even worse than this film a lot worse,reality
flawless thats the one word i would use to describe this film ive never seen anything like it it was definitely written by someone in the war and with respect for those who served in world war ii the acting is perfect and every bit of it is exactly how my grandparents describe war if your seeing this not for the storyline but for the violence then shame on you i am rarely touched by movies but this touched me especially the ending every battle scene is brilliantly played out and every actor does a brilliant job if you havent seen this movie then you better get off your computer and run out and go see it it is by far the best war movie ever made and a classic,reality
tom hanks gives an excellent portrayal of captain john h miller the leader of the rescue mission sent to take private home the fight scenes where also superb i felt like i was in an actual battle situation even though i was only wacthing it the battle on the bridge is also great and the camera work when captain john miller dies is excellent overall a great story with superb casting and i dont think i will be able to find anything wrong with it i felt i was there and most films dont drag me in like that great work by spielberg glad to see he has made better films than et and jurassic park try schindlers list superb,reality
currently the best movie made about any war since its release it has been inevitably used as the standard by which other war movies are judged including unfairly movies that were made decades before itthe battle scenes are horrifyingly realistic and the performances are exceptional it is unbelievable that this film was nominated for the academy award for best picture but lost to shakespeare in lovethe only criticism i have about this film is how quickly and easily cpt millers unit made it across the beach and up the bluff at omaha beach the carnage and amount of casualties were pretty realistic but in reality company c of the 2nd ranger battalion took over an hour to reach the crest after reaching the top they still had hours of hard fighting before any significant area was secure,reality
when you think of bloody horrible wars you think of vietnam maybe korea when you think of world war ii you picture bob hope entertaining the troops or people back in the states dancing to glenn miller shows what world war ii the most defining war in human history was really like the dday invasion of world war ii was to decide the future of the world fascist or democratic would the world be free or enslaved by nazis d day normandy france 1944 an american squadron is looking for a missing comrade the movie opens with a 20 minute war sequence with captain john millers unit landing on omaha beach and trying to push the germans further east to liberate western europe even though the allies win this battle body parts and blood is everywhere this film is full of graphic violence and gorethen the film shifts back to a government clerical office where secretaries are typing condolence letters to the mothers who lost sons in battle it is noticed that mrs of iowa has lost three of four sons in the d day invasion brought to the attention of army brass they decide that the us army must rescue james francis mrss only remaining sonfinding private is like looking for a needle in a haystack for captain millers squadron at times morale is very low you see the difference in personalities of privates jackson and reiben jackson is a fighter a war monger who doesnt care why hes there he just wants to please his commander and kill the germans reiben on the other hand is wary cautious and even somewhat belligerent about twothirds of the way though the story reiben is at odds with miller on the release of a german pow and even threatens to go awol but he along with jackson fights with honor and bravery in the final battleafter days of searching for private captain millers unit finally finds him guarding a strategically important bridge with a lost squadron private does not want to leave his troupe considering them the only brothers he has left this leads to a suspenseful climaxwhen a large german battalion spots the two american units guarding the bridge fighting breaks out who will survive this horrible war the americans appear outnumbered will they be able to save private from dying like his three brothers will mrs lose her last son in this war another spectacular film by steven spielberg is one of the greatest war movies ever made it was nominated for best picture best director oscar went to steven spielberg art direction and cinematography in the film is top notch as are the beautifully choreographed fight scenes which are dramatic suspenseful and ultrarealistic,reality
i posted my original comments on this film the day it first hit the american screens i will never forget the experience of seeing this film it was 11 am on a beautiful sunny day meat the time a 35 yr woman and about 25 old men  i am assuming many wwii vets sat in that darkened theatre and watched this incredible film when the lights came back on we all sat stunned and then filed out into the daylight all of us wiping the tears from our faces some of the men very emotionally moved and crying in their seatsmy dad was a wwii radioman in the navy his brother was a ship commander the other in the national guard when pressed my dad would tell me some stories of his time in service seeing this film and the faces of those old guys in the theatre helps me understand why dad never talked too much about it it was that devastating a film that devastating a timei was in another room last night when i heard the familiar sounds of the landing at omaha beach coming from the living room tv for about the 30th time i was drawn to watch those intense opening scenes once again drawn into the action just watching that first intense half hour the bodies washing up in the blood red waves the look in tom hanks eyes the echoey silence surrounding barry pepper as he makes to shoot the first sniper to open dog 1 well i was again knocked back with emotion i again was so very impressed at how spileberg did so much so well in this film from the distinctive camera work to the small details like the drops of blood on the camera lens to assembling the fine team of actors that brought such life to this film and such feeling for their deaths to the incredible adrenalized battle sequences at beginning and end to the very simple moments throughout and the stories of the meni just had to write again so many years later to say i really admire this film it is important not only from the perspective of film appreciation but also for the genuine and heartfelt way it tells of one of the most important times in american history and the very brave men who sacrificed so much,reality
the beach scene was gory and the most realistic any war movie has been it captures the ultimate horrors of war the story maybe a little silly but anyway forget about that this is an extraordinary war film full of thrills and surprises excellent scenes of battle tom hanks acts his very best in thisthis film can be disturbing to some but this is a must have for war film lovers the accuracy of the film is great to the uniforms to the guns and the tanks i love this film and have watched it many times and it never gets boring for meideas 90 effects 93 acting 91 story 50 overall 99,reality
steven spielbergs is clearly one of the most praised war movies so far it is an account of world war two from the perspective of captain john h miller and his squad on their mission to save one man private james francis who is the surviving brother of three each soldier questions the initiative and reasoning behind saving one man is it worth it to save man and risk the lives of many soldiers the answer is obvious by the end of the movie the story is told in a third person omniscient point of view with a focus on captain miller tom hanks sergeant horvath tom sizemore private reiben edward burns private jackson private mellish private caparzo vin diesel and t4 medic irwin wade the most breathtaking scene opens with the soldiers moving on normandy beach on 6 june 1944 the gate on the boat drops down and releases a surge of chaos as the viewer sees three or four soldiers drown they begin to realize that this movie is taking them for an emotional ride this scene is not drawn from pure hollywood imagination it is a highly accurate account of any soldiers experience during dday captain miller and his squad are assigned to find private james so he can go back home millers squad is forced to put away all of their morals and philosophies in order to do their job it is apparent that miller has a different initiative at first when hes given the mission he was promised a chance to go home and see his wife a chance most any man would not give up but when he actually found private it seems that he was glad to have saved him this is the perfect example of selfsacrifice during world war two not only were men and woman forced to give of themselves to save the land but they were also forced to save each other,reality
one of the best movies ever made the scenes made me live it for the entire film the characters seemed so real they made us feel and touch them never blinked for a moment every time i see this movie i feel the same feelings i had the first time mr tom hanks played his role like no one can he made us feel that he is that ordinary guy who found him self in a middle of the war not wanting to kill any body but his duties made him do it and when he can let any one go he does he is a great actor and the director mr steven spellberg is a great director i have never seen anything not good for him all the other guys were great i loved the sniper guy and was very angry when he died excellent job for all,reality
this was an excellent movie rich in character development well performed roles and topped off with a compelling theme i loved the irony of eight men sent to save onesome say the omaha landing portrayal was unrealistic but id like to see someone pull off the miracle of a better omaha scene than sprs it was as accurate as film can capture that violent moment you can either deal with that or complain as if action is all that mattersthis story is essentially about the characters normal people in extraordinary circumstances the war believe it or not is background this story belongs to the nine main characters not the entire war effort this is why only americans are portrayed if youre looking for the longest day setup why dont you check out cliches r us anyhow this is why we dont see the other allied nations in this movie spielburg wasnt saying americans did all the work the story is about soldiers who happened to be americans case closedsome argue the story is too one sided portraying all germans as dirty animals however there are many segments that suggest this isnt the case the americans act cruel in some scenes and germans do the same in others it was fair to both sides there was nothing enthusiastic in the scene where the two german prisoners are executed ultimately we must remember this movie is in the american pov when wade and kaparzo died we lost two of the films main characters of course their death scenes were to be more emotional than that of some extra playing a germanas far as flaws go there are only two worthy of mentionin the scene where tom hanks takes out three men with his thompson a minute before he meets the very last german dies long after the tommy guns sound effect expiresin the scene where jackson is in the church tower making his final kills before he dies he fires seven to eight shots with the springfield without reloading the springfield 1903 never held more than five bullets in any of its many modified models,reality
is probably the best war movie ever made everything about this film is awesome including the acting the special effects and the music what makes this film different from other war movies it has no music when theyre fighting of course this only makes it more realistic and it seems like steven spielberg will never run out of ideasthe beginning is quite disturbing and graphic but the special effects were amazing when they filmed it this movie is also really sad probably one of the saddest movies ive ever seen but that doesnt make it bad at all i havent seen many war movies but i bet saving pvt and schindlers list are his best i am a huge fan of steven spielberg films and this is my favorite of his movies what really makes this film good are probably its acting and special effects tom hanks did an excellent job acting out john miller in the movie like always acting as if it was really happening everyone else in the film is nearly as good as tom hanks and they all act like real soldiers the special effects are what bring this movie to the top the special effects make this movie brutal and realistic and ive never seen a film thats more graphicthis movie is a must see if you love steven spielberg films and war movies see it,reality
the above  is a quote by the famous union general william t sherman shows the hell fog and confusion of war what else can i say how about based on a true story it was in the brief scene with general marshall where he reads a letter to a mrs nieland in boston one signed by abraham lincoln its not general marshall played by dale dye a former marine captain whos reading it its john de lancie star treks q whos the uncredited letter reader it opens with an older and his family at the american cemetery in normandy hes at the grave of captain john h miller the man who saved his life in normandy in 1944 so whats the message of since i opened this review with a quote from general sherman why dont i close it with one from the book of john greater love hath no man than this that he lay down his life for his friends maybe i should paraphrase the epitaph on an unknown marine who died on guadalcanal when he gets to heaven to st peter he will tell another soldier reporting sir ive served my time in hell,reality
you know why this is one of the best war films of all time because spielberg puts us right in the midst of the war we experience the unvarnished direct and all the nittygritty details that went on in battle i cant think of any other film of the same genre which has done this he does this by using shaky pov camera shots showing us graphic images of soldiers getting blown up or getting shot brutal sound effects etc we also get a solid storyline with an actual plot our heroes have a goal and a mission to complete besides winning the war after a grueling 20minute opening that depicts the horrors that went on dday capt miller and his crew of soldiers are assigned to rescue private a paratrooper lost behind enemy lines his three brothers have just been killed in action and the army wants to send him home this leads capt miller and his crew to undertake a dangerous task with an uncertain outcometom hanks and company are excellent they all give convincing and rather lowkey performances giovanni ribisi and matt damon are particular standouts another thing i loved about the film was the pacing the balance between the ghastly battle scenes and the quiet scenes which gives us time to get to know our heroes is perfect you hardly notice that its a 2 hr and 50 min film the photography by janusz kaminski is incredibly distinctive it has this washedout look which makes it look like an old war newsreel john williams musical score is also appropriately effective its not his most memorable nor as haunting like the one he did for schindlers list but good enough to appreciate without a doubt all this wouldnt have been achieved if it wasnt for steven spielbergs expertise once again he shows us his versatility and mastery as a director to let audiences experience a story rather than just see it i can live with the fact that the film didnt win an oscar for best picture but it would have been an injustice if he hadnt won for best director a great war film and one of the best of the 90s,reality
not many movies can move me to tears in the first 2 minutes of its beginning but this one does the quite shaky steps of the aged priv thru the normandy grave site has an effect like no other war movie has most viewers just comment on the gore and horror of the landing scene but there is so much more to this movie than the violence and depravity of battle it brings to light such a sacrifice our grandfathers made that we often take for granted i appeal to anyone who still has relative who fought in ww ii to listen to their story record it and preserve their memories for future reference every day these veterans are dying off please hear their story before its lost in time,reality
its nice to see a film that depicts the value of human life as fragile as it actually is during times or war this movie with its phenomenal cast brings the characters in the movie to life and sends a message to the audience that war is in fact unpleasant this team of army rangers set off to save the life of one man tells the story of their journey and how hope is a driving force that keeps the team alive with its realistic war violence sequences the movie does a good job at making the audience feel compassion and empathy as though part of the story themselves this was the most memorable movie ive ever seen to this day,reality
steven spielbergs war time drama often gets recognition as the greatest war film ever i think that opinion is wrong but it certainly may be the most realistically shot hard edged war film of all time it is a masterpiece not without its strong points yet certainly not without a number of flaws that prevent this from being a true classic any which way you bend itthe story starts out with an elderly man visiting the arlington national cemetery visiting his fallen comrades of 60 years the movie takes place around the events of dday june 6 1944 starting with a captivating and harrowing battle sequence showing us young ones such as myself just what it may have been like in wwii combat the gore violence and cries are all very real and little is left to the audiences imagination we can even get a taste of what the characters are thinking andor seeingafter the 20 minute battle sequence we find that a boy pvt james has lost all 3 of his brothers and by government orders he is forced to leave combat and return home most of the film focuses around the troop of american soldiers who go through hell to find himafter the normandy scene the plot rarely really thickens and arguably is no longer as convincing or as interesting the script is painfully clich and average and there really isnt much in the way of character development spielberg makes the most out of what hes given occasionally going for the visual eye candy and occasionally slowing the pace down and attempting to give the film some serious emotional momentumspielberg attempts to show both sides of the war but too often falls back on his own personal bias attempting to cause the audience to emotionally stir and get their juices flowing often when theres not much juice to flow and not many emotions to be stirred sometimes he tries to tackle the challenge of making a mountain from a mole hill these scenes occasionally work yet they too often feel forced and empty such as the over done unequivocal allie death scenes which try too hard to force a response from the audiences mouthesthe story takes a few jolts and is never really predictable despite the often clichd telling of the goingons but after awhile it seems a bit two dimensionalone thing i did like was the use of the character of until the end as a metaphor spielberg uses his name as a metaphor at times for the freedom these men might never again see freedom they might never find again represents peace and they just cant find it not even amongst themselves as i said the film is at times visually stunning and the acting performances really help in some cases to bring life to otherwise dead characters tom hanks is riveting as usual refusing to be held back by the dulled scriptthe very ending actually left me bitterly disappointed its not that i was appalled by the patriotic message spielberg is perfectly entitled to make a film that celebrates the american dream of freedom but i was mad that the film once again decided to tellshow us everything thats the problem far too often shows us too much not leaving anything up to our imaginations as a war film it should show us a lot but the overall messages in the film are whetted down by further scenes that could have worked better if they had remained out of the film the ending could have worked on several different levels but instead spielberg almost tarnishes the would be message of the film by showing an emotional 5 minute end scene with elderly and his family i was a bit disappointed with what spielberg left or rather didnt leave up to us the audience to decide for ourselves the film is at times guilty of shoving attained beliefs down our throat but still has plenty of good heartfelt moments that interlude over the bad and for that it still works as a movie but certainly suffers from several near fatal flaws710,reality
a visceral and engaging film with powerful battle scenes that presents a factually and emotionallybiased view of the war its a polished endeavour worth watching but it loses marks because spielberg just has to patronise the audience by showing as an old man had he not done so i think that the movie would have been far more effective as both a creative endeavour and a moral messagethe film is clearly designed with the american public in mind  there are no british or other allied forces at all in the movie and the french civilians and german soldiers are essentially stereotypes the film itself is both wellscripted and cast but i cant help but feel that its protagonists are essentially precisely deployed charactertypes designed to elicit set emotional responses in the audience the lack of emotional ambivalence in its story and characters lends a sense of superficiality to the whole affair that makes the picture in my mind remarkably forgettablei would say that the movie is a fine example of hollywood product it has all the necessary elements of a classic film however scratch the glossy surface and i think one will find a disappointing lack of depth and a disappointingly familiar lack of respect on spielbergs part for the audiences ability to think for itself,reality
i have mixed feelings about this movie while it is clearly one of the better ww2movies to come out the last decades it must still be one of the most overrated films evera small group of soldiers set out to find a paratrooper private who has landed behind enemy lines in normandy the reason is thats brothers have all died in the war and now the army will try to bring home so that at least one son in the family can be brought home to his mother alivei said in the beginning of this review that this movie is overrated and i stand by that comment this movie has received a rating of over 8 here on imdb which i think is preposterous what this movie has that makes it very good although not great is the battle scenes they are simply the best i have ever seen the adrenaline rush the shaky closeups the gore seldom has the complete terror of battle been captured this well those scenes are worth a rating of 10 but the rest of the movie that is where the problems begin because the story is rather dull and unbelievable and the pace is at times very slow but more than anything the characters disturb me they act like idiots i dont know if the soldiers in world war 2 acted this stupid or if this is some strange addition by director steven spielbergmy point in the end is that this movie contain great elements but they alone do not make this a great movie when all is said and done i give this movie a rating of 6 that could have been 8 if the story had been stronger and the characters more believable,reality
this is of course a popular film i happen to own this dvd but at the same time there are only a few scenes that stick out as spectacular in the genre of war films the few well done battle scenes were the reason i bought this but some of the glaring faults are what would lead me to give this film a 7 out of 10 rather than 10 out of 10 as productions like black hawk down and even band of brothers deservefirst one of the most obvious problems with the film starts right in the opening scene we see all these dirty faced rugged looking men on their way into what is certainly the scariest moment of their lives then suddenly we see babyface tom hanks with his smooth skin clean shaven and groomed like the son of a politician it creates a contrast right there in the opening scene that is disruptive to the mood and becomes disruptive later on in the film as well dont get me wrong tom hanks is a great actor but he looked 100 times more rugged in castaway as he did in this filmsecondly was vin diesel ok so people like him dont get me wrong here either im not going to claim that he lacks intelligence outside of his films although i know he did drop out of college but thats not relevant however in his films it seems like he always plays characters who dont display an iq higher than 70 im not so sure this is how the characters were written as much as it is how he plays the roles his acting is unnatural stiff forced and lacks realism he just comes off idiotic in all of his movies he became known in the film world for a film he wrote and directed i believe maybe he should try his hand at that instead of trying to be the next arnold swartzenegger because hes not buff enough and hes too awkward as an actor to play that rolethird as i said before the film has some great battle scenes which is why i bought the dvd but we have these moments that would best be described as superficial moments in the film for example these moments that seem like they are in place only to demonstrate tom hanks witticism or moments that make the nazi soldiers like idiots those scenes seemed unrealistic and annoying contrast this with band of brothers and youll see what i mean its a serious film not a film that requires moments of dry humor spielberg dropped the ball on those aspects of the filmgood film but as a war film not nearly as good as band of brothers platoon or black hawk down,reality
im trying to respond to the germanforeign criticism some of which i share some of which i dontprior to world war 2 the american army was the 35th largest in the world  the same size as the portuguese army so the american soldiers were civilians in uniform a kind of partially trained militia american foreign policy was based on an improvised garbled theory of collective security with the british empire  and the soviets the german army was a professional force indoctrinated from a young age to become part of a military caste and to conform to a totalititarian ideology of revenge and conquestit is frankly easier to understand the psychological condition of the german soldier he had been thoroughly trained to obey i dont think that the american soldiers died for the sake of france i dont think that they died for sake of collective security or capitalism or keynesianism or the flag i think they died the same way a firefighter will die evacuating an occupied building no one has the right to attach an cockeyed ideological significance to that,reality
the film almost immediately finds our main character not privatebut captain john miller along with hundreds of soldiers storming omaha beach in france on june 6 1944 in the chaos of invading france captain miller tom hanks is assigned the task of locating paratrooper john francis matt daman to return him home we follow captain miller and his seven chosen comrades ben affleck and vin diesel among others through an impossible and sometimes deadly mission amidst constant battles as they ask themselves how many men should die to save one every soldier quickly learns when given an order it is not yours to ask why this film challenges that military decree from its early scenes of horrified boys facing the unknown in the storming of omaha beach to the late scenes of men facing death during this questionable mission the film serves as a jolt giving a visual to put with the loss of lives read about in history books also compares the loss of one mother to the sacrifice of eight othersoccasional slow and lengthy dialogue although used to introduce our characters personally is the only downfall of this film the effects in this movie are most notable we are participants in the battles as the camera jerks nervously and bullets scream by our ears just as powerful is the painful mute silence coupled with the slow motion as we witness particularly excruciating scenes as if we are falling unconscious the symbol of a trembling hand stilled only by death and the close up of a characters eyes as he ages or even changes into another character give personality to lives lost and lives saved the repeated use of the death letter we see removed from many dead soldiers breast pockets are accompanied by a stories of who are to receive the letters and their significance to the soldier all to remind us of the real casualties of war,reality
finally got round to watching in commemoration of the 60th anniversary of dday  its quite an impressive film sustaining a long running time with few weak moments and presenting an entirely new level of realism in the depiction of the battles  the violence is quite shocking and its not often you can say that given the exceptionally high level to which our depiction of and tolerance of violence has been pushed in recent yearsone thing that bothered me though was that the filmmakers appeared to be unaware that quite a few nonamericans were involved in the dday push too no disrespect to those brave americans that gave their lives but it would have been nice to have the film acknowledge the sacrifice of numerous other countries too,reality
this film is actually a simple tale told through the mind of the man who was savedprivate theres been very little attention focused on the opening and ending sequences where we see as an elder complete with his family minor spoilers we know from the opening that his coming back to normandy is incredibly significant its in his walk and in his eyes as he kneels down on the battlefield cemetery his mind is far far awayafter the tale is told the ending is as touching as anything ive ever seen in the movieswe get the feeling his journey here and in life is now complete hes paid homage to those who fought and died for him and for all of us  very simple  you can talk all you want about the historical specifics andor inaccuracies this film might or might not contain to me they are irrelevant  the bigger picture is not in dispute  wwii the war in europe the fight against hitler the allied invasion of france and dday were all defining moments of the 20th century that brought out the worst and best mankind has ever had to offer the main body of the film is incredible  difficult to watch and just as hard to look away from the opening and ending battlefield sequences set new standards for actioncinematography  to those who have criticized other portions of the film as boring or overthetop sentimentality i think spielbergs attempts to humanize his main characters are a great success unlike blackhawk down the story takes the time to let us get to know each soldier  i wanted to know who they were and as each spoiler begins to get picked off as the story evolves you feel yourself mourning the thousands of soldiers each represents  tom hanks is wonderful as the captain in charge of saving privatehis performance is understated to perfection  tom sizemore ed burns giovanni ribisi adam goldberg matt damon barry pepper and jeremy davies are all believable and finely cast in their respective rolesthis film takes the time to flush out its characters  in the end when all decide that is the right thing to do and  spoiler most end up paying with their lives i was struck with what a great sense of appreciation i felt for their accomplishment with what it meant for private and again what it meant for all of us  my father died in 1966 as a direct result of an injury he sustained in wwii b24 pilot who was shot down in 1943 over germany sustained severe head injury lost 10 of his crew was held as pow for almost a year before escaping silver star recipient died of brain hemorrhage 23 years later i know this film would have made him proud,reality
i have purchased this dvd a couple of years ago already the moment it got out in the netherlands we celebrate nationwide liberation day yearly for wo ii the day that i post my comment that was 5th of may therefor i thought this would be a great oppertunity to see the film againall the positive criticism posted below i can only agree upon a must see movie  really i intend to see it every year with liberation day i have two children and when they are old enough they too should see this movie with liberation day here and i hope they will not hate me for that,reality
this movie is the best movie ever made depicting the world war ii era it is the most realistic violent true to life depiction of what wwii was really about most of the previous movies romanticized the experience this movie gives you gritty no nonsense look at exactly what the troops faced from their food down to the vocabulary you come to understand why most veterans from this war never mentioned what they experienced its about as close as you can get to war without actually being in it this movie does for wwii what platoon did for vietnam i still cant see why this movie didnt get best picture over shakesphere in love spielberg did get best director but the movie should have won as well this is a must see movie,reality
the opening  closing scenes were for me the hardest to sit through as they both convey such a powerful message that really the film is somewhat of an anticlimax i had only stood overlooking omaha beach where the opening scene was shot about 9 months before they commenced filming when one looks over onto omaha beach itself today there is really nothing to indicate the bloodshed that is so graphically portrayed in the film it is the most peaceful  surreal place one can imagine  a fit resting place for the rows upon row of pure white headstones that adorn this immaculate cemetery there are several other cemeteries in the area but this one is something special  the opening scene of the movie captures the solemnity  majesty of this monument perfectly i just stood there among the graves in awe  admiration of the sacrifice made by these young soldiers who died in a foreign country among the depravity of war to ensure that we could live in relative peace i can understand why so many veterans could not sit through the opening scene  never saw the movie so overcome were they they would have had just as hard a job with the final scene had they stayedi feel the film itself will stand as something of a monument to those who fought against the forces of evil  were prepared to die in the processthe sheer scale  logistics of the movie are mindboggling to say the least hanks was his brilliant self although i consider sizemore nearly stole the show with a supporting performance par excellence not exactly spielbergs masterpiece as i believe we will see more of this type of film from him but it will do for the moment thank you,reality
possible spoilers      is a good war movie only to watch its battle scenes the story itself is rather dull the cast was great but one character wasnt to my liking i didnt like the man that was carrying the ammo for the battle in the german town he sat around crying and scared which is understandable for awar because there are no men who will just stand up and shoot a bunch of guys and not be afraid of everything i know in a war youre scared all the time or most of the time but this character just didnt seem to fit his comerades were being slaughtered around him and he didnt do anything and that made me hate him if you want a good story for dday settle for 1962s the longest day,reality
ive seen many war movies after that of it has been 6 years since the movie has been released and i still have not found a movie that meets its caliberthe movie has a combination of good story and a exceptional fighting scenes although some errors according to wwii might have been made it is still far more accurate than any halfass movies weve seen after it ie windtalkersbasically an amazing war movie which should be on everyones top 10 war movies list im not exactly spielbergs greatest fan but after seeing this movie my respect for him has been increased greatly,reality
possible spoilers aheadis a movie about world war ii  in this it is not original  hundreds or perhaps thousands of films have been made about this subject  what makes this film stand out besides the magnificent acting of tom hanks possibly his best role and thats saying a lot is the films plot  a dozen men risk their life and put service to their country on hold in order to retreive a single officer  not one that is crucial to the war effort indeed not one that is even in enemy hands  just one that is the last surviving son of a mother that has lost all her children in the war the irony and contradictions of a dozen men risking their lives to locate and retreive a single officer is almost paralyzing and surely secures speilbergs masterpiece a place in my opinion among the finest movies ever made  everything about this movie is spectacular from the acting to the effects to the dramatic qualities  possibly the finest of all the world war ii films ever made,reality
is one of those films that keeps you speechless throughout the whole thing by far one of steven spieldbergs best films he has ever made the realism of this film was superb and had exceptional acting tom hanks gives yet again an exceptional performance his nomination for best actor showed how good an actor he really is the plot of the movie is perfect the mission is to save a man you are able to do so much with this kind of plot the relationships between the soldiers becomes a key factor in this film the triumph the heartbreak the relationships and the heroism is the glue that keeps the film interesting and moving this is one of my favorite films of all time,reality
tom hanks tom sizemore matt damon edward burns barry pepper adam goldberg vin diesel giovanni ribisi and jeremy davies star in one of the best war films ever made hanks stars as capt john miller leader of a public relations mission to bring home the last of four brothers sean peter daniel and james who fought in the war what makes this so hard is that three brothers sean peter and daniel are casualties of war and the mother was to receive all three letters at oncethe opening sequence contains one of the most emotional scenes in the entire film only people who have seen the film before will understand the significance and its effect on the rest of the film as well as the viewing audience i have seen many times and i always go back to the opening scene when others ask what scene had the biggest impact on me it was one of those scenes that you must watch more than once to fully understand it as i didsaving private james turns out to become something more than what capt miller had bargained for tom sizemore is millers loyal right hand man sgt horwath sgt horwaths loyalty toward his boss makes me smile and the way sizemore portrays sgt horwath ranks right up with the best actors in the same situation wars are one of the worst tragedies of america and to bring it to life with such a realistic view really shocked methe way steven spielberg brought to life the 20 minute battle sequence at the beginning was an eyeopening view into the real thing at first i hated this part since it was long and drawn out but when i saw it the second time i understood why it was done spielberg wanted brought out emotions and made a statement to the audience that war is devastating and something that should never happen matt damon was superb as pvt james he continues to produce box office hits along with tom hanks and the legendary director steven spielberg is one film to watch over and over,reality
this movie has a truly amazing opening 30 minutes we follow captain john miller hanks and his men during the dday landing a lot of the techniques used during this opening sequence have inspired many other directors sincethe only trouble is the movie has a lot to live upto after the opening sequence we get down to the main story which is millers orders to find private and return him home to his mother who has lost all his brothers in the war whilst the remainder of the movie is ok and spielberg shows us why he is a great director the rest of the movie never quite lives up to the opening 810 1010 for first 30 minutes then 710 for the remainder,reality
i can not understand those who view it as an america win the war movie that is not the point of most of the war movies out there  yes they may use american actors and show american fighting but look past that and see the terrifying experiences of war and the fear of the people back home who suffer the emotional trauma  i felt gave a visual look at war it  gave the best feeling of what war would be like that any movies have given but i dont think that any movie ever will be able to to give the exact fear that is within the people when they are in the middle of a battlefieldan excellent movie dignified moving and intelligent not a word used with many hollywood movies acting with a director that has shown everyone how it should be done,reality
quick and to the pointgreat characters wonderful story gripping entertaining  ive never really been as touched by a movie as with this one  the human sacrifice is overwhelming yet nongratuitous definitely in my top 10 all time,reality
can someone please explain to me how one of the greatest war movies ever made lost the best picture to a painfully boring and immensely inferior movie like shakespeare in love s war scenes were some of the best ever filmed and love was just uninteresting and hard to follow,reality
the film is an in depth film of the world war twos dday which took place on june 6th 1944 thousands of men came in to defeat the germans not many came out this is shown with great detail this film is very gory at the begining of the movie in the dday landings when men are blown apart like it really was in the war the story is also very true and enjoying to watch this film does have a few famous faces such as tom hanks matt damon vin diesel tom sizemore which all act very well in this intense movie in my opinion this is the greatest war movie ever made 910,reality
i am not really sure why i feel compelled to post my experience when watching this movie but after reading many of the previous comments it is apparent that the impact for me is quite different than most other peoplei went to our local theater to see with my teenage son and one of his friends  i was fully prepared for the realistic beach landing sequence that had already gained so much attention prior to the films release so what happened next is a personal experience i will never forget the actual opening scene is not the battle sequence but the images of the elderly and his family visiting the american cemetery at normandy france  in the span of a few seconds  i was transported back in time and place to a raw spring day in 1982 at the beaches of normandy france it was there with my late father and mother that we walked the same path along the cliffs as shown in the film my wife and children were with me as in the film when my dad turned and walked out among the sea of crosses and was overcome with emotion as in the film the horrors of war were never more apparent to me in a personal way than at that momentit was as if spielberg had been there 30 years ago and somehow filmed our family and then edited it onto the beginning of this movie  i was so shaken that i barely remembered the rest of the movie and it was quite a while before i could get up and leave the theater i am normally not prone to emotional outbursts and was embarrassed that i could not stop crying even as we left the lobby  my reaction scared my son half out of his wits since he had no idea what had hit me so hard he was only 2 years old in 1982i have only watch the film once since then and the impact was just as powerful i have often wondered if anyone else relates to this scene as i do since every other reference to the opening scene is actually the beach landingfor me the cinematic faults or virtues of this movie are irrelevant in relation to the pain and sacrifice that this war inflicted on the world and i believe there is value in the way this film helps to assure that the pain will never be forgotten,reality
is a graphic and intense war movie that portrays some of the realities of war im no ww2 veteran but i do know that this film is probably as close to war as we can really get without actually being there the movie is very well done and in my opinion should have won best picture in 1998 i know that some of you may not agree with me on this but for those who are on my side about this all know that this movie should be remembered by everyone that watches it i highly suggest this movie to everyone who wants to know what it was really like for those men in ww2 in fact i think that everybody should watch it whether they want to or not it should be mandatory for people to watch this movie at least once in their lives just to remind them that freedom is not for free i still stick with my opinion on saying that it is one of the greatest movies ever made actually you know what it probably is the greatest movie ever made no doubt about it 1010,reality
this is one of the only war films ever that shows you the real brutality of war not only that but this movie really defines it i know other movies include that but this one does it the best you see war movies do not get better than this one it grips you so tight that you can almost feel the terror that they would feel my point is this is speilberg at his besteven though it does not feel like one of his amazing moviesif you are a  fanbut have not seen thisgo and watch it it is a lot the same but is better my score is 1010,reality
i saw this movie is included in the top 250 and to be quite honest i just dont understand why the most realistic warmovie ever made perhaps because of the special effects those first 20 minutes are indeed horryfying but the sole reason why that is like that is just because is the kind of warmovie they dont make any longer but believe me if the longest day or any other warepic would have been made these days it would have been exactly the same as this spielbergmovie surely not a bad movie at all even worth your time and even more than that but spielberg tries a bit too hard to make it an anthem to those who lost their live in one of the biggest tragedies the world has known but then again every war is a tragedy i see no difference in a soldier dying in france or somewhere in palestina spielberg is not afraid to show the cruelity of war and if you are softhearted you will close your eyes more than once good movie even a bit more than that but just dont overrate it as well,reality
firstly this film is not entertaining in the way war films like pearl harbour tried to be this film attempts to recreate war as realistically as possible and although ive never been in one myself from what i hear it is the best representation yet by definition this means you cannot enjoy it like you would most films the opening scene at the beach during dday was harrowing rather than enjoyable to watch you dont find yourself on the edge of your seat as bullets fly you find yourself cringing and wondering why on earth people get driven to this after this scene the film becomes less miserable and slightly more watchable as an entertainment mechanism but it never loses its realistic touch hanks delivers a memorable if not slightly flawed performance whilst the script is interesting to listen to in general this is the first film i have come across that truly played on my emotions and affected me which is what its meant to do it is a fantastic achievement in the sense that it finally begins to show people just how real the horrors of war are if youre looking for a nice night in with an action film dont watch this if you want to see closer to the truth and appreciate truly great filmwork watch it,reality
its hard to understand how any person could have survived battles so superbly shown hereand this is the ultimate reality film on war horror and courage ever made its message is so powerful all young folk should see it to understand how lucky we the allies were to finally beat the germans  we the citizen soldiers so well shown up against the terrifying enemy who literally fought to the bitter end the cost is seen in the cemeteries in europe  asia for me the us 8th af near cambridge england normandy france and rangoon burma are like this film important and necessary reminders of how much i owe to so many to enjoy life here in the united states,reality
after seeing i was changed forever  as a person twice removed from the war generation 18 years of age my only experience from the great world war ii were from films such as the longest day and patton all seemed to make me want to make a contribution equivalent as far as fighting for my country but after seeing i wish to make a contribution as equal to those who fought and died but i no longer wish to endure that hardship and that is a luxury we as a generation can enjoy,reality
first of all the framing device for the movie is not just sappy but downright manipulative and quite frankly impossible  anytime you frame a flashback like that you have to stay mostly within that characters frame of reference i cant think of a single example that stays 100 in first personits just not possible or practical  how can look back in time on someone elses life while hes somewhere else  i certainly doubt that hanks could have told him his life story so quickly  spielbergs no idiot so he knows that this isnt possible which brings us back to the manipulation factor and the chance to have a surprise ending in the worst possible sense  id like to think spielberg was trying to emulate the experience of war and not knowing whos going to live or whos going to die by making the old cliches of war movies that the hero will live work for him  because spielberg makes us believe that hanks character isnt going to die we think hes the old man then supposedly well be more shocked and have more emotions when he is killed as if we were experiencing war in realtime for me this didnt work because by bulls alarm started blaring  it has a high intolerance for lies and that is pretty much what the framing device does  it promises one thing but gives just the oppositeif spielberg had not included the framing device i would have given the movie a 910 instead of 710  why he felt he needed one i dont know since even beyond my other complaints the framing device doesnt add anything to the movie that couldnt have been done and better while we were still in 1945by the way did they bury all of our dead in france in that graveyard  i thought that one was for those who died on the beach that first day but im not sure  hanks was pretty far in by the time he diedone final point the evil backstabbing german captive thing worked all right as propaganda and even better as a lesson in mob violence back when hitchcock directed his extraordinary lifeboat in 1944 but when stolen and put in private it just seemed like a plot devicehe would just as likely have been grateful for being spared  or as a hypothetical situation in which germany invaded america it is just as likely that an american would do exactly the same thing as the german  at least in lifeboat the issue is thoroughly explored while private uses it merely to show how the weakwilled peaceloving prototypehippie linguist learns that killing people in war is necessary  whatever happened to the less proactive attitude from catch22,reality
this is one of those movies that after watch you cant even believe its so good not a single aspect of film making is flawed in this film from its sound design cinematography productionset design to acting and writing it is all perfect one of rhe greatest movies ever made and easily the greatest war movie of all time,reality
taking off the rose colored glassesextremely hard to find fault here everyone involved is simply at the top of their game its flawless the long run time even works as the film moves at a brisk pace tensions continually rise and the large ensemble cast keeps surprising it hits all the notes as a an action war film historical drama and emotional human story a cinematic milestone,reality
this to me was and is the best ww2 film i have seen i will never get tired of watching this moviealthough there maybe a few exaggerations in the story the realisation of how frightening and evil hitlers thinking and how the german troops were motivated to carry out his instructions to destroy anyone or country to get in the way the movie portrayed the horror of war we must strive to make sure peace remains,reality
this was a brilliantly thoughtout movie and is as heartfelt as it is actionpacked,reality
stands as one of the greatest war films of all time striking a near perfect balance of the brutality of war camaraderie of brothers and the sacrifice the brave soldiers of wwii gave as well as their families supplied with a cast full of breathtaking performances spectacular scenes of intense warfare and an emotionally rousing script not to mention incredible direction from spielberg making this war film a landmark in cinema and among spielbergs finest works,reality
ill keep it short and sweetim not the biggest fan of films about the second world war but this is fantasticits got moments of heart humour and tells a more intimate story while not ignoring the scale of the warit doesnt shy away from the brutality of the battles and makes the message that war is hell feel freshsuperbly acted and directed highly recommended,reality

war is nothing of glory prominence or resolve war is that of complete bloodshed and a reason that drives the motive to kill fellow man war does not tell lies nor do the bodies wounds and scars of the living and dead in a conflict between nations can hide from the truth these same truths are what lead me to watch and how incredibly accurate the film depicts the monstrous and horrific nature of warfare in the film i will be examining how this true war story captures the true atmosphere of war and the many scenes that built up a characters development during this conflict in this amazingly heroic actionpacked heartbreaking masterpiece of a filmwar is mans worst nightmare bringing horrible and disastrous acts of violence and mishap however one man steven spielberg delivers us one of the most convincing and realistic depictions ever in this insanely powerful and depressing film saving privatethis courageous world war ii film dives down deep and explores the struggle to keep the common soldiers sanity and humanity in the dead center of utmost hell showing the audience that spielberg was very much on top of his game as it truly conveys the sickening and heartdestroying emotions and feelings towards the audience leaving them crying shaking in their seats or in an upward fetal position and if this doesnt make you want to watch this film i dont know what will sure you might say but weve got really good films like black hawk down and american sniper but let me ask you this did any of those movies cover the small details did they use specific scenes to visualize a characters development and emotions and did they actually show gore and the true brutality that occurs in an actual war in the film to me most other films seem to try to glorify and sugar coat over the truth which is why i consider steven spielbergs work of art to be advanced for its time a true war story never lies and it never should which is why i recommend this film to you even if its genre isnt up your alley you will find this movie to be absolutely groundbreaking and extraordinary that i promiseshortly after a brief scene with an elderly man at a wwii memorial site we fade out into the perspective of tom hanks cpt miller as it throws the audience right in the midst of the dday landings at omaha beach joining miller on this slaughterhouse of a mission is a squad of loyal but mixed characters theres millers shadow sgt horvath tom sizemore the cocky but confidential commoner from brooklyn new york pvt reiben edward burns the upstanding italian pvt caparzo vin diesel the tough role model jewish kid pvt mellish adam goldberg the worrisome and sympathetic medic t4 medic wade giovanni ribisi the biblequoting marksman pvt jackson barry pepper and the scaredashell interpreter cpl upham jeremy davis as the ramp goes down the crew is met with a hellstorm of gunfire different angle and panning shots shows us soldiers getting cut down as bullets rip and tear through flesh and uniform not even those who jumped over the side were safe as it seen showing people drowning from the overhaul of gear that they were carrying even as the cast makes it to the coast the camera continues to focus on the surroundings and the other grunts screaming guts blown off arms and legs and even a cavedin face even though it takes up a good portion of the film the scene does a phenomenal job at grasping the situation through hanks perspective as it doesnt try to hide anything from what the landings at omaha were actually like presenting us with realism like no otheron top of that steven spielberg did an amazing job driving deep into character development as i found that the most interesting parts of how the film and cast were presented and orchestrated was the surreal fear and sadness that main cast acted out including cpt miller with his shaking hand indicating towards the audience that he was just as human as the rest of his squad lighting also had a impact with depicting the characters fears as one shot only shows tom hanks face as the rest of his head and body is consumed by darkness possibly to convey the theme of loss as seen all throughout the rest of the movie other scenes include breaking down from the loss of characters and the more human scenes and interactions of characters during the film makes it very irresistible to not want to smileoverall i enjoyed the film very much considering that i had never really seen such a vast difference in how war stories are told or how they play out much like from video games and books in my mind i believe that this film takes the cake for its realism and atmosphere amassing the audience towards a traumatizing but fateful story of heroes not only laying down their lives for the sake of their country and its people but revealing and teaching a lesson in it as well that war does not lie not until we as people find common ground will the scars and wounds ever heal from our actions in the film by steven spielberg i will be examining how this true war story captures the true atmosphere of war and the many scenes that relayed a characters development and emotions during this haunting conflict in this amazingly heroic actionpacked heartbreaking masterpiece of a film,reality
some of the best war scenes ever filmed it gets overly sentimental at the end which keeps it from being a 1010,reality
most world war ii movies fall into one of two categories heroic tales of glory and valor or biopics but is neither instead its a condemnation of war wrapped in a tale of human courage and sacrifice theres nothing especially complex about the structure of the film which runs nearly three hours is bookended by two major battle scenes in between smaller fights alternate with quiet characterbuilding moments that flesh out the soldiers allowing them to escape the threat of stereotyping spielberg along with writer robert rodat and the actors ensures that everyone in the movie is developed into a multidimensional individual for whom we can grieve if and when they die the action sequences are some of the best ever captured in any genre and the opening omaha landing sequence which runs almost half an hour is a tour de force of filmmaking this film is simply unmissable,reality
this is a tour de force feature film which netted spielberg his 2nd best director award it is thoroughly deserved the opening battle sequence alone is worth the price of the ticket and the entire film only compliments it this is a juxtaposition of emotions and prowess unlike very few films youd have seen all the actors are amazing but the direction and cinematography take the cake is a film that will be remembered for ages to come and if you havent then please see it at any given opportunity,reality
a very touching war movie that for once depicts war as it truly is a great drama as well as a war epic one of the best movies of all time another spielberg masterpiece,reality
my grandfather fought in ww2 somehow surviving dday he was apart of operation neptune and stormed the beaches of normandy he told us a lot of war stories but rarely ever spoke about that day before he passed away he did an interview with a local newspaper and detailed what he saw despite it being very difficult for him to speak about he loved watching war movies not sure exactly why some about that soldier life never really leaves them i guess he absolutely hated pearl harbor cause of the horrible way they portray the military to be a bunch of toothbrush wielding babies who dont know what to do in the event of being attacked he had a friend stationed there who lost his life and thinks that movie is a disgusting display of ignorance soldiers dont take girlfriends on private plane rides and they most definitely know how to swim maybe ill give that movie a good ripping one daybut was a respectable i cant watch this reaction he said no movie has come that close to capturing what that day was like he said it was too realistic whether or not the story is based on real or fiction that intro was 100 realistic im not sure if he ever did finish watching it but he appreciated it for capturing that chaos like no other movie has before i watched the movie a dozen times now and keep it in my collection as a reminder of my grandfather a scene he was technically in which makes me appreciate how strong of a person he really iswar is hell and this movie not only shows that while being an entertaining experience but also captured what soldiers are left behind with my grandfather was not afraid of anything ive seen this man walk into a cellar full of black widows to get firewood and not even shake them off the only time he ever experienced fear was when he went to bed his nightmares of his time during the war would haunt him in his sleep this movie helped me understand why,reality
this film is shocking and definitely paved the way for more ww2 films like this i would say its a very difficult watch esp the beach landing not for the faint hearted and it could trigger some the direction and production values for its time were flawless,reality
almost 30 rounds have seen this never been bored and tom hanks very well,reality
this film pioneered war films and films dealing with big war battles definitely need to see it if you havent already hard to believe we are 20 years on from this brilliant film being made,reality
he had to win an oscar statue for this one is a tour de force starring a good mix of new and the seasoned and some awe inspiring visuals seriously the opening beach attack literally transports you to the war such is its magnitude this is a film that should be watched in history schools film schools and humanity schools when spielberg finally hangs his boots will be recalled as one of the finest gems in a great career,reality
one of the hardest tasks in life is dealing with the death of someone close for some even losing just one loved one could be impossible to handle unfortunately wwii propelled very young men directly into the heart of stressful and gruesome violence defining the survivors as some of the most emotionally hardened people to walk this earth delves directly into the story of a young man private who because of the rules regarding death of family members in war needs to be found and taken out of combat opening with an older as he grieves the loss of a fellow soldier instantly defining strong emotion and foreshadowing the tone of the movie the scene quickly changes however throwing the viewer directly into heartpounding action as an extremely historic and defining battle takes place dday stress anxiety and extreme suspense come over the viewer as bullets explosions and lifethreatening events overcome the movie is no stranger to strong emotion as it quickly shows death destruction and gripping violence that is familiar with the soldiers on the field the main character is not portrayed to be some valiant war hero either but rather more vulnerable and lifelike is a character people can relate to feel for and become much more connected to making it much easier for the emotions to be shared between him and the viewerthroughout an overall sense of urgency and looming danger is felt whether it be directly in the middle of heartpounding action and excitement defined by loud explosions bloodcurdling screams and sounds of bullets whizzing by or where suspense is heavy in the most quiet of times where silence seems all too bliss visual demonstrations of intense action and perfect recreations of lifelike scenes help the viewer become immersed in what is happening almost smelling the fires burning and the gasoline filling the air the movie does an excellent job at creating realistic and accurate scenes since the movie is based on a historic event its crucial that everything that happens needs to replicate the time that it was set in perfectly or massive reductions in the immersive nature of the movie would be felt and many parts would feel dull and unrealistic however the attention to detail is shown as everything from the vehicles to the technology even down to the way people talk using slang terms and real conversations that people in the 1940s might have is spot on is an amazing immersive and jawdropping movie that easily has the potential to be regarded as one of the greats for years to come,reality
to think that this movie did not win best picture is a crime director steven spielberg uses all of his talent and resources to give to the world the greatest war film ever made,reality
is a spectacular and realistic looking war film showcasing the amazing acting talents of tom hanks there is a surplus of great cinematography as well as insightful direction in this world war period stage by steven spielberg this film is scary at times with a deep and heart wrenching theme the special effects mimicking the devastation and loss that battle with the enemy unfortunately often delivers are very accurate looking compared to historical war films superior acting all around i rate this film 9 stars,reality

i have always thought this is one of the most amazing war films going even if i had to study it in school but it was something that i enjoyed watching it and enjoyed studying it as well amazing adaptation of the book as well in my opinion its on of the best,reality
i watched this movie a couple times since it came out and it still hits me every time i watch it people who say this movie suck crazy its definatly the best ww2 movie ever made,reality
arguably the best war movie ever made more than anything else is a must watch for its technical aspects and masterful direction by none other than steven spielberg the oscar jury got it absolutely spot on when they gave the oscar nod to him and also the cinematography by kaminski was honoured the great thing about this movie is the fact the camera hovers around in such a manner it places you right amidst the action this is war as it happened bloody brutal and relentless the 27 min long famous opening sequence alone makes this a must watch its technique was revolutionary when it released and has been replicated many a times but none so better than the original not without flaws though long and sometimes the dull characters can put you off but still a must watch,reality
the opening scene is thrilling this is easily oltommys best film since the original toy story film he shows some raw emotion that makes you feel like you are in france with him this film will forever go down as the pinnacle of war films,reality

could not stop watching captivating and enticing,reality
throughout the film we can see the talent of the actors and director we can see how cruel war is and dedication of soldiers to war,reality
just reading the public comments on on this sight made tears come to my eyes this movie captured my respect as a history lover in that it gave you just what is to be expected during an amphibious landing in wwii held no punches on war being ugly sicking and horrific the only thing that was missing was the smell of battle the audio visual aspect was it seems to me beyond perfect that i was really there on dday extremely scared while trying to get off the beach i recommend this movie to be seen by every us president senator representative before taking office i was told that this war epic was so influential it made potential cadets who viewed it turn down their west point appointments even thinking about this production will cause emotions to get the best of me,reality
it really does not matter what one thinks of this film as long as they catch the underlying message anyone who has been involved in combat or survived a catastrophe can relate to it having no psychological training i refer to it as the why me syndrome the first and last 5 minutes along with one line towards the end of the movie depict the messages fullest impact on a person relate to it having been in nyc when the world trade center was hit i do not doubt many who survived that catastrophe have similar feelings what is it it is the guilt the sense of embarrassment the confusion the internal turmoil and the many unanswered questions associated with surviving such an event when so many you consider better or more deserving than you did not private in his later years experiences this in its fullest during the first and last five minutes of the movie tom hanks dying words earn this were said for those who never experienced such events those who have do not have to be reminded there are a great many other messages that the uninitiated could pick upif you ever wondered why your father grandfather husband or more recently wife are the way they are or changed after such an experience this is most likely why when the world war ii vets came home they were heroes when the korean war vets came home they came home when the vietnam vets came home however although how they were treated after they came home had an impact on their psyche what they experienced while they were there left an indelible mark they will never be able to erase these experiences come to mind while daydreaming they hit you like a punch when they pop into your mind when concentrating on something totally unrelated and regardless of how long ago it happened one can not control their dreams all i ask is that regardless of what you think of our involvement in iraq those who were there did not make our foreign policy believe me if they had their choice virtually all of them would have rather been somewhere else just try to remember what they have been through and that they will relive those experiences for the rest of their lives,reality
is a war classic with the likes of platoon apocalypse now black hawk down hamburger hill etc i really liked how as soon as the movie starts it jumps right into the action  this one was very graphic and intense the acting was superb i personally got a real kick out of barry pepper as the sniper with a clear consicence  i loved it also edward burns is in this w giovanni ribisi vin diesel matt damon tom sizemore and of course the leader of the group tom hanks,reality
take a blockbuster and quality movies director such as steven spielberg a good leading actor like tom hanks and a decent cast tom sizemore and edward burns are my choices and youll get the best movie ever or you should at least steve got this one wrong in my opinion starting and ending the movie with a us flag isnt the way of making a movie hat will be shown throughout the world the allied assault on normandy was amazing and close to reality i believe making it the most remembered scene in the movie and bestbut then the plot sinks in the middle of the atlantic ocean yes sending 8 soldiers to rescue 1 just because his brothers are dead does seem unlikely and i wouldnt risk the lives of a capable platoon for only one souland making that chickenheart corporal uphams mind change fast enough to make him shoot an unarmed man at point blank does nothing good to this movieoverrated the thin red line and black hawk down are much better its not bad really but i just cant figure out what the hell is so goo about it,reality
this is one of the best movies ive seen in my whole life tom hanks is brilliant janusz kaminskis cinematography is absolutley great john williams music is as usual very very good and spielbergs directing is totally brilliant the movie is very realistic and shaking but i think that those who hasnt seen this masterpiece should do it even if they cant stand bloody scenes i strongly recommend saving private,reality
it seems that those that are critical of spr they are all hypercritical for their own personal reasons  lets back up and look at this movie as a film because thats all that it is a film  for those of you that see a representation of the americans as the good ol boys and the germans as the bad guys lets remember the scenes where the germans were brutally shot at point blank range with their hands in the air to surrender  anyone who misses the point that the germans were just as human as the americans were misses the point all together as i see iti dont see where spielberg makes them look any better or worse than we or any other soldier was in the waras far as steering from the truth anyone that has followed any historical movie knows that there are certain artistic licenses taken to embellish the depiction  if historic films were depicted one hundred percent as they actually happened they would all fall under the documentary category  this is not a documentary and shouldnt be judged as suchi purposely donthavent watched war films because i abhor violence and the use of violence as an ends to any means  however i saw this film because i had heard that it is one of the best representations of what happened on omaha beach and the tragedies of war  never had i been so moved and truly felt how horrible it must have been to be there  or in any warit is a film and just that a film  an interpretation by spielberg of what happened  be critical of what the film meant to you and how you feel not of what was in the film,reality
the opening 20 minutes of are some of the most brutal images put on screen i dont care what youve seen before this is absolutely shocking there were times when it was difficult to watch these events flash in front of my eyes war is not pretty and speilberg shows you this in a way that will grab you a man holding his intestines is crying for his mother another man who loses an arm confusingly tries to pick it up with his other hand you know that this is not gonna be a pretty rideis speilbergs follow up to last years highly underrated film amistad tom hanks is captain miller who gets word of private matt damon who lost all of his brothers in the war he still doesnt know it yet private is therefore granted a safe trip back home and its up to captain miller and seven others to make sure that he makes his return home as soon as possible the only problem is that they dont know exactly where he is just somewhere behind enemy lines the eight begin their journey and on their way each of their characters are revealed we find out that captain miller as tough as he is wants nothing more than to get out of the violence and tragedy that he has to deal with everyday he just wants to return home as does almost everybody elsespeilberg is in top form again and although its not as perfect as his masterpiece schindlers list it does rank as the best film of 1998 so far the performances are topnotch and incredibly real especially tom hanks characterso what can you say speilberg has done it again never before has war been shown so realistically before if there is one film that can show the atrocities that soldiers had to go through every day spr is the one is it the best war film ever made i dont think so but is it a damn good one definitely,reality
i went into with high hopes  as someone who has followed spielbergs career since jaws i knew i would be put through the gamut of emotional responses during the moviewhat i wasnt prepared for was the second scene  i sat quietly through the recreation of the landing at normandy through the endless body parts being pitched into the air  i was horrified at the sight of the armless soldier searching for his severed limb the men trying to get out of the water before they drowned only to be cut down by bullets before they could  i felt the tears well up in my eyes at the sights of these brave men some of whom could have been my older uncles my family fought there giving their lives so that all of us could be freewatching the screen fade from the shot of the dead soldier sorrounded by dead fish in a redhued sea change to the office of the war department  dozens of women typing letters to the families of those lost on the battlefield  the tears didnt stop they came on full force  luckily my family was spared the horror of one of those letters the visits by high ranking men in uniforms coming to tell mothers and wives that their men wouldnt be coming back  but i felt for them  all the battles all the training all the pride of having a family member fighting to keep the world free of evil meant nothing more than a letter home typed by a faceless secretary and passed along for signing  not that im putting down what these women did for the war effort  they had their jobs to do as well  it just touched me to no end to see this  one minute a soldier is a brave man fighting for his country and freedom the next he is nothing more than a letter and a folded flagi hope everybody who sees this film doubles their efforts in  making sure we as a species never have to do that again  show this to future generations along with schindlers list make them aware that the war did happen that this kind of evil is possible  we have had too many rambos  its time we looked at the war the way it was brutal cruel and took the lives of too many men before they had the chance to live their livesmy hat is off to mr spielberg once again  dont let us forget,reality
this was a decent movie but still was highly overrated by everybody the plot was some what weak and although i like tom hanks i believe he is overrated in hollywoods eyes and thought that all of his movies get over hyped i think the same thing with green mile which was a decent movie but still overrated and forrest gump i personally thought billy bob thorton made a better movie in sling blade however hanks did make good scores in big and apollo 13 i also think spielberg is overrated how can people say that this is better than apocalpsye now and platoon the 2 greatest war movies of all time the thin red line was better than by a hair they were both overrated platoon is the best war movie ever,reality
i dont like war films definitely but i definitely think cannot be considered only like a war movie i mean films like rambo commando and that kind of productions have one point in common the main character is a hero the strongest man on earth the renegade whos escaped from the bad fellas and the only one who can achieve this missionin the war vision goes one step not one a bunch of steps far from the typical war film its not about the typical story of a howstrongandbraveiam mercenary the plot introduces us in the feelings the experiences that a soldier has in a battle field fear agony  pain and this message reached deeply in the audience because you feel somehow uncomfortable when watching the film and theres the power of the film the way with which focuses the sensations and fearings of the character is overwhelmingsteven spielberg has done a masterpiece demonstrating that he can do any kind of genre in the film industry its a must see 1010,reality
i could go on and on and on forever about what a pss poor excuse this is for a historically accurate war film gimme a break the first 10 minutes is the only bit of this movie worth seeing things that come to mind initially  theres not one soldier in the squad who is not a blatantly obvious stereotype the jewishamerican gi crying when he finds the hitler youth dagger is a pathetic attempt to jerk a tear out of the audience and that guy cant remember his name is an atrocious actor i actually cheered when he got stabbed later in the film tom sizemores character collecting dirt so we can see what tough guy he is coz hes fought in italy and france etclame the young private coming of age by learning how to gun down unarmed german soldiersuh huh the p51 mustang an aircraft that was incidentally never used as a groundattack aircraft saving the day at the end come oooooooon people ever seen rio bravo and not to mention the ridiculous story which i dont care what it was based on  is fictional about sending 8 men to save 1if that had really happened those 8 men would have ended up dead real quickand you people those who have never seen a war besides the lies your government feeds you every night on tv say this is the most realistic war movie ever made how dare you comment on something you know nothing aboutif you want a good war movie rent platoon hamburger hill or the thin red line leave this one on the shelf,reality
never in my life have i been forced to watch such crap the one good point of this film is the beach scene apart from that its two and a half hours of the most unbelievable story line and poor acting ability that i have ever had the misfortune to watch tom hanks portrayal of captain miller was shockingly bad he failed to get to grip with the part and his acting got worse from scene to scene my advice to anyone that wants to watch a truly good war film is go and rent apocalypse now and save your self the misery of this rubbishthis is a film for people who like special effects and nothing else dont waste your time,reality
a bloody opening on dday with the twitchy camera to make it look realfollowed by a colorized bloodized version of combathe can pull your strings but it was a poor flick,reality
is a true horror movie  i watched it because i wanted to see a good action movie but the opening sequence really scared the hell out of me and the movie left me pondering over it for hours afterwordsits great that there is a movie that shows wars effects on the human body and mind rather than a toned down political chess game  this movie has some amazing cinematography with lots of gray colors to add to the gloomspielburg always manages to create movies that stir up emotions like no other director can  spielburg and george lucas are the dynamic duo of cinema,reality
the opening scene promises much and its great and dramatic but far from realistic it cant be possible to shoot the germans using a mirror i cant help but wonder where are the british in this film americans didnt won the war all by themselvesthe way germans are portrayed is stupid to one dead american there are 5 dead germans how could the germans invade almost half of europe if they are so lousy fighters visually the movie is great but the story is unbelievable and the whole movie is way too patriotic why would anyone send many men to save one guy it would have been much easier to contact privates superiors and send the guy back home and the scene where captain miller dies is just a big clich,reality
this movie does for battle scenes what raiders did for action movies but between the battles its the same old sickly sentimentality and kitsch speilbergisms we are accustomed to  the speilberg suspensearc is easily recognized giving spr the feel of poltergeist with germans rather than ghosts and et with a kid from iowa rather than a kids toy  positively tiresomethe interminable length results in a whole lot of a bad thing,reality
although unintentionally this movie is creating a new envelope for violent movies to push  the next movie that is made along the lines of starship troopers which was only a notch behind in my view will certainly rival in fact i didnt find much difference between the two movies save for how utterly pretentious was  an all star cast that went completely unused throughout the entire movie people often say that this is a movie with a message a message of the utter horror of war  however i personally prefer the delivery in such movies as alls quiet on the western front which relies on acting rather than a multi million dollar budget was it that low used to create a gore fest frankly i believe that most people wont get the message and a lot of people will treat it as an action movie say hey cool that guys got no arm instead of being sick to their stomach like they should be i faced the same thing with starship troopers the violence in the movie made me sick but for most people it was a joyride well yall had better get used to it because thanks to this movie there will be plenty more along those lines,reality
spielberg has claimed in interviews that one of his purposes in making was to specifically honor the soldiers who fought that war a noble sentiment but being a film buff youd think spielberg would be familiar with the constant stream of films from the 40s through the 50s into the 60s and beyond including tv shows that did just that it makes me wonder if he had another purpose in making saving privatehe does in the excellent series of interview dvds put out by the american film institute titled the directors in the episode devoted to spielberg he claims that he wanted to make with a documentary style eschewing the chapman cranes and steadicam approach to big budget filmmaking he wanted the film to look exactly like a war photographer would have shot it had he been at omaha beachclearly one look at the opening beach sequence shows he succeeded in that desire but if chapman cranes and steadicams are not realistic is artificially slowing down the film ok how about desaturating the color out of the film to make it almost seem black and white what about heavily manipulating the soundtrack does war really exist in dolby 51 sound i mean what are we really watching here what has spielberg done with other than simply add an element of chainsaw massacre movie gore to the war film a genre that is surprisingly nongory but the thing that annoys me most about is something that is no real fault of the film its the way so many people fatuously praise the film as being realistic a bunch of different critics even stated that this film avoids all the clichs usually associated with wwii filmsavoids clichs have any of you seen it well lets just start with the squad who goes after private in the film do we have the tough but decent guy from the midwest check tom hanks do we have a vaguely ethnic type check vin diesel as caparzo how about the young coward who later on shows courage check with jeremy davies character what about the wise guy from new york check with ed burns did we forget the country boy sharpshooter no we have barry pepper as a cross kissing sniper you may just as well have cast anthony quinn wally cassel william bendix lloyd nolan and richard jaeckel certainly john wayne would have been perfect for the tom hanks rolestaying with realism does spielberg even get the facts of omaha beach right the real plan was for the men to secure the beach and then have bulldozers knock down the sea wall tanks would then blast through german fortifications and then the men would follow the tanks what really happened was that the water and tides were unexpectedly strong and the men were washed completely off course thats why they landed directly in front of german machine gun nests they certainly werent heading there on purpose after suffering terrible human losses and with the water being too deep for the tanks only 2 of the 29 tanks ever made it the surviving men waited at the sea wall for five or six hours until german fire had died down and then they climbed up the sides of the bluffs doublebacked and attacked the germans from behind eventually over running them thats what really happened i found that out by simply looking this battle up in the encyclopedia britannica apparently that is something no one at paramount pictures did because that is not what happens in the realistic saving privatespielberg presents the omaha beach slaughter as if this is what happened all over on dday again not true in fact troop casualties were much less than expected yes more than 2000 soldiers died at omaha beach which saw the fiercest fighting and was a terrible slaughter but a fifteen miles down the coastline at utah beach they suffered less than 200 casualties and even less to the north at juno and gold beaches im not trying to be disingenuous here i know was about this specific group going into this particular battle but overall what was presented in is not what most soldiers faced that daybut what is really unforgivable to me if you watch is you will get no sense that anybody other than americans were involved in this action remember it was called the allied invasion not the american invasion which might explain why is hailed as being accurate over here but in other countries notably britain and canada who also lost soldiers that day they find this film laughablenobody minds that spielberg fudged things historical in order to make a dramatic movie but pretending you didnt is wrong and yes just because paramount pictures says this is the way it happened dont make it so is clearly a wellintentioned film and was made with skill and care but ultimately it is nothing more than a feel good picture full of flag waving banalities and video game style violence it is world war ii the ride steven spielberg has made a gripping and entertaining film with but thats all lets save our medals of honor for those who show bravery in an actual war,reality
im no expert on the normandy landings but i know enough to know that the opening scenes of the movie so highly lauded as realism were pure hokum though there may have been some landing craft whose occupants were slaughtered as the doors opened and whose few survivors were then further decimated on the beach less than 10 of those who landed on omaha beach were injured or killed so what was the point of showing the fountains of blood we know war is hell showing it realistically is gruesome enough without stretching the truththe movie went downhill from there the next three hours were spent tediously watching a single squad of a men walking all around 400 square miles of france asking whether anyone has seen private how ridiculously absurd again i must ask what was the point it stretched credulity beyond the limiti think the biggest reason i was so disappointed in this movie is that it was so highly acclaimed by critics when it was released i cant imagine why,reality
as an addendum to the very fair report on spr by bob the moo id only point out that the basis for the story is not an american one but a british one from wwi thats the only nod to the usual us view of themselves as the worlds favourite saviours that said its a great film the deaths especially as a result of closequarter combat are rightly harrowing you do get the sense that war is not about glory and that heroic actions often go unrecorded often resulting in tragic endings the attempt at combat realism is commendable the sound of machine gun bullets zipping through air and flesh will remain with me in an action film there is often limited scope for developing depth to the characters and this is also true of spr to blame any of the actors for this is a tad unfair it simply soars way over the heads of such films as full metal jacket and the closest comparison i could make is to the band of brothers series which is closely based on real events and possibly the wind whisperers oh and regarding the comment about michael caine removing his kids from a us school over it teaching that wwii began in 1941 it is sad but true that us kids might be taught this however are brit kids taught that wwii began on 3rd sept 1939 to a pole the war began 2 days prior to that to a czech maybe a year to a chinese person maybe 3 years its all a matter of perspective,reality
plenty of war drama and blockbuster action to start the movie then a long boring few hours to end it very unrealistic overall hardly a great war movie if we are to view the title of the movie as the plot of the movie then we have been fooled greatlyif it is really then why no scenes of private until the movie is almost over well if there had been then they couldnt have played that little prank on the viewers of the first private saved being the wrong one matt damonif you are going to watch this movie have plenty of coffee because after the first half you will fall asleep quick this is just another stage for tom hanks a mediocre actor that the studios keep trying to push down our throats except for forrest gump a role he was well equipped for i give it 5 of 10 stars because of a few good scenes,reality
the movie starts out with a recreation of the normandy landings  plenty of gore some humor which may have been untintentional  the us army platoon shows they know how to stay alive use cover not take foolish chances etc the whole landing was better shown in the longest day without the gore but this first sequence was effective next the platoon is asked to find 1 particular solider at this point the boys seem to leave all their brains behind they decide to fight to the death over some meaningless bridge commit one act of  stupidity after another this would make some sort of sense if they were green troops but they spent the whole first half hour showing how good they were at fighting everyone  i know thought the whole last section of the movie irritating stupid or worse how it got such a high rating is beyond me  after you sit through it once you will never want to see it again,reality
for me this was a long pending movie to watch it was recommended to me over and over again both online and irl and now i know whythis movies opening scene has to be among the top 3 of all time considering a large proportion of this movies budget went towards crafting the opening sequencesteven spielbergs direction is near perfect and filmography is brillianttom hanks does a brilliant job portraying the hardships of the battlefield all the while leading a team to search for the last surviving sibling in accordance with the sole survivor policy of the us militarythe plot unfolds beautifully with some critical twists adding to the effect the preclimax and climax bring the curtains down really well tying up all the loose ends the movie ends with a powerful message that is sure to dampen even the toughest of heartsoverall a well scripted movie backed up by an incredible cast and an exceptionally talented directorthis movie gives a perspective that other war movies rarely depict would surely recommend,reality
i think this is a magnificent film it has everything and everything good it is not an effects movie but it has them entertaining with history and that even taking almost three hours they fly byhow can you have so many actors and that everyone is so good im not a fan of tom hanks but i think even hes fine being a bomb movie it turns out that all actors have depth you all know their lives and their thoughtsit is normal that being spielberg with his budgets makeup art hairdressing are fine but you have tofrom the photograph nothing needs to be said magnificent as always janusz kaminski is formidable constant coldness and depth of field for stevens plans talking to people everyone loves the beginning nobody talks about the ending i even heard that the film has the climax at first i think if you like the cinema you will enjoy much more of the whole ending than the rest of the filmspoiler the film has an early hour that everyone hallucinates not for less that amount of effects extremely well made with a lot of rhythm and very well planned but this is only the beginning because we reached the end of the film the whole area of the bridge from here he talks about values fellowship friendship but most of all steven spielberg gets to direct as he knows plane to plane is a true marvel narrating based on planes the camera is always placed where it should be at the pace it should carry having effects of course but only with the staging and its direction is not to blink no closeups at all pace no plans studied to tell a story it gets you so far in the movie that you do not realize that youve been almost three hoursthere is a moment in the movie when the military arrive to tell a mother that her son is dead she is in the kitchen through the window you can see a car without losing the woman we see the car as she opens the door they pass and it does not take much that she knows what there is what a way to tell and tell no cheap but brutal sensibilities,reality
caused wwii vets to leave the theatre during the film sounds like a bad movie well thats incorrect they left due to the emotions it made them feel and how real the movie seemed this comes as no surprise since it is a steven spielberg movie he is a much decorated film maker who is good with serious genres he certainly did not let down in this instant classicthe movie does an excellent job at showing the terrifying reality of war the opening battle scene might just make you cringe as it starts off in the blood bath of omaha beach this lasts about 24 minutes but leaves a much longer lasting impression while the blood and gore of the movie might turn you off it does show a personal humanistic side tom hanks as the leading actor does a good job at making you feel what it was like to be in that situation tom hanks who is also known to be a much decorated actor had experience of acting out war scenes from the hit film forest gump the graphics and design of this movie were magnificent the designers studied many things about wwii and the way it looked in order to put together such realistic scenes its as close to war as you can get in a film everything down to the stitches on the uniform is done as historically accurate as possible also the animated portions were beyond its time there is a scene where a soldier is trying to put his guts back into his body that is so detailed it kind of makes me sick this movie broke many graphic barriers for the time is what made and really began a new era of historic war moviesthe plot consists of a young private whose three brothers were killed in action since he is the last of his brothers left the marines feel the need to bring him back home to his mother this mission is given to a small group of men led by tom hanks this plot is based on historical truths so the concept of it cannot be argued by critics that doesnt mean the idea of this real life issue cant be questioned however the problem of this plot was seen throughout the movie in the soldiers eyes as the group started to lose men over one private they began to question what they were doing a scene in which the soldiers start arguing about it and one pulls a gun on the other really makes you feel this moral struggle audience members who became attached to these characters also started to question the idea of saving one man for the price of many tom hanks settled down these doubts however in a heartfelt speech during the scene of argument and kept his soldiers focusedbeing emotionally connected to the characters was a strong suit the movie showed it made it better than just a bloody war film it made you feel as if you were there and part of it you grow to care for each member of the group as the film goes on which makes it that much harder when they start to die off a scene in which they gave background stories of where theyre from helped strengthen the connection this movie is intense and is definitely not okay for kids it receives an r rating for blood gore and language veterans of our military will be much more appreciated after a film like this what makes this movie special is that it doesnt only show the horrible nonhumane aspects of war it also shows the morality and heroics these brave soldiers showed in order to protect a good cause is a unique film because of that,reality
steven spielberg lived up to his legacy once again when creating this powerfully moving film by combining amazing actors eye opening details and an absolute genius plot he creates one of the most iconic films ever try sitting through the opening scene of dday spielberg ingenuity when recreating this event is absolutely perfect he puts you in the boots of brave soldiers who threw their bodies at the wall of german nazis gunfire this draws you into the movie and makes you excited but nervous to find out whats next for this group of men this type of plot creates a sense of attachment to captain miller tom hanks and his 2nd ranger battalion as they go on what seems like a pointless mission to find missing private matt damon as the film goes on you yourself might even question is it really worth sending eight experienced men to find this one missing soldier spielberg hit the jack pot with his cast many of which were in their primes of acting or just starting to be known for their amazing talents such as tom sizemore sergeant horvath vin diesel private caparzo edward burns private reiben matt damon private and of course the great tom hanks captain miller tom hanks captain miller is in short a genius his ability to be a utility man and play almost any role in a movie makes him one of the greatest actors ever and he doesnt let us down with his astonishing role every line he gives draws you into his character as a weary old captain who has seen too much for any person to handle and is ready to go home to his wife the actors and plot arent the only things that made this movie amazing this film also put so much detail into locations props and people and make it a life like war zone with crumbling structures from constant attack and overgrown vegetation creating a sense of abandonment and eeriness this detail is the most important factor when making such an emotional film it allows the audience to get that much deeper into the scene and making it that much more believable with such a great movie you must be thinking are there any setbacks to why i shouldnt see this amazing film sadly there is one thing you should be ready for if you can get past constant gore and a bit of cuss words i hope you have a lot of time on your hands this film is 2 hours and 50 minutes so i hope youre okay with giving up a large chunk of your day but dont worry it is beyond worth it despite this small complication is an amazing creation full of action drama and tons of explosions you will be involved with every second this film has to offer and with no doubt will want to see it again,reality
this movie truly deserves a spot on the top 10 best war movies no words can express the feelings you get while watching this movieright at the start youre being thrown right into the heat of the battle the starting 27 minutes are absolutely amazing in the way that steven spielberg the director did tremendously good job at making his vision come true the scenes were extraordinary sort to say in the way that he tried to recreate that ww2 battlefield cameraman aesthetic if you watch any footage from ww2 you can see the hand held camera is shaky and when an explosion or something else happens nearby the camera goes everywhere and the footage gets interrupted steven used this and made the movie feel chaotic the scenes looked so real and felt so chaotic up to the point that real dday veterans who watched this movie had relived the horror of omaha beach because of their ptsd and when this movie was released they setup a hotlink for anyone who had received these horrible flash backs that is such a terrible thing and my heart goes out to the veterans who had to relive this chaos all over again then again as terrible as this sounds this is quite the achievement for spielberg in the way that he made it look so real that it was too realnever the less the rest of the movie had you on edge im not telling you how you should know if you dont then go watch it,reality
is for me the best war movie everit is an important movie reflecting morals and values of how 8 men risk their lives for one simply brilliant really tense and realistically portrayed this movie held my attention throughout there are some scenes which are really strong they can make you smile cry and look awaythats how powerful spr is on the whole i give it 1010 as there was absolutely nothing in the movie that i didnt like steven spielberg  awesomeness spr is a standard a force to reckon with a dark horse among war movies whose simplicity and strength cannot be matched,reality
the best thing about spr is the omaha beach sequence that was very realistic as well as being factual the rest of the story is fictional only somewhat realistic and rather unlikely first of all the wwii us army would never have wasted a ranger captain who was a company commander to lead a squad of soldiers they would have assigned a platoon sergeant or at most a 2nd lieutenant i can believe they might send a squad of regular infantry to find a single soldier but using rangers is a stretch rangers are more highly trained and would be used for an important military objective not a pr mission there were some touches that i liked i liked the way tom hanks portrayed captain miller as a normal guy whos approaching burnout and is starting to get the shakes also the way he kept a certain amount of distance from his men until they were down to a small group the part about the company having a pool on his prewar occupation and it turning out to be a teacher the way the sniper private daniel jackson barry pepper quotes scripture to calm himself and steady his aim the running fubar joke however the end really bothers me having captain miller laying a heavy guilt trip on private matt damon as he dies is unrealistic melodrama finally much has been said about various tactical errors made by both the german and american forces in the movies climactic battle steven spielberg responded saying that in many scenes he opted to replace sound military tactics for dramatic effect shame on you steven neither robert rodat writer nor steven spielberg director have ever served in the military in fact spielberg attended california state university long beach to avoid the draft for the vietnam war so this is the kind of unrealistic war movie made by someone who went to college to avoid military service i dont think it helped that robert roden had to rewrite the screenplay 11 times before it was acceptedin the words of sam fuller the only way to make a truly realistic war movie is to fill the theater with smoke and flame the sound of explosions and to have someone shoot the person sitting next to you amen,reality
is one of the greatest war movies ever made its an unbelievably emotionally powerful film that inspires a horror seldom seen in the usual hollywood movie this has to be not only one of the greatest war movies ever made but possibly the greatest movie ever ever made i would easily put it on the level of the godfather movies why spr has infinite character depth there are no gi joes or murderous killers that every single war movie needs to have every soldier is just that  a soldier i may also be one of the few who felt sorry for upham keep in mind that he wasnt a soldier per se he was an interpreter also keep in mind that he hadnt really established a bond with the unit yet which was something that they all sharedspr has a realistic portrayal of wwii they even portrayed the germans and ss better than any movie i have ever seen it also forces you to feel sorry for soldiers of both sides like when the two american soldiers shot the two czechs i believe as mentioned on the forum who surrendered and then taunted them this was a subtlety that i only recently found out about i always assumed that they were germantom hanks character was truly great he wasnt a stock character at all and seemed like he could be a real person this was actually true for all of the characters i also guiltily felt a little sorry for steam boat willie who was probably going to be executed in a ditch for being the sole survivor of you know you know what happens in the final scene and i couldnt feel sorry for him anymore and was happy as we all were when the event after that happened this was just one of the many amazing themes and subtleties that were involved with this movie i have seen it over 15 times and still notice new things every timein conclusion this movie is gruesome but beautiful what greater present for veterans day is there than to watch this movie they truly were the greatest generation and their gift of freedom to us keeps on giving,reality
ive watched many war movies since i was young but none have impressed me as much as the realism was top notch i have served the army infantry for a number of years and i know the sound and shock of artilleries and bullets furthermore the emotions of the soldiers were presented so well throughout the showas i was watching the show it kept prompting me to realize the hardship of war and the suffering of losing human lives never before has a war movie conveyed to me so deeply that we should never go to war  for whatever reason strange to hear myself commenting like this when i was trained so hard in the army to lead men to fight so aggressively in a possible battlefield,reality
let me get things clear that june 6 1944 dday was not just some small battle it was the turning point of world war 2 ok gave me the feeling that i was watching wwii from someones perspective i was especially amazed by the way this movie was captured with the camera angles the outstanding acting and the amazing special effects what was unfortunate was that the best actor got a very short part he was the medic on omaha beach that yells we did it we stopped the bleeding then the man they saved gets shoot in the head the medic flips out that medic should have gotten a longer part but anyways i found this movie to be awesometotal 1010 a,reality
this movie is about a mother that is about to be notified that three of her four sons have been killed in a war the fourth son is not known to alive nor dead eight men begin a journey to find and bring the fourth son home to his mother throughout this journey you are taken to the war at that specific time this movie shows what the war was truly like and helps people who have never suffered through a war really look and reflect on their life this movie shows the extent to which a government will go to to simply ease a mothers painanother wonderful aspect of this movie is that when the fourth son is finally found and is informed of his brothers death he wants to continue with his mission that was set before him he feels his brothers deaths would have been in vain if he does not complete his mission therefore the eight soldiers aid in in attempting his mission before returning home this is another important aspect of the movie as it shows that most soldiers are there for a reason and believe in the cause they are fighting for,reality
is one one of spielbergs best movies and thats saying a lot it was an incredible experience and the first twenty minutes or so was intense graphic and completely realistic it is known as probably one of the greatest scenes in cinema history ever it was a great beginning to an incredible movietom hanks plays captain john h miller after surviving the attack at omaha beach known now as dday he and his platoon are given new orders to search for a private and bring him back home you see all ofs brothers have been killed in combat and since he is the last survivor the higher ups in the us military want him returned safely to his grieving mother who has already lost three of her boysmiller of course takes the job he doesnt much like it but he is just following the orders of his superiors when he tells his platoon about it they are all against it after all why should they risk all their lives for one person they gripe about it but ultimately they followed their leader and go on the search mission behind enemy lines wheres squadron was parachuted inalong the way we learn about the characters yet the pace never was drawn out as the action is happening we are also learning a little bit about the characters vin diesel had and early roll with this movie and other actors include tom sizemore as sergeant mike horvath edward burns as private richard reiben barry pepper as private daniel jackson adam goldberg as private stanley mellish and henry thomas all were good in their rolesthis movie had excellent cinematography and editing as well as great sound it was no wonder it won the academy awards for all of these and i also believe that spielbergs oscar for best director was the right choice tom hanks was the main star but spielbergs directing made all the characters seem just as important and kept the pace of the moving going without any real slow upmy only question would be about the story which is told form a soldiers view i have know problem with the story being told from that view but what i do have a problem with is believing that our leaders would create a mission that would risk eight of their men to save one i know that the grieving mother lost three of her boys but would our military really go through all this for one man i dont think so but then it is just a movie overall i enjoyed it and would highly recommend it to anybody,reality
is wellfilmed and wellacted but it is thematically a mess and on that count is wildly overratedthe complaints about this movie on these imdb comments are two one that it is properly speaking an antiwar film and the other that it indulges in crude nationalism both complaints are on the mark but it should be noticed that they are not quite consistent with one another in the tradition of vietnam movies like platoon and full metal jacket focuses on the human cost of war but its moral that we must earn the sacrifice those bold men made for us so long ago sits rather uncomfortably with the focus on the cost after all how could we earn the loss of these men and the grief of their mothers by living well by being good people it doesnt make sense how could you make your life worth the sacrifice of so many othersperhaps the point is that we ought to be grateful to the men who fought and died for saving our lives but this doesnt make sense either the war in europe did not properly speaking save our lives wars are rarely if ever fought to save lives they are fought to conquer and to defend against being conquered but being conquered does not amount to being killed and it might well save lives to surrender spielberg does obliquely refer to the holocaust in the film but he must know as everyone does that the war was not fought to end the holocaustperhaps spielberg is tacitly assuming some flagwaving boilerplate about how they fought for freedom and we ought to be grateful for that i dont deny that saving europe for liberal democracyhowever we understand thatwas a noble cause but it would be impossible to tell from this movie that this was the point of the war and it might well be impossible to believe that such a cause was worth dying for once you had properly taken in its message that war is the senseless destruction of mothers sonswar movies traditionally fall into two types one type focuses on the heroic cause the soldiers fought for in which case you will want to glorify war you will want to make your soldiers look strong noble and make our hearts melt with admiration for them otherwise how can we encourage others to fight for such often abstract causes most classic wwii movies fit this mold and given that most of us think wwii was fought for a good cause this makes sense the other alternative is to focus on the human cost of war as vietnam movies and wwi movies typically do but it isnt a coincidence that vietnam and wwi are thought to be pointless wars the idea of such movies is that nationalism and social habits can lead us to sacrifice our children for nothing by shocking us with the horror of war we are encouraged to mistrust martial impulses tries to take from both traditions and ends up with a garbled mess wwii was a noble cause that could not have been worth the sacrifice it might be argued that each type of movie neglects some important truth that the other type captures perhaps some great filmmaker will successfully ennoble the causes of war and at the same time capture its horror perhaps someone already has all i know is that spielberg has not,reality
the opening sequence is without doubt1 the most harrowing and horrific depiction of war that i have ever seen2 the best movie sequence to test out your surround sound system that ive ever encounteredafter learning that 3 out 4 of mrss sons have all died in combat during various missions in world war ii it is decided that her last remaining son will not be allowed to die in battle and a small group of soldiers is assembled to get private outspielberg has undoubtedly captured the feel and the gloom of war and has certainly avoided unnecessary dramatisation with a top class cast a great director and a powerful story is probably one of the finest movies ever made1010,reality
watching was one of my greatest cinematic experiences the first twenty minutes of the film is truly astonishing its as if i was actually running up the beach with bullets going all around me slicing people to bits and bombs blowing off everywhere tearing everyone to shreds there was a feeling of total hopelessness of the existing and forthcoming carnage around mei remember when i first saw the film there was somebody left of me who was so traumatized by the omaha invasion sequence she covered her eyes and went out of the theater there was a seemingly hardened old man right of me who said he has never have seen such horrifying experience in his lifeyes this film has many flaws i found the script to be very conventional and there were many corny cliches the characters are not very well developed even the tank battle at the end an amazing scene than matched the omaha scene in tension is pretty much hollywoodized it showed many military inaccuracies  i had participated in message boards that many military analysts rightfully criticized the ending as being very unrealistichowever its still hard to not say this is a groundbreaking powerhouse of a war film that will and had probably already changed hollywood war cinema forever the intense violence of this film will teach generations of people that war is not fun and games war really sucks,reality
seems like the spielberg who gave us sugarland express duel close encounters of the third kind raiders of the lost ark and et has departed our company and has been replaced by a clone who is intent on exploiting human suffering in the name of art and the oscar schindlers list was perhaps the worst example of this trend followed closely by both films were undoubtedly critical and commercial successes but somewhere something called a soul may be mia amidst all the hoopla personally id rather watch a bridge too far again the longest day again apocalypse now again full metal jacket again the deer hunter again and paths of glory again if i have to remember how horrible war is,reality
the subversive postmodernism couldnt be more obvious no almost no one notices so corrupted are we by the malaise of pacificist impotence the whole concept of basing a film against the very flow of ddaythe heroes are not there to win anything theyre there only to drag someone out while thousands of americans brits aussies canadians free french and others are dying fighting hitlers army and luftwaffe spielberg is leading a campaign of mighty forces to pull a lone american out of the combat zone no matter what the cost to use the worlds greatest invasion from the sea as the mere backdrop to a story is to me perverse and trivializes the extraordinary efforts both of the men who fought during the normandy invasions and the earlier generation of filmmakers who sought to portray that effort on a grand much nobler canvas,reality
first the good things this is a technically well made movie with some impressive shots specially at the beginning the acting is standard good and thats itthe plot is at least weak and the chance to turn the whole thing into an interesting irony about war military etc planted when the protagonists wander themselves about the reasons to save one life risking seven or eight is missed when we see this general really convinced about returning to this one mother his last son alive right after a scene of memorable butcheryall the chances to make any serious statement and provoke debates about war or anything are missed in front of this kind of caricaturesque characters so common in the mainstream movies,reality
a well made movie probably the best effects but schematically the same goodguys vs badguys wwiifilm as usual yesmrspielberg all of us germans are evil yes mrspielberg we love to kill this is so ridiculous mrspielberg only because one mrhitler gained power for just 23 years in german history we will probably see movies like that for the next thousand years everybody knows what happened everybody of us sees it and hears it day by day we all know it was wrong and horrible but enough is enough leave us alone with your onesided point of view many young men died  russians americans italians french germans australians english japanese and so onevery one of them had his dreams every one of them had his good and bad sides  every one ofem had a mother every mother cried the same tears i think it is a shame to say ones death is good and the others death is bad only because of the nationality that is the same thinking like the nazis had good nationality means life bad nationality means death too bad another wasted chance to show an objective antiwar picture where all young men are the same  victims of ideology,reality
ive read several comments and many people seem to agree that this movie is extremely patriotic  i for one think that there is nothing patriotic about this movie it simply shows a group of soldiers that happen to be american  on a mission of looking for a single soldier whose brothers have been killed in action  i personally have no doubt in my mind that had this movie been based on a french british or even canadian squad that not to many people would have been calling it patriotic  for some reason the site of an american flag at the beginning and at the end of the film seems to make people think much less of the movie i am not american myself but i sure as hell am glad they got into the war and all though there were many other countries in the war this movie happened to be about an american squad wellhaving said all that i just want to say that i absolutely loved this movie i give it 1010,reality
the film may have been more than welldone gorefest if any of the characters had been remotely interesting i may have cared whether or not their lives were worth risking  their mission didnt seem any riskier than anything else they may have encountered  there was no dramatic conflict  the characterdeveloping monologues were nauseating and the stories they told were recycled workshop material  the true story upon which the film was based was totally undermined and spielbergs point of view is uncommitted selfinvolved and pedestrian  he quotes abraham lincoln instead of exploring the issues and asks for approval at the end frankly the emptiness of the story characters and treatment wasnt worth the pain of the opening scene,reality
me as a german im interested in the german history a lot this film moved me because it shows the brutality of war very explicit theres one scene which almost made me cry the scene where the german soldier slowly put a knife into the gi at the end of the film one point it is a movie about the brutality of war why is the american flag shown at the end of the film i think this shouldnt be that is false patriotism after all the allies also were french and british the americans were a small part,reality
this is a good actionwar movie thats it spielbergs directing is too perfect it reminds me of a norman rockwell painting sentiment rather than emotion,reality
this was the most gripping and emotional films ive seen for a very long time i watched it on its very first screening and as a result there were many exservice men in the theatre the total and utter silence during the entire film except for the ending where quiet sobbing could be heard gives testament to the powerful imagery concocted by spielberghaving watched the opening beach scene being filmed in ireland i had no idea how dramatic it would appear on the screen after the initial 20 minutes critics said how the film went downhill i thought that it opened up the characters and made you feel for them at the climax of the filmall in all the most powerful war film ever,reality
i took my father to see the movie he had been in the normandy on dday his comment it was like this i think theres nothing to add,reality
this is a war movie that is so horrifying and moving that it cant be anything else than the besteverything is great about this movie great actors great battle sequences and a good ending it really shows the horrors of the wars not like the old wwii war movie where the american soldiers were immortal men that ran around showing the american flaghere we have no heroes just losers because the only enemy they are fighting is the war itself,reality
im amazed at how much stupid some people manage to saylets just get a few facts straight on omaha beach sector dog green there were only americans no brits no canadians no aussies no russians no polish and so on i know they all lost men but on omaha and in there were just americans we have one story here and it would be wrong to bring in people who werent there so if you want to see a movie about nonamerican soldiers in wwii you should go and see something else and not complain about this movieand what kind of person can find the american flag in the end of the movie disgusting 2500 men did give their life on that beach in the fight for a free world and here we have some bs complaining about the flag this movie is a tribute to the men who fought and died there i say they should move to cuba or china or iraq where those twisted ideas still liveits a great movie that everybody should see its rated 18 min 18 years old here in norway which is a little high i think it should be 15 so that schools could go and see it so that we dont get more morons who takes freedom for granted,reality
magnificient simply and horrible even if a movie so close to the hell it was on these days is not close enough to what simple young men had to suffer a great feeling of despair and the question  why should they have to get killed at the end of the movie because in a nightmare like this there is no good purpose to die for even for their country as some generals the ass in their office would explainthe friendship those guys shared was beyond brotherhood in this time think about those who died those who sufferedbut more than anything to those who survived and make us live soldiers who died deserve more than respect they deserve a think sometimes a sincere tear on their graves not for what they won but for what they suffer and they deserve a smile,reality
just a couple of things first of all i would like to say that history is written by winners please think about that hollywood productions dont give any objective account of ww2regarding  at the beginning of the movie 2 hundred poor americans are ruthlessly slaughtered by a punch of faceless huns who are defending the beach at the end of the movie an heroic punch of americans are defending a bridge by killing 2 hundred ss and by destroying 2 tiger tanks with sticky bombs  and handthrown mortar ammunitions in both cases germans are dumb and on the wrong side either as killers or as victimsit is my opinion that soldiers of both armies were equally forced to fight by orders from above and inspired by boastful belief there is nothing really heroic in warif you want to find a more believable perspective of operation overlord try max hastings book overlord 1984 youll learn much more about the poor performance of american infantry and evil germans fighting prowess,reality
this is almost on par with a uwe boll movie for its sheer lack of intelligence was and to a degree still is shown as one of the finest films of the 20th century on a par with the godfather or apocalypse now im sorry but this is exactly what this film isnthere is my list on why this film was such a disgraceactors who the hell bit vin desiel in this movie the man has no talent of any kind whatsoever tom hanks wasnt the lovable forest gump he wasnt doing well as the average guy and officer trying to do his best for the greater good the other actors did little to push the roles they where given and as a result where really forgettablestory who the hell told mr spealburg this was a good story im a writer myself and if i had written this id have taken myself outside and shot myself straight afterword not only was the basic story utter bullocks why would the us army care about this bloke anyway in ww2 millions of people died entire armies where wiped out not just entire families but the film is littered with inconsistencies and inaccuracies its stephen spelburg at his most romantic and that means bad for your iq level the first sense yes its very good yes its gory yes its shocking but it is no where near what real war is like no where near what combat in the second world war was like purely cos stephen spelburg was not there no one sides the people who fought there knows what it was like no one had scaled the cliff face until a full 6 hours after the invasion began also utah beach was only considered bloody cos the defences on the other parts of the mightly adlantic wall was an old french farmer with three teeth and a spadethats just the beginning of my list of terrible story points if i wrote them all the very internet its self would crashcharacters who are they who cares not me they where all idiots stephen spealburg does not have an emotional bone in his entire body are we really supposed to care for these poorly crafted 2 dimensional people the humour between them was so bad ive seen new simpson episodes that are better definitely better written and i for one hate new simpsonsspecial effects stephen speburg is a slave to cgi yeh it is impressive but its also pretty poorly constructed and carried out due to it being filmed in digital time stephen spelburgs 1 student must be a german moron called uwe boll he uses the same camera techniques of shaking to create the illusion of danger and tension it does work in this film for 5 seconds then just gives you sickness in the pit of youre stomach that isnt good for the audiences health much like the storyi could go on and on but i think ill stop here its so damn bad i think ive said everything that needs to be saidone to avoid,reality
nobody who has studied ww2 just for a while and knows some basic facts about it can not like this film the plot doesnt make any sense sacrifice the whole rescue unit for sake of ones paratroopers life seriously stop pretending to be noble here and answer a simple question is a search for one man not rescue exactly worth risking lives of a whole squad furthermore how can someone expect of a small unit which consists of bunch of infantrymen to find one man in such a vast area there was a big mess after attack of allied paras they were spread all over the place with heavy loses some reviewer wrote here the idea to call 101st on radio to pull back i think that would be the best thing to dothis movie is unbelievably insulting the germans are portrayed way too cartoonish like bloodthirsty animals americans are the good guys of course and completely inept enemy at the same time which of course wasnt true in most cases the germans were a tough enemy in spite of the fact that most of their soldiers were not equipped and trained well as in the earlier years what all of you people who think the portrayal of germans in this movie is realistic is the reason the war lasted so long just bad luck and weather no way some reviewers wrote that there is nothing stupid about germans here because they made mistakes like slow reaction to the dday or wrong estimation of the invasions spot that is true but it has nothing to do with quality of individual soldiers that is not a justification for showing elite units including ss panzer gruppen as complete idiotsthe american saviors were just refusing to die each time a shootout emerged yes they were killed finally but should be dead much earlier you are supposed to sympathize with our bunch of american action characters but i just hated everyone of them spielberg wants us to think that they are battle hardened soldiers but i had the feeling they are just kids playing some war game except for the interpreter who was totally unnecessary character btw acting annoyingly cowardly for no reason in the whole movie i was bored for most of the time after the first sequence the way the unit moves behind enemy lines looks like a walk in central park one german with machine gun in the right position could easily wipe out at least half of the unit because they didnt keep any type of formation which should have prevent thisthe final scene is so incredibly stupid that i doubt about common sense of those who spoke well about this one you see german attackers running back and forth without covering fire or support in front of american barrels germans even dont try to find any kind of cover they even hardly return any fire its like shooting range for american soldiers or some kind of pc game looks like every dead american takes at least 100 germans to hell with him kids if you like this sequence i have bad news for you the war doesnt look like this you hardly see anything more than enemy soldiers head and his gun when combat occurs and of course the kills are not so easy to get on the other hand the americans also run uncovered many times but with some ability to dodge bullets or something like that that is the only explanation of my own for their immortality in reality they would have been killed instantly if they would behave in such way as shown in this sequence for example running in front of pzkpfw tiger which has manually operated machine gun at the front the rules which apply to germans somehow dont apply to americans the tactics performed by both allies and axis here is laughable germans wouldnt enter a town with tanks ahead and infantry behind them because the tanks are vulnerable in urban areas their strength is placed in the open the attack on the radar station is weird as well the defenders were surely part of a bigger group it is obvious that after killing the defenders the americans should retire using hit and run tactics because other germans could enter a fight instead of it they argue on the very spot theyve just captured about a sense of their mission like there is nothing to worry about it would have been clear to an orangutan from a very beginning that this mission sucks just stupid i could go on like this and mention for example shooting 7 shots from 5 round rifle without reloading and so on but i will skip it you cannot let this so called war movie treat with history like this call it action b movie and im gonna take it never watch this crap if you like history and portrayal of it in the way it actually happened,reality
no one can doubt the power of this films opening sequence when miller tom hanks slimed in blood and filth stares blank eyed at the carnal slaughter around him  you cannot help but think that was what is was really like and you cannot help but reflect on the importance of this moment in modern history and on the undiluted bravery of the men who were there and yetwhen the initial battle is over horvath tom sizemore scoops up a handful of dirt and pours it in to a tin marked france its a moment of forced quirkiness quite out of keeping with the frank reportage of whats gone before its a bit of business used by the director as a punctuation mark and its the first sign that this is a film with fatal flawshaving survived omaha beach miller and his men are assigned to locate whose whereabouts are unknowns brothers have been killed in action and the us military brass cannot allow to be lost too theres a historical precedent for this although is a wholly fictionalised account given their mission the soldiers debate its worth  are they to throw their lives away in order to arbitrarily save someone else conflicts arise there are uneasy stand offs and reluctant truces they find and save him lives to be a humble old man but most of the soldiers who saved him do not live to be old men of any sortspielbergs technique is frequently brilliant but its unvaried so that the final battle is no different in tone from the first one three hours of screen time previous but the real flaws are in the script miller is an ordinary decent man who will make difficult decisions when pushed horvath is the tough sergeant wade is the medic disgusted by the slaughter reiben is the insubordinate mellish is the comedian who doesnt know when to shut up upham is the tenderfoot whos never fired a weapon on his life jackson is an illiterate from the deep south whos also crack shot carparzo is a giant of a man miller could be played by gregory peck horvath by ernest borgnine reiben might be a young william holden and so onthe worst crime is the character of the german soldier who the men want to execute in revenge for the death of wade the german begs pitifully for his life says in broken english that he loves america and hates germany upham is a humanitarian he cant stand to see a man killed in cold blood and he persuades miller to let the german go free upham has never fired a weapon in his life remember and miller is full of human decency so at the end what happens the german returns having thrown in his lot with another platoon of german soldiers in what is portrayed as a supreme irony the german kills miller and in turn is killed by upham who finally finds his courage or at least his capacity to kill the problem is that as soon as you set eyes on upham hes so weak and pathetic that its a certainty his character will undergo a dramatic reversal it doesnt matter that tom hanks as miller jeremy davies as upham and barry pepper as jackson are superb it doesnt matter that as vignettes the deaths of wade and mellish are exceptional behind the throat clearing and the reverence the clichs stretch from the flinty military hawk who gives the order that must be saved to the final soft focus image of the older himself in the end is a more callow less worldly film than attack or a walk in the sun and the savagery of its opening only serves to emphasise the fact,reality
what steven spielberg has done with is simultaneously craft an enormously successful depiction of world war ii and a touching story that places a platoon of bewildered soldiers in a world of frantic pacing  a startling world of gunfire and proceeding death the constant movement of the shaky handheld camera acts as a first person perspective  we are not merely viewing the movie but participating in it this is perhaps as close as we will ever get to realizing the unadulterated fear those soldiers must have felt as they drew nearer to the beaches of france it is one of the greatest war films ever put on celluloid its scope arguably larger than any other in the genre its conflict superbthe movie based on the actual events surrounding the nilan brothers during world war ii is about a group of soldiers sent to rescue private matt damon a young man who loses three brothers in the war and whose mother is spared the possible chance of losing her remaining son after captain miller tom hanks and his platoon are sent on a dangerous mission to find and return private to safetythe men who fight alongside miller have to question their own actions what makes private more important than any of them they all have mothers too but they follow orders venturing into the battlefields of wwii france in search of private the most reluctant of the soldiers is private reiben edward burns a pessimistic everyman who feels no need to risk his own life for that of another manthe battle scenes are ultimately what made one of the highestgrossing films of the decade and what enticed so many eager viewers into theaters many veterans of the war reportedly broke down in tears during one of the first sequences the landing at omaha beach which probably lasts about fifteen minutes  at leasthowever the movie also reaches a sort of emotional height that few other war films manage to capture this is a fascinating account of war packed with terrifyingly realistic scenes and some of the most disturbing images you will ever see in a mainstream film but it also has a lot to say about friendship and selfless motivations earn this captain miller tells private at one point in the filmspielberg has proved countless times that he is capable of abandoning his famously schmaltzy style of filmmaking to record touching stories that often times relate to his own life spielberg claims that he felt an internal desire to tackle this project as much as he felt it was necessary to direct schindlers list both films work as a sort of documentarystyle motion picture but also contain fundamental emotional truths which elevate them to higher groundtom hanks as captain miller is not the first actor who comes to mind when one thinks of war picture but hanks position in the film works to great effect primarily because he personifies the everyman quality of a soldier as we too often forget the men who fight wars are not always the schwarzeneggers with huge muscles and a wealth of weapons and ammunition the soldiers in world war ii were fathers husbands brothers sons hanks successfully embodies the image of a simple man who is thrust into a world war and tries his best to stay aliveis a better movie than apocalypse now platoon or other great war pictures in the genre not necessarily but it stands on its own as an amazing achievement of pure filmmaking and an ode to the thousands of men who lost their lives for the campaign against hitlers armies if you can stomach the violence and accurate depictions of brutal warfare is one of the most moving cinematic experiences you will ever have,reality
there are some very good things about this film unfortunately there are also some very bad things that detract from it as a wholefirst the good newsthe action sequences at the beginning and end of this film are second to none  war is not heck but something entirely more horrific there were some nice little touches such as miller having parkinsons that added some colour to the characterisationnow the bad newsthere were far too many formulaic elements in this film  i would like to think this was enforced by the studios but i doubt itthe german they let go and what happens afterward with him  extremely predictablethe rookie that goes to pieces at completely the worst time  equally sothe sequence where miller is firing at the tank with his sidearm  were in cliche countrythe ending from after above scene onward  far too jingoistic for my taste  the film tries to show how repulsive war is then tries to glorify it this particularly cheapens the entire movieis great to look at and will hopefully open a lot of peoples eyes as to what being shot or blown up actually looks like in reality but with a sharper script and a less cynical template it could have been a lot betterdan,reality
im sorry but i was not at all impressed by this film the plot was thin the characters too stereotypical by the end i didnt mind who would make it through and who wouldnt i have seen better,reality
if this movie wins best picture and tom hanks best actor then its all just politics  i thought the whole thing was boring  it s just spielbergs war movie period,reality

is a movie about world war 2 a group of officers from the army go to find the only remaining son of the family the plot was good it gave an accurate representation of war and the trauma of the experience i didnt like how private refused to go home sure it was a courageous move but a bunch of guys just risked their lived to bring this kid home and now hes not even gonna go the music and sound effects when along well with the movie the background is good mostly taking place in europe the movie is heart touching and intense this movie is filled with action and adventure the dialogue and acting is very convincing you almost feel as if youre in world war 2 overall the was a heartfelt and action packed,reality
on the same day in july 1916 my greatgrandparents received three telegrams from the war office informing them that their three eldest sons were all missing in action presumed dead two were soldiers taking part in the battle of the somme the third a sailor on the convoys to russia in fact only one of the boys turned out to have been killed but my greatgrandmother never recovered from the shock her husband seems to have borne the loss of his eldest son more stoically i well remember my grandfather the youngest of four sons and whose name was james like my own telling me this piece of family history and always reminds me of it because it deals with a very similar story except that here all three boys really are dead one day in june 1944 a mrs receives news that her three eldest sons have all been killed in battle two in the dday landings and the third in the pacific my grandfather was too young to fight in the war but mrss fourth and youngest son also named james is also serving with the us armyat the us war department general marshall orders that james must be sent home immediately to spare his family the pain of losing all four sons the problem is that he is a paratrooper who has parachuted into normandy and nobody knows exactly where he is captain john miller and a squad under his command are ordered to find him and bring him back oliver stone accused the film and its director steven spielberg and scriptwriter robert rodat of promoting the worship of world war ii as the good war i am not sure that that should really be a criticism the great majority of american or british films about world war ii have portrayed it as a just war against the aggression and brutality of the axis powers it would be a brave director who set an anti war drama against the background of this particular conflict catch22 is perhaps one of the few exceptions and i note that not even stone has dared do so it is much safer for those who wish to make antiwar films to stick to world war i or vietnam moreover spielberg can hardly be accused of ignoring the human cost of war the film has been praised for its graphic battle scenes particularly its harrowing opening sequence lasting nearly half an hour showing the american landing on omaha beach spielberg does not flinch from presenting war as cruel and bloody or from realistic depictions of men being killed or maimed at first the assault appears to be completely chaotic yet as it progresses we begin to realise that this is not so that the americans do indeed have a strategy and that they will succeed in taking the beach albeit at a heavy cost in casualties the film may have its critics but it also has its admirers and there are many who believe that it should have won the 1998 best picture oscar ahead of shakespeare in love spielberg did indeed win best director it is one of those films which when it gets something right gets it very right indeed the abovementioned battle scene is the best example of this but i should also mention john williams oscarnominated musical score especially the deeply moving hymn for the fallen which plays over the closing titles i also liked spielbergs use of handheld cameras and desaturated colour he was aiming to reproduce the look of american wartime colour newsreels british ones during this period were all in blackandwhite and i found his pale bleached colours much more appropriate to the mood of the film than brilliant technicolor would have been and yet i cannot share the widelyheld view that this film is a masterpiece the visceral intensity of that opening sequence is allowed to dissipate as for the next hourandahalf the film proceeds slowly as we follow miller and his unit across normandy only when they finally find towards the end followed by a second battle scene does spielberg recapture anything like the brilliance with which the film opened during this lengthy interim the action is too slowmoving and attempts to focus on the conflicting personalities of miller and his men never arouse much interest it is as though individual human beings are dwarfed by the sheer immensity of the conflict raging around them my vote for best picture of 1998 would have gone to the truman show and despite spielbergs undoubted technical mastery for best director to peter weir being a great director is not just about shooting great scenes it is also about making a great film and here i think he does not succeed is a technically accomplished film but not a great one 610,reality
not a bad film but not at all memorable of course the beginning and end are mawkish and irritating the omaha beach sequence it has to be said is exciting now ill openly admit im a bit of an anorakbut some of the scenes during the final battle sequence were laughable firstly considering they were likely part of an experienced panzer division the germans were ridiculously naive tactically in reality they would have made life a lot harder for the americans until air support arrived in the unlikely form of p51s british typhoons would have been most likely the second point id like cleared up is the matter of the sniper in the bell tower and his demise he ls dispatched by what looks to me like a tank destroyer with a long barrel 75mm if the piece could have been elevated that far it would have been firing an ap round which would most likely have passed straight through the tower doing little or no damage in reality the germans would have kept their panzers and tank destroyers largely static and used them for ambush only,reality
yes the opening beach scenes are very dramatic and mighty quite moving but the actual story is sentimental and corny the worst thing for me though by far was the final scene in the cemetery  this isnt a spoiler because the film has been out for so long now anyways final salute and words of gibberish dont go anywhere near in my opinion expressing the depth and profoundity of the experience its so sloppy it actually makes you want to vomit and i question here why spielberg at the final moment allows the superficiality of nationalism to take precedence over humanity its as if spielberg is saying is first and foremost an american before he is a human being,reality
obviously you dont need me to tell you that you probably already knew everything about this film was spectacularthe realism the plot the production value the actingetc all amazing the characters are all unique and likablewith the exception of uphamaka the good guy you hate more than the bad guys several reasons for this hes idiotic and doesnt understand war he talks all this humanity and whats right bs but when its time to kill an enemy easily and save a fellow comrad hes too much of a coward he also fails in the field because he was cowardicethough he finally shot someone it proved uselessit only said he was willing to kill but kill an unarmed person at point blankwhich ironically makes him more of a coward other than that all characters are cool the mysterious miller the tough guy carparzo the jolly harvath the defiant reiban the great medic wade the great yet unfortunate mellish and my personal favorite the cool religious sniper daniel jackson you cant help but fall into the storyi mean everything is done so exceptionally its no wonder why this is remembered as an alltime great,reality
this movie has affected me deeply i saw this with high expectations and was not disappointed i feel incredibly lucky that the war didnt affect me and i know that sounds very selfish spielberg shows us what a debt we owe to those brave heroes who gave their lives for us so horrifically the dday landing scene at the start made me cry i couldnt help it this movie shows such feeling and pain and love it is unbelievableim so glad i watched this film because it has made me feel emotions i havent felt whilst watching a film since band of brothers another powerful war filmtv show steven spielberg is a legend and tom hanks is superb a must see more than ten stars i would give it a million,reality
i grew up in a tight knit italian family my father and several close uncles who all saw action in the second world war in fact when i was born my father was in europe fighting they were in the marines army navy and one in the 101 airborne although none of them would speak of what they saw and did in any great detail as they grew older they would from time to time discuss little bits and pieces i can tell you from what i gleaned from their various conversations and having seen just about every war movie is as close as we privileged citizens are ever going to get to what it was really like however i believe it reality it was worse yes worse than movie could make it remember this was a 3 hour movie showing one incident the reality is far worse as the survivors of each incident did not go home they got to fight again the next dayweekmonthyear and so on until the war was won of you were killed or wounded the greatest generation you bet they made the world free they did give up their tomorrows so we could have ours if you dont agree and therefore do not honer remember and celebrate these real american heros than i say kma and drop dead you unamerican sob and go back to whatever hole you came from,reality
being interested in history enormously and loving films with an historical background i was very interested in this one at first but i really think this film is the very reason i started to dislike movies about wwii american productions dealing with this topic always include a lot of bathos but this one was too much after all and i have no clue how come so many critics are amazed by it the description of the events is horribly onesided and unrealistic that i can only recommend to watch das boot or der untergang downfall instead to get a realistic impression of what was going on back theni still voted with three because the performance by tom hanks as a soldier suffering from parkinson was quite good and interesting im thus still waiting for a film showing the events on the american side realistically,reality
i still remember seeing this film almost five years ago and i was never so sickened by any film in my life why because spielberg gave us a hell of a view of war this film is not that of history save for the opening gore fest battle that contained more than blood and missing limbs like previous war films like platoon or glory i can easily understand that war is hell which im glad spielberg revelaed to the world for a change im not a gore lover but this really caught me off guard since im used to such violence from films as of braveheart and the full metal jacket however i have to confess that all i got from this film was blood and gutsso after an agonizing thirty minutes of constant brutality the film picks up with a story of about a band of four brothers three of them are already dead and only one remsins so a small force of eight men including portrayals of popular stars such as tom hanks and tom sizemore who didnt do much except shoot germans with machine guns they are to find this man retrieve him before he is killed which would result in the devastation of a his family a very selfless task it is but as the man is found after another hour and a half of no character development with these eight men no feeling for them or tears and griefat least from me and says he refuses to leavei laugh and the only reason why this is so is because spielberg wants another bloody mess feeling he hasnt shown enough killing so another battle happens with more deaths of both germans and americans leaving this whole film into a usless flashback so thats the whole film in a wayi may sound to hate this film but i dont but im tired of people claiming this is the best war film ever heck other films ive listed above are better than this for goodness sake however the realism was well depicted the music was haunting and sad but i had no feeling except for wanting to lose my lunch in the pit of my stomach and the usage of sound mixing editing and cinematography was truly oscar worthy so since spielberg put effort into this film i give a generous 12 out of seriously i got nothing accept horrible images and yearning for a bucket in this two hour and fifty minute film,reality
seeing it again nine years after its release you cant help being struck by how familiar things are the pale blue cast of the photography the distinctive special effects the squib charges exploding not with blood but with dust when a man is hit the clank of bullet against armor the shaky camera the enemy seen as dark phantoms scurrying through the murk of the battlefield the tiny fountain of cork chips as a bullet slams into the dirt the attention to period detail the necessity of reloading at particularly awkward momentsall of this is familiar now because its been so often aped often in strong films like band of brothers and blackhawk down i doubt that anyone could make an ordinary war film anymore slow cheap ones like sam fullers or even innovative gruntsview stories like platoon if youre going to make a war movie now spielbergs is the bogie you have to match it is the fate of rebels to found orthodoxiesand what an innovation this movie was oliver stone must be applauded for tackling a subject like the vietnam war that was so controversial that the conflict was avoided for more than ten years because of the still smoldering emotions the war had generated if vietnam had been a human being it would have had to stalk around dressed in rags tinkling a little bell and crying unclean unclean saving privates subject is less controversial first the enemy really was our enemy germany declared war on the usa first not the other way around second well  we won didnt we but it is probably more original in its details and candid too a german and an american soldier are locked in bitter mano a mano conflict and the german wins and not by cheating either he is the bigger man and finally overpowers the american and inch by inch sinks the americans own bayonet into his chest he does not gloat or smile its no tennis game to the german but a deadly necessity just as it is for the american soldier relax the german pants in a low voice its very simple as the tip of the knife slowly penetrates the americans chest the scene is phenomenally starkthe most complex character is uphams the rest of the americans play their assigned roles performing impossible feats of bravery this is precisely what the germans are doing too but upham fails at a crucial point and costs the lives of his allies the viewer can sit back and make olympian judgments about uphams character but consider that for every hour upham spent in combat he was as valiant as everyone else for fiftyfive minutes he translated was almost run over by a tank ran across open spaces under fire and carried ammunition but those fiftyfive minutes dont count on his side only the five during which he was frozen in tonic immobility a fundamental mammalian trait which  not having been in uphams place ourselves  we can condemn him formaybe nobody can define an antiwar movie they all claim to be antiwar movies how could you possibly market a prowar movie unless we were formally at war with another nation to many people an antiwar movie is a simple excuse to give us more action and more blood put steven segal in combat boots others are antiwar because they give us a glimpse of the enemys humanity somewhere along the line but in all the antiwar movies we always seem to win as indeed we do in the cavalry comes galloping to the rescue all war movies even those depicting a defeat like pearl harbor seem to endorse the same bumpersticker slogan no matter how sneaky or noble they may be they cant whip us i guess it takes an enormous amount of courage  in hollywood  to ask an audience to pay money to see a movie in which we lose a war or a battle or a fist fight with an enemy its what i admire about a movie as flawed as a bridge too far and its what makes me feel more involved in the tragedy shown in that handtohand fight that the american loses contravenes established war narratives what we lose its as shocking as hitchcocks killing of janet leigh halfway through psycho dont miss a milestone at the time,reality
a close russian friend a onetime tank commander made me think seriously about this movie he said the first 20 minutes of make all other war movies look foolish he then continued for example that hollywood movie memphis belle is so silly well i happen to think memphis belle is a good movie and i must say that spielberg copied the hollywood warmovie style of kubricks dr strangelovetechnical issues or even realism aside the underlying message of is so strong so wellput and so human that in my view it defies objection i have wandered too many war cemeteries to think otherwise all quiet on the western front is also a good war movie but it makes the case for pacifism the basic message of is not pacifist at all its something else altogether but i suggest you see it and draw your own conclusionslastly is so wellmade that it bears repeated viewings but if you dislike war movies then you should still watch this movie once if only for the message,reality
the first 20 minutes of is probably the most realistic depiction of war and the invasion of normandy ever made that being said the plot is far fetched and the story drags out for while without anything really happening there is very little character development and many of the characters you never really get to know all that very wellthe last combat scene of the movie does not live up to the first it was very disappointing to me personally in reality the german military was highly trained and professional in this movie they are reduced to cannon fodder in the last 25 min it seems to me there was two different directors on this movie  one for the first half and one for the second half,reality
i was unaware of the furore this film caused because it got passed over for best picture by the academy having watched both i have to say i think that for once they got it pretty much right sure the landing scenes are awesome  they really are they are the most graphic and horrific depiction one could imagine being translated onto screen and as a brit who has also been to the beaches in question i felt extremely humbled and thankful for the incredible sacrifices made but this is a film not a vote on the actual perfomance of the heoric men who fought to rid europe of evil and im afraid the second half of the film gets progressively worse until we are left with a silly tale about tom hanks saving the world this is a real shame the gravitas of the first part of the film deserved better treatment,reality
i was disappointed with spr  unfortunately i found the movie terribly sappy maudlin cheesy  especially the frame  i really agree with what spielberg said about himself  he makes movies that he would have enjoyed as a child  this movie would have been more entertaining to me if i were 10 or 11 years old,reality
i wont rate this picture as an academyawarded first sequence is too boredom we know how they were killedit was too long like a rushfilm or a russian warmovie the title of which i couldnt remind if i were the producer the normandy scene would be cut into 6 or 10 minutes it will be a fair length for the movie the plot was too much elaborated and empty anyway what is it that tom hanks right hand dindle why did he tingle like that had the writer and the rest of staff forgotten this matter goofs but the productionworks are marvelous thus i rate it 4 for them,reality
most idiotic portrayal of the normandy invasion ever the main characters acted like modern spoiled brats the characters were not convincing at all if actual soldiers acted that way they would have never even made it past basic training also the us military back then would never have risked the lives of a whole squad to find and bring back one single solider the main objective to any soldier is win the war and that used to take precedence over anything also the moment private mellish disrespected a superior officer and then refused to carry on he would have been shot there was no time for pampering cry babies during a world war and this movie basically portrays wwii era soldiers as modern day cry babies it was not only a disgusting insult to our vets but it was a insult to our military and our country the only thing going for this movie is the special effects but it takes much more than pretty filming to make a movie i have no idea how the hell this movie was so well praised this movie was as stupid and clich as inglorious bastards,reality
is awash with wildly exaggerated scenes of carnage seems like every member of the grrreatest generation wants to be remembered for the kind of overthetop violence that has graced vietnam war films oh yeah thats just how it was right looks like omaha beach lost every other guy nope one in tenwe have pictures of the normandy landing look at them does the beach look anything like spielbergs beach spielbergs beach looks like a video game bullets streaking through the water and killing the soldiers as they swim up from the bottom of sea this is how history gets rewrittensuppose there was one landing boat that landed right in front of a pill box good thinking and got hell shot out of it why is spielberg showing that one unfortunate boat feel manipulated get used to it this whole soap opera is chock full of bridgesofmadisoncounty drawn out boring melodramatic scenes designed to pluck at your heart stringsoliver stone complains that spielberg is playing into the good war mantra that is currently being used to finance the war on terror i saw no signs of that i saw us soldiers shooting down unarmed pows and beating prisoners a touch of vietnam to thrill our taste for revenge or is it just part of the arms race between chickenhawk war directors trying to stimulate our jaded tastesthe acting is atrocious its hard to blame the actors really since we dont get to know them at all they are simply redshirts waiting their turn to get shot down or get into hissy fits tom hanks is tom hanks as always theres no tension we know whats going to happen were just waiting for it and it all unfolds so slowly its boring the scenes that could contain some excitement are spent in a quick and confused blur its a mess theres no more artistry in this movie than is contained in your typical music video halftracks and rangers pop up out of nowhere as our heroes cross an open field endless streams of machine gun fire pour out from nowhere in particular its just ludicrousthere are few scenes in that arent replete with unnaturally sentimental dialog unrealistic dissension in the ranks haunted stares tears and hollywoods rendition of jaunty chummy talk they might as well have been a bunch of teenage girls one star for the cgi,reality
the first half hour of is excitingly filmed graphic and horrifying the rest of the movie is maudlin bloated badly plotted and with some of the least compelling dialogue it has been my misfortune to hear a movie that starts and ends with the us flag is likely to put nonamerican viewers off side it would appear that the only people involved in world war ii were the americans a few cowed and unimportant french peasants and pantomime german villains a psychiatrist friend of mine assures me that this movie is a classic illustration of the isolation caused by post traumatic stress disorder but her husband agrees with me that the movie is just rubbish the thin red line which was so overshadowed by this farrago was of a poetic beauty that is rare in us cinema see that instead,reality
it is very clear to me that mr spielburg has never fought in a war situation the film did not depict d day as it was at that time it is clearly relating to the turn of the century and would be seen as suchmany will think that its success is because it is purely a us affair i thought there were about 16 countries involved including the defense team the battle scenes are over dramatized and no one seems to keep their heads down to avoid being shot especially the germans also as usual the germans are depicted as being cowardly stupid and not obeying the rules the whole film is an exercise in american patriotism as told in american schools if you must see an american war movie that is realistic watch task force which is a much more accurate depiction of war also it depicts the americans getting the worst deal on d day not true the germans didthis film is sometimes chosen as the greatest ever not by me i would dearly love to know if these voting systems are stacked,reality
the first fifteen minutes of this film are electrifying then i am pinned to the beach by the relentless barrage of spielbergian humanism,reality
when i say disturbing i mean disturbing volience gore and graphic imagery is serve in this film when i had to watch it in history class at school i ended up shutting my eyes and putting my fingers in my ears gave me nightmares for 2 whole weeks would not recommend this to anyone below the age of 18 i dont know the rest of the film but ten minutes for me was enough to judge not saying it is a bad film because it might not be but for me it was too graphic,reality
way too longnot nice whatsoever fall in love with the characters to watch them really go nowhere with their livesalso contains a real stabbing scene which was definitely the very worst thing ive ever seen,reality
i really dont like war movies because it makes me think that someone i know that is going into the army is going to die and i would be devastated when i watch these movies it makes me think what those families have gone through and the pain that they felt when they found out their husbandwifemomdadsondaughter has died yeah its for the freedom of the country but it makes me so sad because i know so many people that are going to go into the marines or navy or something and i dont want to see any of them die out there because they cant always get the body because its shredded thats why i dont like war movies that much,reality
i didnt watch this film until probably a year after it was released the beach scene is perhaps the best opening to a war film i have ever seen a lot of time and effort as well as the budget went into recreating the dday invasion the rest of the film just plods along until the find the acting is superb especially tom hanks spielberg has done it again i would recommend anyone to go and watch this film at least once the film doesnt drag along the whole journey to find is littered with danger and heartache the recreation of the beaches are so realistic every small detail is spot on i would rate it higher than an 8 but the opening of the film set a high standard for the rest of the film,reality
this is one of my favorite movie i really enjoyed the story line and the action in this film i am a fan of military movies because they are empowering to see how we must stick together i really like how the color correction put me in the action along with them the camera movement was on point i would love to work on a film like this i could relate to this movie because my father use to be in the military what really got my attention was the sniper scene where they were trying to save that little kid and family stuck on a roof top in the rain was deep then the sniper begins to shoot one of the soldiers that sound of a broken piano was kind of shocking this movie is a great film and i recommend it to everyone,reality
this movie hit me hard with emotion with just the first 15 minutes the infamous opening scene is something you can never truly prepare for sure gore isnt the worst for many however i remember when i first saw it at a young age i cried because i knew that ever injury you see happened to a real person at one point in our history the thing i appreciated most about this movie is that there was not sugar coating anything the people in this movie are mirroring true events meaning that people do die and people suffer you go back and forth on the reasoning behind the plot which is sending a group of men to save just one life it really plays with your mind a group of men are worth more than just one right but what about that one mans mother who already lost three of her four sons there is no right answer in a situation like that someone has to suffer and thats what happened in the war to so many real people this movie is a great reminder to appreciate where we are now there are people out there to this day who are still suffering because of this war while we live our everyday lives i definitely recommend this movie to anyone maybe not the younger ones out there considering the gore because it is a great portrayal of history,reality
is a heart pounding drama that shows world war 2 very realistically the battle scenes while horrific are done to perfection it shows us the horrors of war from the pov of our main character captain john h miller tom hanks and the platoon he commands captain millers platoon has landed on normandy beach and has now been assigned to a rescue mission to locate and save private james francis matt damon a us paratrooper whose brothers have been killed in action as the group goes through france to find one man they ask themselves why one man should be as important as the eight looking for him as ive already stated the battle scenes are amazing the acting also is top notch its really an incredible movie the last 27 minutes is just gripping its impossible to ignore,reality
i have always enjoyed most of spielbergs movies like et goonies the mind blowing jurassic park and of course never has a movie stirred such emotions in me of sadness and awe from the moment the movie begins so does the true horror of war itself ive never been to war but this movie i believe had given me a good idea of what a soldier in action goes through the first 45 minutes left me feeling horrified and sick and so did the scene where the runner gets shot down then finished off in a barrage of bullets it is a bloodthirsty flick but war is hell and this movie captures that tom hanks performance is by far his best as an officer who suffers from a form of shell shock and as his job requires has to hide his emotions from his troops even though the loss of his men to save 1 whose brothers have all fallen in the heat of battle cannot be justified the finally also is horrific and spielberg did an amazing job capturing the horror of war 1 of the best films and cinematic experiences i have ever seen 10 out of 10 for me spielberg is the greatest director of all time a must see to teach us why we must be reluctant to go to war war horse also is the best depiction of the great war ive seen too another spielberg great,reality
all the bad reviews on here have led me to the conclusion that people feel smarter by trashing criticallyacclaimed and oscar winning films like this one this is one of if not the greatest war movies ever made the opening 20 minutes is one of the most harrowing battle scenes ever filmed and in itself debunks the theory that this is a prowar movie anyone who wants to go to war after seeing the opening scene of this film is crazy this film is poignant and heartbreaking particularly vin diesel and private mellishs deaths and the idea that this film is prowar in any way is ridiculous a bunch of reviewers on here criticize the film for only showing the american perspective on dday hate to break it to you guys but this is a film about a squad of american soldiers who go on a mission to find an american paratrooper whose brothers have been killed in combat putting another countrys perspective in this film would have been ridiculous and wouldnt have fit in with the rest of the film as for the other arguments against the film which are basically a bunch of nit picky details like the type of rifle they are carrying or an insignia on someones uniform or some other ridiculous historical detail that really has no effect on the film at all this movie never pretends to be a documentary and shouldnt be taken as one some of these people cite the paths of glory or the longest day as examples of great war films and dont get me wrong i loved both movies but i could write a whole list on their historical inaccuracies films like this one should not be analyzed as documentaries but should be taken for what they areexcellent wellfilmed wellacted harrowing and heartbreaking films that bring the brutality and horror of war into our lives,reality
i spent some time reading old posts in here some of them are terrible one post suggested that the baby boomer generation had to try to prove they were as good as the generations before them i have no clue what that means other post suggest the movie is average once the beach scene is over this movie is incredible every mission every detail the thought process of each character their personalities makes this movie about as true to life as a movie can get it is an epic piece of work and kudos to all the actors in this picture that bring this film to life if the very first and last scenes not the beach scene or the battle scene in the abandoned town at the end i mean where the elder visiting capt millers grave doesnt drive home what this movie is about then just stick to comedies,reality
to call this movie a masterpiece is an understatement what spielberg has done here has transcended the viewing of a motion picture and created an experience in movie making this is emotional unbelievable storytelling and a depiction of a war that makes you feel like you are there now is this the most original story ever told no the storm of normandy has been shown before the story has been told before this is pretty much another story like that of the brothers sullivan who are talked about in the moviehowever  it has never been depicted like this ever the first thirty minutes of this movie will have you glued to the screen if there is popcorn in front of you it will not be getting touched let alone passed anywhere it is brutal real amazing shocking true and for a movie the most realistic battle scene ever put on screen spielberg puts you on the beach the sounds alone envelope you this is a movie for the big screen and surround sound also i must mention the amazing john williams musical score is nothing less then brilliant accompanying the visuals on screen that music alone tells such an emotional fantastic storyactual war veterans who lived through this part of our history said for the most part that what you are seeing on screen by spielberg is the closest thing ever depicted of that war besides actually being there some could not finish watching the scene so if you want to see a movie that is so much more then a movie see this it centers around one of the most important wars if not the most important for this country and the rest of the world to be clear though this movie is not just about that war the story is told during that time period of our history centering on this one battalions search for a manok how about the rest of the movie the searching and hopefully the rescue of private excellent you will be interested and want to know what happens a great cast and masterful movie making keep you glued to the end oh and mr spielberg does a fantastic job in bookending this movie with two wonderful scenes that tie it all togetheri original saw this with my dad on its original release in theaters after the movie i asked him what he thought he literally could not speak for like twenty minutes watched it again just recently with my girlfriend reaction was pretty much the same nothing to say for a bit this movie leaves an impression and does what many a movie does not you walk away experiencing something so much more then a movie a small glimpse of our history and us as human beings enduring all the horror war laughter tears and ultimately family and love that keep us wanting to go on,reality
spielberg turns out a war movie which is both harrowing and gripping not to mention being an essay on both the futility of war and also the opposing view that sometimes it is right to embrace that futilityi dont want to repeat excessively many many other comments so ill just say that the two combat sequences which bookend the main narrative are staggeringly visceral and must be the nearest experience to war combat short of being in it these sequences are astonishingly well stagedhanks has never been better and the rest of the cast is also excellent but this is spielbergs film,reality

is spielbergs antithesis to the action movie indeed the blockbuster ideology from the man who made his name indeed inspired a entire movement if youd like to label the blockbuster so in making 1975s jaws a film that skipped along the boundaries of comedy horror and sheer action driven spectacle comes a film that combines the latter two of those three and approaches them from a completely different angle whilst spielberghelmed starring functional friendly relaxed and accessable lead tom hanks released in the summer month of july in america but getting a more realised winter period release everywhere else and very much arriving as a genre film is anything but the usual summertimespielberghanks led flick instead turning a entire promise into a thing of pure terror in a summer that saw deep impact armeggeddon and godzilla released in close proximity must have been quite the joltpeople have written in the past about the degrees of sentimentality and the nuisance to do with the unreliable narrator i think its impossible to look or even think back to the times of the second world war without a sense of sentimentality the notes that accompany the dvd state that spielberg attempted to get across that orally guided sense of the father telling the child ie his father informing him of the horrors of the war such an approach to some might sound a little convention indeed like a clich or something that contains a degree of sentimentality essentially this is exactly what spielberg does in he doesnt trivialise in rendering it tv movie of the week built around some harsh battle scenes he delivers on a truetolife narrative as told through the perspective of someone who wasnt there but is aware of the horrors much in the way anybody born post wwii might attempt to reimagine what it must have been like to fight under certain conditionsthe film is in fact delivered by way of a flashback  a delving into the past a specific soldier does in order so that we may relive what occurred over the space of half a dozen or so days echoing spielbergs own relation to the war stories of old by way of his father the film is about unity teamwork and the risk of sacrifice those undertake for individuals they are yet to meet for the platoon in it is an individual they know is out there but in the grander scale of things it is for people spanning a number of generations across a number of nations they will certainly never encounterfollowing the flashback spielberg provides us with a few seconds of calm before the storm in the form of waves lapping up on a beach the place is northern france the event is dday in 1944 much has been written about the landings going into them would only repeat what has been said but its worth noting that the first lines anybody ever says once all the vomiting and praying in the landing crafts has stopped arrives in the form of a load of military directions and ramblings which the viewer might not properly hear enhancing confusion and a sense of disorientation just prior to the drawn out sequence of carnage with this and as pointed out in a review in a publication the casting of hanks as captain john miller gives the audience something to map onto amidst the chaos as actors that do not carry similar weight to hanks are either blown apart around him or placed in this hellish cauldron however years later the likes of pepper burns and diesel have since established themselves as names and face thus threatening to dampen the intended purpose of anonymity spielberg meant viewing it recently i do not feel any of the impact is particularly losttheir eventual mission to seek out the private of the title a certain matt damon whos located somewhere pretty deep within northern france deep enough so that the march there will last half a dozen or so days march for the troops millers platoon is made up of the guys that survived with him on the beaches of dday plus a certain private by name of upham a trilingual troop played by jeremy davies who does his usual scrawny softly spoken seemingly untrustworthy and somewhat illateasewitheveryoneelse act which was fresher back then than it is now millers professionalism is only enforced by talk of a highly dangerous off screen mission he undertook one that saw him and his crew knock out a number of german antiair craft guns dennis farinas somewhat impressed and therefore transfixed gaze locks onto a talking miller as the emphasis in his characters superiority in military activity is encored he and his platoons journey is punctuated by interactions with french families german snipers machine gun nests and conflicts with each other as they go in searchto say the film concludes with an almighty shootout between two sides in a bombed out and long since deserted french town would be grossly misleading in a sense an action film might very well build to an explosive and dramatic set piece but while might conform to a series of heroic actions followed by a twist in fate just as a fatal blow is about to be struck to whom we think is the lead the lingering feeling is on the sense of loss moreso spectacle one might argue the sequence comes across as more stark and more frightening than the opening beach landings simply because of the presence of the reason the platoon are even there the fear of loss of life comes across as more prominent in a film that has thus far displayed a massive amount of loss the film is a towering achievement and one of the better films out of the decade thatwas the 1990s,reality
rekindled an interest in the media about the second world war with the tv series band of brothers films ranging from the great raid to enemy at the gate to pearl harbor and computer games like the medal of honour and call of duty series is also noted for its use of realistic of violence and war combat which has continued into further films and television programmesset during the early days of the invasion of europe by the allied troops a platoon of american soldiers led by captain john miller tom hanks is assigned to find private james francis matt damon an soldier who 3 brothers are killed in action he has a ticket home the mission sounds simple enough but was in the 101th airborne and dropped behind enemy lines before dday millers platoon has to go through enemy territory to find one man the platoon who are assigned with miller start to question the mission especially when their men start dyingthe war scene especially the dday scene are some of the best committed to film it shows that war was very brutal very bloody confusing and the need for good tactics and good men the film makes an effort to show a mixed picture that the germans were a soldiers not monsters or all nazis whilst some americans can be arrogant and even committed war crimes like killing surrendering soldiers it is so much better compared to a onedimensional film like braveheart spielberg is a great director and avoids shooting the film in a ordinary way he uses a handheld style and his cinematographer janusz kamiski films in a washed out look giving the film a documentary gritty feel he knows how to make a film visually wonderful they is an excellent cast tom hanks tom sizemore matt damon in leading roles whilst even small roles were filled by established actors like ted danson and paul giamatti tom hanks is the most well developed character making you care about what happens to him and what drives him throughout the film many of the characters have backstorys like private or character traits like the arrogant jew or the sniper who was a committed catholicthere are however problems with this film the script and story are weak they are character clichs like the wimp the ultra good officer who is committed to the mission the brave soldier etc on the other side of the coin some characters simply disappeared off the screen because you couldnt care about them the story is also ridiculous could you really picture the american military risking a whole platoon to save one man a private a farm boy from iowa especially with him being in the middle of enemy territory and not knowing where he was not fighting on the frontline its hard to suspend your disbelief the film is also a normal piece of american patriotism showing how great their were i know its an american story but it ignores some of the darker elements which other writers and directors would have focused on mainly nonamerican filmmakers they was no mention of the british or canadian forces fighting and even robert rodat writes a line which pretty much an attack on field marshal bernard montgomery a british war hero rodat must have some issues with the british because he also wrote the really awful the patriot also has the same problem that gladiator has that its opening is so good that nothing else in the film can compare to itis a example of a director improving on the script he is given worth watching a good oscar win for spielberg but the thin red line should have won best picture in 1998 over and shakespeare in love,reality
this film grips you from the very beginning and holds you spellbound through the entire movieit has all the elements of an endearing classic that both informs and entertains in reading the other reviews it is absolutely amazing that anyone would rate this movie below 7 or 8 stars it seems the detractors fall generally into two campsthose that do not like the fact that the german soldiers were not shown in the same sympathetic manner as the americans and those with such virulent antiamerican or antiwar sentiments that they are simply incapable of forming an objective rational and honest opinion in other words their negative reviews of the movie are an expression of their politicalideological views not their honest assessment of the quality of this movie which does a disservice to this movie and to those they may dissuade from seeing this film so dont let the negative reviews stop you from watching this movieit is truly one of the best movies ever made of any genre if you are a fan of great film making you will love this movieif you are virulently antiwar or antiamerican this film is not for you,reality

i am only 12 years old and yet i think i felt the true meaning of this filmmaking masterpiece first of all the opening 24 minutes is the most gruesome bloody and most realistic warscene i have ever seen it makes me feel as if i was in one of those boats getting ready to fight for my life the movie just gets better as it moves on i grow attached to every single one of the characters and as i see them dropping one by one i cant help but to shed a tear you might think just because im 12 that i like just the bloody battle scenes but i always ponder the question is it right to save one mans life if it costs you 5 i simply do not know overall i believe that this is the by far the greatest warmovie of all time the greatest overall movie might be pushing it a little but it is definitely one of my favorites ive seen the movie about 6 times and after each and every time i see it about 56 weeks later im still thinking about itespecially the opening scene this movie is simply incredible and if you have never seen it then what are you waiting for this is definitely one of the greatest experiences youll ever have after watching a movie,reality
i saw this gripping and grizzly film at the young age of 9 yes nine even at that age i felt the pain and and triumph of the soldiers the first 25minutes are so edgeofyourseat material that its no wonder the majority of networks air this with little if any commercial interruption this is one insane and intense filmtom hanks is great as well as tom sizemore and matt damon spielbergs direction is so astounding its what makes this what is is amazing theres a ton of gore and blood the first 25minutes as aforementioned are so gruesome im surprised i didnt puke yet spielberg knows when weve seen enough and when all goes quiet its almost like it just happened in your very own living roomthe music by john williams is beautiful and haunting from the hymn for the fallen to some of the battle cues its a very good scorethe story is inspiring and terrifying making it all the more realoverall will absolutely shake you to the core in terms of seeing the war and feeling like youre in the thick of it i highly recommend this to anyone with strong stomachs because of its epic story and surreal realism it makes for a oneofakind experience seldom seen in the majority of films today,reality
forget apocalypse now and the deer hunter is the best bar none the acting is monumental and the action is even more so from its gruelling cinematic opening through to its profound ending delivers on all sides of excellence tom hanks is compelling as captain john h miller hanks hasnt portrayed anyone quite as captivating since his 1994 oscar winning success in forrest gumpthe visual concept is staggering and undeniably excels anything in the war genre praise to spielburg though for giving audiences a tragic look inside to the horrors of war and its various other hellish topicscudoes to saving privates raw beauty and magnificence in recreating the bloodiness and nightmarish abyss that was war this being said is the best war film simply put and its visceral grit and substances shine boldly among others,reality
i gave this movie 1010 coz its simply excellent be it the gory violence which looked almost real to the combat scenes which were amazingly shotthis film proves that spielberg is the best directors of our generationyou dont have to be american to enjoy this movie if you just have eyes and can take a little gore and violence then this one is for youthe camera work is just superb and takes you that era of war tom hanks as usual is very good with his natural performance and the supporting cast is also very goodmatt damon seemed a little out of the character but that did not affect the movie in any wayi believe that matt damon could have been replaced by somebody else but all in all this is one of the greatest war movies made,reality
everything that you could have heard about is trueyou may have heard about the opening battle footage its a little over twenty minutes long and its some of the most violent footage ever put to film to be honest with you i expected worse but its not so much the violence as much as the horror of it all its just sickeningand i say that as a complimentwhen the actual search for private happens youre introduced to the characters and their personalities theyre all very distinct some think that casting tom hanks as the captain was a bad choice but i disagree hes perfect the rest of the cast is just as good it features great actors that include tom sizemore adam goldberg barry pepper giovanni ribisi i related to his character the most matt damon and a surprisingly good performance by actorfilmmaker ed burns the only actor i had a problem with was jeremy davies as the interpreter ive seen davies in several other movies spanking the monkey and going all the way and he always plays the same annoying wuss character picture henry thomas but much skinnier and more geekylooking i dunno maybe im just nitpicking it was kinda necessary for the character by the way theres an interesting bit part played by a major tv celebrity i dont know why hes in this movie but it was an unexpected surprisethe script was written by robert rodat who also wrote fly away home and tall tale and had uncredited rewrites from scott frank wrote dead again and adapted get shorty and the great out of sight and frank darabont wrote the 1994 version of mary shelleys frankenstein a nightmare on elm street iii and the fly ii but hes known best for writing and directing the shawshank redemption and though its not a perfect script its a damn good one my biggest problem was the bookend parts set in the present unnecessary i thoughtsteven spielberg is strange in that hell make mindless movie blockbusters that are welldirected but lack any substance and then hell turn around and make the color purple schindlers list or it almost seems as though he makes some movies just to fill his pockets and then once his pockets are filled enough hell do something from the heart steven spielberg truly is a genius filmmaker and with as much acclaim as he gets now he still seems underrated i just cant believe that shakespeare in love got the academy award of best movie when this one was clearly a better film in every aspect what a shame,reality
thats rightmany nitpickers claim the film is not realistic clearly they have no experience with the countless detours ad hoc actions revised plans fubar situations and the like that is part and parcel in the ebb and flow of combatthe business about capt millers comment about the germans having to change the barrel of their machine gun and this is the chance to attack in the radar station scene is nitpicked by some based on their knowledge of german weaponrywell big fcukin deal like no soldier ever made a mistake assessing the enemys armaments the scene simply adds to the realism not subtracts from itthis is a benchmark war film which i have seen probably more than a dozen times i have the dday commemorative version steven spielberg really scooped the attention when it was released and the opening scenes good god to have run through an unending hail of bullets and mortar shells pinned down on a narrow strip of beach nowhere to turn death everywhere what to do feel free to view the documentary world at war where they discuss the invasion in the episode morning what happened when the situation came to light with the commanders on board the battleships off shore that had escorted the troop carriers after viewing with binoculars and hearing the radio reports these commanders totally against standing orders took it upon themselves to move in closer within range of the german batteries and start dishing out some ordnance to the same german defenders in order to relieve the situation of the troops pinned downyou got that they put themselves in harms way to help out their comrades on the beachthis is the whole story line of the film self sacrifice towards a common goal the details of which are merely that filling in the canvasim just glad these men did such a good job 60 years ago that my generation didnt have to repeat it somewhere elseas far as this being american propaganda well feel free to write a script and produce your own work on the same topic the fact is omaha beach the 101st bitching about montys hesitancy and numerous miscalculations are all part of the widely known historytherefore the realism which i look for of this film as opposed to actual specific historical events is right off the scale i dont care if its a scifi comedy western or drama i have to see continuous plausibility in what im spending my time and money onthis film spr has that in abundance,reality
i got into this movie expecting a high budget unreal action adventure boy was i wrong as i watched the soldiers storm omaha beach i was amazed at how good the action was but as i continued to watch the action i started to realize that there was much more to it amidst all the chaos plain as day were the dying soldiers cries for their mothers the explosions full of severed limbs and torsos and the general chaos caused by the death and destruction and then it hit me this must be what the war was really like and it wasnt goodasides from the message of the movie the characters were amazing tom hanks adam goldberg matt damon i have to say that i think these are the best performances of their careers they were just so real i really felt for these guysso if you are looking for a movie full of the ra ta tas of machine guns high budget explosions and plenty of action this movie is for you but if you are not ready to experience war like it really is then maybe you should pick a different dvd at the rental store but if your minds and your stomachs are ready for this film then brace yourself for the best movie of all time,reality
you know many war movies try to get it right but completely fail great war movies only come around every so often such as platoon full metal jacket and apocalypse now however if you notice something all of the movies i just listed are all about vietnam those 3 movies have all been considered for greatest war movie of all time but we havent seen a great wwii movie in quite a while well the wait is over is also in the list and near the top as wellreinacting a battle like dday will almost always fail in cinema however steven spielberg gets it right and more also when you watch the battle scenes it makes any other war movie battle look completely lame i know that veterans say that if you havent seen real combat then you just havent and i do respect that it is true however when you talk about combat in the movies is as close as you can cometom hanks once again displaying his talent plays the roll of captain john h miller as if he was really in the military tom hanks is just one of those actors who can play all types of roles and play them amazingly seemingly without even tryingthere isnt much else to say about mostly because i just cant find any other words to describe its brilliancehas its rightful place in history as one of the greatest war films of all time,reality
its not easy to recreate something so horrid as warin facti dont think that anyone can totally recreate it with overwhelming successyou can get ideas from the people who were thereand that certainly gets the imagination goingbut no matter how bad you make it lookonly the those folks who were there have a cluethat being saidthe astounding recreation of the normandy invasion in this film is sure to make you ask questions as to how much worse it really could have beenit is an amazing piece of work and i admire the way that john williams musical score was saved for the battles aftermath rather than during the battle itselfall you heard during the battle was the sound of combatspielberg wanted to make sure to make the viewing experience of this historic battle was as real as possiblewell donei also enjoy this excellent story of how these eight men were sent out to risk it all so that one man could go home and salvage what was left of his mothers shattered heartits truly one of the most inspirational films i have ever seen,reality
is steven spielbergs brave attempt to redefine the conventional war film and specifically world war ii films more than that even its an attempt to explain the conflict itself to a generation that never knew it firsthand spielberg proceeds from the assumption that baby boomers are hardwired to doubt their countrys motives in any war and seems to be his way of saying there was at least one war the us fought where it was clearly and completely in the right whether he succeeded is something thats difficult to gauge in many ways is your standardissue combat flick albeit a very wellmade one some scenes would be almost interchangeable with those from any number of movies where gis trudge across europe and engage the germans at various points in heated battles but theres something else at work here that none of those earlier films put across in quite the same manner at times its almost intangible there is a feeling of the here and now about the film that we are really living and experiencing what the soldiers did nothing puts this across more vividly than the opening scene after a brief prologue in a presentday french cemetery the scene shifts to the bloodiest day of the war when the allies landed on the normandy beaches i think it is fair to say that there has never been a more realistic depiction of what the first few army units faced in those first awful hours the chaos the death the wholesale slaughter really of thousands of young men trying to gain a foothold on the beaches there i remember reading about an early screening of for ww2 veterans one was asked about this scene and the old man replied grimly and succinctly thats pretty much how it was though nothing in the rest of the film is quite as brutally graphic the scene sets the stage for what is to follow we are reminded that the vast majority of americans were not professional soldiers they were ordinary people lifted from ordinary jobs to fight in the most consequential armed conflict in their countrys history which makes their sacrifices and their courage that much more profound and poignant the story which can easily be seen as an allegory has to do with a group of four brothers all soldiers serving in the war and all have been killed in action except one the private of the title it is decided that this family has sacrificed more than its share and so a special army squad is dispatched to find and send him home tom hanks is perfectly cast as the everyman genericallynamed capt miller the schoolteacher turned combat soldier his dying words to private earn this earn it are the message he and spielberg hoped the following generation would take to heart again its hard to know whether or not that generation has,reality
if the people who pay to see movies were given the honor of picking the oscar winner for best picture for 1998 and best actor steven spielberg and tom hanks would have that converted prize above their fireplaces on this day in fact i will go even further and state that if their were an oscar for best picture of the decade which was into its eighth year would have that honor yes i watched again today and while its not exactly the experience i had when i saw it on the big screen it consumed me all the same and will continue to do so whenever i view it in the future thanks to steven spielberg and everyone else involved if i could i would present each and everyone of you a peoples oscar jim madden,reality
september 18 1998 the day i saw this movie throughout the yearsthere have been war movies that brought back horrendous memories to veterans who fought in war to movie buffs it showed how war can tear up an individual or showed why it was worth fighting for in steven spielbergs war drama it is not a division between whats good and bad but to show homage to those who fought in the biggest war of the 20th centurythe first 20 minutes of the prologue is one of the most gruesome battle scenes ive ever watched on screen we see the boats boarding up soldiers as they are heading to the murky beaches of normandy june 6 1942 which will be remember to most people as the worst battle in history tom hanks plays capt john miller who leads his squad in the terror battle and tries to find his team into the breach as hundreds of soldiers die as realistic as it is we see the carnage of soldiers getting ripped in pieces crying for their mothers and in one scene we see a man looking for his amputated armafter the grizzly attack on the beach miller has been ordered another mission a manhunt for the lost of one soldier after losing three of his brothers at normandy and throughout the film we get to see some of the most realistic battles since platoon where the violence and gore plays an important part of the realism but also get a chance to see to recognize the characters during the nonviolent parts which reminded audiences members of how these soldiers were like a familyis one of the best war flicks i have ever seen on the screen with a great all star cast from tom sizemore edward burns matt damon vin diseal barry pepper giovanni rebisi paul giamatti and more this is one of steven spielbergs greatest work ever made,reality
an interesting feature of steven spielberg probably the most reliable hit maker outside the michael bay realm of idiocy is that he often seems very clumsy with things that are the furthest away from the technical aspect of his films theres often a quality of naivet that simply would make the film more interesting and adult if it just was cuthas one such annoyance and that is a rather common one claiming a war as one sides story in private this would be the bookend scenes which serve no purpose to the story but to cram the supposed message down the viewers throat every country has had its wars it is insulting to millions to claim the story of human suffering in war is exclusive to one person one side or one war also schindlers list has similar scenes that begin and end the film although they are not as badwhile everything in private is technically as good as it will ever get the story and the characters seem out of place the only properly fleshed out characters are hanks mysterious captain and davies inexperienced clerk that obviously serves as the characters most people can relate to the rest of the characters arent that memorable if you think of them as personalities not ranks and tom sizemore plays a sergeant here the believability coming from the fact hes played the same role about a zillion times there are a few interesting cameos with ted danson and dennis farinathe story while a typical road movie with soldiers at least is not as standard as a retelling of a battle is nowhere near apocalypse now or other movies treating soldiers as passers by its near to a typical hollywood version of a war mission and something you could imagine john wayne doing this obviously was the purpose making an old fashioned war movie but it clashes with the realistic battle scenesthe battle scenes they simultaneously make battle look like something horrible something you want to be a part of and actually instantly create a bunch of clichs details such as the exaggerated sound of a m1 carbine running out of ammo a very common detail if you watch a ww2 movie made after this or even better  play a ww2 video game the scene in which someone is talking and suddenly is hit to the head the scene in which the viewer situated in the middle of the fighting cant hear anything because of shell shock whoainterestingly this movie proves the quote you cant make an antiwar movie and not make war look even more sexy in the endim not saying is a bad movie im just saying a lot of its flaws are glossed over thanks to the execution and respect to war veterans who i of course respect as well not depending of the side essentially a similar film with better characters similar technical awesomeness and fact instead of fairytale is the miniseries band of brothers another project from hanks and spielberg,reality

this movie starts with the most intense scenes of all time it just takes you there and makes you bite your tongue i cant imagine how nobody at least i dont remember have ever done before the updownwater thing spielberg did in the beginning it just blow me away with se sounds and the images really amazing and so simple that you cant understand how nobody else has got that before but i guess that is what makes spielberg such a great directorthe reality in this film is amazing you can feel the blood and the sweat and the screams you feel like fighting yourself but the realism isnt perfect the camera movements etc makes for a wonderfully looking and realistic film but the fighting scenes in the end come on the tiger tank was its time most deadly killing machine ever invented it was impenetrable how on earth you destroy that with a sticky bomb and how can you run freely around it it had mgs at almost every sideanyway that is a minor flaw because these little unrealistic things just build up the atmospherespielberg one of our times greatest director shows once again his only weakness sentimentality american banners everywhere no signs of uk canadian or any other countys soldiers that overly sentimental bs popped up to my eyes only a couple of times though so its not a real problemoverall the film is superb and keeps you at the edge of your seat from the beginning to the end the almost complete reality the characters nice moviethe last thing hankses character says left me thinking earn this that is the most terrible but also meaningfull thing a person can say before dying to a man he just saved,reality

being a history genius i have seen many war movies in my day but none have really put it all out there as this movie did steven speidberg didnt hold anything back in this movie especially in the beginning scenes into the breach this movie was made as a testament to the greatest generation that ever lived and to the greatest army unit that ever lived the 1st army rangers to believe these men climbed up 100ft cliffs with mg42 machine gun fire pouring down on them and all the time all the germans had to do was roll boulders down on theme and cut their lines but they still made it up the cliffs to destroy the mg nests no other movie shows so many bullets flying around and so much constant action going all around you in all angles from people trying to find there very own body parts from the many that are lying around from other men just the beginning 40 minutes of this movie will give you all you can really handle because your thinking how many gis can possibly survive just the invasion of the beaches not only that but you feel so helpless for the gis because if they dont take the beach they are in a world of s because there is no where to retreat to in this moment in history the world came to suspenseful pause to watch which superpower was going to be the big boy on the block wethere it was germanys fascism or americas democracy i am just tallking about the first 40 minutes now its your job to see the whole movie trust me you will not be disappointed i personally see this movie minimally once every 34 weeks and yes that bayonet seen with pvt mellish is heartbreaking the drama is classic as you see mellish breath slower and slower as that bayonet slides further and further into his heart and then he twitches less and less and all the while his scared bastard comrade upham is hiding shi his pants off man what a thrill ride this movie is it is said to make grown men slightly break a tear and for all you real ww2 fans go and invest in medal of honor airborne it looks like the next generation in ww2 combat the realism and the graphics are unmatched,reality

reading several of the negative comments about this film i concluded that they could be grouped into a handful of categories the pedantic the america haters and those who find innate fault with the spielbergian tendency to manipulate the audience for those in the spielberg hating camp i would ask what do you expect audience manipulation is every bit a hallmark of a spielberg film as a sappy ending is to a capra film or existential jewish angst is to an allen filmas for the other two categories it doesnt pretend to be an historically accurate film it is a dramatization for the people that feel that spielberg depicts the americans as purely good or the germans as purely evil i would ask you to go back to two scenes one where gis summarily execute a surrendering german and second the look of compassion in the eyes of the german sniper when the gi he has just shot is trying to hand off a letter to his familythat said i would focus on the technical aspects of the film the initial scene of the invasion looks just like first hand accounts of the omaha beach invasion i have read veterans of the landing who have seen the film have attested to the authentic look and feel of the film perhaps what i find most striking is spielbergs use of old style cameras and film stock that give the movie an old newsreel type flavori wont argue with anyone who accuses the actual mission as being unrealistici would say that the mission itself is secondary to the storytelling art it takes little vignettes assembled from stories i have heard over and over from ww2 vets and tells them succinctlyhanks character suffers from ptsd known then as battle fatigue  vin diesels character was the guy who forgot for one second to keep his head down and it cost him the interpreter overcomes his initial cowardice after it costs his buddys life overcome with emotion another character wants to summarily execute an unarmed german but is talked out of it two opposing soldiers who have lost their arms attack each other hand to hand all of these stories are archetypal and universal among veterans who survived the warthese characters represent the amalgam of experience of all combat soldiers similar to platoon its unrealistic to believe that one small group of soldiers experienced them all but as a dramatization the story is excellently filmed and told,reality
ok im going to spit this review so here we gochanging the camera to make the picture more grainy is awesome something that works real well its a great cast mixed with fantastic locations is it real is it fake you cant tell if you got surround sound switch it on to here em yell the quality and realism is so good you can almost smell although its occasional lack of polish is where it fellit can be watched and watched and watched some more its a great sensation making you want moreits historical content is all intact and the talent of the actors this film dont hold backdont avoid it thinking oh its another spielberg fiasco jus watch it and afterwards all you can say is oh because its amazing gripping true and tense oh man does this film makes a whole lot of sensejt take another hit,reality
is a magnificent beautiful film it stars tom hanks as john miller a soldier who is hired to take his team to find private a fellow soldier whos three brothers have died in combat they are told to find him and bring him back even though it is unlikely that he is still alivewas an amazing movie that shows the true teamwork and brotherhood between soldiers in a war it also has some brilliant acting performances by tom hanks tom sizemore vin diesel and matt damon this movie somehow manages to have gross and disgusting action sequences but at the same time it is very touching and movingi would highly recommend this movie to anyone910,reality
the first 30 minutes of this movie are perhaps the most compelling 30 minutes of cinema ever filmedthe chaos of war the moral decisions made and not made the bravery of those under fire on both sides all is hereas the plot continues you see more moral ambiguity and more moral certainty war is hell and that is clearly seen heretom hanks gives his best performance just ahead of philadelphia and all of the featured players perform more than admirablyi do need to give a shoutout to the translator he is the one in this piece who i can most closely identify with an intellectual forced by his own convictions to join the war effort but struggling with the realities of the war i fully understand his fear and his strength,reality

simply put this movie was a work of pure genius it is by far the best work of steven spielberg and one of the best film works in general from the historical accuracy to the amazing acting jobs even from those people who came into the project as nobodies to the brilliant filming style this movie has all the areas covered although through some of the battle scenes there are areas of excessive gore the fights are well done and extensive enough to give everyone a thrillthis movie gives the viewers a perfect window into what it was like to be in that squad or to be in the military in general during that period of the fighting in depth description of john miller the attitude and mannerisms of melish the emotions of loss and despair and all of these other elements compiled and created the perfect opportunity for someone to witness those events to be in that place at that time and gave the chance for veterans or those affiliated with the war a chance to reflectwas is and always will be one of the greatest movies ever made naysayers may site a shaky documentary filming style as a bad reason but this adds to the window into these soldiers adventure they may say that it contains a very clich plot line which may be true to some degree but the film makers actors and writers alike gave it an unforgettable element that made it captivating these are a few things among many negative accusations made but let me assure you that they are dead wrong dead wrong this movie is not deserving of the title of one of the best war movies it deserves the best war movie is a work of genius a mustsee and a musthavemcairellps questions comments anything email  theoneeggygmailcom,reality
the american army are about to land at the omaha beach in france the moment they land its a blood soaked fight to take the beach in this fight is captain miller and his troop of men after the omaha assault miller is given a mission to find a man and take him out from behind enemy lines the man is private jamess brothers have been killed in action and to bereave his mother the american army want him homes location is unknown as his paratroop were miss dropped miller and his troop now have to go behind enemy lines to find that is if hes still aliveis an outstanding war drama from master director steven spielberg the opening beach scene is so brutally violent and harshly real yet it honestly conveys the horror of the war this was the first movie i saw that violent but accurately portrayed the violent nature of war and the emotions of the soldiers you are placed right into the battle with people being dismembered and shot apart the final fight at the bridge crossing is the most intense battle of the film it doesnt have the sheer unrelenting violence of the opening battle but it is so emotionally chargedthough the violence is confronting but there is so much drama and character depth behind the violence all the people of millers troop are three dimensional you can emotionally attach to them they all are bonded too you can see their comradeship between them there is also that naivety to them they will follow their captain not just on orders but they trust him without question captain miller has so much depth to him you dont find a lot about him yet you can tell there is much anguish and longing to leave in his facespielberg has taken a more head first look into the second world war shinders list was about the men behind the scenes and the politics while in we are taken to the view of the soldier spielbergs direction is flawless getting you right into the battle and evoking so much emotion from all the actors the acting is also flawless tom hanks gives one the his best performances ever he was brilliant tom sizemore edward burns barry pepper vin diesel giovanni ribisi adam goldberg and jeremy davies all bring great performances as the mix matched group of people their friendship for all of them was so believable matt damon though only appearing towards the end as private does a great job alsois one of the best war movies ever made it is a masterpiece of cinema,reality
what steven spielberg has done with is simultaneously craft an enormously successful depiction of world war ii and a touching story that places a platoon of bewildered soldiers in a world of frantic pacing  a startling world of gunfire and proceeding death the constant movement of the shaky handheld camera acts as a first person perspective  we are not merely viewing the movie but participating in it this is perhaps as close as we will ever get to realizing the unadulterated fear those soldiers must have felt as they drew nearer to the beaches of france it is one of the greatest war films ever put on celluloid its scope arguably larger than any other in the genre its conflict superb,reality
during the second world war a selected group of us soldiers is sent to bring back a comrade who is stationed behind enemy lines this mans brothers have been slaughtered on dday and he is being sent back homethe plot is noticeably silly in war especially this war high ranking officers would not send a squadron out to retrieve one man who holds no vital information about the enemy nor would they send squadrons out to retrieve men whose blood has been slaughteredbut it is not the plot that drives a person to see a movie of deeply realistic and harrowing violence a person watches this movie to go back in time many people thankfully will never have to fight in wars and therefore would never know the true meaning of terroris said to have been the most accurate war picture ever to be created watching it is almost as close as fighting a real war you are with the countless men who are destroyed when the us storm the beaches of normandy you sit through all of the personal conflict among soldiers you witness the emotions change and tempers flare and most of all you experience a time warpa movie crafted this well is a true gift a piece of entertainment that is so well done that it makes us forget that we are sitting at home watching a movie with hollywood actors this film will become your world as terrifying and depressing as it is it will become your world,reality
is a great wwii movie it was one of the first movies in an evergrowing ultrarealistic wwii accounts being an avid wwii history buff spr gives me an insight into what it was like to be on the beach at normandy hanks and spielberg really show their concern for detail in spr and their later work band of brothers i would have given the movie a 10 if is wasnt for the poor performance of matt damon damon comes off as a whiny little snot nose the director should have caught this and worked it out as it is very distracting some people especially of late have said this film is too graphic to show on tv however i really feel this is a film that does not make gratuitous sorry for the spelling use of graphic images that is what it looked like and it should be shown like that every network shows the warning before they air the movie and so we should all be smart enough that if its too much flip the channel dont complain that it was too graphic when you were warned a movie as realistic as this is going to be graphic which adds to the impact it makes watch this movie youll enjoy it,reality
that and fubar fucked up beyond all repair are two great lines from this movie the writing is both believable and nowhere near approaching any worry of clichs polluting the movie the direction is superb probably what started out the usage of handheld cameras which have now been way overused in movies since then steven spielberg really brought his agame to this one jeremy davies as corporal upham was good in this movie as he was able to portray cowardice in a war movie which people rarely do and did it very well giovanni ribisi as t4 medic wade almost stole the show when he talks about how his mother would come home early just to see him and he would pretend to be asleep this ties in to something later on vin diesel as private caparzo seemed very much like a weaklink only there to get killed ok performance but nothing really to write home about adam goldberg as private mellish who ive only really seen otherwise in friends as chandlers roommate eddie didnt really expect he would be all that good but he put in a great performance as the jewish soldier and when he gets stabbed later on in the movie heartstrings are pulled barry pepper as private jackson has worked with tom hanks in both and the magnificent the green mile and in both of those movies he has held his own against the star tom hanks and that is good work best when he goes to shoot someone with a rifle and says a couple of prayers edward burns as private reiben isnt that bad he does well and was touted as the next big thing but hasnt fulfilled it yet tom sizemore as sergeant horvath is extremely good definitely became a fan after this movie both thumbs up matt damon as private is the macguffin of the movie and actually has a small part in the movie less than an hour and becomes just as much a part of this movie as the others and the star of the movietom hanks as captain miller does a magnificent job leading his men as they attempt to rescue a guy that they know nothing about that is thought of as just another number until tells miller about the last night he and his brothers were together and became another human that should explain the ending,reality
steven spielberg made his second historical visit to the time of world war ii following up from his acclaimed schindlers list with this tale of a group of american soldiers assigned to find private the sole survivor of a family of brothers killed in the warthe group assigned to find him are worldweary captain miller tom hanks his righthand man sergeant hovarth tom sizemore sniper private jackson barry pepper wiseguy jew mellish adam goldberg and translater corporal upham jeremy davies a bookish sort whos never been in battlethis ensemble is played by a gallery of seasoned natural actors tom hanks gives probably his most subtle performance as the besieged miller capturing the dizzy tiredness of a man whos sick of fighting sizemore is fine as horvarth and pepper goldberg and davies are good in their various roles giving their stock characters a distinctiveness and humanity matt damon is given the pivotal role of private and plays him in much the same way as he played will hunting a petulant obnoxious moron who does not engender much sympathythe story especially with reference to recent world events feels like a us propaganda tool watching it especially if youre uninformed of history youd think the americans were the only ones fighting the nazis other allied groups the british the french and the russians are never seen or referred to any waywhere the film really succeeds is in its portrayal of wartime battle surely the most realistic depiction committed to film the film is shot in harsh realistic tones with a lot of grey and brown the grime blood and gore of combat is far from overlookedthe opening attack on omaha beach is excellent and you can feel the frantic fearful adrenaline of the soldiers as they rush into the line of fire and are randomly picked off onebyone the germans who surrender in eventual defeat are randomly shot dead the concluding battle to defend the bridge is even better as the characters weve come to know over two hours are decimated or worse than that changed by their ordeals however it is not the guns and bomb battles that really convey the wasteful nature of war it is the handtohand combat scene mellish has with a german soldier while upham cowers on stairs the german gets the upper hand and slowly forces mellishs knife into his stomach gently rocking him to sleep as he does so this is what it ultimately boils down to the savage nature of fighting and possessing or losing the will to remain on your feet and stay alive it is this reality encapsulated in that scene that the film captures so very wellit will not stand up as a historical document few war movies do but in bringing the realities of wartime battle home to a mass audience is a mustsee,reality
before i begin my praise let me just say that my grandfather served during ww2 82nd airborne my father served during vietnam and i myself was in basic when the crap hit the fan in iraq the first time around to be honest when i first saw the trailer for this film i had thought it was just some average hollywood vehicle for matt damon and did not bother to see it in the movies boy was i wrong like the godfather goodfellas and jfk i cant help but watch this film each and every time it comes on cable i never get sick of it just the invasion of normandy beach scene is worth the 3 rental charge bataan was good patton excellent but this has to be the best ww2 picture to date probably as close to realism as a movie can get  meaning when troops get shot they just dont fall down ala windtalkers  heads are blown off body parts are everywhere and blood pours down like rain it is always good to see a film of this quality come around every once in awhile to remind us not to forget those who have given their lives so that we could live ours now i know why my parents always taught me to respect my eldersi also recommend band of brothers which was inspired by this film and also brilliantly done,reality
has to be one of the best war movies ever made but it is definitely the most realistic the opening battle is considered to be the most realistic war scenes ever caught on film the fear and tension of the dday invasion is so frighteningly realistic in saving privatedespite the graphic and gruelingly intense violence most kids older than 10 should see this to get an idea of what war veterans have had to fight through steven spielberg once again proves he is capable of awesome directing skills through saving privateunfortunately i missed this when it was out in the theaters but the great cinematography and direction must have been awesome to experience on the silver screen i hope there will be a tenth anniversary showing of this in theaters everywhere although the running time is a bit long is well worth seeing every shot and camera angle is brilliance see this movie on the biggest screen possible with the best surround sound possible and youll feel as though youre actually there,reality
its a buddy movie id love to get on my soapbox and quote henry v at you all day long but the bottom line is this movie is all about buddies i am not interested in molecularly accurate historical fact so i wasnt bombed out by some small insignificant detail instead i chose to feel how these men these ordinary men felt and how they treated each other i griped a bit about the lack of backstories about some of the men like reiben or jackson but then i realized that they were just like you and me we all know the story of you and me and the story moves confidently because of that without being bogged down by too many flashbacks to an earlier life that would have hurt the pacingthe cinematography is really good because you get closeups on their faces a lot of the time and other closeups on important things like hands and bleeding corpses and so on unlike we were soldiers which suffered from too many wide shots as a result you get to see every little crook in their expressions and every facial tic so you feel for them much more focusing on tom hanks hands was one of the most wellchosen shots ever because it showed the vulnerability of the man without too much exposition or violenceadditionally let me say that all the actors put in their best performances for this movie while matt damon was a little stiff the rest were oscar gold as they grimaced and swore through the movie and there was never the politically correct feeling that crippled other war movies id like to highlight three awesome actors who deserve to be paid in nothing but solid academy gold medic wade played by giovanni vonnie ribisi corporal upham played by jeremy davies and of course the lead actor himself tom hanks in the role of john miller all three delivered powerful in uphams case powerfully pathetic performances and the final scene you truly get to see the groundbreaking ability of tom hanks ribisi is notable because of one particular conversation that if handled by a lesser actor would be merely melodramaticone minor quibble is the beginning and ending scenes which were completely out of step with the buddy buddy feeling that permeated this movie while the resolution does tie up all the loose ends it just makes it soflat but its a minor quibble nonethelessthe plot itself is paced well the actors are brilliant the script is sharp and honest the gore is substantiated and not overdone so whats stopping you from watching this movie,reality
the 3 points i gave this movie are all for the landing at the beach the movie itself was just the usual hollywood nonsense that thanks to big names like spielberg hanks and damon and big advertisement was successful i admit the acting was good but it still doesnt give this movie any importance,reality
dont get me wrong the first 20 minutes of the film were both visuallyspoilers withinstunning and physically sickening if i had ever held any foolish notions of the supposed bravado and glory of war they quickly evaporated in a hail of gunfire blood brains and severed limbs this short section of the film with its cinema verite like hand held camera and grainy newsreelesque cinematography is evidence of the calibre no pun intended of filmmaker that spielberg could bethe rest of the film god knows how long it is seems to be spielbergs valiant attempt to ruin the effect of the first sequence mothers cry villains are smoten good guys manage to fit in a final heartfelt sentence or two before they croak and tom hanks manages to keep the same deadpan thisisthedemurefaceigetpaid20millionamoviefor expression on his face throughout the whole film and as if to rub salt in the wound there is the final disgracefully jingoistic image of the film you know the one im talking abouti wouldnt be so outraged at this pro american bigbudget moneymaker if it didnt pretend to be an antiwar masterpiece,reality
while the first twenty minutes or for you pedantic moviegoers out there who are going to jump on me for being six minutes off in my assessment the length of the first scene of this movie is a brilliant chaotic and harrowing battle scene there is nothing else in the movie that even comes close its poignance the rest of the movie follows in the footsteps of every other trite spielberg drama i think that people are too afraid of besmirching the face of any movie that deals with wwii to be honest about films such as this the subject matter does not make the art it american audiences are unable to make such a distinction,reality
this was the most disappointing war movie ive ever seen  granted the first 20 minutes shocks you and the violence seems very real  however its all down hill from there  the whole thing just turns into a load of american flag waving rubbish if you want a real war movie watch the thin red line and leave this one on the shelf,reality
dwelling on the past and its horrors wont make the horrors of today go away why is it that if movies like this really show that war is horror people still go to war this movie still promotes shallow minded heroism taunting the shallow minded to make a hero of themselvesbut now i gives too much creditthem portrayal of the characters doesnt help you connect with them or their situation all the macho bullst that weve seen i hundreds of war movies is so tiring the character are shallow as are the points made by the movie if any,reality
this movie begins and ends in a very lame fashion old people american flags and shonky acting features heavily gratuitousthe subsequent half an hour the landing scene by itself would have made a better movie what is the message this movie is trying to convey that war is hell if so then extend the landing scene to an hour finish the movie there and preven the hellish aspect spilling over into cinematic experiencethe rest is just boring attempts at moralising cliched moments and other embarrassing moments that just diminish the impact of the opening battle scene until it becomes a distant memory and you find yourself watching yet another formulaic war movie,reality
this is another movie in the long list of overrated movies here in imdb you know war has always been a favorite subject for movies because it generates intense emotions these emotions are there de facto just imagine a seriously wounded soldier screaming covered in blood surrounded by fellow soldiers with pain on their faces you see it cant be too difficult to generate emotions when the subject is war and so does this movie but not in any particularly original way the most serious problem of this movie is its storyline which you know from start to end if you read the following sentence a soldier has lost his 3 brothers in the war and so we must find him and save him to soothe his poor mother thats all folks the rest is the typical adventures you would expect from a war movie the same predictable results the occasional conflict between members of the rescue team and so on we have seen all of this and much better the only reason this movie will get a 6 out of 10 is the very good as usual tom hanks all in all a great movie to see if you want to forget it in the next 10 minutes after the end,reality
poor old mister speilberg he was so upset when he did not win the oscar for this movie well if he stop shoving the american way down everybodys neck then maybe he would have done better those flag waving scenes at the start and end were some of the worst bits of judgment when it came to directing that i have seen for many years next time he should watch the thin red line to see how not to be all happy about the cruelty of war he seems to think that just he stuck a graffic scene in near the start then it was a true and honest account of war get real  if he had just let go of the emotional cord it could have been so good,reality
i dont think i want to ever watch this movie again i wept and wept and wept when i saw it in theatre i dont think i can take it all in again too emotional too real giovanni ribisi and barry pepper are the best littleknown actors around because i really thought they were their characters as i watched them on screen mr spielberg is a master of his domain pardon the cheese and tom is simply amazing i know its very manipulative but i didnt mind it touched me in ways that very few other films did schindlers list was another its quite difficult to rate this film simply because it was as much a documentary as it was a film excellent work regardless,reality

i gave it a vote as high as 3 merely because i believe that on technical merits alone it was quite good  however as far as its entertainment value it had none whatsoever for me  i found that i could not see past the violence and gore  it therefore as far as i was concerned had no plot no character development no nothing  many will disagree with those statements but note that its not that the script was without those things or even that the actors necessarily did a bad job but simply that the violence was just too strongly presenti remember hearing that the director wanted this to be a movie that would show how war really was  well ive never been in a war nor do i have any desire to fight  if this movie gave me the feeling of being in a war than if i am ever in one i will become a mindless drone  i will be almost completely without emotion my biggest feeling will be one of disgust i do not feel though that this movie has made me feel any differently about war  i still think its a horrible thing the movies that have made me feel more strongly in that direction are those that have drawn me in to the characters lives and then ripped those lives apart  just a few such examples are platoon and schindlers list on the serious side and just as potently good morning vietnam and life is beautiful on the comedy side,reality
ive seen lots of war movies in my 32 years of life but this one is by far the only one that really really affected me emotionally  watching this movie in the theatre i had knots in my stomach  the emotional impact of the film is something i had never experienced in such intensity  the visuals were absolutely the best music while sometimes too melodramatic was first rate and the acting was mostly excellent  i will admit that the movie did drag somewhat in the middle stages but im glad it did because i needed the breakmany people here have said that this movie was not an antiwar movie  far from the truth  spielberg has shown what war really is form a soldiers point of view witrh some creative liberties thrown in to be sure  he shows us war for what it isbloody ugly violent in the extreme and most of the time has us wondering why  if anyone wants to rush off to war after seeing this film you have some issues to deal with  and is there something wrong with spielberg showing soldiers as heroes  i didnt see that very much anyway especially at the beginningi saw goodguy soldiers shooting surrendered germansnot very heroic but most likely true  in my opinion every single person of that generation that went over there was a hero ugly consequences asideand to the european crowd who cry about how ther were other nationalities that sacrificed and bled just as much as the noble americans didwe know that  thats why they called it world war 2  this movie however focused on omaha beachthe most heavily defended beach of dday  americans were there and they were slaughtered by the hundreds  the brits were over on another beach gold with very little resistance not the kind that the americans experienced at omaha in comparison  this is not to take away the valiant sacrifices of your boys but to put this mudslinging in context here  if you want a movie made about your sacrifices specifically then make one  but dont take away the fact that it was predominatly americans who bled and bled hard at omaha  the us flag waving at the beginning and end  whats the big deal  was an american soldier in the 101st airbornewhat the heck else was spielgberg supposed to show  the union jackat any rate this movie should be ranked as one of the greatest war movies of this century  if you havent seen it you should  world war 2 is not all old blackandwhite combat footage you see in documentaries  its sacrifice death struggling and heroics and rolled into one and chances are there is someone in your family who was over there,reality
oh hollywood  wherefore art thy head hollywood  could it be up thy assthe american public are suckers for movies with cool special effects and bitchin surround sound  we love for the same reason we love the fourth of july  when i first saw the movie however it was blasting from my larger than life 19 inch sanyo television set  it was less than spectaculari have to admit the first few minutes were disturbingly reallooking and the buzz is that they are as close a depiction of the events of dday as we may ever realize on film  for that i give the film the weight of my praise without it i would have voted 2 instead of a 4  however once the nightmarish slaughter was over and the film attempted to transform itself from megabudgeted explosion rally into something resembling a watchable war epic it flounders and flails pathetically begging to be recognizedlook weve got tom hanks and matt damon it pouts as if we didnt already know this the film tries to tell us war is terrible  as the story progresses it seems to whine about iteditors note possible spoilers aheadattempts at points to explore the eccentricities of war some examples the guy at the beginning of the movie who is nailed in the head and saved by his helmet takes off the helmet in wonderment and is immediately killed by another shot to the head  the virgintocombat interpreter intellectual who begs for the life of the german prisoner citing the rules of war is the one who is ultimately responsible for most of their deaths  as a recurring theme the characters wonder why they sould risk the lives of their squadron to search for a man who is probably dead to these i say please contrive your metaphors and heavyhanded imagery a little more mr spielberg  maybe then i wont have to think at all during your movies  maybe youll attain a level of patronizing that will remove the need for audiences to realize their own feelings  perhaps have someone stand at the front of the theatre with cue cards displaying the emotion you want the audience to experience in each scene the problem with taking speilberg seriously about anything is of course his stickysweeet sentimentality  think et  think cocoon  think the old folks home skit in twilight zone the movie  the only place it has worked well is schindlers list when taking a moment outside himself spielberg created a powerful and moving drama  i think this is largely due to liam neesons solid performance i guarantee anyone with a developed sense of irony and individuality will after seeing this movie on the small screen take their accolades down a notch and stop praising speilberg for being someone he isnt  frank capra,reality
after the first 20 minutes or so of incredibly gutwrenching special effects becomes a rather simple and simpleminded war movie with a cliched plot and cardboard characters while tom hanks and the other actors do a reasonable job there really isnt much meat for them to chew on actingwiseafter leaving the theater my initial impression was wow what a great movie but 20 minutes later i realized that i was basing my opinion on the spectacular opening act which really presented a realistic view of a large scale offensivebut thats about all the movie has going for it the first act leaves the audience stunned and spielberg uses the diversion to traipse through the rest of the movie with nary a thought of actually doing anything remotely original or interesting at the end i really didnt care if was saved or not,reality
this century has seen two world wars and this is the time when all of us should say we dont want any more this movie will make us think about the brutal side of war spielberg has done an absolutely perfect job this movie is the masterpiece of spielberg probably the most significant movie of this century,reality
i saw private last week for the second time i thought that the first 25 minutes would not be so impressive as the first time but i was wrong even for the second time i was amazed by the scene of the soldiers landing in normandie i think that it is the most horrific scene i ever saw especially considering the fact that it all really happened i think that the first half hour off this movie gives the best impression of how it must have been in 1944 the sound effects are just magnificent and i think it should have won the oscar for best movie,reality

this movie is one of the best war movies of all time the first 15 minutes are very shocking and there is a lot of blood but its one of the best part of it the directing was excellentspielberg couldnt do betterespecially at the 15 first minutes the story is quite good and shows you all the misery of the second world war the actor were fantasticespecially tom hanks and matt damonafter watching this movie you will feel very lucky if you didnt go war one daywatch it its a beautifull movie,reality
this film has a very deep and personal meaning for me  my dad was a wwii combat veteran after seeing this film i looked at my dads army photo and metals hanging on our living room wall and i thanked my dad for fighting for our freedom then i cried my eyes outthis is the best and most realistic war film i have ever seen ranking above platoon and glory stephen spielberg really deserved his best director oscar because of the great camera angles during the intense omaha beach scene terrific performances all aroundthank you mr spielberg for a powerful film that makes us feel even more thankful for the veterans on this memorial day,reality
the first 30 minutes at omaha beach is absolutely a knockout  incredible realistic scenes masterpiece direction by spielberg but the rest of the movie is just like any spielberg film  old stuff with a new feeling we saw that kind of story a thousand times attack 1956 red badge of courage 1951 walk in the sun 1946 all quiet on the western front 1930 theres also a 1919 universal war movie heart of humanity telling the story of a mother who lost all his sons in world war i except one but the omaha beach is absolutely amazing the rest is just hollywood entertainment,reality
this is one of the most affective movies ive ever seen and it will probably be a classic because of its realism great movie,reality
put together the greatest actor of his generation  tom hanks and the greatest director of his era  steven spielberg and you will get a great movie this is probably the greatest war movie ever made the opening sequence of the omaha beach landing sets the tone for the entire film hanks brings great brevity to his role it seems custom made for him great cinematography and a wonderful support cast make for a very absorbing movie,reality
was one of the best movies i have ever witnessed in my life  i dont recommend children seeing this movie though because it is also the bloodiest movie i have ever seen  i feel should have one the best picture oscar at the academy awards  it was an outstanding film,reality
i was physically sickened when i witnessed the outcome of the oscars this evening when steven spielberg won best director honors i was immensely pleased i thought that the best film of 1998 and the best war film ever would surely take best picture honors however when harrison ford announced that shakespeare in love was best picture i was on the verge of vomiting while shakespeare in love may have been a decent film it was resoundingly light fluffy fare that didnt deserve to win best actress that should have gone to cate blanchett nor best picturenow that ive put shakespeare in love down enough not entirely enough but as much as possible right now i want to write about the virtues of when i first saw this movie i was amazed at every single element nothing was flawed in this film the sound was amazing as was the cinematography the editing the screenplay the incredibly subdued performance of tom hanks and the tremendous supporting cast with the bookends of the two extraordinary battles and the framing sequences that mean say so very much about the meaning and loss in war with so few words was obviously both the best film of 1998 and the best film about war ever filmed because of this it will be remembered long after shakespeare in love goes the way of tom jones the life of emile zola and all of those other forgettable best pictures that have come before steven spielberg did a great service to wwii veterans and the moviegoing public with this film and i hope that its remembered for much longer than the light meaningless shakespeare in love,reality
i cant believe that this movie is number 5 in the all time list as voted by nearly 7000 people in this registeryou are all mad  this movie will basically be forgotten in 6 months time sure if you think that a detached arm quivering on the dday beaches is great cinema then i suppose you may like think this movie good  otherwise think about it what is the story  not much of one realistic i suppose but nothing that full metal jacket apocalypse now and a host of others dont have this is just another one of those attempted groundbreakers which will be copied by everyone  believe me shortly people will be saying saving private who  if you want to have quivering body parts and open wounds watch any of a host of horror movies from about the 1950s on tom hanks for an oscar  you have to be kidding  forrest gump was a better role  the man has next to no personality in this role and his portrayal doesnt help,reality
i may be going against the grain here but if you havent seen it yet then let me give you some advice dontit is a really well made movie the storyline the actors the effects the music all are excellent the highest quality if this movie doesnt win a clutch of oscars then there is something seriously wrong with hollywoodso after all of this why would i recommend not going to see it because i think that this movie is the most psychologically disturbing and shocking movie i have ever seen in my life on this planet i read the revues about the realism of the war scenes and thought what the hell it cant be any worse than platoon or full metal jacket ill give it a try bad lapse of judgementthe movie is three hours long and after maybe the first ten minutes i wanted to leave but the thought was that sooner or later this assault on the senses must letup you wait and you wait and you wait and it doesnt the realism the emotions the atmosphere of war are all there for the three full hours even in the quiet i cant use the word peaceful moments of the movie there are still the oppressive feelings of the expectation that this certainly can not last and it doesnt these moments are played to the best effects of the greatest suspense moviesmy friend and i left the cinema after the final credits we couldnt say anythingi dont know whether to think of mr spielberg as the greatest movie maker on the face of this planet or the most irresponsible manufacturer of shock horror movies ever but this is really not the correct way to put it because shocking it was without a shadow of a doubt but horror it most definitely was not if you watched all of the news or documentaries that were ever made about the scenes and effects of war it would not be one percent of the preparation required to watch this movieanyone who sees this movie can not fail to be affected by it consequently i tend to ere on the side of mr spielberg being a little irresponsible war is a fact of human life we can never escape some peoples urge to kill each other but why show it so graphically on the large screen at some point in the future although i hope it never happens some of our offspring will have to goout and fight a war for us why do we have to be shown what they will faceas you can see i was just a tad affected by this film but what can i say mr spielberg has outdone mr cameron yet again although my feeling is that this movie will not get the recognition of titanic for three reasons there is no love story there is no dicaprio or winslet and america does not come out of this movie with the flag of rationality and reason flying high more like at half mast with no breeze,reality
this movie is a disappointment in comparison to steven spielbergs previous films it just did not have the magic of movies like shawshank redemption or schindlers list i think people are just so used to commending him that they are unable to realize that this isnt as stirring as some of his other great accomplishments people need to start thinking for themselves instead of letting others think for them,reality
when i read the first ten comments i was shocked how easily the audience accepts everything it gets served by names like spielberg the only positive exception i saw is mark welchwhen i saw the first 40 minutes i was really surprised how realistic spielbergs pictures and the plot were after they took the beach he produced just another one of those average let 10 americans beat the german army movieswhy did it have to be a setup like that it was not just 200 infantrists  10 tanks vs 20 gis of course none was black but the waffenss the german elite troops which had quite some fighting experience from russia it was the same plot than hundreds before let the idiots take the main road we attack from the sideswhat would have happened  the church tower would have been blown up before any germans would have entered the town as snipers are not that new  a small group of german soldiers would have checked the town  so i probably saw 2 movies on the same day the best and the worst war movie of the year it doesnt surprise me that the good part was just a visually great setup of a fixed plot whereas when spielberg was writing the story it turned out to be worst rubbish if you want to see a good war movie take full metal jacket or platoon,reality
i feel that the one thing that characterised this show more than anything else for myself was the total lack of sensationalism in the movie so little of the show seemed contrived but it just simply feels like the way it was like too many movies today appear to demonstrate violence and carnage for its sake but they invariably never made me feel for it the way that spr didsome comments indicate that spr is nationalistic for me it wasnt and im an asian after watching the show i felt saddened for the sheer numbers of lives wasted and the hundreds of thousands of young soldiers of all nationalities not just americans for their tremendous sacrifice in the carnage the leaders of the antagonistic nations be dammed but it was the common soldier who had to die senselessly,reality
yes the opening sequence is breathtaking  once its over with though the movie is a tired rehash of every ww ii movie cliche  it also features perhaps the most dreadful score of john williams career,reality
after having to watch it makes one to sit down quietly and think about the lifestyle we are enjoying right now this show is very emotional in some scenes where those soldiers have sacrificed their lives in order to win the war as well as saving a private this movie shows how terrible it is to have a war breaking out and having lose loved ones during war time lets hope that this is the last war,reality
as a surgeon that treats wounded soldiers i was shocked to see the concealed parts of my professional life totally exposed to the unsuspecting individual this movie is indeed a landmark that exposes the true side of the romantic wars that have been part of our cultural upbringing for decades shattering the notion that war is an exciting adventure it is not  soldiers are usually 1820 year old boys that get ripped apart by metal objects that kill maim and cause terrible pain and anguish to their families even though this movie had its hollywood side it succeeded in conveying the true nature of warfare  killing in every conceivable way the ghastly scenes of spilled guts and blown off limbs are accurate to a point that brings back vivid memories to those that treat wounded soldiers i sincerely hope that this very explicit movie will cause people to understand the true horrors of war as marlon brando uttered in apocalypse now the horror the horror,reality
if you dont like typical american movies playing cheaply with human emotions go and spend your well earned money elsewhereor leave the theatre after the rangers have captured the beachhead because that is the only original input steven spielberg has made with his overrated maybe your local theatre is showing an old wwii classic ,reality
its the best war movie about americans in ww ii i agree but somehow everybody seems to forget the americans werent the only ones there good thing if you see what kind of stupid decisions even a captain can make  the radarpost great directing good acting mediocre plot mediocre dialogue an ending that makes any sane person sick lots of sentimental conversations that dont add anything to the storyline truly patriotic truly american truly hollywood,reality
one of the best war films ever made is raw and shocking not only because of the gore scenes but also because of the camerawork using a steadycam combined with the absence of music soundtrack during the breathtaking battle scenes gives a realistic and natural feel to the film war films are hardly an opportunity for actors to showcase their talent as more focus is set on the viewers visual pleasure but in this film time is taken to describe many of the charactersgenerally is almost excellent and highly recommendedmy only objections are as regards the choice of hanks for the main role a role more suitable to clooney or crowe if you ask me and damons teeth its remarkable that a soldier thats been through hell for a long period of time could easily be the protagonist in a toothpaste ad o9,reality
very much so does this movie have high expectations  yes it was expected to be decent  at first i couldnt figure what was so important about  i guess there was a purpose  the narraration always stuck to the movie  and the plot was right on target  i thought the best part was the beginning when the men struggled to get on the shore  you know my dad was in a war and he went through harsh times but im sure it was never that risky  one thing i know this is a must see,reality
this is truly spielbergs greatest film combining action with the gruesome terror f the second world war the superb realism makes it feel as if you were actually there when the allies stormed the beaches of normandy a bit too much so i dont think anyone will argue this is a true masterpiece and while enjoying the film you might actually be learning something,reality
this movie starts and ends with shots of the american flag which points to one of its biggest problems it purports to be an anti war film but this rubbish while it may show the horrors of war in graphic detail it ultimately is a celebration of militarism and heroism sure heroism doesnt mean its a prowar movie but this movie goes beyond that its little surprise that the military are among the biggest fans of this movie it may not celebrate war as a something good but then i cant think of any film that does outside of propaganda movies if you want an anti war movie that shows heroism and mateship without celebrating the military watch all quiet on the western frontit does follow the standard american war movie characterisation rather faithfully the germans are universally evil other nations are either nonexistent villains or locals who get saved by the americans well in this case it is not that far from the truth without the americans the war would have gone on much longer than it did and the germans were villains but all these facts are distorted and stereotyped in a bad way here for example the only german with a sizeable speaking role turns out to be a total coward and backstabber who repays the americans who saved his life by shooting them there are a couple of good points to the movie though it does deviate somewhat from the standard us heroic movies in that it shows that americans committed war crimes too like shooting soldiers who had already surrendered there are also some quite powerful scenes that are as good as any spielberg has done best among them is the scene where a father in a french village tries to pass his daughter to one of the soldiers to save her this single scene can probably verify this movies claim to show the horrors of war somewhat the landing in the normandy is good although somewhat overrated i wasnt there so i cant comment on the realism but it felt like this was close to what it was really like many people were upset that the movie only shows americans fighting the germans but for once this is not really a valid argument since the various armies fought in different areas and would have had very little contact amongst each other the movie really goes downhill towards the end though when the troop actually find instead of being glad to be out of this hell he wants to stay there to help out his comrades very anti war indeed this is where the movie turns totally hollywood and looses all claim it may have had to a somewhat realistic portrayal a number of people had died already in trying to find and his decision to stay there costs another couple of people their lifes yet the movie makes him a total hero for it steven spielberg is capable of making great movies this isnt one of themthe acting is not particularly good and leaves out no cliches tom hanks was actually nominated for an academy award for a role that pee wee herman could have played betterfinally the salutation scene in the end is totally stomach churning,reality
at basic combat training my company had to watch this movie as part of our class on the seven army values loyalty duty respect selfless service honor integrity and personal courage no it isnt an accident that they form the acronym ldrship whether it was intended to be so or not matt damon in his role of private clearly exhibited each one of the army values it stirred our emotions and made us focus on the task at hand we were proud to be training as american soldiers,reality
not known to many viewers this is based on events that occured during wwii  try to find into the breach for more infoto say that is one of the best war films ever made is an understatement  it might possibly be the best war film ever made right up there with other films like apocalypse now platoon the deer hunter and full metal jacket  yes i noticed that i used only nam films but hey theyre some of the best around  and for todays top 250 poll its at 27  even that is an understatement  i believe that spr should be in the top 10 maybe even top 5 best movies of all time  thats all my opinion  but heres a plot summary for this masterpiecejames matt damon has lost his brothers in combat  all three of them so the government sends captain john h miller tom hanks with a team of an additional seven to find him and get him the hell outta there  these people are as diversified as the new yorker private richard reiben edward burns to the southern sniper private daniel jackson barry pepper the timid translator corporal timothy upham jeremy davies to the hardened veteran sargent mike horvath tom sizemore  along the way they encounter various goose chases and german troops and suffer losses that affect thoughts of how important one private isevery actor in this film is up to his element  i say his because well to be honest there are no women in this film except for random typists and mrs who dont have speaking parts  also starring adam goldberg vin diesel giovanni ribisi and ted dansonyou have not truly lived until you have seen saving private,reality
i just saw on sunday although its very gory intense scenes are pivotal to project the realistic view of war is quite disturbing yet very good to all of those with light hearts i dont recommend this film is set in wwii where tom hanks and his troops go looking for private james francis a soldier whose three brothers have already been killed in action the story is great the acting even better ive never seen another war movie as good to those tough enough i recommend saving private,reality
the first time i saw this i was so overcome by the reality of this movie that i almost cried with shame and disgust for the human race you may have thought this would have turned me away from movies like this but it got me so interested in both great wars that i have rented and bought many more after seeing spr again it wasnt so dramatic and gruesome but it showed me the truth of what really happened i never considered the actual experience of war until this the great dialogue and spectacular cast added to the experience i mean if you consider this most of these actors looked as if they belonged there fighting in the war the only member of the cast i couldnt picture is matt damon hes a good actor but he cant pull off a war film the rest of the main cast tom hanks tom sizemore edward burns adam goldberg giovanni ribisi and jeremy davies really did a phenomenal job i have never been so impressed this is a totally recommendable movie to anyone who wants to learn more about the cost of freedom,reality
special effects aside this movie is too full of heroic and unrealistic portrayal of soldiers war is not supposed to make sense and spielbergs attempt to make it look gritty and touching fails terribly this is pure hollywood nothing artistic or schindleristic about it what a dissapointmentonly the opening sequence makes good as for the rest of the plot about its just stale and too formulaic im sickened and disgusted by this moviego watch grave of the fireflies now thatll tear your heart in two,reality
this movie had it allon the positive side the most outstanding feature was the sound and the camera work we have often seen battle scenes that would depict the bravery the madness the brutality of war but never before were we so much included in the experience and i attribute it to the amazing way the sounds were worked in and the ever moving camera work nothing stands still in such fierce battles it was so gripping and so effective that i felt sort of trapped like the soldiers would like i was in an amusement parks ride that made me dizzy but i could not get out of and yeah the whole opening omaha beach scene made me a little dizzyon the negative side i wish spielberg or the story editors would have taken out the returning german soldier steamboat willie this is the weakest imo point of the movie it taints an otherwise very credible story and im disapointed that such a hollywoodish turn found its way in the scriptall in all a very very good movie albeit of a very very sad and disturbing subject,reality
spielberg isnt good at art hes a showman who makes must see movies that put things on the screen we havent seen before he has terrible taste sometimes such as hanks shooting at the tank on the bridge which reminds us of jaws which wakes us up to the fact that its only a moviei watch it for the middle and end which are thrilling although that may not have been the emotion intended but thats barnum for you the middle section is more traditional and recalls the morality scene in guns of navarone where they have to execute the informer it works there but is incongruous here because of the verite style of the war sequences,reality
i know i know is supposed to be spielbergs second schindler but seriously if you think about it its obviously not alright the omaha beach scenes are really some of the most astonishing action sequences ever staged however the following story unfolds as a cliched plot like any war story it reminded me even of the pilot to tour of duty tom hanks leads a small platoon through enemy lines to save the last of four brothers three were already killed in action on this mission some of the gis get killed the rest start pondering if this trip  if the war  is worthwhile so far so good to show that this movie is a deep one spielberg pulls the joker of showing the enemy in a humane way steamboat willy a german officer doomed to get shot who turns out to be just another nice guy but from the wrong side they let him get away but when they encounter him the second time the gi translator  who never before has killed anybody  has of course to shoot him just to show that all germans were demons after all hypocrisy and all the discussions whether the effort was worth it are silenced when turns out to be the bestest american boy ever it couldve been a far better film if was a dead already b a cowardish and unlikable character c black or d just not to be found then all the thoughts about the reason of war would have led somewhere now they are just a fig leaf to cover up a standard bwartime flick,reality
yesthe movie was excellenti give it a 10being a war movie nuti really didnt think tom hanks would make a good war herobut he did a great job as usualthe other cast members were goodbut the orginal cast members of the tv show combat put them to shamesgt saunders what a soldier anyway the tiger tanks on t34 chassies were excellentonly one problemwho wrote the part where capt miller lets a unarmed medic charge a mg42 machine gun nestwhats up with thattaking the nest ok choicebut i think sgt saunders would have kept doc in a safe placeoverall a great movie,reality
the movie starts off in blazing hell 15 minutes of stahlgewitter men screaming scattered and dying in a visual assault of maimed bodies and detached limbs without a doubt one of the most shocking and memorable depictions of war ever shot unfortunately the movie takes a big dip from that point on instead of showing us the absurdities of war something the plot could well have brought across spielberg laborously evolves the movie around trusted values like male comradeship loyalty and heroic patriotism blasting the genre of the american war movie 30 years into the past combined with the effort of hollywoods most pretentious actor tom hanks and a criminally tacky score makes this one of the most pathetic war movies ever madeterrence maliks thin red line which it incidently sunk at the box offices shows what this movie could  should have been,reality
is a terrible steven spielberg film usually spielbergs films are very intelligent and demanding masterpieces but wasnt more than a gory bloody massacre the germans were again the pieces of scum not worth to live films like stalingrad das boot or platoon show us that there are always innocents and unscrupulous killers on both sides in the german soldiers are just the meat stock of the ww2 american soldiers are dying always a gruesome painful death so the audience can really start to hate the germans and hope for more scenes in which more nazis get killed the german soldiers were usual soldiers too and especially in the last months of the war they didnt want to carry on fighting but there was not a single sign that the germans were humans too in the movie they were just cannon fodder for example there was the standoff between the americans and the germans in the destroyed city every german got killed the americans survived without any problems its painful enough that such senseless movies are still so popular in this time but the fact that is a steven spielberg film hey the man made movies like et schindlers list and jurassic park is truly shocking i think the movie was so much glorified because it was a spielberg if spr would be a war movie by a nonamedirector it wouldnt be more than a second missing in action please mail me your opinion,reality
from the outset it is without doubt the most realistic war film ever made the stomach churning beach battle at the beginning may well have put many off but those that stopped with it were rewarded by superb acting and more especially steven spielbergs staggering direction a must see film if ever there was one,reality
i love this film to bits spielberg williams and kaminski strike again with this great wwii front line drama all actors were excellent in their roles and i think hanks was stiffed at the oscars i especially liked the beginning of the dday landing scene with hanks and co in the transporter at that point you can really feel the tension building up mainly because of the shots of the soldiers faces as they waited to hit the beach the suspense of the situation really built up when you could hear the bullets clanging against the ramp on the front of the transporter and it was just sheer terror when the ramp fell and the guys at the front were riddled with bullets the point is spielberg makes the audience feel like theyre one of the soldiers on the transporter and i was no exception i got the real feeling of not wanting to be one of the soldiers there the length of the landing scene was quite long getting you into the feel of the time scale the blood and gore was necessary to depict how horrible this scene was the thing is thats what it was really likegranted it does get a bit slow when they start looking for but not to the point where youre bored enough to want out of the cinema the bonding between the soldiers in the squad is also highlighted in the film corporal upham for example being excluded by the others at the start and by the end is joining in with the lingo ie foobar the ending tugged on the heart strings plenty and it shows that hanks character was no hero but a normal human being hesitating to put his life on the line for another cf earn this the overall effect of this film is pure antiwarjohn williams score was excellent as usual and the fact that there was no music in the battle scenes was a good move so that the audience can concentrate on the action kaminskis shots were just genius his freehand style instantly recognisable giving a real feeling of terrifying action and movement at the start and end of the film this film was stiffed at the oscars mark my words,reality
this is the greatest film about war i ever seen of course i didnt see the real war but im living in the city former stalingrad that was almost swept from the face of the earth by the german luftwaffe for russians wwii is a special subject and from my childhood i watched a lot of films not only russian about it but no one impressed me like the spielbergs one unfortunately havent see it in wide screen but in home theater with dolby it was great thank you steven now i can forgive you jurassic ii and iii and iv and v and ,reality
the first time i saw this movie was at the cinema the opening scene simply took my breath away you could really feel the soldiers horror and i as almost crouched down in my seat seeking for cover i had just eaten before the movie so i ended up feeling really sick when the soldiers where slaughtered on the beach it is clearly the most realistic war scene everthe film is brilliant the actors are great the story is thrilling it is one of the best movies about war ever i think the main purpose of the film is to honor those who fought and died in the struggle against the nazis in ww2 we owe them a lot,reality
this movie tops them all a great tale told during the greatest event in the history of mankind the men of world war ii are the greatest heroes of all time,reality
this is an excellent piece of american cinema it is a heartfelt film about brotherhood loyalty and honour it might be said that it fetishizes the tragedy that was world war ii but i would say it is a respectable memoir it is gritty and dramatic touching and exciting a true classic among war films,reality
21 years ago this movie was released and i finally watched it in 2019 i really struggled to watch and i cried and i wept through most of the movie i did two tours in nam this movie was like being back in country i will never watch it again its just eats my guts out,reality
is a masterpiece  a cinematic milestone from spielberg directing to hanks masterful actingyou get to feel as if youre in the battlefield yourselfhands down one of the best movies ever,reality
is one of the greatest war films ive seen,reality
one of the best war movies ive ever seen it was great it made me cry and at the end i felt my heart brokewar is the saddest thing that the world could ever seen i felt every single part of the movie with all of my heart tom hanks was amazing as usualhe is great and amazing,reality
a prisoner of war is a man who tries to kill you and fails and then asks you not to kill himwinston churchill,reality
i would like to think everyone has seen this movie and for good reason i do not know a lot about ww2 history so i dont know how historically accurate this movie holds that being said this film is a masterpiece and demonstrates the brutality and sacrifices us soldiers make no punches are held throughout this movie starting right from the start as the soldiers charge on the beaches of normandy this movie really jerks your around and does not hold back so be prepared for a journey this is one of the higher rated movies on imdb and most people know why i have heard that this is a movie that a lot of veterans choose as there favorite weather that be due to the similarities or the accuracy of the execution of the story a must watch for sure,reality
this is the best war film i have ever seen as a veteran i always look for how accurate they get the details of the battles down and this film certainly did an amazing job in bringing history back to life i believe this is a film every generation needs to see,reality
this movie was just outstanding from start to finish as it was based on a true story and the script was well written even if some liberties were taken about the battles that were fought in france the actors all did an excellent job in their roles and the cinematography was spectacular especially the landing on the beach in the beginning the special effects were also superb if really graphic and veterans tell of the realism that is in the film plus i also like the way that the filmakers used equipment that looked like they were from that era unlike a lot of other war movies,reality
what an amazing filmit doesnt hold back with its portrayal of dday and the awful slaughter on the beaches and as the film progresses you see more of the tragedy that awaits so many soldiers fighting in ww2 it is such an emotional film and it is sensitively done and true to history too i recommend it to anyone with an interest in ww2 or anyone who wants to see just how horrific things were in the war,reality
a triumph in cinema not only is this a beautiful film its also the best war film ive seenthis must be watched by any series film fan the shock of the reality sets in quite early on in the film getting to grips with such devastation makes for a hard watch at times especially dday the beach landingtom hanks gives a truly blessed performance and the story holds up throughout,reality
i love this movie a lot war scences are directed very well storyline is also good,reality
i think its the best war movie i saw him several times and did not hate himits really a wonderful movie,reality
i have watched this movie over and over and it still causes tears to come it is astonishing surreal and feels like you are right there watching it all go down would recommend watching this movie ,reality
one of my all time favourite war movies acting is superb and the story is incredible 10,reality
svp was filmed by the americans but anyway it doesnt seem like typical american film about brave soldiers who fought against hitler,reality
considering im interested in ww2 i really liked this movie its pretty accurate as war movies go the actors do really well playing the soldiers ordered to bring back private james after learning that his brothers were killed in action leading them is the experienced captain millertom hanks what can i say about this movie that hasnt been said many of the actors are now alist stars vin diesel barry pepper and matt damonwho already was well known from good will huntingthe usage of handheld cameras and desaturated colors give the movie this rough feel and the silent moments help convey the unstable atmosphere that the main characters have to endure slowly and slowly they get picked off by the germans one by one and even though you may not know them you still feel for them and all the hell they go through it even gets to a point where they begin to question their mission and one even thinks about deserting his squad i like how it shows war for what it really is rather than glorifies it like most war moviesthe action scenes are well done it feels like youre really there alongside the soldiers its fast but never to the point where it gets confusing i dont have much else to say other than thiss a great movie and id recommend it to anyoneunless they have ptsd really it was so intense that ww2 veterans left the theater during the depiction of the omaha invasion and visits to ptsd counselors increased as well as a hotline was set up leading to 170 calls after the movie was releasedthere has been criticism of its accuracy and depiction of americans fighting in the war but honestly i think it was well done spielberg and his team did their research on the matter and it really shows the uniforms and equipment are fairly accurate theres not much to say about this movie other than its really great if you get the chance check it out,reality
a powerful film its only misstep is the length the plot drags a bit but the impressive action sequences completely absorb the viewer,reality
great movie has a bit of everything one of the best war movies,reality
ive seen this movie probably a half dozen times or so im a fan of the hbo series band of brothers which tom hanks and spielberg were both producers on so already knowing the story and setting fairly well i figured i would put this on and get some emails done balance my accounts and maybe do some drawingthat did not happen even the opening sequence which takes place in modern day as an old man walks through fields of graves marked with white crosses and stars of david drew me in and before i knew it we were halfway up the beach the french countryside and eventually defending the bridgetry as i did to get other things done there is something about the way spielberg directs that captures the attention and eye of the vieweri love a good ww2 movie but when spielberg makes one it makes every other one ive seen feel like a staged reenactment or kids playing war in the back lot of the neighborhood,reality
as always a top class performance from hanks complimented by show stopping direction from spielberga tale that is not only believable but brutality honest,reality
guidance film contains graphic violence and injury scenes and very bad languageeveryone knows about the landing scene on the normandy beaches this one was coded omaha and landed on by the us rangers in june 1944 it is every bit as graphic and bloody as described in reviews elsewhere and brings home the horrors of infantry warfarehowever this has no bearing on the story of it is its own little sideshowonce this episode is over only then does the mission come into fruition and the story begins i was under the impression that the action fizzled out but that is not the casethe action is no holds barred and there are more battle scenes evry bit as intense as the normandy beachesthe film brings home the real horrors of war it is unlike the war films made directly after world war 2 which sanitised modern warfare and were very black and white in their portrayal of both sidesthe plot however is paper thin and exactly as the film title,reality
this one of greatest movies i have watchedi enjoy its action and dramaand its so exciting from the begging to the end,reality
so this film is a really good film heartfelt and a brilliant tom hanks performance but the amount of american propaganda and the last bit with the american flag made me go down to a 7 which is a shame,reality
1998 starring tom hanks and jeremy davies represents an impeccable display of 90s practical effects and cinematography while the plot sometimes borders on cliche wwii realism is buoyed by dramatic performances from a talented supporting cast including tom sizemore and giovanni ribisi the film depicts a surprisingly accurate recreation of nazi occupied france  during the initial phase of operation overlord 1944 a particularly moving shot features heavy rain drops on the leaves of normandy hedgerows  your ears first interpret gunfire sharp direction by steven spielberg mirrors real life war reporting adding a level of grit and documentary terror not seen before or since the first 30 minutes of cannot be forgotten and may function as a tool to familiarize future generations on the scenarios of endless brutality generated by an environment of total war,reality
i am watching the movie for the nth time and i keep shopping on the same place because it annoys mewhen they are making their sticky bombs they put plastic in the socks in the containers which are not pliable c4 or any of its cousins could be sticky but the containers have edges and would bounce off ffs,reality
i loved this story it was a true inspiration it was a great story of bravery,reality
violent and emotional ome of the most belivable war movies ever made the acting is accurate yet matt damon feels out of place,reality
it was really really good what a lot of action ,reality
a masterpiece that clearly reveals the reality of war inspiration of dozens of films,reality
i would regard this as one of the greatest films i watched as a child its still as good watching it now then it was back then many films do not have this effect on the audience,reality
war is hell retelling is is almost as hell butwhat i hated of this movie was seeing how the attack on dday was so much like shooting fish in a barrel how badly our side messed up our own soldiers the landing boats were so stupidly designed opening from the front instead of the side using the front as cover until it was somewhat safer to disembark like shooting fish in a barrel they were fish the boats were the barrel why couldnt the boats have landed and then soldiers fired from there for their own cover why couldnt a lot of thing happened that could have not ended is such a huge loss of lifehow many died by the overly simplistic strategy of flooding the beach until the enemy was overrunartillery by land by ship bombs by plane were used but this battle was sloppy i know all the other details about this battle all the hardships and time constraints due to the weather but there was no lack of time for planning so what happened they claimed they didnt know how much defence were waiting for them on the beach for all they already knew how is this truethe higher ups didnt care about the expendable individual how many did they think was needed add enough more to make sure it works it did work,reality
this film is so awesome and breathtaking  seeing how these men are fighting over seas,reality
great movie great cinematography great acting i really enjoyed this,reality
director steven spielberg yet again brings together an allstar cast to create an influential war film tells the story of eight men who set out to find private played by matt damon as his three brothers were killed in action their goal is to find private and send him home to his mother as he is her only child still living the movie set during wwii shows not only the hardships of war but also what men are willing to go through to bring a fellow soldier home these eight men led by captain miller who is played by tom hanks must travel into enemy territory to retrieve private and in doing so find themselves fighting for their own lives to do so while the theme of the film is war spielberg directed his cast in a portrayal of courage showing what great lengths men will go through in such a troubling time courage could be referenced as part of the plot of this film but it can be argued that you cant have a film with war as the theme and not have this be a subsequent role in the film another element of this film would be the loss of life or disregard for life in the film soldiers are seen killing german soldiers who are attempting to surrender this again relates to the main theme of war but also that in which life has no real valuelighting was impactful for this film and appeared to be natural lighting but seemed to be duller than what would be expected this brought out the element of drama and while being a typical dramatic effect gave a real sense of mood in most of the film like most war films a depressing mood is given off and with this type of lighting it really made this feeling come true for me as a viewer character costume was also an important element in this film not only was there uniformity between officer and enlisted you could also get a feeling for who was in the fight and who may have just arrived most men looked haggard and beaten down and without needing to look at their expression you could understand this through their appearance mens uniforms were dirty or blood stained while men at a base would have what almost appeared as new fatigues as they had not left the safety of the base these different elements added to the cinematic effect and helped in portraying such an exhilarating filmwhile some may describe this as just another war film spielberg hanks and tom sizemore together made this a classic war films generally follow the action and turned the focus to courage rather than just victory a must see film from an allstar cast,reality
this was just a fantastic movie that opening half an hour with the allied invasion of normandy is like nothing ive ever seen before unflinchingly gritty violent bloody loud horrific and brutal i was actually watching it on the treadmill and had to stop because i was gasping and then sobbing probably one of the most realistic portrayals of the horrors of war ever made this was in your face throughout and doesnt glorify or lie about combatthe movie itself i would have to say is a bit of a masterpiece with amazing attention to detail and steven spielberg deservingly winning an oscar for his stunning war drama the story follows a squad of us army soldiers on a mission to rescue a gi trapped behind enemy lines in france on dday after all 3 of this brothers are killed in actionexcellent performances all round but especially from tom hanks as capt miller leading his men on their perilous mission to locate that one man pvt matt damon a paratrooper whos somewhere behind german lines i also really enjoyed tom sizemorethis movie has so many familiar faces attached and it was interesting and even fun seeing all the different actors showing up along the way in the search for including adam goldberg barry pepper bryan cranston dennis farina edward burns giovanni ribisi nathan fillion paul giamatti vin diesel hurst 111115,reality
i hated this movie at first  the very beginning is maybe 2030 minutes of horrific violence yes  it really happened of course i saw that id just always seen that as gratuitous i couldnt stand to watch iti see now why it was necessary though i often chicken out and try not to watch  its absolutely a part of the movie thats supposed to be there  every drop of bloodone thing that made my heart jump a little was a quote from a favorite poem  keep an ear out for charge of the light brigade if you like itspoiler  yet so much meaning in life itself especially todays fighting  one line i think should really be shot to the top of everyones head out of anything any other character says it just grabbed me after a harrowing search to find private and what these men went through to get him to safety  as tom hankss character is eventually dying as a direct result of the search to save this young soldier his last words are to him  earn this,reality
tom hanks vin diesel and matt damon star in this war epic directed by steven spielberg the story follows a group of soldiers who are risking their lives to save private whose 3 other brothers have been killed steven spielberg doesnt cut any corners or hide the truth as in the opening normandy landing scene he shows the brutality as it is the film really emphasizes the horror of war and how risking your life for another is an honorable and rewarding thing tom hanks helps boost the film to a high with a stunning and scarily realistic performance as captain john miller the supporting cast like matt damon are also awesome and help the film reach its fullest potentialthe film is truly one of if not the best world war ii films ever made and will surely stay a gem in cinema now and into the future,reality
i agree with almost everybody on this one this is definitely a very good film the first part is excellent and is almost certainly destined to become part of cinematic history the original music score and the special effects are uniformly excellent and the cinematography very goodhaving said all the above however i did also find some faults albeit small hence the rating of only 810 lets try to explore some briefly i think the story was a bit lacking slightly oversimplified more in depth characterization would have improved the movie in my opinion apart from this i also think and i am well aware that most will disagree with me here that tom hanks was completely miscast here to me even though he is undoubtedly a great actor he never even remotely resembles the tough nononsense war hero he is supposed to be playing just think of john wayne in a very similar role in the longest day and you will probably see what i meanhavind said the above though this is and remains an excellent film spielberg has done it again,reality
its actually pretty sad for me as russian to accept that its america that made the best movie about wwii but not us but eventually it doesnt even matter the main thing is  they managed to present the most plausible film regarding this topic the one which dispels the myth of wars romanticism and actually shows the horrible truth about the war  terrible death blaring perishing fear hopelessness despair inexpressible brutality the landing scene from my point of view is the paragon of presenting a battle experience blood runs cold whilst watching that scene generally the whole movie is watched in one breath yeah one could say that the plot is a bit flimsy but its perfectly compensated by incredible battle scenes it is also impossible not to mention the amazing cast the personalities of characters are unfolded spectacularly if youre into war movies youll probably dive into the story and live through it together with the squad and this is exactly what really terrific about cinematography so in this way if you havent watched this movie yet you should definitely do it asap i bet it would be one of the most breathtaking film experience youve ever had,reality
the film saving privatespielberg 1998 follows a squad of soldiers led by captain miller played by tom hanks the squad is sent on a risky mission to locate and return private played by matt damon has lost multiple siblings in various theaters of wwii thus earning him a ticket home he is however lost somewhere in france following a messy dday assault the theme focuses on the sacrifices made by brothers in arms and the idea of earning what was paid for in bloodupon initially learning of the mission the squad balks at the idea of risking an entire squad to save one man as the squad proceeds with the mission they convey through speech and actions that they hope to earn the right to return home and grudgingly come to terms with the mission however a repeating motif in the film is that despite trying to apply the moral and ethical solution to a problem the end result is often a large unrewarding sacrifice for example vin diesel as private caparzo attempts to rescue and take with them a young girl at the request of her family in the confusion and stress of the scene a sniper shoots caparzo additionally when the squad later encounters a german machine gun bunker the squad reluctantly decides to attack hoping to prevent a future ambush the end result is the death of the medic wade furthermore a german soldier captured during the assault is released and later kills private mellish in a different battle despite their willing sacrifice the end result is often negative this is in contrast to many other war films where sacrifice immediately pays off such as enemy at the gates annaud 2001 in which the sniper vassili is able to locate an enemy sniper after his friend sacrifices himself by allowing the enemy to shoot himnot only does the film do an excellent job of visually depicting the horrors of war but it also uses a keen detail to sound to further the experience and elaborate on the fear and stress of a war time setting from the pings of spent ammo clips to the realistic thuds of ricochets the sound envelops the viewer a particularly striking scene occurs after the squad has located private yet are compelled to stay and help a grossly undermanned and under gunned group of soldiers defend a vital bridge from approaching germans as the group waits in silence to ambush the approaching german armor a low screeching mechanical sound can be heard in the distance the sound becomes increasingly loud and menacing as the germans approach and the viewer is filled with a sense of dread reiterated by the facial emoting of the actors it is clear by the sound they are dealing with a very powerful force and do not have the means to make it a fair fight yet they must stay and fight this scene would have lost much of its power and influence without the dramatic build up from sounds effectsultimately much of the squad is sacrificed and captain miller implores private to earn this chance at life that he has been given and live a good life after a tremendous amount of sacrifice a positive result finally comes to fruition however as indicated in the final scene an aged is plagued by the burden of being a lucky survivor and is in constant inner turmoil over whether or not he had earned what so many others had sacrificed forspielberg s director rodat r writer 1998 dvd united states dreamworksannaud j director annaudjwriter 2001 enemy at the gatesdvd united states paramount pictures,reality
is certainly a good film and a major technical achievement but it is little more than thatafter the stunning first twenty minutes the movie begins to falter the storyline seems to be based in asking the question what is the value of one life the characters struggle with risking all of their own lives to save just one is duty and honor important enough to die for what if turns out to be a complete degenerate it is a pretty heady and ultimately unanswerable question yet with the modern bits tacked on the beginning and end of the film spielberg answers the question for us this is pure schmaltz made to get one last tug on the heart strings it cheapens the film when hanks admits to being a schoolteacher back home it is the worst kind of melodrama when the soldier does his bit in the church about missing his mother we somehow know hell be dead in ten minutes when they release the german soldier we somehow know well see him again how many clichs and obvious plot devices can one throw into a realistic movie how about the celebrity cameos that feed a directors egobut serve only to distract the audience from the film hey isnt that ted danson for the most part it is completely overblown gratuitous melodrama it isnt even the best war movie ever made much less the best movie ever its worth the three hours but not much more,reality
now i know people are going to just despise me for saying this movie was not spielbergs best dont get me wrong i love spielbergs work and i love tom hanks and matt damon but this movie although beautifully shot and with some of the most intense action sequences ever portrayed in a movie i feel as though the characters lost me they did not grip my interest i did not care of them as i normally do in a movie such as this i felt myself not caring when characters were killed which really disappointed me spielberg tries to make you care for them by overly long scenes in which they talk about their past i however found these scenes boring and had didnt have me caring any more this movie is about a squad in world war 2 that is sent to save a man who had lost all his 3 brothers in the war since he was the only son left in his family the government made a decision to send a group of men to go save the last remaining son damon of course on the way they lose men and face trials of humanityeven though what i said above i still highly recommend this movie to everyone its just that i have such high expectations from spielberg and hanks so in my opinion it was kind of a let down though i may be the only person on earth who thinks so so by all means go watch this one friends,reality
i spent the better part of this movie in awe thinking this was the best war movie id ever seen there are no heroes or villains on both sides just poor men trying to stay alivethe americans have faces the enemies have faces compare this to a movie like top gun for example you never see the enemies faces therefore they must be evil right the whole idea collapsed like a house of cards at the end suddenly the americans turned to heroes and the enemies turned to villains i still dont understand why they did thatthis movie could have been great the way it is  its merely good,reality
this movie is incredible it is dramatic intense and inspirational with great music and a great cast the story of a squads journey to save pvt james franciss life is truly inspirational it is very realistic which at times simply becomes hard to bear i like bears im sorry about this review because i have to write it for a class so i think ill just chug through my lines with random writing like tom hanks chugs through german after german while dodging bullets like jacky chan this element makes the movie slightly unrealistic at times it is also has some other neat elements like a badass sniper and some kick ass scenes this movie truly does show the gruesome affects that war has on soldiers in battle but not so much the aftermath and the symptoms of post dramatic stress so what do you think is the best type of bear i think the coolest ones are polar bears but they are certainly not the best in conclusion this is a must see for war movie lovers and people who like tom hanks,reality
was a great yet tragic war story it truly captured the life and times of world war ii this movie allows the viewer to see how soldiers thought and acted in world war ii it showed that most soldiers will sacrifice their own life in order to save others the actual fighting of the war was extremely impressive in that that era was captured beautifully and the director did a great job the opening battle that took place in normandy was by far the most impressive war scene i have seen in any movie the great yet graphic fighting depicted the brutal war and allowed for the viewer to imagine what the war would have been like if they were to have fought in it,reality
this film is very well researched and the opening thirty minutes are intensely visceral as we experience the dday landings in normandy france after such a stunning start the film suffers because it never again captures that intensity the story is simple and shows the american soldiers as good honest men who fight because its their duty hanks is fine in an understated role matt damon is slightly bland no one else leaves much of an impression the film descends into sentimentality frequently and this does occasionally fell like overkill still its well worth watchingoverall 710,reality
although i have had this films dvd for a few years now i had never been intrigued by war films and always thought of them as preachy propaganda in one way or the other but i happened to stumble across as our class was doing a wwii project and so decided to watch it although maybe it was preachy somewhat and yet still not extremely historically accurate i should know considering that i watched it for a history project one thing that i could not deny with an open mind is that is epic filmmaking at its finestas far as the story is concerned i wont go too deep into historical accuracy but as long as the important things are set straight and the story makes sense on its own im happy with it that being said there should have been more effort put into showing how other allied nations besides america contributed to the war at least during the beach landing sequence this is my biggest gripe with the story and even then its a fairly minor gripesome more background on the war would have also helped a lot to lend that extra authenticity edge to the movie but the lack of it doesnt come down hard at all since most of us know it anyways aside from that the story is fairly straightforward which is good since most of it is packed with great amazingly cinematographed action sequences and even better the highimpact action is nicely balanced out by a few tender moments  making more than just a warthemed action filmhowever the whole mission of  for which our heroes risk their lives  shouldve been justified more deeply with more than just an abraham lincoln speech and another thing that couldve cleared up many misconceptions was the movies name pvt despite being talked about throughout the movie appears for like 15 minutes on screen and even then has very little character development heck the movies tagline wouldve made for a more suitable title the mission is a man in fact pvt is almost relegated to a minor character when it comes to screenplay as the movie centers almost entirely around tom hanks capt john miller who is also the most fleshedout character in the movie  perhaps the only one in fact but considering the movies runtime focusing on a few characters is a good thinglike most others my favorite scene from the movie was the normandy beach landing at the beginning which is one of the most intense sequences ive ever seen in a movie if there is one vital thing that this scene would be incomplete without it is the cinematography  the shaky handheld camerawork wonderfully evokes the feeling that the viewer is seeing the whole thing through the eyes of one of the soldiers fighting on the beach and it leaves a very strong impression there are also dramatic depictions of shell shock and tons of realistic hardcore gore none of which feels gratuitous in context of the overall turbulence of the entire sequence the sound is just as good as gunshots and machinegun fire booms loud and clear amidst frantic last cries groans and screaming of soldiersthe cinematography production design and acting are topnotch all across the board throughout the movie tom hanks performance is particularly moving and resonant the cinematography is greatly helped by the handycam style of camerawork and use of appropriately grayish color palettes when it comes to the production design destroyed villages and pastures look like they should with dead rotting cows and all while the piles of garbage that are found in abundance throughout the movie are also meticulously detailed complete with chunks of 1940slooking weaponry sticking out of themall in all is one of the best war propaganda films ever made if not the best and i mean it positively  but my dilemma was right it is still a propaganda film because according to this movie all nazis are onedimensional motiveless and spineless but considering how good the movie already is with its current premise i couldnt really ask for more and besides with a famously jewish director what else can you ask for regardless is without doubt among the finest movies in its dimension and in its genre rating 910,reality
its tough being a teenager now you have to catch up on all types of movies classics older movies and newer movies you may have missed when opened in 1998 i of course wasnt allowed to see it nor would i have been interested in seeing it but now everyone at schools buzzing about that movie saying how great it is i finally gave into peer pressure and rented it and its quite a good movie its just not the extraordinary classic that its made out to bethe time is world war ii captain john miller tom hanks is sent to fetch the title character hence saving him and making the title make sense why send out eight people to rescue just one private his three brothers who were also in the war were killed so basically eight men are sent out to ease mrs obviously when they finally reach him there is resentmentthe movie opens with a flashback to the war as every single war movie seems to do why is this always necessary that means we know that some people survive taking some tension out at least we usually cant figure out who yet then it goes in with a bang at a loud exciting war scene that doesnt really have much to do with the rest of the plot but its very exciting the only problem is that it pads out the movie to an obnoxiously long 170 minutes and since it isnt necessary it didnt have to be in the moviewhile the movie is quite long its never boring not at all but some parts arent very interesting also since its a spielberg investment every single character has to have a backstory meaning that smack dab in the middle of the movie everyone must reminisce about what their life was even those whose names we dont know meaning that right when its getting good it goes off to left fieldthe war scenes were incredibly realistic as far as i can tell although graphic at times its obvious how painstakingly hard they worked to make it seem like you were actually there no matter where you were including watching it on a 5 screen also i think something else that added to the realism is that spielberg kept the camera to a 1851 aspect ratio therefore he was centralizing in on the action what needed to be shown and what doesnt need to be shownebbs and flows at times theres heartpounding action at others its just watchable so you can continue on with the plot but however you feel about this movie you have to admit that its one of the most realistic war films ever mademy rating 710rated r for war violence and language,reality
an excellent film the acting is superb the history is accurate the action is intense the characters are sympathetic my only complaints which are minor ones are that the film is too long and the pace is a bit too slow other than that its vintage spielberg and a masterpiece,reality
i was one of the few people in the world that had not seen this movie  last night a friend of mine wanted me to see the beginning scene on his home theater  i heard so many people talk about the open scene that i was all for the experience in surround sound  i wasnt planning on watching the whole movie but it was too late  this is one of many really long movies but it flows so well and the storyline just sucks you in  i constantly kept thinking how would i feel if i was in one their shoes  i couldnt begin to comprehend how traumatic it would be to go through a war with all you would be involved in doing and the things you would see you wish you didnt have tothis is a really good movie which comes to no surprise when it is a spielberg movie  this is a movie about bringing a private james home after there is confirmation his 3 brothers were already killed in action this movie shows great passion and there is lots of gore  this movie doesnt glorify war but depicts it exactly how it is  ugly i would recommend that if you have not seen this watch it  it is a long movie but it goes at an excellent pace  it is a touching movie with allot of graphic images  allot of what you see in this movie will most likely disturb you  i just cant stress enough this is a must see movie,reality
tom hanks did a superb job in portraying the poor hapless fellow charged with  only to be killed in the end  many scenes of war fighting with all one expects such as enemy snippers machine gun nests and mine fields  the enemy soldier hanks benevolently lets go in one such scene is one who helps to kill him in the end private played by matt damon only coming into play in the latter part of the movie to me some what of an anticlimax is insistent he doesnt want to be rescued but chooses to fight to the end of the movie that is admittedly this movie is about the character played by hanks with damon as an after thought  the pvt character could of just as easily been played by a trained chimpanzee for what it added to the overall movie while i liked the overall movie i was noticeable disappointed by the pvt character,reality
steven spielberg is more than just an artist he is a humanitarian  i commend him for  the first 20 minutes of this picture stand as a perfect representation of the truth  in fact its hard not to get teary eyed when i think of all the brave soldiers that gave their lives on dday  teds grade a,reality
the first 20 minutes of this movie are indeed the most horrifying images of the reality of waralthough many viewers complain that the facts are not historically correctthis liberty can be accepted as a means of portraying the pure horror that is experienced on any battlefield past or presentthe impact of the confrontation with the destructive nature of man and his senseless killing however is spoiled to a degree by the ensuing story itself the movie becomes a  remake of so many other hollywood war epicshad the potential of being an ode to all those soldiers who have given their lives for their country in often questionable circumstancesit certainly doesnt have the same impact as classics such as paths of glory which succeeded in portraying war as a cruel reality without the need of adding any fictitious elements to engage the viewer,reality
hi i have only just recently seen the film and feel it my duty to salute all the participants mr speilberg mrhanks mr sizemore mrburns mr goldberg mr damon mr davies mr pepper mr ribisi mr diesel this list of course is only naming a few but thanks and praise go to all i have always enjoyed learning about the world wars nothing i have ever seen came close to it deeply moved me and have watched it many times over since yours lucy anne mcglennon scotland age 15,reality
i had put off watching this film because id heard it was so bloody and i wasnt sure i wanted to see it  well it lived up to its billing  the scenes of war look very realistic and its a shocking experience to watchi enjoyed the film but not as much as spielbergs other wwii film schindlers list  i suppose its because of the comparative lack of drama  tom hanks is a terrific actor but his character doesnt draw you in like liam neesons did  i didnt relate to the people in the way i did in schindler  its probably not a fair comparison to make but that was my reaction anywaythe premise bothered me a little bit too  sure saving the lone remaining child of a family is important but did it make sense to send a company of men out during the days right after the landing at normandy to save one person  things were chaotic then and success wasnt assured by any means and i think the militarys focus would have been elsewhere  i dont know what the real circumstances were that the film was based on but the director did make the mission seem worthy by having the men defend a vital bridge from the germans after they caught up with its a complicated subject war and while this movie is very good im not sure i agree with the focus of this film as a way of portraying patriotism,reality
when i went to see this flick i had heard all the rumours about the beginning of this movie i consider myself to have a strong stomach for silverscreen violence so i thought to myself what could spielberg mr fairytale of all people shove on my face well 30 minutes of unrelenting fullblooded grindhouse gore was not anything i could have prepared myself for i dont think theres anyone in the world who can take the beginning of spr easily i bet even guys like paul i said more blood you faggots verhoeven ended up thinkin this sht is heavy youll be stunned youll feel the horror and youll end up watching helplessly as spielberg and his team introduce you to the face of war this is not entertainment with a bunch of grownup kids cowboying it on the krauts this is sadistic mindless and brutal just like the real thing after the start things slow down just a little bit as the plot unravels but spielberg manages easily in staying miles away from his fairytaletelling alter ego and in the end well here we go again if this was a regular action flick youd be waiting for the big finale this time you are so much rooting for the soldiers you hope they would get away without having to fight anymore but steven keeps it real to the end and in the grand fnale bombards the viewer emotionally to the ground only two minor complaints closeup on the american flag yea yea heroesland of the free etc and some light moments at the end the last speech of the dying hero  cliche taste a bit fake in this otherly very heavy movie i also am not so sure if portraying germans again as backstabbing sobs is that good a choice and i hate sizemore in this but this gets payed back by the surprisingly good performance of ed burns10  10,reality
finally a movie with waffen ss men those who dont know those are the germans at the town battle scene with the camo i never saw a war movie except a bridge too far that had waffenss  soldiers this movie is great it shows how both sides have to kill or be killed and how the us soldiers werent all angels and to whom it may concern canadians are americans they do live in the american continent  to those who forget that this continent is called america not just the us anyway great movie great sound affects especially the gun fire only flaws were that the battle at the end didnt fit the real german battle tactics that unit was represented as the 2nd ss panzer div das reich  they were blooded from eastern front campaigns and they would know alot about urban warfare and that unit wouldnt send a tiger and a assault gun down the middle of a town knowing very well the effects of urban warfare but i guess spielberg wanted some socalled nazis to be killed there should be more movies like this one especially about the unknown waffenss heroes who were just soldiers doing there duties as front line soldiers,reality
i saw back in 98 when it was released in theaters  i remember sitting there almost in tears ten minutes into the movie  it does not feel like a movie at all  it feels like a war  the camera men and the sound crew deserve as much credit as speilberg or hanks for making the movie come to life  i say this is one of the best movies ever because almost every other war movie glorifies war and destruction whereas this movie would dissuade anyone from wanting to go to war  if you have not seen this you have not seen a war movie yet,reality
being told he can go home private hell these guys deserve to go home as much as i do theyve fought just as hardcaptain john miller is that what im supposed to tell your mother when she gets another folded american flagprivate you can tell her that when you found me i was with the only brothers i had left and that there was no way i was deserting them i think shed understand that,reality
realizing that men boys actually lived and died in the events portrayed in this film certainly makes one appreciate even more the sacrifice made by those very brave individualstom hanks and all the cast played very real characters which the movie viewer could develop an emotional bond with,reality
no doubt this movie is great steven spielberg directs this movie masterfully absolutely flawless there are good performances from the entire cast but my main criticism is why tom hanks got an oscar nomination he was good but not worth an oscar nomination maybe i should watch the movie again its a great movie but i wonder if people rave about it too much overall 9 out of 10,reality
whats not to like about this movie i especially liked barry peppers jacksons line give me a clear line of sight of hitler and you can pack your bags fellas the wars over haha but on the flipside what i really could not stand was that translator guy they had to bring along his cowardly acts just made my skin crawl otherwise an awesome movie indeed i give it 5 out of 5 stars,reality
this has got to be one of the best war films of all time doing justice to actual events of omaha beach by accurately representing the landings of june 6th was the thing that clinched my liking of the film  despite it being the opening 20 minutes so very many films stray from the truth in order to make the film more exciting and the visual effects more pronounced which isnt a big problem to me as long as its tasteful further developments in the film also increased how much i enjoyed the film well filmed action sequences littered with plot development really keep the film going however after the first 2 or 3 times some of the characters can become dull pvt melish for example typically good acting from tom hanks is complimented by good performances from tom sizemore jeremy davies and even vin diesel  in his best role to date overall a very good film but dont over watch it,reality
the beginning was shock bullets of enemys machineguns tearing soldiersheads away while they are about to go enter omaha beach the notoriousbeach for us soldiers the cameraman really lived through all that i thought i have seen a quite a bit war films but the chaotic inhuman and horror are not strong words enough to describe the beginning of the moviespielberg did a good work i must say what comes to describing the actual war what its like also following his style he steers clear from judging things however soon the movie lose its tracks yet it seems to be historically accurate and its interesting to watch as a historical epic story the moral set of the movie starts to taste strange  indeed and the composition in the beginning when the old mrryan is squatting on the graveyard and folks are behind that composition is very spielbergthats afterall the best thing in the movie but also its the thing what makes this movie feel like a bit unfinished also the movie reminded me too much ofgreen mile which was a kind of inmature description now that i think of it thats the thing of spielberg movies they get everyone inside in the first sight but soon they abandon the audience leaving them wander helplessly intochaos of unclear and muddy world or moral questions kubricks world is moreclear in that sense anyway good movie well worth of 8,reality
this is one of the greatest films ever made  obviously there are people complaining about sentimentality sickening proamericanism etc well for those people  im anything but a patriot but i still loved this film  it is the greatest war film ever and the second best film everits been said but i will still say it if you dont like this fine  just dont bash it for being proamerican when it is an american film stereotypes  whatever  then there are plenty of 40s and 50s movies for you to make fun of since they were so onesided  this is a film about soldiers not a crappy allstar extravaganza with big names topbilled for maybe twenty minutes of screen time and slow battle scenes  midway tora tora tora extremely overrated imo and the battle of the bulge  where half of the movie is the opposing generals planning the battle ah wellthe plot is a bit hackneyed eight crack us soldiers are sent on a mission to rescue private james matt damon who has crashlanded behind enemy lines  the reason  because all of his brothers have already been butchered and the us military in the persona of chief of staff george c marshall harve presnell decides for public relations reasons to save him the soldiers led by john miller tom hanks go through a warscarred countryside engaging in a skirmish or two along the way and seeing the ravages of war up close and personalsound cornywell it is but the execution is perfect  yes the opening and closing scenes at the normany memorial couldve been left out without making the film any worse  but theyre a very small part of the experiencethe battle scenes and the acting are great  even vin diesel who after seeing the abomination that is xxx i now despise is good though he only has about fifteen minutes of screen time anyway  the opening dday fighting features some of the most graphic violence ever put on film with dr strangeloveesque cinematography  lets just say however that after seeing we were soldiers the wild bunch the patriot etc before this i was not shocked by the violence at all  even the soldier who had his guts blown out did not disgust me  i thought it looked like foam spray but its still a graphic sceneone of the best scenes of the film is the attack on the radar station for more than one reason  seven of the us troops diesels character was killed by a german sniper in a french town a while back attack a small german force  the battle is not shown really instead we see a brief firefight with no gore at all through the view of the green interpreter corporal upham the superb jeffrey davies  then one of the grunts a private wade giovanni rizzi has been gut shot  in a heartrendering scene his comrades gather around him and attempt to stop the bleeding before he dies then the americans come across a german soldier joerg sadler who is forced to dig a grave for wade  upham pleads for the germans life while miller and his men want to execute him  the german utters token english phrases such as fck hitler in an attempt to have himself spared miller for whatever reason decides to let him gothe best battle scene of all however is the final confrontation  having finally found and several men of his patrol miller and his men decide to join them in the defense of a crucial bridgehead against what would prove to be a laststand  this battle scene is graphic and moving  no realism is spared  the ending was predictably copout but given how it played out i didnt much careten stars is an award that i give very few films  but spielberg  arguably the greatest filmmaker working today  deserves it with this,reality
this film is certainly one of the best war films knocking around the opening half hour or so is very powerful and definetly one of spielbergs finest moments however it is a bit let down by the usual spielberg sentimentalityoverall i enjoyed this film a lot it is basically a very good film but not a great one,reality
this movie is about heroes its about men who give their lifes for us my grandfather went to the worldwar 2 he was a hero are you willing to die for your country my goodness and my fortress my high tower and my deliverer my shield and he in whom i trust who subdueth my people under me i guess the only question remaining is have you earned that imagine theres no countriesit isnt hard to do nothing to kill or die forno religion too imagine all the people living life in peace you may say im a dreamerbut im not the only one i hope some day youll join usand the world will live as one,reality
i voted a 1 for this movie not because i hated it but because i do not believe it deserves to be this high on the imdb top 250 47 at the oscars in 99 many were surprised that this picture lost the best picture award well i was not but i was very disappointed that shakespeare in love did the best picture award should either have gone to elizabeth or to la vita  bella those were the two best pictures of 1998 at least the best ones that were nominated i thought it would be la vita just isnt that good i meani did believe that it would be the one with the second most awards because of technical awards like sound sound editing editing and cinematography which it all won those were the best aspects of the film deserved these awards more than any other film that year because they made the normandy sequence a classic that is also the only reason i felt that steven spielberg should have won the best director award he and benigi were the only one who created a classic scene and he won either him or roberto benigi deserved to win the bad aspects tom hanks and the screenplay by robert rodat however are bad because they just dont work its not that hes a bad actor but he just does not fit the picture neither does matt damon by the wayand ted danson what was he doing in there spoileranywayat the battle for the bridgesequence when hanks is dying and he says the line earn thisearn it coming out of the mouth of hanks it just sounds so corny to mehe was a better actor playing a dying man in philadelphia as for the screenplaytheres nothing that really sparks interest so oh yeah another thingjohn williams score should not have even been nominated there is just one good piece of music the hymn of the fallen the rest is just like the rest of the movie dreary boring and above all uninteresting it fits the movie but a dreary boring uninteresting film is not what people want to see its not worth the nomination thats all,reality
some people may be taken by the fact that this movie is infact one of the goriest movies of all time they also may be taken by by the strong dialogue or even the severe lack of color but none of those can mount up to the over riding facts that make this a good moviehow so you may ask well let me explain it to youthe plot this movie has a compeling and original plot based on the real ww2 story it involves a stiring try to find a private james whose 3 other brothers have died in combat  warning after this point there will be mild spoilers and i strongly recomend you do not go on if you have not seen this movie they eventually find and have a life or death choice to help him and his company or move on and let them diethe characters this has a semiall star cast headed up by tom hanks they all develop well in the course of this movie and those who do die are not lost in vain they are constantly put to the test in thier task to find privatethe gore yes even the gore supports the movie by not holding back on any gore spielburg  was able to put you into the realism of war and bring you into the movie as if you to were fighting the germans,reality
much has been made of how this extraordinary exercise in cinematic verisimilitude is a powerful antiwar statement when in fact it is arguably no such thing  indeed there are many points in this film where one feels that it is less a powerful antiwar statement and more a 1970s war movie the dirty dozen with highbrow pretensionsthis is a terrible shame of course as the film has many virtues combat is depicted in a defining cinematic fashion and generally presents war as existing in a moral void where after all the participants are attempting to slaughter each other  good manners seem like something of an irrelevance when the bullets begin to flynonetheless the film remains mired in the results its own incestuous matings with clint eastwoodera cliche  soldiers talk about their mothers in a church at night  isolated and demoralised soldiers face down overwhelming odds  soldiers improvise powerful weaponry from a everyday objects and some explosive  a charismatic strongbutsilent soldier buys it in the last reel prompting many in the audience to pine oh i liked himand such obviousness is frankly the least of the films worries  in a pivotal if practically sepiatinted scene captain dale dye adds another silverhaired martial patriarch to his already extensive cv of such characters and expresses the view that sending a squad of men after one paratrooper because of his mother is simple foolishness on a purely mathematical level if nothing else  his co offers a devastating counterargument which is nonsensical franklyas the scene closes the co having read out a very admirable letter by abraham lincoln he has not made the case for his proposed military venture he hasnt made the case for anything actually  in fact if the letter has a message it is that young men die in war and tragically thats inevitable and the bereaved parents should be proud of their sacrifice  even if one agrees with this sentiment it is still rather difficult to see how it supports the case for sending a squad to find jimmy  indeed it would appear to run utterly counter to it  but presumably everybody  including the otherwise reliable captain calm down son dye  is too caught up in the moment to still be you know thinking or anythingworst of all the characterisation of the squad themselves is largely cardboardcutout  a group of very able young actors are all saddled here with underdeveloped characters all of whom appear to have been freshly unearthed from a metaphorical toybox where these lead soldiers have presumably been languishing since 1977  only the ironicallynamed sergeant horvath truly impresses and that is as much because of the way in which tom sizemore masterfully transforms cliche into archetype  it is surely plain to all that had this film involved any lengthy sequences in a french or italian town the good sergeant would have shacked up with the madam of the local whorehouse in a matter of minutesthis film is something of a jekyll  hyde then  quite honestly its far too exciting to be genuinely antiwar and perversely far too glib and simplistic on the subject of heroism and sacrifice to be an effective memorial to those who gave their lives  its a shame that spielberg did not choose to make a film that was in one camp or the other rather than straddling both in this way  as a technical achievement this film should not be missed but it should not be mistaken for more than it is  a glorified 1970s war movie  any who truly doubt this should reflect that the makers of this film saw no moral complications in adapting it into a succesful series of computer games in which war is once again an exciting and heroic game,reality
this is a movie about a mother that has four sons and three of them die on the same day so there is a search team launched to find the last brother this movie has a great plot and it shows the horrors of war this movie is mostly about the aftermath of war for the first fortyfive minutes or so the movie is all fighting and it is all very realistic you can even see the bullets cutting thru the water but after that it is about the struggle to get to someone to save there life and send them home,reality
captain john miller james im here to tell you your brothers were killed in combat theyre dead private which one sir captain john miller all of themthis is the most realistic war film i have ever seen it relay shows the horror and point less ness of all wars not just world war iipeople say that it is hared to sit though the first hour but i think that if you dont sit though the first hour you are missing the point the first hour is war war is death blood and murder and the rest of the film is the aftermath the affect war has on inveiglesevery single member of cast and crew should be commended on the quality of this filmps i also think that george bush and tony blair should be treated to a private screening,reality
this movie is amazing not only is it a great war movie but it is also a great window on the human psyche i can say that its a movie about honor but its so much more than that its about everything else as well there really are no words to explain what this movie is about except that it is a lesson on honor andeverything else this is a really bad review but i would be dumbfounded if an adequate description of the underlying lesson existed its a feeling you get when you watch the movie it makes you rethink the rules of war versus basic survival instincts and war reflects everything that happens in life i take that back war magnifies every human emotion and human reaction this movie does a magnificent job at portraying it,reality
this was one heck of a war movie i enjoyed every second of it tom hanks does a tremendous performance as always all the characters played a key role in the movie one of vin diesals first movies too this movie he could actually act in though barry pepper plays the sniper who does well enough to pull off the job but doesnt quite fit the role to convince me enough but i really liked him in this movie giovani ribisi i feel does the best as the medic ribisi needs more exposure and he could win an oscar one day i cant find a movie which tops this one off enemy at the gates black hawk down thin red line and even full metal jacket just didnt quite capture my eye enough to convince me of the reality of war,reality
in my opinion this is the best movie ever put together  i was taken at how an average joes war story could unzip wars most disgusting moments it made me realized what our forefathers faught for just so that i may live free and in peace a lesson i think a lot of young people dont take seriously  for this i think that the script was cleverly written  if you seen this movie you would agree at how well the cinemetography and script captured bullets whizzing by body parts getting blown to pieces and the soldiers emotions  not that i am into gore but i think to have capture the realism this way was truly amazing  finally what better choice than tom hanks to play the led role  a versital actor that deserves the oscar ten times over,reality
from the literally breath taking opening sequence which immediately became a standard which newer movies would only try to touch gladiator to the brilliant photography and sound unprecedented cinematic achievements that spielberg became very fond of i think he used the enr process in minority report as well and the oscar worthy performances of every single leading actor so what exactly is missing what possible thing makes one of the best and not maybe the best war movie of all time its the final message i though that just ending the movie with the elderly comforted by the thought that he was indeed a good man who lived his life the best he could was just to trivial to be inserted in the movie and of course spielberg had to take a long final shot of the american flag despite the fact that the movie was almost completely fictional when it came to the plot but despite these flaws the movie is spectacular and is one of the best movies of 1998 falling in second place to the thin red line which should have won every oscar it was nominated for but then again loosing to shakespeare in love hurts every bit as much a visual triumph war never looked so real and brutal 810,reality
i just saw and it knocked me of my feet here in europe the wo ii is still nearby and present everybody has a grandfather or another relative that survived the war and told stories about itliving and visiting the countries where it all took place you can still see the remains of that terrible war you can still find old people who still have memories and nightmares about it i have seen many movies about this war but not one of them equals this one very realistic outstanding camerawork and great acting especially by tom hanks a true masterpiece worth watching if you have the oppurtunity,reality
when i first saw the trailer for private i had high expectations because spielbergs last 2 wars films  empire of the sun and schinders list  were amazing so i couldnt wait to see and after seeing it i was very impressed and pleased with what i saw but i think it could have been much better   the ending of the film left me feeling dissapointed because i thought the ending of the film was just too nice and you probably think what the hell i am going on about but the truth of the matter is that my girlfriends grandfather was at normandy and he told me that even though they triumphed over the germans it didnt make it easier to carry on because they were used to all the bloodshed and the tragedy of world war 2 is much worse than we all think because the whole situation was a complete tragedy of war and once told me all about what happened amongst the madness i wasnt expecting the film to end the way it did so i went out and actually researched a bit about what happened before seeing the film and i just dont think that they covered it well enough for me to be totally satisfied   i would never say it was a bad film i would just say that i think a bit more could have gone into the story  a good film all the same,reality
i have just seen the movie spr and read some comments about itfirst of alli am rather disappointed by the hollywoodstyle mrspielberg uses in such an important matteri am incredibly grateful for what the alliesnamely us soldiers did to defeat the nazi murderersnow i am very scared about what happens in the name of americaif we have learned one thing about ww 2 it should belets be careful about things like honourpatriotism and nation,reality
tom hanks ranks up there with my list of favorite actors not only because of his role in this movie but other movies such as forrest gump cast awayin he plays captain john h miller who must lead his group of men into the heart of world war ii in search of private james matt damon  privates mother receives 3 telegrams informing her that 3 out of her 4 sons have been killed in the line of duty and that her son james will be given a ticket home  captain miller and the rest of his group which consists of great actors such as edward burns tom sizemore giovanni ribisi vin diesel and more try their best to fullfill the mission and get through alivegreat acting and cinematography makes this film so great  the fact that steven spielberg directed it is also a plus a,reality
yes i know what you readers must be thinking war is supposed to be violent but this was justgraphic i mean a guy crying for his mom with his appendix laying next to himneed i say more the acting was pretty good as well as the special effects if you like warmilitary movies and can handle blood and guts check this movie out 8 stars out of 10,reality
i like to contrast with thin red line  both came out in 1998 and both deal with wwii from the american perspective  yet it would be difficult to find two more radically different films  each has strong and weak points  saving privates strong point is its intense realism  viewers who were used to the traditional wwii movies of the 40s or 50s or even later wwii epics were not prepared for the intense violence of this film  for the first time we saw what sightedin mg42s and a line of mausers can do to advancing troops  this was not gratuitous it is important for us to remember that the nazis did not simply fall over the allies including our own soldiers had to fight very hard to beat themyet saving privates strength doesnt go nearly as deep as thin red line  spr is at heart a sharpened version of all the wwii movies that came before  it is a very good war movie but thats all it is  there is no deeper exploration of the characters or the nature of humanity  thats not a criticism just an observation,reality
was a very good war film but not a scratch on the great escape the film follows the story of private james francis whose brothers have been killed during the war we follow captain john miller and his team accross france looking for who is to be returned home throughout the movie thee are many refernces the easy company and th 101st airborn on which band of brothers mini series was basedi really enjoyed this film mainly because of the action involved but mostly because of the strong cast tom hanks performance was superbthe great escape was definately the best war film ive ever seen and is so much better than because of its superior cast script and action the first 15 mins of is extremely gory which will entertain some people band of brothers is just as good as and there are countless similarities between the twooverall was a very good film by steven spielberg with excellent performances from the likes of tom hanks giovanni ribisi adam goldberg and matt damon however this does not make it the greatest war film ever made for that i believe you should look at the great escape,reality
possible spoilers aheadi cannot begin to say how much i loved this movie probably the most engrossing plot line of any war movie i liked the story especially at the end because the end really makes the film what it is which is amazing the entire point of the movie is summed up in one line tell me ive lived a good life wants to have lived a good life because almost a whole squad died to bring him home this is the genius of the movie because the mission is so deadly just for saving one manthe end battle is brutally violent one guy gets stabbed slowly through the heart a couple are blown up and just about everyone else gets shot the few that are left at the end are in hysteria this movie does an excellent job of proving just how insane war can be because they sacrificed so many people just to save one,reality
i saw this in the theater and then recently borrowed a friends dvd and checked it out again i was still bothered by the beginning spoilers were taken into hanks horrorofitall  shellshocked world in the first few minutes then they reach safety behind a berm he grabs his radio man sees that his face is missing and tosses him aside like yesterdays newspaper and then tries to use a shot up radio some guy gets a ricochet in the helmet is told how lucky he is then gets watermeloned visual gags this after watching guys get torn in half by the most enveloping surroundsound machine guns and shells to ever reach the big screen it kind of made me wonder where the movie was going a deafeningly fictional account of war showing us how horrible it is okay great im totally there now am i supposed to laugh ha ha ive been a war channel junkie since watching victory at sea on pbs in my garanimals and if the insomnia channels got richard burton giving em the whatfor or even kojak piloting a sherman i am totally there as well but dont overwhelm me with awesome auditory and visual effects and then fail to effectively draw the line between serious and sarcastic determination okay no problem time to relax tell us about yourselves wow what an assault take your time filling us in on the plot the scene back on the rolling farmland with the mother and her four stars was imo the best scene in the movie okay so youre not going to blow up a dam or smoke cigars in the eagles nest thats fine so the rest of the movie is a nitpicker because it all looks great but if you sense the fatalism and the mission is not to outwit the enemy toward victory  winston rules then the vignettes on the way to your fate are all you have  the countryside and all kept me going nearly three hours in the theater but zipping around with the dvdokay gripes on the vignettesthat sniper tower was not 450 yards awaythree civilians left in the village all hanging out out on the recently remodeled second floor verandaif a wall falls down and the enemy is pointing guns at you you open fire immediately they wouldhey guys keep your heads down or at least show us somebody representing a sentinel especially in a scene in which were not sure if youve taken out that positionthat halftrack didnt see youa couple of sparkling tankbusters straight from the reno air races do a flyover and its surrendermonkey time anyway good fun but not for the squeamish,reality
im in two minds about this one folksthe opening is magnificent possibly the greatest achievement in us film history to this date the reality of these sequences are breathtaking and spielberg along with his cast and crew should get enormous credit for it as a whole however this one is a disappointmentin spite of the marvellous work of recapturing the stress and anguish of the common soldier of a major modern military conflict i would say that spielberg and his scriptwriter spoils most of it by creating a line of clichs both when it comes to the characters involved and the dialogue between them in my opinion there is no place in a feature like this one for the kind of conversations the characters get involved in im thinking here mainly of the pathetic attempts to turn everyone of the main characters into noble heroes and do it just in time before the great german assault which brings me to another point of complaint the portrayal and behaviour of the german soldiers they are with a single exception anonymous characters whos only role in this film is to get gunned down by the invincible well im overstating this in order to prove a point but youll hopefully get the idea american troopers im the first to admit that the combat scenes are formidably done set with an accute sense of reality to them thats rare in wwii related films nevertheless spielberg falls into another pitfall by portraying his single german identifiable soldier as a traitor both to his own countrymen and his american captors this is all in the spirit of the classical dehumanisation of the germans in hollywood wwiiproductions theyre usually in any feature just to be used as extras mowed down in the pursuit of freedom i feel that a greater depth is lost when these stereotypes are repoduced yet again in a feature that promised to be and perhaps still is a classic in spite of these reservations i would like to congratulate mr spielberg and his cast and crew on a great achievement only sligthly tarnished by the points ive mentioned above,reality
the german tiger tank in saving was actually a russian t34 with an upper body crafted to resemble a tiger the wheels were the giveaway along with the tracks a tiger was a much larger tank overall someone did a good job creating this faux tiger infact i wouldnt be too surprised if this was the same one that was in kellys heroes because it also had the t34 running gear since ww2 production of the tiger one was only about 1200 and the war took a huge toll of them its only natural not to be able to come up with a real one for a movie,reality
nothing in cinema will bring you as close to being intheaction as the normandy landing scene in the opening minutes of the film the realism is striking and not glitzedup or shown from too far overheadas is often the case if theres a man who has spent time in his nations uniform that wasnt openly crying at the end of this movie ive yet to meet him a true tribute to those who have served their country with honor,reality
i just finshed watching this film 2 days ago i found it good this film is a classic and should put in the history books as a good tom hanks castawayflick it had a good backup cast such as tom sizemorepearl harbour givovanni ribbis boiler room and matt damon good will hunting i would recomed this film to anyone its cool,reality
its hard to argue spielberg cant shoot a beautiful picture  rarely if ever has a film so accurately portrayed the horrific consequences of warthat said despite excellent acting jobs by the cast the film suffers from a frequent spielberg curse  that of the ohsoobvious moral theme and the dreaded bookendsthe scenes of the old man weeping at the end of the film in my mind ruins its message  clearly after the scene on the bridge where miller hanks tells damon earn this we can see all of the evils and horrors this man has absorbed and will carry for the rest of his life  it is unnecessary to see the older fifty years later having proved he took his captains words to heartultimately its still a great film  and one thats worth seeing if not for all of the actors who were somewhat unknown at the timeit is not however worth seeing ted danson in any way shape or form,reality
is a great movie and in my opinion the quintessential war movie this is a gripping motion picture with superb acting and exquisite direction that dday scene will undoubtedly go down in history as one of the greatest movie scenes ever see this movie bye,reality
spielberg showcases his genious again  after taking us back to wwii in schindlers list and showing us the horrors of the holocaust private brings us to the horrors of the front lines  the first 30 minutes of the film is uncompramising  the film does not let up as it shows us the brutalities of war and in my view the greatest war scenes everthis is my all time favourite film along with the silence of the lambs i have had relatives fight in wwii and this film just gave me added respect for what they did for meall of us for that matter  there is one scene that matches the power of all the war scenes im sure youll know what scene i am speaking of  it has no fighting no bombs no blood,reality
i thought that was a really good film and it should have won the best picture oscar but one thing gets on my nerves with hollywood world war 2 moviesfor people who didnt know britan and france were also in the war and won the war against germany with america america did not do it all alone as many brits and french soldiers died on the normandy beaches along with the americans same as u571 as the british also got the code machines plus i just want to say this now all british people dont speak with a nice posh accent in fact about 90 of the population dont i just want to see a hollywood picture with a normal englishman not a stupid posh one oh and i would also like to actually see some englishmen in world war moviesanyway back to the movie it is very good ive actually been to those places were they are set and i believed that they were actually filmed there acting was superb and as in all speilbergs films the directing was top notchso it was good film but would have been better if the english were credited with the beach invation because my grandad did it and i dont see any record on this film visually about the risks that the brits took as well as the americansoverall 910,reality
the reason this film is so successful is that it sidesteps the corniness which can go hand in hand with so many war movies the characters are tantalisingly out of reach yes you find out snippets one of the troops recollection of his mother coming home from work and an anecdote abouts brothers but what makes this film special is the way that when asks captain miller to elaborate on his wife miller simply said that some things are for him alone the fact that their lives back home are only occasionally hinted at actually gives the band of soldiers incredible dimension i do not need to celebrate the awesome battle scenes or the moment when edith piaf sings out of the deserted town before the battle others have done that simply be prepared for an unforgettable experience,reality
was a good movie it wasnt excellent but very good it was better than the movie which won the oscar that year it had some good history in it good history indeed the only excellent part of this movie is the dday invasion it seemed very realistic it was bloody too and a half out of ,reality
the first twenty minutes are some of the most remarkable scenes ever filmedthe violence and brutality is shocking and believablethe rest of the movie cannot live up to thisbut it holds your attentionthe acting is goodthe only weak part is soldiers talking about the meaning of life late one night afitting tribute to those who sacrificed their youth for freedom 810,reality
this was such a good movie i think it deserved an academy award this and pearl harbor were both really good wwii movies everything about it was really good i have nothing bad to say about this movie the acting was really good and so was everything else this is one of the best war movies ever made i recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good war movie or just an excellent movie period,reality
spr is really two movies the one gutsy and innovative the other improbable and in need of much suspension of disbelief on the part of the viewer the first twenty minutes of spr deal with the realities of the landing on normandy beach by the elite us army rangers this is the movie with the level of gore and computer pyrotechnics that hollywood as part wwii war propaganda machine was totally unwilling let alone incapable of showing this was what was missing from a half century of war movies the gruesome nature of true combat the psychological effect on even trained soldiers are impeccably portrayed on the other hand after the landing has been achieved were thrown into a platoon of rangers who are saddled with the unlikely task of locating a trooper private because all his brothers have already been killed although the movie now and then returns to its war movie roots the premise is so unlikely as to lose the viewer certainly the second half isnt living up to the firststill recommended,reality
this was an excellent albeit fictional dday saga which drew you in by the throat from the opening shot outstanding realism on the beach real war is like this hell not like the make believe fairy tales we were fed decades ago that glorified war if you do not weep during this film you need to loosen up and check your veins for blood top notch entertainment from the getgo shades of platoon ,reality
i first watched this movie in a theater i have since purchased the video the depiction of the landing on omaha beach was easily the most intense movie experience i have ever had  the battle in the town near the end of the movie is probably the second most intensewhen the movie ended there was total and complete silence in the theater it lasted for maybe a minute  then i could make out the sounds of patrons gently getting up out of their seats  next i could hear the soft footsteps as the people began to slowly walk out of the theater  and i could barely discern people near me talking in low and seemingly reverent tones  it was like everyone in the theater felt that they were in the presence of an awesome power that demanded and deserved the utmost respect  never have i come close to an experience like that  it was as impressive as the movie itselfsteven spielberg is a true genius,reality
this movie is a wonderful depiction of the 2nd world war  it shows the true horrors of it  it shows how sad war could really be  it also shows the gruesomeness of it  tom hanks and matt damon shine in this great war movie they shouldve won awards  it follows a group of soldiers who have to find a young man whose three brothers just died  the whole group of men are tough as nails and really cool  the battles are pretty intense and very goryoverall the whole movie is really excellent and brought out perfectly rating 10 out of 10,reality
is one of the best films i have ever seen the direction by steven spielberg for this film is absolutely brilliant and the performances by every essential cast member are breathtaking and unforgettable spielberg graphically shows the harsh realities of war and the brotherhood of every soldier involved tom hanks performance in this film is a work of art a brilliant performance by a brilliant actor the screenplay is successfully written and provides a hell of a story it is because of these key elements that the film is brilliant it is truly one of spielbergs best works however the only thing wrong with this film are the occasional hilarities of the film they sometimes drag off the importance of this story and what the director hopes to achieve from this other than that the film is one of the best films ever made and should have won the best picture of 1998,reality
it may be silly to say this but i feel like i just survived world war ii but thats silly of course i never fought in world war ii  im only eighteen years old  but i still feel like i survived the war because i just watched steven spielbergs saving privatewith most reviews i write for imdb i begin writing with a sense of purpose i know what i want to say and how i want to say it  this time im at a loss  shocked me out of any senses i had left it disturbed me more than many other movies films ever had  in fact the only comparable film i can even think of is another by spielberg schindlers list  both classify as what i call superrealism  the film is so realistic so believable that one immediately forgets that they are watching actors on celluloid and is transported to the actual eventsuch is the case with this entire film especially the opening dday invasion  the outstanding acting crew of tom hanks edward burns tom sizemore among others become real soldiers  we fight along side them when people suffer we cannot help but feel their paini think the most striking thing about this film from a technical perspective was the phenomenal cinematographer of janusz kaminski  as he did with schindlers list kaminski achieves a consistent newsreel effect but this time the camerawork is more frantic more likely to take us by surprise particularly during the dday sequence we are as confused and blindsided as many of the actual soldiers and this adds to the intensity  beyond kaminski everybody involved deserves a standing ovation or perhaps more fittingly a salute for making a film this greati feel like im getting hysterical and i really dont want to  suffice it to say that is a phenomenal film capable of extraordinary emotional impact able to make us week tremble and practically scream out with nearagony  this film conveys the truth about war and only those who do not fear the truth will be able to watch it  of course a warning is needed  few films are as graphically violent as this one but few have as much of a reason to beif nothing else ive yet said made any sense maybe this will  see  or better yet experience out of ,reality
i had purposely not gone to see at the theater since i have a difficulty with war depicted at an entertainment venue  but it rolled over me when least expected  after a headbanging day while on a business trip i thought just dive into a motel and watch tv  i got the last 45 minutes of instead of frazier and couldnt turn it off this is a military boot camp training film as it can and should be with all the chaos sound and death given straight up  it turned my stomach as it should anyone elses whoever has one  this is how war must be presented on screen to convince others of its total destructiveness before decisionmakers decide to enter it and before herowannabes go too rah rah by joining it  the film is not entertainment it is a fleeting glimpse so intense but capable of leaving a necessary imprint  it is a vision of death shy of its totality but demanding of your attention  it misses one point from the battlefield  the pervasive smell of death that never leaves your brain,reality
a film that should be shown to every person on earth when they reach the age of 18 maybe then well get lucky and stop killing each otherits a true masterpiece on film on the horror of wartake the cinematographers of this film to london and get them deservedly knighted,reality
it is important to see the act of as symbolic of wwii soldiers sacrifices made to give us the lives we now have sacrifices they made even when they couldnt see their part in the larger picture this is why the film is bookended with the old man and his family we see the results of the sacrifice of millers squad results  they couldnt see as their friends are being pickedoff around themwe are private our way of life was saved by soldiers who fought and died for a cause beyond themselves even when they couldnt always see the logic in itthe ferocity of the battle scenes are necessary for the audience to begin to appreciate the horror that real men endured so that we could have the life we now enjoythe soldiers of wwii fought even when it was hard to give us the lives we now have now it is our responsibility even when it is hard to make something worthwhile out of the life they died forthis is the point of saving private,reality
im not especially a fan of war movies ie i turn them off the instant i determine that theyre a war movie maybe this movie represents the culmination of special effects acting and directing that is necessary to make a successful war moviei like movies that mean something and i like directors who make movies that mean something i cant help but compare this spielberg movie with his other wwii movie schindlers list both films have detailed wwii in ways that are at the same time nakedly objective and blatantly subjectivespielberg tries to scrape some humanity from the holocaust in schindlers list while at the same time offering up the horrific imagery that was the reality he manages to do the same thing in saving privatejohn miller an army officer leads a team of wwii soldiers on a mission to find james whose three brothers have been killed in the war will be sent home thanks to a highranking officer who decides that it would be unacceptable for the family to receive yet one more notice of deaththroughout the film the characters question the value of saving one person in the midst of the destruction and murder of many other soldiers the reality of war and the movie hits home when miller amidst losing men and trying to find another to send home convinces his men to risk their lives because the main objective is to win the warthere are some many different levels on which this film is chilling and this movie is especially good at portraying how characters in their different stages of life interpret whats going on and really nobody is right and nobody is wrong great movie,reality
of all war movies that i have seen this is without a doubt number one this movie is loaded with action and suspense  it shows the disturbing realities of war so ive been told  it really made me appreciate what i have thanks to those who fought so hard and gave up so much  the dolby digital track is awesome  there are scenes in the movie where german tanks are rolling by in close proximity to the camera and the rumble coming from the sub in my home theater probably made my neighbors look out their windows in fear of a panzer in their driveway  from bullets whizzing by to airplanes flying over the 51 is top notch  if i had to pick only one movie to have in my collection this would be it,reality
the opening twenty minute scene offered me more than most of the rest of the film it should have been more heavily edited and the tricks that spielberg has used so successfully in his past blockbusters could and should have been foregone in this picture i have never given him much credit as a filmmaker beyond his ability to make films that lots of people like to see which is worth something its true but with the exception of schindlers list i havent found much to look at in his films and even less to pay attention to in terms of plot most of his films spr even are the basic western prototype with good guy v bad guy that can be fine too but i really wanted him to convince me of something to move me with this film i was heavily persuaded by the wonderful interview piece by hendrik hertzberg in the new yorker a few weeks ago into believing that spielberg was trying to make a smart difficult realistic film and to some degree he did but where was the swearing is it true that only white men fought in wwii did soldiers really even in the heat of battle immediately dive into the pockets of their dead buddies for the dear mom and dad letters i dont know the answers to these questions yet i think this is an important film i think many scenes were filmed very well i think it would be a very meaningful and intense film for a wwii veteran for those like me who did not fight in that war i think it missed something to make me feel invested to really move me  im not an overlycallous or violent person nor do i in any way enjoythat is take real pleasure inheavy duty war scenes yet i never had to look away and it seems that i should have felt compelled to do that at some point and i went into this film expecting that,reality
this movie is a masterpiece of direction the landing scene is one of the best scenes in the history of movie making but lets not get carried away now let me tell you what this movie is all aboutthe whole thing about saving a private whose brothers have all been killed isnt at the root of this story it is just a pretext to put some men in life or death situations and see how they react the whole movie is a metaphor of war all wars wars are used to have more lands more power thousands millions of men die in a war to please these people who want these lands or this power in the movie men fight and die for something that seems so insignificant the life of one man all these men get slaughtered for that one thing that is so important for some but seems so stupid to us so the movie is in fact a transposition of war in a context where we know all of the characters so that we dont see a man who dies just as a simple private but as a human being i think that was the only way to show us all the horror of war itself and i think spielberg knew that,reality
wow  i was left with a really sick feeling in my stomach just after the first 15 minutes  this film must have the most realistic battle scene ever  especially the underwater shots  the way the american gis are slaughtered is unbelievable  the film has the shock value of the nam films but also has the feelgood factor in the fact that the enemy gets what he deserves  personally i didnt have any sympathy for the surrendering nazis being shot especially after the results of one of them being released  tom hanks character is excellent  a ruthless killing machine with a sensitive school teacher  i felt the film was a bit americanised  all the soldiers were american but it reminds you if the good ole usa hadnt helped us out all us brits would be speaking german and eating sauerkraut by now ,reality
a lot of people had some great things to say about this film im gonna lay them all together1 this movie rode on the battle scenes  although the reality and brutality shown is unprecedented in the war film genre the actions scenes arent supposed to carry the movie although apparently they can and did for spr2 any depth  i find it funny that kubrick and speilberg were close friends because kubrick is an intellectual and an artist where speilberg is just a very succesful hollywood director  i cant help but compare full metal jacket with  the main difference is that fmj is lacking the same number of barrels of blood and it replaces that with irony cynicism and black comedy  the final message of spr earn this is powerful but not very intellectually challenging compared to all the messages flying through fmj3 being a canadian we fought the hardest beach on dday and got the farthest inland i find it difficult to but this whole im an american and that makes me a rambo the flag waving wasnt excessive but the ending rambo scene seemed contrived good thing that god sent 7 americans to guard this bridgei dont buy it4 it is deplorable the way that speilberg lacked any compassion for the enemy he made no attempt to humanize them i watched as germans who were surrendering were shot but i hated them so much that i was glad they were and for that ill never forgive speilberg  it is commendable that he could make me feel such strong emotions but these germans are people too everyone walking out of the theatre is getting this subtle message look what the germans did to us  thats not right and thats not a good antiwar messageoverall i commend speilberg for leaving a record of wwii and normandy which will stick with us forever,reality
steven spielberg has shown again his wonderful talent in personally i dont like to watch warlike movies they always look the same they always say the same they are the same thing each time i see one but steven spielberg just has told us that a warlike movie might be a good movie he did a great job at the schindlers list and he did it again in saving privatethe reality of this movie is even scary it makes you think what would happen if a war would start now and what would i do on front of somebody that would shoot all my partners would i be strong enough he is asking that to each person that watches the movie he is asking that what would you do that is why i think is a scary movie it looks so real that makes you think you are one of those people and that in any time the guy next sit will get shot or even that yourself is about to get shotnot everybody is ready for a war most of the people is not ready for a war and many people is not even ready to see one of the best movies ever donei cant believe shakespeare in love was considered better for the acadamics that was a shame shakespeare in love is not bad just not as goodin my opinion if you think that you are ready to see blood to see violence to see the way world war ii was go and enjoy the movie at the same time you think that the human being is the most dumb think in the earth and thank steven spielberg to let you know it,reality
this is not an easy film to watch clearly that was not its intent  the story begins in current time at the normandy american cemetary in france  an elderly man followed by his family walks as if compelled toward a single grave  when he arrives there his memory takes a different journey back to the beaches below on the date 6 june 1944from this moment on especially for the ensuing 25 minutes we are thrust into a story that if it is hard to view must certainly have been harder to live  as the troop transports approach omaha beach the eerie sense of calm gives way to a landscape that when all is said and done is one of the most powerful statements ever put on filmwhen all is said and done two brothers surnamed have died on the beaches of normandy  another has died within a week in the pacific  it is discovered that a sole surviving brother has parachuted somewhere in france it is the assignment of a survivor of normandy and his platoon to find this brother and return him homedirector steven spielberg is a master at bringing emotion to the surface and he does it once again with a film which is gutwrenching  however the movie isnt all blood and gore its the story of young men and boys who fought and died to preserve a way of life and to eliminate the evil that they sawtom hanks heads the cast as capt john miller the man who is given the mission to find pvt and bring him home  in one sense it works against the film to know that matt damon plays pvt james but not so much that you cant appreciate the nuances which miller and his platoon come up against time and time again during their missioni agree with those who say that spielberg puts us his audience into the film and sweeps us up and carries us along from the opening moments until the films end  it is a masterful piece of filmmaking that makes us feel that we have survived although we were never in dangeris a masterpiecemy vote  11,reality
spr is a film like no other before it  for the first time ever the realism and gruesome detail of war is there for all who dare to face it  starting on perhaps the most significant day in history dday it follows the story of captain john miller tom hanks and his band of soldiers as they search for one james matt damon who has lost all three brothers and has been given a ticket home to be with his motherthe soldiers sent to save private question the motive of risking eight lives for one a stranger a faceless name for which few survive in trying to complete their mission to get home safelythe footage is graphic  when the hatches on the landing boats open bodies are literally torn apart by high calibre machine gun bullets  booming explosions agonizing screams the whine of bullets richocheting  at the conclusion of the initial battle all that remains is a sea of blood washing ashore  it is immersive and i for one was left speechless and literally shakingsome have criticised the acting in particular the relative unknowns in the supporting cast but i believe such criticisms are harsh  the quality of the supporting cast with tom sizemore and ed burns plus a cameo by ted danson combined to make the acting quite good  tom hanks as always was oscarworthy portraying the huge burden of an ordinary english teacher leading men into battle knowing many men under his command will not be going homespr is definitely the best war film and one of the best films period the very least you should get out of is an appreciation of war and what those men experienced in trying to protect the worlds freedom  lest we forget,reality
steven spielberg received rave reviews last year when his movie made it to the multiplexes in the united states and europebecause of this my expectations where quite high although i had some fears that the director best known for movies like jaws et and more recently jurassic park would lack the skill of making the transition from pure entertainment into serious drama to be fair is not his first stab at serious moviemaking spielberg directed the excellent schindlers list in 1993sadly when i went to see last fall my high expectations where proved wrong the only thing that makes this  film stand out compared to other warmovies are the much talked about battlesequences which are outstanding in conveying the brutality of warbut a movie of this magnitude can not stand on battle sequences alone it needs substance and saving private lacks it all the characters are only mildly interesting you do  not care about their plight and ordeal when not fighting for their lives they engage in a quasiphilosophical discussion about the validity of their mission is it right to sacrifice a handful of soldiers with the purpose of rescuing one manprivate the question is an intriguing one but it takes up too much time at the expense of characterdevelopmentwe dont really get to know their motives their fears and what makes them happy this is what separates good movies from bad ones to me this is just another actionmovie but with little else to addit seems to me that the movies which are made today emphasizes style and action at the expense of real substance one of the reasons for the excellent reviews it has received must be that the public and critics alike where overwhelmed by the outstanding battle sequences and its realistic depiction of gore in 20th century combat but as i have said earlier that does not necessarily make for a compelling moviefor those of you who share my opinion with the respect of this movie i highly recommend das boot by wolfgang petersen  the iron cross by sam peckinpah and paths of glory by stanely kubrick all in their own right superb movies that in every respect are better than with the exception of the battlesequences,reality
i have seen many war movies with different points of view about different wars and different geographic locations during those wars i have never seen such a powerful and realistically shot film i have never been to war but after watching this film i left the theatre feeling i had it is an amazing film word of caution have the dvd but it doesnt do it justice this film must be seen on the big screen,reality
ive always considered myself a fan of speilberg he has consistently turned out fine entertaining work as a serious filmmaker he excels as a director of slick entertainments he also excels unlike many who believe schindlers list has been his masterpiece i feel et was a greater acheivement as good as schindlers list was and it was very very good its impact seemed at times forced all this aside nothing could prepare me for the film is not the work of a great director it is the work of a worldclass artist it is stunning it is devastating it works where it should not work it works where you do not want it to work it is a simple war film it is an intellectual challenge it is cold and distant it is raw and emotional i have never seen or experienced anything quite like it before the only film i can remember reacting to in such a way is pasolinis great and repugnant film salo both are kicks in the gut both and im sure there are not many admirers of salo out there are cries from the depths that eventually by their ends not only expose human evils but also depict hope and dignity i cannot say enough for all i can say is experience it for yourself,reality
as my wife and i packed our rented ryder truck to move from florida to chicago my neighbor came walking by with his small white dog  i had seen this man with his little dog that was so small that it looked like it should have batteries walk by my place for the better part of a year but never had a conversation with him  he stopped by then and we chatted amicably about little things like the weather etc  as we talked i noticed a small brass pin on his ball cap that said dday veteran  i was amazed i collect all kinds of info on wwii airplanes and here was an opportunity to actually talk with a dday participant  we chatted longer about those times and he invited me into his home to show me his souveniers of that period of his life  there in an old newspaper clipping was a picture of a younger him indicating he had gone ashore at dog green sector of omaha beach  i cannot tell you the awe i felt in this mans presence  for the uninitiated this was the same sector that tom hanks company was to have gone ashore in saving privateready for the last coincidence  my last name isthis movie has only one flaw i can see  we could have done nicely without the bookends of the old man at the tomb of capt miller  it was a very touching scene to be sure but distracting to the movie as a whole,reality
this was without a doubt the best war movie ive seen ever yes the gore was a bit much but it was only to summarize real war steven spielberg and tom hanks both did a fantastic job i think everyone should see this movie some time in their lifetime in a rating from one to ten i give it a ten,reality
congrats to spielberg for another masterpiece to add to his list this movie shows how godawful war really is to those people who thought this movie was overrated or whatever well those are your opinions and to spielberg i am awaiting another one of your masterpieces truly the best war film ever made,reality
the single most powerful film i have seen since schindlers list the opening and closing scenes are technically brilliant and punch you right in the gut  the best direction  cinematography i have ever scene in a film everybody that i know who has scene this film has had tears in their eyes by the endthe film does lose a little steam in the middle but not enough to make it a bad film as others have said it just pales a bit in comparison with the explosive opening and closing battles some quibble that spielberg caters to peoples emotions and relies on that for his films impact of course he doesiliciting emotion is what makes a film powerful it has to affect you for you to care about whats happening spielberg has a gift for knowing what buttons to push and while not all of his films are perfect its why he will some day if not already be regarded as the best american director of all timethe best film of 1999 and possibly the decade it was robbed at the oscars a 10,reality
for a war film which purports to adhere to great levels of realism here are a few thoughts having been there i can attest to the general realism of the filmie the panic and confusion on the assault beach and the poppopping of the cooling german 20mm machine gun but there are two big exceptions gis are always ravenous and always exhausted the characters in this film werent realthey never ate and they never slept just imagine how much energy was expended with the real gi first they probably got little or no sleep the night before the assault and then expended high amounts of nervous energy and adrenalin in the landing craft on the way to the beach second the extraordinary life and death situation on the beach would have depleted massive reserves of strength and also raised adrenalin levels to the critical point  lastly when the beach was secured and the battle over these men would have been near to or considerably past a state of exhaustion further into the film we see the squad traveling considerable miles on foot and like the energizer bunny they just kept going and going and going lastly hanks was the wrong actor for the part,reality
forget platoon forget full metal jacket this is the real thing closer to the blood guts and madness of war than ever before this one grabs your throat and squeezes you mildly throughout leaving you dizzy and with a wrenching stomach and with thoughts lots of thoughts that you wont digest in the first few days,reality
well it has been a week since i saw this movie and six days since i posted my last comment on it see august 2nd  and to tell the truth not a whole lot has changed in the impact this film has hadcertainly the images have started to fade and i cant remember every single nuance and camera angle any more the names of the characters have all but faded from my brain much of the movie has gone the way of movies in the past  gone to make way for the every day humdrum of lifehowever there is one thing that hasnt faded  the distinct feeling of respect for life and perhaps even a newfound appreciation for it  this movie is powerful  im not saying that as someone who gets easily moved by movies  but as someone who watched this epic film and hasnt been quite the same sincei can no longer take life for granted  i attempted to watch volcano the other day and couldnt finish it because the death scenes disgusted me  they seemed too contrived for ratings  and these are the same scenes that i had no problem with not too long agofor those who dont believe that this movie is important or think that it too is contrived youre the reason this film was made and the reason that others gave their livesi may not agree with your opinion but will defend with my life your right to have itanyway i thought it would be nice for someone more than two days removed from this film to show that if you allow yourself to take more from this film than war is hell it will affect you for some time to comecr,reality
mr spielberg i loved your holocaust masterpiece schindlers list most of all modern hollywood films this one is just another blockbuster made just for money and fame he spielberg took the first to mention representor hollywood  tom hanks bad decision tom hanks is so positive in hollywood  no doubht  he and only he should play capitain miller  our world hero the choice of matt damon was not your best idea either all your film is just  showingoff american dream george washington silly stuff like that but please understand that no one in the world exept usa cares about this and washington awful and stupid plot combines with superb directing and as a result the script fails the whole feature but i can say that you should watch it because of the wonderful cinematography by janusz kaminski mr kaminski  you are the best youre a magician,reality
i didnt see this movie in the theatre but i thought it was good for what i could sit through some parts were just too gory for me to handle it didnt change my opinion of war ive always thought it was horrible very good story and good acting see this movie if youve got a strong stomach the first 12 hour is particularly gory just a warning the rest of it isnt quite as badi was impressed by this movie the visual and sound effects were very realistic so realistic it was almost frightening can you believe people would do such horrible things to each other in conclusion this movie disgusted and amazed me,reality
the academy has missed again there is no possible way that shakepeare in love is better than this the greatest war epic of the last twenty years further tom hanks should have received his third best actor oscar for another terrific performancethe battle scenes were far greater and realistic than any other battle scenes in any other movie of its kind except for all quiet on the western front and perhaps the very underrated gettysburg of a few years backbest pure war movie since patton far better than the overrated platoon and apocalypse now flickshow could the academy give platoon the nod and not this is unbelievable because this movie is ten times better than platoon  the movie is not preachy and antiwar there is no unneccesary vulgarity or nudity no evil soldiers it is straight to the point with a poignant storyline and the realism is frighteningthe scene where the jewish soldier is killed by a german knife is one for the ages in that scene we see the interplay of death with eroticism,reality
this movie was a masterpiece and steven spielberg has got to be one of the greatest directors ever to walk the earth the movies realism and the way it tackled the issues was quite breathtaking the fact that there were people walking out of the cinema during the opening scene does justice to the realism of this film it also shows the horrific reality that is war,reality
this movie was great ive seen a lot of war movies but this one is the best by far great character development loads of detail and emotion spielberg goes into a very great amount of detail with every scene bullets are flying everywhere and unlike gi joe when a group of people fire hundreds of rounds people are bound to get killed this movie really puts things into perspective and shows you just how many sacrafices are made during war too many to say the least makes you apreciate the type of life that you got now and why you are able to live that life the acting in this film was excellent as expected with a hanks spielberg type of movie not for people with weak stomaches that for sure,reality
is something quite special in the 1990s pantheon of hollywood movies it stays with you long after you have left the cinema and truly makes you reflect on what you have just seen artistically it is a triumph the cinematography is breathtaking shot as it is with a handheld documentary style and the performances too are superbwith naturalistic dialogue and astoundingly realistic battle scenes it works so well because it defies the cliches laid before it as a genre which even full metal jacket and platoon  fell unwittingly intoacknowledges that death can come to all or any of the characters at any time brutally even when you expect the characters you admire the mostthrough careful development to survive and that is how it should be because that is the nature of true conflict the only downpoint is the portrayal of the americans as having been the sole allied forces involved in the war and beach landings when this was clearly not the caseis moving powerful and thought provoking one of the best world war ii films ever mad and can stand proundly next to the classics of that genrehighly recommended though traumtic,reality
is the recent film directed by steven spielberg a director known for his audience manipulation and subsequent audience appeal he has stated in interviews that like schindlers list 1993 is a story that is meant to objectively portray warthe story begins on tuesday june 6th 1944 dday at 630am that fateful morning an initial assault wave lands at omaha beach the story proceeds to follow the story of captain john miller tom hanks and the men he commands the first thirty minutes of the film includes some of the most graphic violence known to the screen with the aid of cinematographer janusz kaminski schindlers list spielberg dispels any preconceived romantic notions of the last great war the pace is quick and the film visually mimics news cameras of the period the fighting is presented as grim and unglamorous with use of various handheld camera techniques and astounding sound effects the audience becomes part of the war another fresh technique employed is intermittent periods with hanks character is surreally caught up in the moment one must see this film just for its visual and aural aspect it truly is a lesson of history after surviving the initial attack captain miller is given a new objective to save the life of one private matt damon this comes to be due to the fact that of the fours that entered the war one remains alive or at least is thought to be alive his life is worth risking that of millers and his men from this point onward i reconsidered the films title to be saving matt damon the contrived hollywood plot was presented thus forth perhaps the life of the one is worth saving considering the lives of the many i sure as hell would like to be that one life and although a few characters suffered poignant moments adding to much of the films humanity my mind could not get over the added fiction within the history,reality
is by far one of the greatest films of all time second only to star wars no offense  tom hanks outdid  himself as captain miller and i have the upmost respect for my idol in life mr steven spielberg  he used every measure in his power to make the opening sequence of dday as visually realistic as possible  i saw spr the night it opened and i left with a deeper respect for this country and my own some of the lines in this film were memorable and i look forward to the directors cut coming out next yearout of 101110,reality
steven spielberg triumphs again this was an amazing movie the intensity of this movie is amazing with cinematography so realistic you feel like you are really there there are some scenes which are disgusting but show the horror of war like no other movie has this was the best war movie i have ever seen     tom hanks is marvelous as is tom sizemore they make a great team and give the movie even more intensity because of the friendship of the two and both of them in a war together shows the bond that grows in war and you feel their pain as well as the soldiers that die in the movie     it is moving the way this picture is put together and shows that war is more of a surreal nightmare than it is a glorious way to show your patriotism i think this movie definitely deserved the best picture award and is worth going to see dont miss it it is an excellent movie,reality
i passed this movie many times while visiting the video store i had been told it wasnt for the squeamish one of my sons came to visit and talked about of the impact it had on him after seeing it that my husband and i should watch it having been a schoolgirl during wwii i felt i had seen enough of the real thing plus plus enough war movies to last a lifetime my son insisted so we watched it and it was the most authentic war movie i have ever seen at times it was hard to keep looking at the screen when soldiers were being blown to pieces but i stuck it out after all this is what truly happened to these men who lost their lives in order that we could live a free life something they would never do i do remember seeing the sullivans in 1944  the movie about the five brothers who didnt want to be separated  but they all went down with their ship  bringing about the rule that this would never happen again to a family yes it did bring back a lot of memories but if a movie like this is watched by the younger ones theyll realize what a war is truly all about my husband feels that those who govern our countries should be made to watch this movie on a regular basis being the mother of three sons i cant imagine what life must have been like for the sullivan parents losing five sons saving privatedoes make you think very deeply about this,reality
its hard to imagine how anyone could not give this movie a 10  its not just a great story its the display of the real horrors of war instead of glorifying it that sets this film apart  its a very moving experience to watch this movie  if its not  your must be dead inside,reality
i salute and give a heartfelt thanks to all of the soldiers who fought at that dark day after seeing this movie i was amazed awed disgusted and most important of all i was proud of the allied soldiers who fought and preserved our freedomthis movie must be shown every year on memorial day,reality
certainly deserves some accolades  the now infamous omaha beach scene is probably the bestchoreographed war sequence ive ever seen  it captures the horrors of war in many respects  the confusion the bloodiness the futility of soldiers being no more than cannon fodder the direction is of course stellar  after all we are talking about spielberg  the choice to mute the colors palette to washed out greens and greys is an especially nice touchhowever spielberg refuses to lay off the schmaltz  oftentimes the scenes where he injects some humanity or includes the everyman average joe character in this case the soldierinterpreter to me appears forced the opening and closing scenes also revel in this schmaltz trying to bring the story into modern times and connecting it to todays audience  spielberg tried something similar with schindlers list with the stonepiling scene at the end  to me both movies work well enough on their own without these extras  as good of a director as spielberg is he often resorts to these overthetop techniques to jerk a tear or to invoke sadness  i wish he would show more restraint or find a less obvious way of expressing the same emotiondont get me wrong  i liked the movie well enough to give it a 7 and gladly recommend it  a bit of trimming would have made a much better film though,reality
this film is possibly the most overrated war film ever true it boasts some of the most spectacular special effects ever but the story is too unbelievable the characters paperthin and the whole thing is littered with continuity errors special effects alone do not make a film remember independence day,reality
this movie is not important  the violence is gratuitous  the plot is little more than an excuse for a movie based on bodycount  the movie is a wellmade exploitation filmimportant  war sucks  getting shot sucks  duh  a group of soldiers are tasked with getting the last living soldierbrother away from enemy lines and he doesnt want to go  simple yes  somewhat intriguing yes important  not even closeviolent  the vast bulk of this movie is composed of scenes of people being shot in the head while we watch the blood spurt out or of people getting blown in half and then dragging their torsos by their arms  the scene where the medic fixes the bleeder only to then have the soldier shot in the head is an example  amateuristically ironic  yes  gratuitous  you betcha important  hardlyrealistic  seems that way  but if i were to drive around with a videocamera and film in graphic detail all the car wrecks i came across id have a realistic movie too  would i have an important film  no  if so then driving films like blood on the highway or exploitation films like faces of death would be dubbed important and be up for oscar nominations toorealism does not an important film makeveterans deserve all the love and honor we can give for being tasked to do things as noble as keep our country free and for being tasked to do things as stupid as enforcing inane political grandstanding   ,reality
this movie is so real and and depicts what it is like to be in battle the beginning of the movie makes you wonder how these men with all there courage could go through what they did to land on those beaches in france that day  i think that anyone who sees this movie has to stop and think how much of a sacrifice was made by the real players in in that war and in any other war  i hope that those who have seen this movie will appreciate what was given by them for all that we have to day,reality
first let me explain that i am not a big war film buff  i liked platoon and a few other films of this genre but generally i do not enjoy war films i think the reason for this is that most war films seem to glorify the act of war  they try to make war look fun and cool  on the other hand shows you just how brutal war is  it puts you right into the middle of one of the most deadly battles of the entire war and makes you glad that you are not one of the soldiers on that beach  this movie makes me appreciate our veterans and their struggles even more than i did before  but most of all it makes me appreciate how lucky i am to not have to risk my life for everything i have  our veterans have already done it for us,reality
what can i say the opening sequences in fact all of the combat scenes blew me away if youll pardon the expression as for the plot and timeline obviously they had to fudge things a bit for this to become a coherent whole also a bit clicheed in some segments but overall a very good movie a little note an english film magazine asked in their review where are the other allied soldiers answer they were to the east which youd know if youd cared to do a little research on dday schmucks,reality
i have never seen a movie so moving and so intensely emotional as  the movie actually showed a person the horrific circumstances surrounding every death in the war  i began crying at the site of the young soldier with his stomach ripped open crying for his mom  and again when they showed all of the bodies littering the beach  and again when the telegrams were delivered to mrs  i did not expect this movie to be so intense and i did not expect to walk away feeling so changed inside  if i never understood before i now understand why the veterans who came back from the wars were so changed and so different  possibly the most gut wrenching scene besides the ending which i wont spoil was the scene when the german soldier was begging the americans not to kill him and singing american songs  anyone who says this movie dragged in the middle or was too sentimental or too mushy or too graphic obviously is not in touch with their emotions  this movie was by far the best i have seen in my 16 years of life,reality
what can i saywhile the world cried gruesome i saw it four times in two weeks  great film spielberg is god he rules its a great film go watch it now  superb performances great cinematography and mindblowing direction its the movie,reality
as i sit down to write these comments the credits are rolling so the event is as fresh in my mind as possible  it is difficult to write as i struggle to control my sobs  as a us army veteran i feel a special connection to the story and to those who fought and sacrificed all between 1939 and 1945 i separated from the army just as operation desert shield commenced in 1990 and have always secretly felt disappointed that i missed military service in a combat theater and somewhat jealous of my brother who did serve there after seeing steven spielbergs graphic representation of the horrors of close combat i no longer feel such disappointment or jealousy  instead i feel thankful that providence led me far out of harms way unlike two soldiers in my former unit who did die in saudi arabia  if mr spielberg was trying to convey the message that war is a terrible thing that ought to be avoided he definitely succeeded with me,reality
perhaps it is in the nature of war films to be devoid of a sensible plot and realistic script call me old fashioned but these are important considerations when reviewing a film  that is not to say that i necessarily consider this to be an inferior war film but rather that it is not the complete war film  this is a spielberg film and it plays to his strengths with magnificent special effects which bring to bear the inherent nakedness of war  i couldnt help but be for wont of a better word shellshocked by preserving the film in this form almost as a documentary spielberg would have been onto a winning formula from the cinematic viewpoint although perhaps not from the bank balance viewpoint  unfortunately spielberg did as spielberg does putting into place a script and moralising undercurrent both lacking in any sort of subtlety which might work well in films like jaws or et but serve only to blunt ones reactions to the raw images of the inhumanity of warin sum i consider this to be a visually astonishing and moving film but one which is ultimately impaired by the banalities and simplicity of the screenplay,reality
i seriously doubt that there is anything i can say about this movie that has not already been said i felt that it was one of the classic war movies i have ever seen the direction was brilliant in fact i would say that was the number one asset secondarily tom hanks was great and so was the intensity of the action  almost unparalleledi nitpicked on a couple things  as i am prone to do but the main reason i didnt give it a 10 was simply because like schindlers list it was too depressing i will never give a depressing movie a 10 now dont get me wrong i didnt think it was that depressing but the fact that 8 men set out to bring back one and that most of the 8 i wont say how many in case you are the only one who hasnt seen it die trying to bring him back is a formula that i have a hard time with emotionally interestingly the movie deals with that very subject and allows us to develop our own opinionbe warned however there are lots and lots and lots of dead soldiers and lots and lots and lots of dead soldiers parts,reality
first off i should preface my comments by saying that although this was an excellent film it isnt for everyone  the intense graphic in your face nature of the presentation will be too much for some viewers to handlethe opening sequence is extremely well done  i was literally shaking after seeing the horror which faced those involved in the dday assault  the camera angles combined with the gritty high contrast filming give the whole film a documentary feel  unlike other war documentaries manages to pull the viewer deeply into the actionmy only negative comments relate to the underlying premise for the movie which seems rather farfetched  i also felt that in some cases the special effects exaggerated things a bit more than they should have  but those are minor faults in an otherwise top rate film,reality
when is the life of one man greater than the lifes of 8 this is one of the issues raised in steven speilbergs great war epic  saving privateset during the d day invasion it follows 8 soldiers led by captain john miller tom hanks who must venture behind enemy lines in order to find and retrieve private james whos 3 brothers have been killed in actionthere are many who have said that this film includes to much gore and over the top violence and in some way i must agree in any war not everyone will have parts of their bodies blown off but equally the film is trying to destroy a myth that so many have that in some twisted way war is glamorous the majority of war films will simply have a soldier shot and fall to the ground with a minimum of blood lost if this were the case then there would not have been so many soldiers who returned from wars minus limbsthis film deals with many of the human aspects of war similar in certain ways to  the thin red line  soldiers are expected to obey orders without thought or question no matter how impossible or crazy the orders may bea solid cast hold this film together for 2hr 40minutes with tom hanks well cast in the role of captain john miller and mat damon as private james each and every one of the main actors in this film will stay in your mind after you have seen this film and is because of them and speilberg that this film is as good as it is i feel speilberg has dealt with a strong subject with the same level of sensitivity which was shown with schindlers list  it maybe painful to remember but equally it is important not to forget the past or the same mistakes could be made again no one should ever have to go through another war like thatif you are looking for a film with a strong story line then i can think of none better than this i dont think there can be a person alive who after watching this film will not look upon war in a completely different light and remember the sacrifices which were made,reality
the main thing that i realized when this movie reached its conclusion was that there was many occasions of irony now if you saw the movie you should be able to tell what im talking aboutbesides the irony the beginning scene was horrific in the gruesome sense but true to life to the smallest characteristic whether it was people loosing limbs from a grenade while hiding or someone being shot down with numerous bullets while running away you almost thought you were watching a real war sceneit was also touching in numerous ways one way was that you got so emotionally attached to some of the characters that searched for private when they were killed off for one reason or another you couldnt help but get a tear in your eye and if you didnt you obviously arent part of the human raceso if you think that this movie is just another shoot em up war type movie youll absolutely wrong it has a fabulous story line to go along with the life like war shots a definite to watch and to own go now,reality
ive always been fascinated about the subject of wwii having read many books on the subject until now however it was always somewhat distant and surreal i looked at photographs of the war and thought how amazing that such an event could have ever taken place and how i admire and respect the men who gave their lives in defense of freedom a man i know was recently decorated by the president for his part in dday and i asked him if he had been scared at the time he told me that the truth of the matter was that all of the kids in the boats were really unaware of the enormity of the whole situation and that it was just something that had to be done after having seen spr i understand what he meant and why it is that when i ask other wwii survivors about their experiences they mostly generalize not really wanting to talk about it the things they must have seen cannot be conveyed in mere words steven spielberg has done a tremendous job in helping me to see the truth about wwii the next oscars will be a titanic night for saving private,reality
forget all the pooh pooh folks with their unnecessary violence and all the supposed nam experts they never got within 500 miles of france on d day go see this movie and rate it on its own merrit spielberg did one hell of a job with it as well as tom hanks et all spielberg and hanks both wanted to make this as realistic and factual as possible and they did their homework believe me it shows,reality
much and most has already been saidbut this one is a true case of being a fine and most definitive movie for those who can talk the talk  and a most shocking experience for those who have walked the walki am glad that i watched it and sorry at the same time,reality
is the realistic war movie ever made because this movie shows people getting shot in a realistic way people blown up and the way that is made  its about three brothers who died in the invasion of dday one brother is alive somewhere in the war and its up to eight men to bring one man home alive  this movie is more real than a horror movie but some good action sequences too  is much more real than other war horror or action films,reality
im a great war movie  war game enthusiast and this movie made me remember the fact that war is truly horrible and is not something to glamorize and take lightly  the realisim of the normandy landing was incredible  i felt as if i were on the beach with those men,reality
tearsits all i have to say tears real tears salty tears splashed across the cheeks of the majority of the men  both young and old  sitting numbly in the theatermen weeping what a strange experience and concept what a strange sight to see but there we all were watching this young man dying with a bullet through his liver gripping the arms of his comrades as he stares up into the sky and moans for his mommawhat a powerful scene what a powerful movienine out of 10go see it sit down with your child and make them see it too maybe the dday scene will leave such a scarring image on their minds that theyll make some changes somewhere down the road big changes so fat rich old men in bunkers wont see it as a necessity to send 17yearold boys dashing through bloody waters into a hail of bullets,reality
indeedweve glimpsed at the hell our parents and grandparents had experienced only that we are able to turn it off they could notlisten to the letter gen marshall reads throughout the movie i was reminded how weak and fruitless any words of consolation to the overwhelming loss and grief mrs however fictional or historically inaccurate she may have been must have felt upon her notification of her sons deaths watching helplessly these men die many not even having the opportunity to make peace with themselves was a sobering and harsh statement that we should never forget the sacrifice they willingly madei may have spent a few sleepless nights replaying scenes where people die needlessly yet it would be borderline slap in the face to even suggest that i can begin to understand what these men have gone through and their loved ones as wellwe should allow ourselves to be easy to forgive but we should never never allow ourselves to forget the ultimate gift our parents and grandparents gave us to be always thankful that we have the happiness and comfort of freedom that we sometimes take for granted,reality
spielberg has constructed an excellent war spectacle this is essentially an old fashioned war film with more graphic violence this is not to take away from the film the battle sequences at the start and finish are probably some of the best ever filmed they reminded me a lot of kubricks full metal jacket and dr strangelove spielberg like kubrick uses a lot of shifting perspectives first person perspective works the best for me you the viewer are transported to the front line with the troops an excellent film to watch many times tom sizemore rules,reality
i remember very good my feelings when i first saw the soldiers standing in the landing boat at the beginningif i were born 40 or 50 years earlier i couldve been standing there myself and i could feel the horror all of those men must have felta lot of people call this film too uscentered but i thought the film did every soldier in wwii justice there were no good or bad soldiers in it just poor fellows in one of the worst possible situation a young man can find himself ini could identify with every one of the guys in the platoon if i would been forced into military service now i would end up like  tom hanks charactersomeone wrote that the movie praises the usa for fighting good wars by showing the star spangled banner at the beginning and the end well i didnt understood it that way could one really be proud of a country who forces his young men into such a hell,reality
the film starts with the most horrific scenes of war i have ever seen in a movie the way spielberg films the landing at normandy just enhances the confusion and puts you there he uses handhelds skips frames and speeds up frames definately one of the most important films of the last 20 years see it in the theater just for the experience the only part that is lacking is the story but that is just means to the end for spielberg to show us his thoughts on the horrors of war,reality
being a world war ii historian and after talking to many veterans of war myself and after having served in the air force for four years i can appreciate a film like  this is war as it is  the bravery  the stupidity  the loss  nobody ever wins at war you just hope to survive and get back to your family  theres plenty of guts in the movie and im glad hollywood finally has the guts to show this and war as it is  i dont like the ultraviolent action films made now but this violence has a purpose  what 150000 allied troops went through on june 6 1944 cannot be experienced first hand but this film comes close  just think steven spielberg gets us off of omaha beach in just twenty minutes for those who actually participated it took them from 0645 hours until well after 1200 hours  thats around 6 hours or more  just think of what hell that was for those who landed on omaha beach that day which will be remembered as the longest day  spielberg couldnt have assaulted us with 6 hours of combat footage so he did the next best thing  e got us off the beach on the quickthe story itself is deep in history not just of wwii when they mention the story of the brothers sullivan who died on the same ship in the pacific but also mentioning mrs bixbys loss in the civil war which is also a cornerstone of the plot  think of the sacrifice real people make on the homefront when they send their loved ones off to war  this sacrifice cuts to the core of the story  should we sacrifice all of one womans offspring for god and country  no is the resounding answer  an answer that tells us that sometimes one common man is as important as the world entireprivate lives a good life  thats what he must do  many men lost their lives so he could have his  so who does private represent  one man in the war machine  one man to whom the war machine sacrificed an arm private represents you and me  many men sacrificed their lives for us many people sacrificed their loved ones for us  now we must all be like private  we must all lead a good lifereminds us of this sacrifice  that is why this movie is a must see  ninetypercent of us have never been to war  ninetypercent of us dont know what war is really  ninetypercent of us need this movie to have a taste of what war is  ninetypercent of us need this movie so we may know the sacrifice made for our freedom  one hundredpercent of us need this movie so we appreciate our freedomthank you steven spielberg,reality
the first time i saw this i was with an aviation camp and we went at night to see this about 45 minutes into the film i fell asleep and did not wake up until the end credits it was not out of boredom but rather the tiredness of flying planes and telling dirty jokes at 1am typical stuff at an aviation camp anyway i gave another try and it still didnt go with me the action sequences at the beginning were okay but the flashback technique did not work for me at about an hour and 35 minutes into the film my attention span shrunk this did not really seem like spielberg at all the storyline seemed very boring it was mostly a series of very long fights,reality
the sad thing about this movie is the way the story takes a backseat to the gratuitous and often unrealistic level of violence previously to seeing this i had heard a lot about how overblown the violence was ive read several letters in the newspaper from actual wwii veterans who said the movie was unrealistic and one of my coworkers who just happened to be a first lieutenant in vietnam also said that the violence was overkill watching this movie i really got the impression that spielberg was just using the story of private as an excuse to make an extremely bloody war movie that every one would go see because they had heard that it was more gory than braveheart youd really think that no one died in 1944 europe unless they were exploded or had their guts blown out or were decapitated or disemboweled or something when tom hanks pulls his radio guy over and his face was gone i was like oh please give me a break this was much more of an action movie than a war drama i thought that the thin red line was a much more thoughtful and dramatic movie that didnt rely on such copious amounts of violence it was a far better picture as was full metal jacket and the deer hunter and platoon and apocalypse now etc etc,reality
what makes speilbergs wwii epic so great is the fact that it takes a plot from a 1940s war propaganda film starring ohperhaps john wayne and makes it real the plot line is simple eight men are assigned to find one man whose brothers have all been killed and send him home the question is is the lives of eight men worth risking for the life of one speilberg in all of his brilliance manages to take this simple story and uses it as both an excellent character study and as a vehicle for  graphic depictions of world war ii no more is there blood and gloryjust horror and fear these men who are fighting arent the fearless war heroes of all the propoganda films of the 40s on the contrary they are normal average men who are afraid and who hate this mission they arent just actorsthey are you and i in these situations presenting our humanity and our frailtiess in chaosthis might be the first film to depict world war ii in such a way of course it helps that it is backed by an excellent cast tom hanks edward burns tom sizemore matt damon ted danson to name only a few that knows how to portray each character in memorable ways but also this might be the most gruesome of all wars films not beating around the bush when it comes to the realistic violence that resulted from the war limbs are blown off brains are shot outthe violence is aplenty but not in a way to glorify it as many war films do no this film uses it to reiterate the original idea war is hellno its worse and its not something be glorified these men sacrificed their lives for us being no better than us and no worseand if it was you in the situation you would have to do the same respect thattheres no question about it this film should have won best picture and it was absolutely robbed if shakespeare in love was one millionth this film it might have had a chance at competing against it how it beat this masterpiece is beyond meignore the foolish academy this film is the greatest of 1998perhaps one of the greatest of the decade out of ,reality
after reading other peoples comments i decided to change mine i think this movie represents symbolically the sacrifices that the veterans and those who died fighting for our country i am going to see this movie again i cannot explain how this movie made me feel when tom hanks character says earn it he was not talking to he was talking to us private represents everyone you and me everyone those eight men represent the people that sacrificed their lives to save ours from perhaps closest to pure evil this world has ever seen my only hope is that all of us live our lives to the fullest so we can earn their sacrifice  of ,reality
i started watching this film and after 5 minutes i was thinking what rating i would give this film and five minutes into the film i was thinking 10 the scenes of graphic violence limbs missing etc considering the amount of violence on our screens today was truly horrific and made even my stomach churn but somehow it wasnt enough somehow it didnt make war seem as pointless as say platoon where the drill sergeant really made the men feel like worms but it was for their benefit but this film did not either lift me at the end nor leave me flat out on the ground in the end it was an 8,reality
first let me say that the battle scenes in are the most realistic and horrifying i have ever seen i think most people will have some images of that film with them forever my problem with the film is that it makes it seem like it was all worth while not only the search for not only wwii but war in general im hoping it was intended as an antiwar film that fell well short of the mark but the opening and closing shots of the stars and stripes says that this wasnt the case with the flag fluttering in the breeze america and the allies included i presume fights just wars fights good wars and being saved and then going on to live a decent honest life raising a family etc is proof that it was worth it maybe the fast pace of the film compared to other and what i consider better war films like the thin red line or gallipoli is what makes it so popular just compare the final scenes of those two films to the final scene of spr the message i got from wasnt one of the futility of war it was a much more realistic portrayal of the horrors modern warfare but in the end a romantic view none the less,reality
i saw this movie twice in the theater and i didnt think that was enough to really do it justice  the difference between tv and the big screen are almost immeasurable and spielberg has a master on film  i felt as if i stormed normandy myself  i remember my grandfather telling me stories but this no offense to him but this takes the cake as far as world war ii goes  it gave me chills,reality
what people ask me you liked better than schindlers listthere are many reasons why i feel is a superior filmfirst look at it from the technical aspects these include directing cinematography editing sound sound effects editing lighting set design and so on and so forth dont get me wrong lists technical aspects are great that breath taking black and white cinematography buts are just superiornow look at it from the acting point of view is not only a great technical movie but an excellent acting film too im not talking about just tom hanks alone it was the supporting characters being lead by hanks that really did it for me and jeremy davies as corporal upham when he kills that german that is one of the three times ive cried in a movie lists acting is very good too but it is so many people that it is hard to get attached to a character had a nice concentration of excellent performances and you came to identify with all the characters that didnt die in the first scenethis got ten out of ten stars for me,reality
1998 c169 min d steven spielberg tom hanks tom sizemore matt damon edward burns jeremy davies ted danson jake busey realistic war drama begins at dday and continues through the story of an expedition to find the last of four brothers that have been killed in the war incredibly gory but very truetolife everyone involved delivers terrific performances especially hanks rating 9 out of 10 rated r for graphic violence some language and adult themes,reality
is one of the top films of the decade  it is the best war movie to come along since full metal jacket  the acting is superb with his performance tom hanks once again proves that he is one of the best actors of all time putting in one of his best performances  it is extremely accurate with not even the smallest details being ignored  steven spielberg is yet to produce a bad movie  the violence in the movie was an absolute necessity making it more powerfull than any other war movie or drama for that matter  it is a tragedy that it lost to shakespear in love for best picture  no question it was the best movie of the year  it is a true tribute to the veterans of world war 2 and gives them the respect they deserve for laying down there lives for america,reality
the basic plot doesnt seem like a very likely thing to happen but a great script made it much more believeable  i really enjoyed this movie although the first 20 minutes or so were pretty intense dont watch on a full stomach  its really long but i loved every minute  gives you a good idea of what war really is like,reality
i remember as a kid watching films like the wild geese the big red one the great escape and the dirty dozen among many many others with my dad now ive got a son only 4 years old at the moment so a bit too young i can picture my self a few years down the line watching this with him on tv letting him stay up late to see it maybewhereas i watched all those old films as a kid and went straight out with my toy machine gun with my friends and played soldiers this film would perhaps have caused me to consider the futility and senselessness of war then again id wager that it probably would not have as there are so many memorable moments that i would have loved to have replayed in the playground my personal favourite is tom sizemore and a german soldier throwing their helmets at each other having run out of ammo but these moments come along at a steady ratei know that some people will appreciate the film as a whole but hate the modern day beginning and ending i know its a bit corny and flatly played but the idea is spot on for me just like schindlers list you see what saving one life leads to and why it is worthwhilewhen tarantino was promoting pulp fiction he did an interview with the bbc here in which he said he would love to make a men on a mission movie id love to see it but maybe private has put him off i hope not,reality
at first glance this movie seemed to be nothing more than another glorified war movie but all that changed once the movie started  even from the opening scene the movie was hardhitting  although it was one of the longest battle scenes ever i think that it was one of the best produced and most realistic battle scenes ever  although that was one of the best parts of the movie there is still one thing that still sticks out in my mind even though i saw the movie a week ago  that is the part in which the german is stabbing one of the americans and constantly saying shhh  there is not a moment that goes by that i dont think about that part  i dont know what it is about that part but i think that it was the most memorable part of it for me,reality
i thought was a very excellantay wwii movie steven speilberg was great i am yet to find a movie that he has directed that i didnt like besides et anyway the story was great and the never ending action never bored me i really advise watching it if you can stand the blood and guts,reality
this is one of my all time favorites because not only is it just a drama but it has everthing else great acting special effects its all there good theme music steven spielberg really knows how to direct tom hanks gives one of my favorite performances of all time it is a truly memorable performance dont miss this masterpiece,reality
i saw with some trepidation  i saw it late and on the small screen  i knew about the initial halfhour and had read the criticisms of the film from the right and left of the political spectrum it seems all the political reviewers didnt like it and i was prepared to be disappointed   all i can say is wow  is one of the most gripping films i have ever seen  gripping in the sense that it grabs you and doesnt let go  you belong to it for the almost 3 hour running time you cant think of anything else you cant leave  this is a film you will be thinking about for days afterwards  it is a must rent a classic but if you have lived in a cave for the last two years and havent heard the film is highly graphic in its depictions of battle and is not for the fainthearted,reality
the films core simply follows a small group of americans kicking ass behind enemy lines  maybe its just me but i never really warmed up to most of the characters in that group and found the heartwarming backstory anything butregardless the you are there intense action scenes make up for the faults in the sappy department  although again once we are following the crack commando group the battles no longer seemed particularly real to me since only the enemies are dying  that seems to reinforce the stereotype of the invincible heroic soldier that actually makes war look appealing  plus it went on so long i was definitely getting rather tired of it by the end watching it a second time on video was completely unworthwhile in my opinionanyway in the end i give this movie about a 3 stars out of 4,reality
one of the greatest war films ever made since all quiet on the western front appeared on the big screen  the direction and cinematography are outstanding  people can say what they like about spielberg but this film and schindlers list puts him up there with the greats,reality
when i first saw this i was trembling i stared as i watched hundreds of soldiers get mutilated i trembled because this happened and i have been to the beach it is graphic but this is just to me total realism i felt it is time that war is shown at its full gruesome truth i think a lot of people will take more of a standoff view to war this movie in its first 30 mins is a total antiwar movie but still gives total credit to the men who fought in it the performances are first class and the cinematography and sound send chills down your spine i really feel so much for soldiers now after viewing such waste,reality
managed to do to me what only a combination of actiondramacomedy movies can do it kept me at the edge of my seat in the intense battle scenes the acting was genuinely good the graphic nature was only excessive in the very first battle scene it was not necessary to see the guy screaming mama with his guts out otherwise no other movie has been able to show me the intense horror and the gravity of war the soldiers did not have romantic deaths like in most other movies about world war ii in american history i thought only vietnam was horrific but this movie surely changed that picture it is one movie that i absolutely loved but i dont think i can tolerate seeing it one more time i am not american and have no relatives who fought in wwii so i cannot relate yet i can feel it through this movie the only other war movie comparable to this one is glory this is one movie definitely worth seeing if you dont like it you probably missed something,reality
wellwatched this one and i have to say that the first part of the movie on omaha beach is pretty pretty intensive can you say intensive my eyes reached their information processinglimithowever after this the movie just wanders off and becomes a feelgood story where a couple of soldiers find themselves hopping all over normandy in search of a guy calledwe see lots of american flags heroism shabby dialogue a miscast tom hanks i kept picturing bubba next to him telling him about shrimping and of course bad front jokesas for the uscentered approachits understandable  paul verhoevens soldier of orange was centered around dutchmen as well even though lots of other countries participated in the entire war british warmovies focus on brits and so onall in all not an awfully bad movie to watch but not the ultimate classic it was portrayed to be for that we still have to go to apocalypse now or full metal jacket,reality
this movie is so great just everything is great image sound acting directing light special effects colors storytelling everything ive seen spr twice i hope this movie will be a lesson for other directors,reality
what a great movie but what a horrible horrible manipulative beginning and end flashforwards sequence it was bad enough in schindlers list but at least there you had real people in the flashes here its just old actors putrid bad my wife was incoherently angry at the dishonesty of the first flashforward couldnt he do any better than this rehash technique doesnt he trust us to understand the painfully obvious point that the ending makes cut off those hackworthy five minutes and you have one of the greatest war movies ever made but with them on there you have an insulting 6,reality
okay so my one line review is a bit pathetic but the truth is thats how war is people die and director stephen captures the true nature of war hell but the fact is thats it well that sounds stupid doesnt it all i can really say is watch it,reality
i loved this movie  not for tom hanks oscar worthy performance for the riveting tale or for the shocking realism  nope i loved this movie for the actors  i think that as a whole the cast did an incredible job filling the shoes they were given  first and foremost was anyone else absolutely taken by barry pepper as private roy jackson  ever since seeing this movie i have been glued to my computer watching his fan website for updates on magazine articles and barry sightings  this guy is one to pay attention to he is definitely going to be big  those cutting eyes say it all  second giovanni ribisi  his sleepy stare combined with his sensitivity make any one swoon  this isnt just a phenomenon for mr ribisi either  in every other movie he has had a major role in he has taken over the screen  how about edward burns  granted he does play a new yorker with an attitude in almost all of his films but he does it so well we can forgive him for that this cynical beauty of a guy plays the quintissential smart mouth that we love to hate and love to love  i wouldnt mind being the butt of some of his cutting jokes and how about young vin diesel who plays the illfated private adrien caparzo  though he doesnt make it very far into the movie he makes a great impression  i dont know whether i cant get past his great body or his heart melting voice  and then theres adam goldberg  a talent to be reckoned with  this guy plays the good smart allick  the flip side to edward burns biting character this one is the nicejerk  i just hope that goldberg doesnt get typecast as the token jewish guy  it would sure be a shame this guy can work the camera  and what about jeremy davies who played umpum  i find it hard to comment on him  it is largely due to the fact that i cant bring myself to like him  it is not his fault he was only playing a character  was anyone else out there screaming mad when he made it through the final battle  i would have traded him for wade ribisi or pepper jackson any day  and was anyone else ready to burst into tears of sorrow when we had to bid farewell to both our luscious silent but gorgeous types,reality
and washes ashorehere you have two not one movies at the price of one the masterpiece is the opening half hour and the final half hour battle in the bombed out town in between we have sgt rock characters with some trendy gore and un style stereotypesits essentially a b film with mass amounts of  fx expertise and speechifying thrown in i always am leery of any film that presumes to tell us what war is really likethat is crap the only way to really tell it as it iswould be to simply stick a camera crew on omaha beach or in stalingrad at the time and letem roll guts and allthats it here we have forest gump trying to be john waynenice try but forget itno way and a bunch of 20 something directors like ed burns pretending they are grunts sometimes it works sometimes it doesnt i like the intention of the movie to show how horrible it all is and etcbut the way the film was marketedits producer telling us its not john wayne up the beachthat was nutssure guys it was tom hanks and steven speilberg up the beach complete with sam malone from cheers inland to recieve them gimme a breakyou want a realistic war film try the big red one or platoon and the first 30 minutes of this one too skip the rest its just a jacked up episode of combat without vic morrows credibility and with old mr gump theretwo ratings for the landing sequence and the final battle  for the stuff in between  try again steve,reality
thank goodness  in a world where bruce willis climbs aboard asteroids dinosaurs ravage metropolis and famous sports figures brett favre all but steal the bestlooking babes cameron diaz it is a nice change of pace to see something real in summer films  isnt a perfect movie but is sure is powerful in conveying the horrors of war  leave it to steven spielberg to blast all of the id4s armageddons and lethal weapons into oblivion,reality
sometimes very rarely a film comes along that blows itself off celluloid and straight into the mind begins in a way that leaves the viewer gasping as we see the dday landings in all of their hideous glory the opening battle scene is one of the most raw and frightening sequences ever captured on film as we are spared nothing from the battlefieldthe rest of the film is spent with the examination of the effect of  war on the psyches of the men involved how the cling to memories of home for survival and the way they band together in order to keep each other alivethe performances are terrific but it is the superb direction by spielberg from rodats emotive script that really makes the story he got the best director award but how the film was overlooked as best picture at the oscars by a daft bit of fluff like shakespeare in love boggles the mindi urge you to see this movie but be aware that it goes beyond a story on screen and will leave you touched inside and thankful for the peace that exists for most of us today,reality
well we will sit back and contemplate the message of this outstanding movie for a long time to come war is a terrible crushing reality  merciless on mans physical and psychological existence the ramifications are farreaching in so many respects one shivers at the thought of what the world would have been like today had the germans won dday at omaha beach spielberg maintains his usual brilliance in this masterpiece which i prefer to call a cinematic experience rather than a movie,reality
this movie definitely gets four stars i was riveted i never really thought about the significance of world war two until i saw this film those soldiers saved the world god bless every us soldier black and white and japanese that fought in world war iican you imagine what would have happened if germany won see this movie,reality
laughable dialogue hackneyed acting war film cliches piled high like spielberg grafted on every single famous war movie scene hed ever seen into a contradictory muddled mishmash war is hell war is noble war is spirit changing war is savage war is uplifting war is horrible war is brotherhood war is ironic war is epic war is petty etc etc this is how he cons the audience into concluding this is the best war movie ever made that and the fact that many viewers are secretly titilated by the flying limbs and exploding bodies peppering this best war movie ever made  i can just picture stevie thinking ill take this bit of das boot and combine it with guadalcanal diary and and then throw in some apocalypse now style irony and thenbrilliant premise as if the generals planning the largest sealand invasion in history are worrying about a poor mother in iowa i like how all the characters are about as multilayered as the dirty dozen the cynical quipster brooklyn the clumsy rookie the fast talking nazi hatin jew the bible quoting expertmarksman southerner the muscular guy etc etc ridiculous monologues private picture a girl who took a nosedive from the ugly tree and hit every branch coming down haw haw this from a character who symbolically represents america and has the movie named after him banal bawdy soldier banter ed burns shes a 44 double ewho ahmy favorite part is when our heroes are behind enemy lines and then casually stumble around and tell jokes in loud voicesfitting with the films total lack of military realism especially the action movie ending where the plucky heroes take out a legion of tanks with richard dean andersonlike sticky bombs silly patriotism maudlin and sappy john williams score and dont forget buckets of sam raimi style gore so critics think its an art film its so violent it must be important still nice photography by kaminski and the opening bloodbath is effective though significantly overrated as far as im concerned stevie peaked at jaws go see the thin red line instead it may be flawed and too slow for audiences who found the matrix to be thrilling cinema but compare malicks believable portrayal of the confused japanese soldiers who by the way all behave differently to wars horrors and are individuals with stevies portrayal of the germans as evil double crossing villains not far removed from the kooky nazis in his thrilling indiana jones trilogy unfortunately the world is more complex than as seen through the eyes of spielberg or frank capra although both excel at propaganda  one of the most jingoistic widely acclaimed films in recent memory and the seventh best film ever according to the handy internet movie database,reality
the movie is an artistic masterpiece that works best as a monument to those who fought for the good guys during wwii  the argument that the germans during the war were not on the bad side is wrong  that they on a grunt level were also just kids stuck in a war is true  spielberg does not show this for a reason hes honoring the sacrifice and victory of our fallen americans in the war  the battle scenes are incredible pieces of gut wrenching artistry and the chaotic slaughter of the first 20 minutes means something to the story but that story fails at achieving its more provocative yet slightly out of focus ideas  the ideas are there and they can be reached through the important viel of the films realism  but spielberg for all his visual brilliance does not make it work  in fact it seems like he is constantly trying to cloud over our thoughts that may come out of the film with a scene that is meant to close out a story that should not be ended so easily  the men fought and died and lived through that hell for the world we live in today but instead of letting us contemplate the worth of that sacrifice and allowing those moments of horror to manifest themselves in our minds along side the lives we as the generations born into that infant world which have taken advantage of this age speilberg and or the screenwriter has ended the story of that sacrifice  works as a metaphor for the men who lived to go home and rebuild or build lives but that metaphor has a serious flaw when the character is shown finalizing his internal conflict  well with that it seems less of a thanks to a generation  tom hanks on the other hand gives one of his best performances so does tom sizemore with what little he had to work with everyone else overacts  no kidding  the dialogue is very bland and repetitive  spielberg and hanks lend them power but that doesnt hide the awkwardness  i enjoyed the interested paradox of having an incredibly violent war film be patriot  it shows us the horror and nobility both right next to each other hand in hand  it shows men facing their own deaths as individuals as a greater good stands in the shadows but almost completely out of site  that is important this is one of the first films to do that  but theres a better way of characterizing the men than giving them each a monologue in the minutes before the final battle or simple stereotype characteristics  yet this was not what i was thinking when i first saw the film  as an experience the film works and like a great film it stays with you  but the more i thought about it the more its moral and metaphorical problems came to the surface  its definitely worth seeing maybe even twice but it will never provoke its ideas on a deeper level than the logistic banter of the men  its almost too visceral  for more ideas see the thin red line  the too films both try to say the same thing one with a flag the other with the earth we fight over but one succeeds where the other comes just within reach but not artistically gutsey enough to grab hold and run they are both about human dignity in the face of the inhumane  one encompasses the wwii generation the other encompasses the entire human race  weve seen violence and if were not trying to survive it we should be thinking about why it is  only then can we overcome it its a noble gesture but impossible  its bleak but then again were only human,reality
the best warmovie ever made the shots are so realistic t the beginning that one really feels like hes in the middle of the battle it made a real deep impression on me and it made me more realise what sacrifices of young men had to be made to liberate europe from the nazi terror,reality
you can say what you want about spielberg but you cant deny hes consistent he dazzles the eyes the ears the guts but the brain remains untouched i dont think any film has ever given a more realistic rendering of being under fire but after the action there are only platitudes and more platitudesi suggest that those who think this is the greatest war film ever made take a look at kubricks paths of glory economy of means sobriety of tone only the slightest touch of sentiment at the end to humanize the story spielberg seems to be a fan of kubricks i noticed some discreet visual references to full metal jacket in the sniper scene but hes still very far from reaching that level and he doesnt seem to be making any progress similar comments can be made about the vastly overrated schindlers listbriefly spielberg is a technical master who simply cannot escape the trap of syrupy middleclass sentimentality with heavy string orchestration by john williams bless his heart that always dissipates the potential impact of his films,reality
is an overwhelming thought provoking film which takes the baton from platoon as the standard for war movies not that it is necessarily better but it certainly raised the bar in technical achievement and graphic violenceanother winning combination of janusz kaminski and spielberg the technical achievement of the opening act dday invasion is worthy of all the praise and awards the movie garnered spielberg again shows us as in schindlers list his unique way of depicting violent death as something that happens to real people not simply a cool effect to rid the plot of bad guys this 25 to 30 minutes of the film is one of filmmakings alltime great achievements spielbergs real genius in his serious films is his knack for allowing us to enter inside and feel the chaos and emotions spr schindlers the color purple and even jaws surround you rather than hit you in the facethere is a line spoken by one of the soldiers shortly after they receive their seemingly inane assignment to rescue one man this better be worth it a sort of prophetic statement that to me commented on the man the mission and the film itselfa great film for sure but not perfect and certainly not worthy of 7 on the imdb top 250 the script is a little too clean and clever for a bunch of kids thrown into combat and it so so violent and depressing that it is physically exhausting i feel that after the stellar and gutwrenching opening act spr never lives up to the standard it sets for itselfhowever if the opening and closing acts are even 1 accurate in their depiction of combat then this movie should be used as war deterrentnot spielbergs best but certainly a noble film and a technical watershed in movie making12 out of ,reality
had this movie been hyped as offering the purest carnage visualized with a high degree of technical skill the advance promotion at least would have been honest  but the film is dirty morally and bankrupt artistically  without plausible story ideology acting character or any redeeming social purpose this film ends as a herecomethemarinesjustintime tribute to john wayne but without appropriate credit to its obvious inspiration  it has all been done before and much better except for the artful hypestill spielbergs outstanding skill  is really jurassic park with german troops and tanks instead of dinosaurs  spielberg really succeeds at the level of war comics and has earned the admiration of that audience but adults who pay to see it ought to be ashamed  dreamworks  give me a breakits the usual publicity fake and hollywood trash,reality
every once in a while a movie comes along and sets a new standard for the class  in this case has achieved that place in two areas the war movie and the human condition movie  on one hand does not mask shield or taint combat in any manner from the viewer and lets the experience of war happen in all of its stark reality  i have a feeling that any movie depicting war will use as a model from now on the strongest message that the movie sends is that in war there is no motivating sound track and people do die horribly without mercy and often without reason  drowning in eight feet of water within reach of the beach applying a bomb that goes off prematurely and having no effect on the target being shot by an unseen sniper are all displayed without glory or the indication of some greater purpose being achieved in the end  what is left are those alive and those that are dead and those that are alive must live with the horror of what they have been thoughbut the really great war movies are not really about war but are really about how people react to an extreme condition that they are faced with  in this case moves from one gender to another without the viewer realizing it  much has been said and written about the battle scenes in the movie and far too little has been said about the emotion between the squad of soldiers and how they feel about trying to rescue someone they have never met  in the countless movies i have seen about the same basic topic this one tells the untainted truth about this emotion  the soldiers do it because they are ordered to but like every american soldier marine sailor or airman that i know they dont like it and they will let everyone know about it  but beyond that the film also shows the american combat soldier as they really are crass vulgar dirty beyond belief prone to raw humor but where this film excels is the depiction of why they are how they are long days of stress fatigue danger at every moment living moment by moment  by the time the troops leave the beach and the horror there the viewer accepts their condition and forgives their behavior and manner  even the word forgives is bad word to use  the film generates the emotion in the view that these troops have earned the right to behave in any manner that they please  they have paid for that right 1000 timesbut the humanity prevails in many ways some large and some small the raw emotion when one of their squad falls in combat the sharing of gum from one mouth to another the group resentment of those who have not been through the hell that they have been though the appreciation of a piece of music that will relieve them of thinking of their situation for only a moment  it is these moments in the film that elevates the movie beyond a regular war film into a classic that other films will be measured against  i have seen four times now and it has not failed to generate a strong emotion in me every time  there are no heroics in this film  there is only an accurate display of humans placed in a situation that is beyond belief who do things because they have to not because they want to and to they best they can without reward or commendation  their only reward is survival,reality
i believe that is a movie that every american should see  it is a movie that will blow your mind  steven spielberg and tom hanks have teamed up to create the most authentic war movie of all time this movie has unbelievable action sequences a really good script and jawdropping cinematography  this film has my vote as the greatest of all time  also i dont worry about it not winning the academy award because everybody else outside the academy seems to agree that was the best movie of 1998 and got the most positive reactions from moviegoers,reality
i have never been moved by a movie as much as i think this movie should be seen by all americans to show what price was paid for our freedom i have a renewed respect for our flag and memorial day the opening scene is the most intense 20 minutes of film i have ever witnessed,reality
very impressive battle scenes but ultimately the movie left me with the feeling that i was watching two flicks  the first a very realistic account of war the second an attempt by spielberg to create a kind of apocalypse now or heart of darkness version of world war ii as the main characters stand around and talk about how surreal war is on their journey through the french countryside in search of pvt  the beginning and ending scenes at the graveyard also struck me as silly and preachy  the dday landing by itself is enough of a reminder of what the world owes the men and women who fought and died in wwii without spielberg making sure that we dont miss the point,reality
i just have one wordbrilliant  ive seen lots of good war movies like platoon or galipoli but this one tops them all  tom hanks is absolutely brilliant and will definately get nominated for an academy award for best actor if not win  will get many award nominations  steven spielberg is a pure genius  i think hes the best director ever  he has definitely outdone himself this time  is filled with lots of gore and graphic violence but it depicts war perfectly  i would recommend this film to anyone who thinks they can handle it,reality
is a great movie due to its great acting and realistic scenes this movie is spectacularly done with very good acting and it is very realistic to the war this movie is placed in world war 2 and id give it five stars ,reality
a good movie but not great compared to some of the movies that have gone before without the benefit of animation cgi people overlook stories that were better written like all quiet on the western front lew ayres version the longest day etc while i have high regards for most of those involved in this movie it was not the great that many made it out to be,reality
this is the best movie ive ever seen  not only because of its story but because it was acted very well  they made it look very realistic when they were fighting and when they werent fighting  i commend the actors for their great performances  another thing that is great about this movie is that it never really died at any part and it always kept you wondering what would happen next  also i really enjoyed the score written by john williams  it is in my opinion the best score ever written for any moviethere really isnt anything bad to say about this movie  it was very disappointing to see that this movie didnt win best picture best actor or best original score at the academy awards which i believe it deserved for those who havent seen it go rent it  its definitely worth it,reality
the scene of a cowardly american soldier symbolizes the usa response to the desperate appeals for help from the european jews which were being brutally destroyed by the nazis  this passivism cost the lives of untold millions  you watch this scene and you wonder how in the world the usa could ignore these cries for help knowing that innocent people were being murdered and yet we did nothing  this lack of response was due to fear and refusal to act responsiblythe next scene is a death struggle between a nazi soldier and an american jewish soldier  the fight is to the death  this scene symbolically portrayed the reality of the jewish people struggling to survive the nazis attempt at trying to exterminate them  there would be many which the nazis would kill and the nazis would simply get away with it until the world could no longer avoid the problemthese scenes were so masterfully created that they are perfect in the reality they portray as well as the symbolism of historical parallelism  i am so impressed with the genius of the creation and production of  i wish it would be made required viewing and discussed as part of a curriculum for world history in schools and collegesi love and wish to thank every person involved in making the movie and presenting it to the world,reality
this movie was probably the most realistic picture of war without actually being there the battle scenes are brillianthowever the script and dialouge is really weak if you dont believe me rent the movie and really listenthe lines are wooden and awkward schlinders list and jaws both had better writing and are superior films to this one,reality
the most realistic wwii movie ever is the best war movie ever made steven spielberg has shown us once again why hes born to be a director with spielberg showed us all why war is hell watch it and youll always remember how great this film is,reality
i found rather elementary  yes it makes me proud to be an american but many movies do that primary colors is a better and more recent standout and spielberg seems to be interpreting the horrors of war while rarely showing the human element behind it and consequently dulls the impact of the message war is very very bad  the film lacks intelligence and perhaps lacks a soul as well despite its patriotic fervor  tom hanks is quite good though as the tortured captain whose face is a mask of quiet despair  in one scene where the soldiers under his command want to shoot a german prisoner hanks turns away trying to become blind to it all  his performance and the dazzling cinematography make up for a soso story and a script containing approximately fifteen coherent sentences still five or six more than close encounters though ,reality
is one of the most unforgettable movies that i have ever seen  this is very close in that respect to schindlers list is the only movie that i can think of that actually made me cry in the theater  i remember almost everything about that night i remember sitting in a metro detroit movie theater watching with some friends on opening night  my favorite memory of that night is when the movie ended  there was an older gentleman sitting in front of me and to the left  while the landing at ohmaha beach scene was concluding he was sobbing a great deal  when the other soldiers were joking about the term fubar he was the only one in the theater who understood it and he laughed loudly  when the old man salutes the flag he cried again  he sat through all of the credits as did i  when he finally got up he was wearing his uniform from wwii  that is who this movie was made for  it was made so that we would always those brave men who died for our benefit  it was made to educate us  this movie should be viewed  it is too powerful not to  steven spielberg did a superior directing job on this film  this is the best movie of 1998 and possibly the best of the 90s,reality
this is a good film dont get me wrong but its plot wasnt developed to the point of caring  the movie seems to rely on the violence like a crutch the characters are boring and winy although i would be too if i had to risk my life for someone who doesnt want to go anyway because hes a good guy  the final thirty or forty minutes of the movie almost makes the whole thing seem like a waste of time  its a good movie but couldve suffered a much better plot,reality
the first 30 minutes of is one of the alltime great sequences on film however i believe spielberg made a fatal flaw in casting such known actors in such an historical filmduring this opening sequence the camera pans up and we see tom hanks and the first thing that came to my mind was my name is forrest gumppeople call me forrest gumpspielbergs casting of schindlers list and amistad was so much better he shouldve taken a cue from two of his own movies,reality
this is a movie that is so realistic that you may find it difficult to watch  it is possible to get so emotional that you want to close your eyes or cover your ears  but you dont  you are drawn into the film like into a miniature black hole  by the way does anybody know what the d in dday stands for  the answer is at the end of this reviewthere are so many other wellwritten reviews of this movie that i am going to keep this short  i have a question though  does tom hanks ever star is a bad movie  the answer is no providing that steven spielberg directsthis is a exceptionally good and realistic war movie  my father served in world war ii but it was difficult for me to realize his sacrifice  not after this movie it isnt  it is so vivid that there might be a new warning label coming out  perhaps something like ed watch out  can cause emotional distress if you were there  the almost noiseless sound of the bullets hitting soldiers or sand is unforgettable  perhaps even haunting it is not difficult to understand how some veterans sought professional help after viewing spielbergs latest masterpiecewell i guess you have waited long enough  nobody should have to actually read one of my reviews  the d in dday stands for day  i had trouble believing my father when he told me that  yes and the h in hhour stands for hour  see this movie if you dare,reality
astounding action scenes the best ever seen however its one and only flaw is the americanisation of the war defined by the shots of the stars and stripes flag what was he thinking an outstanding film dragged into the depths of independence day and armageddon as america saves the world such a pity,reality
an unbelievably realistic war film the opening sequence depicting the normandy invasion is the most intense and shocking battle scene ever filmed the movie horrifies but also packs an emotional wallop that leaves you spent wow,reality
if the pentagon and the us army could honor this film how could this film not be recognized as the best of 1998  this is more than a movie  it is an incredible experience and a grim reminder  of how horrible war can be and the sacrifices that were made by those who fought for us to be free thank you steven spielberg for making this film,reality
i loved this movie  it was one of steven speilbergs greatest films that he has ever done  just the way that his trademarks were so visible it was fantastic  the start  was nothing that i had ever expected  i was told how real it was but i just couldnt believe it  it was like he was actually at the beaches on dday filming the battle  he didnt hold back on anything in the way that the battles were done or how real he showed the shots and the gun fire  i was almost getting sick because of the dday battle  he was having them get shot the second they opened the doors for them to get off the boat  anyways i think that steven speilberg is a fantastic director and a brilliant human being  and it is displayed in this film,reality
ok was a good film the dday landing scene at the beginning could well be the most realistic depiction of conflict ever made this was easily the films best feature however after that it just went downhill the story was utterly unconvincing and although it was depicted graphically and with immense skill it doesnt ever excuse it the ending of the film was probably the singly most uninspiring and cliched for a film that deals with the epic issues that this one attempts not very well to grapple with i enjoyed this film but my question is how can it be at 8 or even in the top hundred can a film that relies so heavily on its skilled making and so little on its depth really be among the masterpieces mostly in the top ten movies,reality
forced me to respect steven spielberg again  while i often found little depth to his other films with the obvious exception of schindlers list his work on this was absolutely magnificent  the thing i liked most about the process behind spr was the amount of teamwork involved  janusz kaminskis photography is the best ive ever seen for not only was it technically brilliant but it also made me feel as though i was in normandy on the beach and amidst the dying  the same goes for the sound and production design for it did what was needed most put the viewer in the action  everyone associated with this picture should be proud of their work  the only fictional war story better than this in my opinion would be remarques all quiet on the western fronti doubt ill see a movie more powerful than even if the rumors about the thin red line are true,reality
together with platoon one of the best war movies ever made from the guesome realism in the battlefields to the good performances by the cast and the masterful direction by spielbergthis motion picture is unforgettable and truly proves that war is hella honorable salute to every man and woman that has ever had to experience such awful events,reality
the first forty minutes of this movie were some of the most visually stimulating film ive ever seen but it slacked off in the end  spielberg is an amazing director but that didnt cover up the poor acting and the even worse plot  if spieberg didnt feel the need to succumb to corny endings and famous actors this could have been a much better movie,reality
this was the most incredibly moving film i have ever experienced  i say experienced because this is not a film that you see  you see 2010 you see star wars  you experience private  from the beginning to the very end of the show you are hopelessly attached to your newly acquired best buddies in the world who are real people with fears and aspirations and attitudes and personalities and everything  this is not the gijoe hero story where the good guys always just manage to not get shot  this is war as real as i can imagine it up close and very very personal  if you have served our country thank you for whatever it is that you did for me and my family  if you know somebody that was in a war especially ww ii please go and experience this movie  i guarantee you will see them in a light that you may have never seen beforemy rating  definitely on the drama  action must see list,reality
i have seen many movies about war and thought that i had a grasp of what it was like to be there  when i saw i realized that i had not even come close in my imaginings  as i watched this movie i sat stunned and speechless  i dont know how steven spielberg depicted such a raw and vivid portrayal of the effects of war but he did a tremendous job my hat goes off to him and the many actors and extras who took me into battle with them even though i felt like i was at war myself i   cant seem to shake the thought that this movie was only scratching the surface of actually being there  how these men watched their friends get killed each day smelled blood and rotting bodies lived with the fear that they would be next and never go home or worse live with the guilt that they had survived only a true veteran will ever know for many years i have taken my freedom for granted memorial day was a day off from work and a day of picnics  thanks to this movie i will never see it this way again  this movie has left myself and millions of other people with a whole new outlook on the way we view our veterans and those who lost their lives at war i thank them all from the bottom of my heart for what we have today and for the freedom that many of us have taken for granted  i also thank for the rude awakening that we all needed i believe that everyone who sees it will never be the same,reality
the shock of the opening scene is so overwhelming that you dont realize how far into the film you are when it is over  tom hanks is a truly fine actor who makes you wish he were your neighbor your teacher your friend  the portrayals of the young men in the squad are well done without resorting to melodrama or stereotype  the action and special effects are so good that in many moments i almost believed i was there in combat with those men  what an outstanding tribute to the veterans of world war 2  a wonderful complement to schindlers list,reality
what an amazing first half hour  how could anyone think of war as glorious after seeing that  there are so many fine touches in camerawork and direction that you need to see to believe  the sheep wandering past the unit the homely sandwiches and so on  so clever to have the rescue unit itself hostile to the rescue  after all each son who died left a mother bereft and that is what himself felt at the end of the film  it is such a shame that the last half hour of the film became a conventional war movie  spielberg has made a great movie  in parts greater than anything that has ever been made about the second world war  but his last half hour is an indulgence which lets the rest of the film down  nevertheless my father joined the british royal marines in february 1939 and fought throughout to may 1945 including the normandy landings  for the first time on screen i have now seen something like what he must have gone through how did our parentsgrandparents do it  and arent we so lucky that we have not had to,reality
tom hanks is excellent and his character is wonderfully developed while the action sequences are second to none but ultimately is like so many war movies i saw as a kid regardless of how well rendered the opening scene after the shlocky frame as they storm the beach at normandy is pretty awful you get the sense that a nation shows its resolve by how many of its young men it is willing to sacrifice just throw the bodies out there in kosovo we held that number to zero such a lovely way to fight a war in ww ii the number was however many it took says something spielberg makes this point with the wideangled shot of the channel filled with allied landing craft and support vessels for as far as the eye can seea scene incidentally right out of frank capras seminal series why we fight to which this film is indebted whether spielberg knows it or notworld war ii was a war so horrible and so all encompassing that to this day we really dont understand it or comprehend it spielberg thought he was being objective in showing war as it really was with americans murdering prisoners and vomiting from fear and dying like cattle without a chance something capra of course was not able to do yes but to show the saving grace of individual valor is to perpetuate the war system because that valor is a fraud it was not the bravery of our soldiers that won the war just as it didnt matter how brave or how cowardly the soldiers were in the landing craft it was the sheer volume of them that prevailedi think as long as one believes that individual heroics amount to something we will have war spielberg no doubt thinks he has shown us the horror and waste of war but while plying the trade he knows so well seducing the audience he has trumpeted the glory of war that old fraud and so he is just like the rest of the proselytizers only more skillfulstill it is impossible to say what is right if we had not won ww ii the world today would be vastly different totalitarian imperial repressive racist regimes in which the state tortures and enslaves the people would have prevailed they may have nuked one another by now and we could be living in the rubble of a bestial existence who knows thank god for the united states and its incredible industrial capacity because that is what won the war not individual heroics much as our tribal minds along with spielbergs would like to believe such fairy talesnote over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book cut to the chaise lounge or i cant believe i swallowed the remote get it at amazon,reality
normally i do not like war movies but i watched and loved it it deserves to be among  the top 250 movies the story is loosely based on a true story of the sullivan brothers there were five brothers that were all put aboard a ship the ship sunk and they all died in the same day imagine how devastating that must have been to that family because of the sullivan brothers there has been a law passed that siblings cannot serve on the same vessel ,reality
ill keep this as brief as i can due length of this page and to the overwhelming responses to this truly great american movie that now that ive experienced it i plan never to watch againmy review is broken into two separate parts  part one is for those who have difficulty with violence blood and gore dont see ityoull be getting over it for days possibly weekspart two is for those who can handle violence blood and gore see it  youll have the same problem getting over it thoughthis is a movie that locks the name of steven spielberg into cinematic history forever  the thing that makes this movie like no other ever made is that it makes us believe without a doubt what it is to be in the hell that is war  the shocking scenes of violence and horrific combat combined with sound editing that actually makes you want to take cover under your seat will haunt the hardest of souls long after you step out of the darkened theater and back into the normal world  a world you will be thankful to have when you stop to think that 98 of what you just saw actually happened to thousands of american soldiers the story told here is one of ultimate sacrifice and deepest loss  this is not a flagwaving movie nor is it kellys heroes  this is the truth about dday the truth about those who were unfortunate enough to be there and those who were fortunate enough to make it back alive,reality
alright this one definately one of the best films of 1998 and contained some of the most harrowing frightening and realistic battle footage ever filmed now i saw it the day after it was released before any hype had touched this film this film was so overhyped it became sickening another thing thats so annoying is that people are calling this the greatest war or antiwar movie ever made  it is may be one of the best but is isnt in the same ballpark as some of the others this film is meant to show the horrors of war through battle and carnage yes that is one way to show it but the more antiwar style to show it is to show more humanity and suffering like the killing fields the best antiwar film or born on the fourth of july even platoon but because of hype it has the look of an action bloodandguts type of film the video stores are categorizing this under action action the film had a weak script but still a story to buoy the film and an annoying overly patriotic beginning and ending which did play a toll on the film for a second you might even think it glorified war but nevertheless it is mostly overlooked because of the intensity        but these people who call this the greatest war film ever complain about this years other war companion the thin red line it was so different from this taking a different and interesting approach to war is hell and was a great film but obviously flopped thank god hype didnt kill that but nevertheless this is still on my top 5 list of 1998 and is worth a rent,reality
after making such inexcusable trash as the lost world spielberg just cant be taken seriously neither can tom hanks after forrest gump no matter how hard he tries and in his most recent attempt at redemption he doesnt succeed in the slightest he simply cannot refrain from being the typical spielberg with his heavyhanded lofty and ultimately sappy direction the problem here is not the film perse its the fact that he tries to pass it to us as reality the supreme truth about wwii in fact not only there are many visible historical and strategic inaccuracies but most importantly the human interaction is injected with familiar spilbergian fakeness i coudnt help noticing the dialogue aside from a couple of obligatory fwords and a few explicit sexual references feels at least fifty years old when the hollywood character actors went about delivering grand allimportant speeches and witty  crowdpleasing lines sorry steven but if you wanted to keep it real you shouldve cut down on melodramatics or better yet hired a different screenwriter the soldiers suffer from a lack of character development and remain nothing but polished stereotypes their emotional responses not always justified if all the obvious falsenote subplots that make this a spielberg vehicle would be removed hanks trembling hand the german prisoners hysterical clowning one of the privates symbolic confrontation with the enemy as a jew and so on sprs level of realism would have been consistent enough to allow for its nowclassic status the main reasons to view this film of course are the two battle scenes enveloping the story much like in the wild bunch only here instead of using peckinpahs nowcliched slow motion violence the scenes are shot in realtime or even speeded up slightly to an amazing effect john williams thank god quiets down for the duration of both scenes and lets us listen to the actual sounds of war without any musical interference the first scene the storming of omaha beach is so tensionpacked exciting and simultaneously terrifying that it could well be the best of its kind the last onea small group of men versus a veritable army  hmmmwhere have i seen this before is almost as good if not for the cheap hollywood trick at the very end which finds the movie venturing into indiana jones territory it almost seems that spr was directed by two different people spielberg and his wwii battle consultant on the very primal level however the film achieves at least one of its makers many aspirations when i exited the theatre i felt lucky to be alive,reality
it obvious this is a great movie that i dont even need to talk about the fact that shakespeare in love won best movie over spr is absurd spr shows all of us that have never been in war the psychological and physical hardships our national heroes endured this movie helped fathers and sons understand each other shakespeare is a good movie but thats all it is spr is a historical masterpiece that will be shown every vererans day so that future generations will understand what these men did for their country lets see who remembers shakespeare in 2 years,reality
when i viewed schindlers liston video i resisted my urge to fast forward during slow parts not the case i felt compelled to watch it as is as if it was my duty to watch lest we forget my thought of the movie disturbingpainful was the word that came to mind i saw private twice i appreciated it more the second time because i new what to expect  the first time my thoughts were this if asked to recommend the movie i would say no but go anyway what do i think of the movie its gross better than schind list no thanks,reality
i guess when youre steven spielberg no one ever second guesses you this is what i was thinking after the lights came on and i left the theater how else could those cemetery scenes have gotten into the movie wasnt there someone who could have told him that those were horrible scenes war veteran with his sons daughters and barbiedoll grandchildren visits arlington cemetery and asks his wife if hes lived a good life i had to look away it was the most cheesy thing i had ever seen i felt embarrassed for spielberg i thought the scene at the end of schindlers list was pretty cheesy how many more could i have saved had i sold this car but this was infinitely worseaside from those scenes and the one with lincolns letter the movie is okay it suffers from a weak screenplay but the action sequences are the grittiest most realistic and overall most effective ive ever seen the cinematography is dazzling the sound is perfect and the images horrifyingly real youll grip the armrests and live the fearbut i dont think this movie is deserving of all the praise thats been heaped on it it will show you realistically the horrors of war  and perhaps thats worth a pat on the back for spielberg but it could have been better it could have been much much better  if only it had a good plot and some real character developmentdefinitely worth seeing but not the greatest war movie everone more thing  the thin red line was overshadowed by the success of this movie but was very different and very good check it out,reality
this film made me consider the sheer brutality and terror of warfare in a way i had never done before it did this by placing me in the middle of the battle while at the same time enjoying the comfort of a cinema seat i realised in a way i had never accepted before the horror of the dday landings and the courage of each and every man who didnt just lie down and play dead as soon as they and if they set foot on the beach which is probably what i would have doneit made me think in a way that no other film has done i came away reminded of the sacrifice that was made so that we can live in freedom today it reminded everyone that wwii wasnt the neat and tidy war that it sort of gets remembered as i was moved to tears and im not even an american the brits landed too by the waybut that small issue aside this film made me think more than any other film has ever done not just a war film but any film it is to me the most important movie ever made,reality
this movie has been criticised for the large amount of violence in it but i think the violence is necessary to point out what a horrible thing world war 2 really was the story is great and we must all pray that a terrible thing like this must never ever happen again,reality
this movie is worthy of the oscar acclaim that it received  the opening dday scene will turn your stomach with cinematography that seems to come very close to reality i read one comment that said sure it depicted what war is like but we all know what war is like already  what a  slap in the face this kind of thinking is to the men and women who have actually stood in the line of fire  no one can know what war is like unless theyve actually been there if you have never experienced war firsthand and the good lord willing will never experience it then this movie may be the closest thing in depicting what it would be like     as far as the movies premise i took a class in college once called modern war and morality  in this class we pondered the same issues that are discussed by the soldiers in this movie  in one scene hanks says every person that you kill you have to consider it 20 lives saved at least he says that is how you have to think  some people would call it rationalizing an irrational act  well this movie is full of these philosophical dilemmas      and while i have heard some people call the bookend gravesite scenes corny and unneeded i think they add a great touch to the movie  james could be any wwii vet reminiscing on gruesome times and great friends and relatives lost,reality
anyone who comments on this movie as being too graphic lacking in character development or as having scenes that could be cut is missing the entire point of the movie  while we sit here in the 1990s in a comfy movie theater watching a fictionalized version of the horrors of the taking of omaha beach there were hundreds of young men barely past high school age who had to live it  to say that a scene was too graphic is to belittle the men who had to witness it first hand and did not have the option of turning off the vcr or leaving the theater  sometimes a movie is supposed to make us think  sometimes things are not always laid out for uswe have to pick them up ourselves  and finally bravo to spielberg for making one of the few truly honest war pictures ever war is not pleasant  it is not about this superhuman nobility and clean victory  no matter which side wins everyone loses this movie made me think long and hard about what people my age 20 had to go through just 50 years ago  when i saw this film in the theater i was surrounded by members of the wwii generation and i could see in their eyes that this was almost too real for them  the ability to create a movie that makes a 20 year old girl in 1999 feel like she was at normandy in 1944 is an epic talent that should be cherished  is beyond a 10 anyone who doesnt see that should really watch it again,reality
is simply the best war movie ever made and also the best movie of this summer for now steven spielberg is the best producer of all time ,reality
fantastic from start to end speilberg had a master plan with this film that complements shindlers list the story the acting the graphic realism nonstop action intermeshed with brutal ironyone could go on despite criticism of corp upham he could have done little else being a noncombatant humanist who was deluded by being civilized in wartime speilberg wished to show the unimaginable cruelty horror and pain suffered by all who were caught in the entire holocaust we call ww ii and he masterfully succeeded,reality
wow what can i saythis is truly spielbergs masterpiece it  will take a lot of effort to to find any significant flaw in this epic it is a real disgrace that it was not awarded best picture at the academy awards one of the outstanding aspects of this film is that despite its realistic description of war as hell on earth it clearly points out that the sacrifices  was not all for nothing democracy and freedom must never be taken for granted i give it a 10 see it today and buy a copy on vhs tomorrow,reality
speilberg proves himself yet again as the best director of all times  he has successfully left the goonies behind for more intelligent movies worthy of his vast talents and this is a good example his use of different filming and sound creates a dramatic effect it is the prime example of a movie which makes you feel as if youre there of course hanks performance is oscarworthy yet again kbone rating 10,reality
i gave it a 7 which was a compromise between the absolutely excellent effects and the absolutely lousy plot it couldve been less but hey you have to see the famous first minutes even with such a typical dumbhollywood scenario,reality
this the most unforgettable war film ive ever seenthe depictions of the horror of war and what is did to our brave soldiers with always linger with methe battle scenes were so brutally vivid that i thought the director had built a time machine and when back in time filmed the battle scenes as they happened profound and haunting are the adjectives that come to mind in this film and its images will linger long in my memory,reality
i saw this movie the day it opened not knowing much about it beforehand i was really blown aray this was without a doubt the most realistic portrayal of war ive ever seen in a movie the dday reenactment alone is one of the most powerful scenes ever put to film this movie is the flip side of those glamorized hollywood john wayne movies from the 40s and the scary thing is as real it it looked its still probably not as real as it actually wasid never seen an audience so silent leaving a movie theater before i left that theater with a new appreciation for the people who fought and died in world war ii i recently gathered up the courage to see this movie a second time when it came out on video and it lost none of the emotional imact it had on me the first time a true mark of a great film in the summer that gave us godzilla armageddon and the avengers this movie was a breath of fresh air,reality
everything that i thought this movie was going to be changed in the first 5 minutes  is an unwavering trek into the deepest darkest horrors of war  spielberg pulls no punches in his telling of the tale of 8 brave men on a mission to save a mothers last remaining son  hanks delivers a performance that is sure to bring him his third best actor oscar and tom sizemore is superb as a hardnosed sergeant that stands at hanks side  powerful performances and incredible special effects make this one of the best films of steven spielbergs career,reality
steven spielbergs most unforgettable film it is the most realistic war film ever made provides the most accurate and heartwrenching portrayal of war at its worst the first 20 minutes will draw tears and sorrow as the viewer finds his or herself as just a mere spectator of what brave men had to torment during a quest for world orderi loved this movie i give it 10 out of 10wouldnt it be great if this movie was on dvd,reality
an awsome depiction of the unimaginable horrors of war is a visual masterpiece the opening scene of carnage and slaughter should slice through even the most imperturbable viewer sometimes i try to tell myself that i would have been strong enough to witness the atrocities of war without breaking down but after seeing this movie which so artfully put the viewer in the thick of the battlefield i know with certainty that god forbid if i had to endure what these wwii veterans went through my mind would have shattered into thousands of pieces that to this very day i would still be trying to put back together,reality
like anyone else i was not only spellbound but also made very uneasy by the opening scene  there was a specific part of that scene that i have never witnessed in a war movie before one of stark realism that i can attest to because of a tour in vietnam  as the landing craft begin to lower their ramps there is the vision of many of the men being cut down by german machine guns ashore  i say vision because you dont hear the sounds of the guns as you would in the average war movie  instead what you hear is the sound of the rounds striking the men and the sides of the craft  this fits with the very real tenet that you never hear the one that gets you obviously because of the speed of sound you take the hit before you hear the report providing youre lucky enough to hear it and if you do is not a loud report rather a sometimes faint one depending upon the distance of the shooter from your position  i have heard leaves all around me being clipped by enemy fire and can honestly say i dont recall hearing the shots responsible  this is the realism that spielberg provided during that scene and it was a bit unnerving  later in the film i noticed that after the firefight at the radar station where the american medic was killed the same number of gis are seen walking across a field as had walked across another field prior to the contact  this obvious editing mistake was actually good for me because it put the movie in its proper perspective the fact that that was what it was a movie  considering the fact that the rest of the thing was brutally realistic i was glad to have had that little error to fall back on  otherwise i might have been tempted to believe that it wasnt just a movie at all my opinion of this film one of the best of all time if not the top  i can watch it several times and i will,reality
first of all before i get to my complaints let me say that this is a fairly wellmade entertaining movie  spielberg puts together a good flick though i still maintain he has not achieved the status of hitchcock or kubrik  the battle scenes were fantastic and by far the most realistic that i have ever seen not including the thin red line  anyone who thinks that normandy was a glorious day should watch this film which depicts the landing of the us army rangers near omaha beach one of the most hellish fights in army history  and i do have to say that the cast was one of the greatest ensemble casts ever made  the scene where hanks reveals who he his to stop a quarrel is just fantasticnow having said that this is not the greatest war movie ever made as some have proclaimed  for one thing i just find it patently ridiculous that a platoon of soldiers would be sent deep within enemy lines to save one guy maybe that kind of stuff happened maybe not but i find it very implausible  unfortunately a movie with a bunch of guys roaming the european theatre fighting germans would have been worse  another thing  one more role with a pompous tom hanks and i will vomit  hes a good actor to be sure but jeez  and matt damons performance did not impress me eitherthats my story and im sticking to it ,reality
whats interesting is that we have a meeting of the war movie minds with this film   spr has attracted the john wayneaudie murphy fans with the realists aka coppolastonekubrick lovers   both camps will find fault with this movie but an open mind will really appreciate what spielberg achieved with this film   the action in the first halfhour is top notch you will not find action of this kind in any war movie to date  now we come to the plot   war films and plots are usually blurred or nonexistent unless they are nonfictionattempted true to life films   in this case we have a fictional story with a plot  compared to platoon and fmj this movie has a plot   the movie has peaks and valleys as do most films that is how one builds a climax   the hype of this film has jaded many to believe that you can achieve 2 hours and 49 minutes of intensity to match dday  spielberg captures peaks and valleys of soldier combat   its intense battles with a lot of boredomto sum it uppatton better character developmentplatoon uses personal experience to judge a period of time too much bias to show one side of vietnam  deer hunter makes platoon look weakfmj  characters a bit disjointed realistic combatthe longest day a puff piece the only redeeming aspect is the german perspectivea bridge too far weak screenplay for a true to life drama a good war film nonetheless,reality
this is a good movie  i agree i think that this is the greatest war movie of all time yet  i like the way how steven spielberg made the bombs exploding the bullets flying the people getting hit  it looks very real its like you are in the movie fighting  very sad though  the way soldiers died  im glad that tom hanks was in that movie  same with barry pepper and all the other actorsactresses  this is my favorite steven spielberg movie  they go threw the battlefield just to save one boy private james francis,reality
this was a change of pace from every other movie that has come out this summer  i went in to see a lot of action then found a movie with historical backgrounds and moral issues of war  i heard how violent this movie was but i was still caught off guard  i think this was the most violent movie ive ever seen  all in all the movie was excellent  you might want to stay away from the hot dog while viewing this movie,reality
the wars heroes are losers because generally they die steven spielberg shows exactly the horror of the war and how a decent and simple man can change in a killing machine just for finding and the last son alive the man won his cause he found and saved private but he died did it worth,reality
usually war films dont appeal to me but steven spielbergs latest hypedrenced film did look like a remarkable film so i watched it i have to say from beginning to end i could not take my eyes off the film for one second it was absolutely compelling almost in a a surreal way i have never seen such a film as this one steven spielberg triumphantly proved to the world once again after schindlers list just what a phenomenal director he is it totally baffled me how he could of crafted such a physically and emotionally complicated with virtual flawlessness there are two major battle scenes  one in the beginning and one in the end and they are both extremely harrowing the first one burns with unflinching realism you almost feel like youre right there with the soldiers instead of watching them on a screen it shows just how terrifying the war really was every form of anihilation and destruction is captured on film the second one is a bit more sombre mainly because the audience has gotten to known the main characters and after witnessing some of their deaths our feelings and sympathy and sorrow are evoked the performances given by tom hanks ed burns and the rest of the crew forgot their names but are all enormously talented are all exceptional they all have diverse personalities but when they put in serious situations we powerfully sense their shared emotions of instinct terror longing and grief saving privates power comes mainly from its clear moral as it proves just how tragic the war really was and the devastating impact it had on the world and humanity the story may be fictitious but the movie still enables us to have a pretty good idea of the savage violence that rampaged the earth during the wars all while asking the ulimate question was there any reason at all why this had to happen it was a question that lingered in my mind for days afterwards is a truly extraordinary film,reality
this is not a film for the melancholicsure it has great special effects theres more blood and guts to be found here than in your average war movie and if youve become accustomed to watching nato missions on cnn or on the net this might just bring to mind the fact that in war there is suffering no matter what the technology used in this respect the sound effects are particularly poignantbut there are two scenes in particular which brought me a cold sweat in one a german soldier and in the other an american find themselves in a situation where death at the hands of the enemy is now inevitable for each the only remaining option is to beg for mercy and hope that their communications are understood but what brings out pathos in the viewer wins little understanding from these soldiers therein lies the most gruesome message of all in war these men have lost the ability to treat others as humans this contrasts sharply with what we learn of their private lives prior to the start of the warthe cinematography is excellent just as the beach scene filmed in ireland receives acclaim for its realism the scene on the bridge is filled with tension as the soldiers await the arrival of the tanks its high noon with tom hanks in the role of the sheriffprivate plays little role in the film perhaps this is why some commentators have said the film lacked depth they wanted to see how mrs was feeling at home to them i say go watch a lassie movie,reality
is a great movie it contains the best battle scenes i have ever seen in a film  merely on the merits of the films first half hour spr will deservingly have an important place in film historyand although i think the movie was great a couple things about it fell just a little short1 the contrived bookending sequence with the old man at the cemetary wouldnt the story have been just as powerful if told entirely during the war 2 the script was good but it pales in comparison to the directing cinematography and actingthis movie had such high ambitions that it was disappointing to not see spielberg reach them entirely  its like a team that has an amazing season then loses the superbowl  this film came very very close to being a nearly flawless masterpiecemy rating 44 stars  95100,reality
i have only just seen this film on video for the first time and i must say that i regret not having seen it at the cinema but after sitting through schindler i was loathe to get an uncomfortable bum for a little bit more spielberg self glory and pomposity  except for a jingoistic america is the greatest land in the world kind of attitude  i thought that this film stood head and shoulders above any other film of this genre and literally shot down the longest day as my classic ww2 movieit is as has been pointed out repeatedly in these comments a very fine and realistic seeming drama  ok so the plot is thin and intentionally narrow minded but what hollywood movie isnt at the moment and it was refreshing to see the characters in the film moaning about how ludicrous and shallow their mission and therefore the plot line was but in the weak plot is its grace  the sheer waste of life and time hits you very hard and it is the documentary of wartime which comes at you like a screaming fury and provokes a huge emotional reaction which ill wager im not alone had me discussing wwii  20th century politics and war in general for quite a few daysyes it may have been based on a reallife story  yes the historical representation may have been unnervingly accurate  yes the omah landings did prove costly the artillery bomardment and armour landings failed to materialise  not surprising from the american armed forces  and yes a great number of very brave men died  what got to me though was the huge pointlessness of the fight  who was actually saved   certainly not emotionally  the wartorn lands of france  not in the film  the american or even come to that the poor german soldiers who had to obey orders which did not take into account their humanity  not if the ketchup was anything to go by  not even hanks spielberg et al were saved the misery of shakey in love picking up their beloved oscarsbut the direction of the piece  the cinematography the initial landing scene grainy and with fantastic sound and visual effects will stay with me for a long time to comespielberg has once again shot up in my estimation and it was pleasant not to have his own insecurities and pats on the back so prevalent in one of his films  i even hear that the next jews during the war movie the betty someone story may not even be directed by him but may go to the bard branagh instead but here he has at last come of age in the realms of adult drama and serious filmmaking,reality
a scary film  the landing scenes were so real i was left cold  is this what war is really like  i personally think that soldiers who worry as much about whats happening around them as these guys did do not last longthe acting is not important  how can one who has never experienced war produce the necessary emotions or lack of them  the effects are good not too flashy to let you relax yet strong enough to shock you  the movie seems overlong though as the search for continues  a lot of the dialogue there seems superfluous  a better director might have used less talking and more expression to convey the same emotions  unfortunately there was little attempt at developing the characters beyond the basic stereotypes so their fate does not matter much in the end  still  a modern audience may need that statement of the obvious to get the pointdo i recommend this movie  if you have not seen a war movie before do so  any attempt at illustrating the realities of war is commendable however if you have seen other war movies save yourself the time  the movie is too long and despite a terrifying start fails to engage you in the long run watch it on videoi rate 25 out of 4,reality
i finally saw spr on video last night what a valiant attempt by spielberg to realistically depict the sacrifices of the allies during the normandy invasion and its near aftermath this is almost a great movie i had trouble hearing some of the dialogue and granted some of the scenes seemed a bit trite but mostly this film succeeded im also sorry that blacks and hispanics were not included yes the germans were portrayed as being brutal particularly steamboat willie but on the other hand there were also scenes where americans ruthlessly shot surrendering germans it just goes to show that war really is hellnone of the comments that i read here focused on the lincoln letter which general marshall quotes by heart in the early part of the film and later incorporates into a final letter to mrs i found this to be extremely effective in establishing the overall theme which was the sacrifice of our fathers grandfathers uncles etc on the altar of freedom in the end it was not the brutality of war but the selfgiving sacrifices of the wwii generation which is the main point of spr,reality
this film is fantastic ive never seen so many open mouths in one place as there was in the cinema during the first half hour of this film children should be forced to watch the first half hour to at least give them some idea of the sacrafice made by these men and the courage it took to run at machine guns it is the kind of film that the more you think of it the better it becomes im not a tom hanks fan but he is really very good in this film and tom sizemore is superb and ted dansons two minutes is his best since cheersjust watch it even if you dont like war films watch it,reality
a master class in filmmaking this contains some of the most brilliantly executed battle sequences ever made this is one of those rare films that arent afraid to depict battle in a very realistic manner managing to show how people can die such senseless and horrible deaths there is one particular sequence at the beginning of the movie that really numbs youas an example of the futility of war it certainly delivers and the plot concerning really concerns the tom hanks character for he is the one who needs saving the film does have flaws in its narrative and the middle section is possibly 20 minutes too long but taken as a whole the film is quite an achievement and surely should have won the best picture oscar when viewed on video the one major aspect that will be missed is the ultra realistic sound effects that manage to add a whole new dimension to the battle scenes making you feel as if you are really therewhile this isnt spielbergs best film technically it is his most accomplished and is an example of a filmmaker nearing the peak of his creative abilities at the oscars spielbergs face said it all  this deserved best picture910,reality
not being a big fan of tom hanks or movies that seem to get blown up reviews i went into this movie prepared for a let down from all the prerelease hype how can anybody say what war is like unless they have been in one  if you see spr you will feel like you have the only difference is you come back alive after the first assault on the audiences senses spr tracks a group of 8 men sent out to bring back one for all the people who say the plot is unbelievable or the characters weak that is hogwash this is one of the best movies of all timemaybe not the best but it ranks up there with schindlers list gone with the wind and all the other academy award winners check out the movie be your own judge i saw it in sdds thx and i wouldnt recommend seeing it in anything else  invest the 600 or 700 dollars and you determine if war is hell,reality
we live in an age where war is not fashionable and old glory has not the respect it once did  this movie begins and ends with a shot of the american flag looking as if it had been washed in hot water instead of sent to the dry cleanera woman has three sons killed in action virtually simultaneously  army policy is that in such a situation the sole surviving son  private  be discharged  unfortunately parachuted behind german lines the day before dday  the army chief of staff meets with his wogs some seem concerned about bad pr if all the sons die some see the rescue mission as suicidethis may be a violent war movie but it is also a story about the decision to do what is right  whatever the cost may bewar is a duplicitous adventure  men do good things for bad reasons and bad things for good reasons sometimes its hard to tell the two apartthe lead character played by tom hanks tries to do what is right  in the fog of war some die and some good is done  maybe thats what war is all about,reality
i honestly thought that this movie should have won best picture and i still have no idea why it didnt when you watch this movie in the theater it is just incredible almost as if you were right there in battle it is definitely a movie worth watching over and over the opening scene dday was amazing it gave the audience a really good idea of what these young soldiers had to go through on that day of june 6 1944 i really think that kids now days should watch this movie and maybe then theyll realize that so many young men had died to give them their freedom,reality
this war movie is probably the best antiwar movie ever made  as a combat veteran with some major time spent making war i think that this movie does a better job than any other i have seen to show the reality of combat,reality
has several very intense and touching scenes the first half hour is for instance a movie classic already however having not seen this movie on the big screen i guess i dont look upon these thirty minutes the way many other people do for me they are only intense  like so many scenes in so many filmson the whole is far from a masterpiece it is very wellmade and rather interesting but not much more i still enjoyed it though even if i think glory and a few other films are much better war moviesand as for the academy awards this year i consider it to be a scandal that shakespeare in love won the best picture award spr is at least somewhat better than that film its just as strange as the fact that edward norton didnt win the best actor awardso this film is far from a masterpiece but i still appreciate the fact that spr is wellmade and interesting,reality
i loved for many reasons but mainly because im an history freak i love to learn about the past and spielberg made an excellent job at recreating what wwii was really like  it makes you think twice before starting a war,reality
im only 12 and my mom didnt like me watching because of all of the graphic violence but just think about it this film was so realistic id see what happened sooner or later in a film in school except the fact that what id see in school would be what really happenedit also shows that you may be at war with a country but you dont just wanna kill it wasnt just like the united states sent in some bad ass udt team of 8 and whooped hitlers army people actually died from the us and they showed them on the beach of normandy just laying there while being shot at from machine guns on hill sides it just didnt seem cheez compared to like some delta force movies ive seen where a guy is left behind so they jump 50 feet into a helicopter throw the guy out and luckily they have rope or the tie something to the yoke to make it not move and they go down and rescue em or someone gets shot in the chest once and dies while some other dude gets shot like 50 million times and ends up beating the other side,reality
as many others have remarked the first 25 minutes of this film are intense brutal and painful to endure i agree there however i disagree with some that the shaky cam during the normandy sequence was jarring or headache inducing completely drawn in never once did i stop to think i was viewing the gore and horror through a lens i was there and i didnt want to be i closed my eyes during some scenes but i couldnt close my ears i couldnt escape  the bullets kept on flyinghow could anyone survive something like that and go on to lead a seminormal life i couldnt even watch white christmas after seeing this movie at the first sight of a wwii jeep i wanted to cry what is it like for someone who was really theregood movies simultaneously make us think and feel and this one did that for me i only wish spielberg would have cast unknowns in all of the parts seeing tom hanks and matt damon in the midst of this ultrarealistic violence reminded me it was still hollywood pulling the strings most people have commented that hanks should win an oscar but i think that would be unfair to the rest of the cast the grueling process they had to endure the dark heart of humanity each actor had to face to make such a film makes them all deserving of recognition hanks played captain miller with honesty and grace but i dont think he necessarily outshone the performances of tom sizemore ed burns or jeremy daviesanalyzing the plot or the characters is missing the point if the jew had been the sniper from tennesee or the brooklynite had been the combatshy translator most of you would still complain about stereotypes people say they didnt care about the characters because they werent interesting is everyone you meet on the street incredibly interesting i doubt it the point isnt to care or not care when they get killed but to realize this really happened to all kinds of men and women that we may find boring or typical in civilian life but who put their lives on the linesome say they didnt need the war is hell message crammed down their throats well thats great for you but if everyone knows war is bad death is bad why is it still so rampant in our society war is always happening somewhere this movie shows that not only is war hell but the death of one man is just as tragic if everyone really did know this we wouldnt have gang wars driveby shootings or terrorist bombings everyone needs to know this and if a gutwrenching movie will drive this message home to those people then im all for itand though this is getting too long already i have to say one more thing many of you didnt care for the apparent sappiness of the bookend scenes of the old man at the cemetery why does everyone have such an aversion to sentiment i say things in my every day life that if someone were to make them movie dialogue would sound hopelessly cheesy but that doesnt make them any less true or real,reality
my mom would tell me your grandfather was a paratrooper in world war ii i never had any idea what she meant  however after seeing this movie i now realize the hell that my grandfather went through as he fought for our country  steven spielberg perfectly portrays the pure horror of war and why it should not be viewed as an action packed event  i was somewhat astonished while i viewed this movie as many men never even made it to land  the acting is great and the war scenes are perfectly i mean perfectly done  i never got to meet my grandfather as he died of cancer shortly after i was born  i now realize how brave he really was and i view him with a lot more respect than i once did,reality
this is one of the greatest movies i have ever seen  if there was any doubt that spielberg is the greatest director of the late 20th century this film removed it  during the oscars i was pulling for shakespeare in love to win best pic however after seeing this film i have to repent of my sins this film was the best movie of 1998warning this film is graphic so if you dont like violence i would not recommend it but if you can take such violence then i would highly recommend ittom hanks is at his usual best matt damon does a good job as well and even edward burns is okay i do not like this actor as he takes himself way too seriouslywhat else can new can be said  go see this film  you wont forget it,reality
this is without a doubt one of the best war films ever made and how the hell shakespeare in love won best picture over this is beyond methe opening scene on normandy is definitely the most realistic battle scene ever captured on film the gut wrenching effects and the horror in the faces of the soliders are endearing images in my mind that ill never forgethow some people can say the performances are weak is absurd tom hanks gives one of his best as with ed burns ive also heard complaints that the movie falls apart after the opening scene with which i disagree the plot develops nicely and it did enough to keep my attention until the the battle at the end in the abandoned city another very realistic and well done scenei give spr 1010 if you arent affected emotionally by this film youre probably dead,reality
when i got to the theater to see this i hadnt yet seen schindlers list and thought it was pretty good and that it would win a lot of awards at the oscars  however after having seen schindlers list i understand why did not win best picture of the yearis closer than a cool action movie than a heavy drama like schindlers list  sure its good but it isnt the best movie of the year  i think that perhaps if spielberg had cut out more of the action and gory scenes and had concentrated more on the fact that mrs would like to see her last son come home it probably would have been a higher and better quality drama than it actually isalthough the opening on the beach of normandie on dday is pretty well shown i think that there were a couple of scenes that could have been cut for example one of the soldiers looking around for his arm in a pile of others or the other soldier trying to keep all his intestines inside his bodyall in all its a very good movie but it isnt even close to being nearly as good as schindlers list which probably explains why didnt win best picture of the year,reality
the soldiers of the united states army have fought for this country with great courage honor and commitment  because of these soldiers we live in a peaceful world  these men were brave  they are heroes  they have served this country with great pride  what is the point of risking the lives of eight to save one  what is the point of saving any at all  is your life worth less than the life of someone youve never met  these soldiers fought to save our country and our freedom from the people that try to take those away from us  they fight so that they can save the lives of others  we are the others  to the mother that has lost 3 of her 4 children her last surviving son is in that category  these soldiers fought to save one man that was their duty  as captain john miller said to his soldiers if that gives me the right to go back to my wife  he knew it was his duty to save this man  his job is to save as many lives as he can and one life of private should not be ignored  i gave this movie a 10 out of 10 and only 2 movies have got this rating on my list  this movie earned this rating,reality
much has been said in homage of this movie realistic important devastating a masterpiece an instant classic brilliant but how much of this is hype is this an example of the mainstream press bouncing off of itself to create an event is this really the first movie to show what war is really like  who knows really well people all around the world know exactly what war is like theres the world war korea and vietnam veterans here in the us the vietnamese korean laotian chechnyan iraqi isrealite palestinian saudi arabian french german etc etc civilians and soldiers alive during the conflicts in their countries that either have happened or are happening right now or in other words perhaps there are more people alive who know exactly what war is like than you can shake a stick at maybe even more people than live in the us maybe more than will ever plunk down cash to see this visceral  fantasy this money making effortdont forget just how much tom hanks steven spielberg and thousands of other folk whose lives depend upon the success of their entertainment ventures are going to make from this particular one that depends partially upon our buying in to the acceptabilityeven the goodness of killing people with guns ie as german soldier is sitting astride one of our heroes about to run him through with a knife tell me that you dont want to wrest the gun out of the ineffectual intellectual who lies frozen just around the corner that you dont want to take that gun and shoot the heck out of the soldier killing our friend  oh my yesi personally havent lived through a war i dont know what it is like i cant however imagine that it was anything like the first 30 minutes of and it certainly wasnt anything like the next overly romanticized two hours  it might have been hard to watch sure but i could just close my eyes think these are all actors and lo and behold three hours later im thinking about which restaurant to eat at  i wouldnt try to think that my experience with this movie would let me talk with any sophistication with someone who has lived through an armed conflict much less imagine that i in any way was left with an experience that threw my very notion of myself into turmoil is just a movie perhaps it was a more realistic effort than has been previously made but all you need to do is throw a lot of money at something take into account an audience more prepared for on screen violence and hire enough people who are decently skilled at what they do and poof you have sure it is finely crafted certainly the acting is decent the lines arent completely horrible and the cinematography doesnt intrude on the experience but it is still just a movie  if we as a nation need something like to realize that war is horrible that people die way too quickly and without reason then i think this means that there is something wrong with us  there are people living situations out there that are far worse than anything we feel when we are in our air conditioned theatres and i think that it is a bit condescending of us to think that we understand anything about war just because we watched this movieit is a fine movie not exceptional not the best of the year not even as interesting as forest gump but a fine movie that is worth seeing sure,reality
after scanning some of the other comments i think im more disturbed by some of them than i am this film first of all the battle scenes are spectacular particularly the invasion sequence none other than john keegan famed war historian has said that it is as realistic as your going to find on film some here have criticized it for being to amerocentric i guess thats a word because the soldiers are all american this is not a fair criticism  the soldiers landing on omaha and utah beaches were all americans the other beaches gold juno and sword were landed upon by british and canadian soldiers mostly if youre going to criticize a movie do it for it is not what it is not of course many other nations participated in wwii but because theyre not seen does not invalidate this film the men who landed at omaha beach were by far the hardest hit the normandy battles were not as large as kursk for example but celebrating one battle does not somehow invalidate the rest criticizing it for that is childish and petulant the movie does slow a little in the middle but i did not see any mushy hollywood type movie making your stereotyped hollywood picture has a big soundtrack and lots of gratuitous pyrotechnics  this movie had none of that i have often criticized some of spielbergs films in the past but i have none to offer this film its not perfect no film is but its very good an indirect kudos to stanley kubrick whose influence i saw in a couple of scenes maybe thats just me but it seemed kubrickian in a quiet indirect sort of way,reality
the reality of war has comprised of nearly onehundred movies during the past century and no one in that time frame has been able to make it as real as spielberg did in all of it was true the death the destruction the horror everythingthe movie is quite remarkable for nearly three hours it showed the basics and specifics of how the allies and enemies went at it in wwii the enormous amount of losses at normandy were all that sparked me in the movie that is where i started remembering who was on that beach at the time or who made it or who didntthe entire cast conducts an incredible performance hanks and burns shine damon and sizemore strike the screen with their emotions and thoughts and spielberg again amazes the world with his hard work and dedication toward the movie industry and the history of the world,reality
my granddad was in world war ii under many of the same circumstances as the characters in the movie seeing the movie really helps me appreciate what he went through i really cant say enough good things about this movie tom hanks should have gotten best actor and the movie should have won best picture i cant believe so many people on this site gave it one star i dont know what movie they saw because the one i saw was spectacular this is a must see beautifully directed wonderful cast and a very emotional story dont miss this movie,reality
i guess you all know what its all about and youve heard about how real it iswell for me it came across mostly as very realistic although the omaha beach landing was more a gorefest than great cinema this might have been intentional as the purpose probably was to shock the audience with the full horrors of warstill this scene doesnt do it for me why because ive read so much about the dday and wwii that i know people died in droves literally on the beaches that day such as they always do in war only this was on a much greater scale that same scale what is working against the scene because we dont know the characters involved and we do know that those we recognisetom sizemore and tom hanks for instance will make it safely ashore as they have to go and find this paratrooper schmuck named it is a good scene though just not all that it was claimed to beok ok ive rambled on about the landing how about the rest of the film well it starts off a bit slow to allow the audience to get their breaths back from the opening 20 minute blood bath and to introduce the main characters to the audience we are also introduced to the films moral dilemma is it fair to risk the lives of nine men to save one just because his three brothers have already died what price are we prepared to pay and for what exactly are we willing to pay that price the message is further emphasized by the losses incurred on our small group of heroes as they traverse the french countryside the whole mission seems like a suicide especially as nobody knows wether is still alive at alland its the final battle scene that really makes the movie for me because now its man to man you know the characters involved and you can see the fear in their eyes and you can see the same fear in the germans eyesso its really gritty and intense and spielberg has managed to capture all this with a really stunning and upclose photo the cinematics are incredible the shots are long with few cuts just like in the old david lean movies lawrence of arabia most notably all this combines into one long and really breathtaking battle it would probably have been easier to start a real war and film that one instead than to shoot this battle scene when i came out of the theater my condition could only be described as shellshockedsadly this is a movie which will lose a lot if seen on a tv but see it anyway if you havent seen it yet,reality
i was surprised with this americanwarmovie this is no common americanwe are so good and the germans are so stupid and evil it really catches the horror of wari see great similarities with the german stalingrad1993i found that was much better than i had expectedi must say its the best war movie i have ever seen,reality
left me speechless  to say it was a quality film does not do it justice  its a shame that there will be an inevitable posse of people who dont like this film  i hate those achingly typical individuals who feel a need to buck the majority  admittedly its not a film for everyone but no one can say that it wasnt a welldone motion picture  the actors did a stellar job of bringing what could have easily been stereotypical soldiers to life  giovanni ribisi was particularly riveting in my humble opinion  still i have one ittybitty bone to pick with this film  its a shame that spielberg had to frame his incredible wwii story with a painfully contrived modernday scene  i dealt with the beginning but the end was positively gooey with cheese  what happened  during wwii was the story not what happened after  other than that  i commend spielberg for creating such an affecting motion picture and for having the courage to cast such brilliant yet relatively unknown actors,reality
see this film for the first half hour thats all and while your watching it keep thinking to yourself not too long ago this actually happened forget the crap in the middle for me that ruined the film cause the brutally realistic and horrific beginning just went downhill into sappy cliched hollywood stuff i dont think spielburg pulled this off as well as he could have its all very patriotic to america making out like they were the only ones fighting the war no other nationalities apart from the germans who are very cliched in this film very evil and cold blooded not human at all which even though they were on the opposite side they were human too just like the americans i thought the way they were portrayed was very bitter and if youre going to make a good anti war movie you have to get across the message that war is futile and affects and hurts everyone not just one nationality that is why it is so pointless the film is visually raw and bleak like it should be but i think the storyline flaws it too much and spielberg could have done a bit better,reality
this film truly moved and terrified me at the same time when i watched it at the cinema not many films can do that except for maybe schindlers list recently i rented it but could only watch it until half way through the omagh beach scene i think this film is the kind that you can only watch once my dad watched it and it moved him also he even had tears in his eyes by the end of it i cant believe that some war veterans involved in dday could actually begin to watch this film it must bring back some terrible memories i think its something that we all should watch because it brings home the horrific nature of war that books and even pictures cannot even begin to illustrate most kids like me should definitely watch this as it makes us realise just how trivial our troubles in life seem we should not be allowed to forget the millions of ordinary men who were slaughtered in this conflict what they died for and just how lucky we really are my only critcism of the movie is how like many hollywood films only concentrate on the american side of it all when many other nationalities participated ok i accept that omagh was a mainly american thing but even now the american soldiers are all portrayed as the good guys who can do no wrong and the germans as inhuman monsters take that bit at the end for example when the german stabs the american what i think the film fails to illustrate is that even the germans were just ordinary men just like the american soldiers with mothers and families and i think portraying all the german soldiers as pure evil is a bit outdated and sad we should realise that now i also wish that this film could have been about and dedicated to all the men whatever their nationality who gave their lives on dday it wasnt just the americans despite this however i think the opening scene is about as close as we can come to how dday actually was and i think its about time we knew what the war veterans went through for us and how eternally grateful we should be to them,reality
i like many young people had a grandfather that was in the war  i know he faced death many times but i dont know how many times or any of the details of his ordeal in wwii  he wouldnt ever talk about them not even to my mother or her sister  sometimes i could never understand that but now i do  if this is really what it was like to be a soldier no matter what war you are fighting then it must be an incredibly difficult ordeal to drudge up memories that are this disturbing this vivid and this real  i have never been to war and i hope to god that i never have to experience war but after seeing this movie i believe i can tell you at least what it may have been like  this movie is that vivid and that honestthe first half an hour of this film is some of the most amazing direction i have seen in any film in my entire life  i have even read that spielberg toned it down some  that is hard to believe knowing what is up there on screenthis film is brilliant in every capacity  the direction is so clear and crisp that you feel like you know these men when the film is over  you feel like you understand the war a little better than you did before  the acting is terrific  and not just hanks and damon but everyone from sizemore to ribisi to the grunt that gets his guts blown out  take your pick as to who that is i cant believe a film like shakespeare in love a film that could have been an after school special was chosen as best picture  best picture  over this  how is that possible  if you havent seen this  and there arent many of you out there  please do yourself a favour see it tonight  it is such an amazing film and it is one that i will never forgeta final note  even though my grandfather has been gone for about 8 years now i salute him and every other guy that put it on the line and did so because they believed in what they were doing  i have a new understanding and appreciation for people like my grandfather  and that a film could make me feel that way is something special in itself,reality
im getting really tired of some people some guys seems to expect entertaining violence in the  lethal weapon   way in movies like  clockwork orange   reservoir dogs  and this one these people seems to think that when a soldier in this movie picks up an arm that seems to be his own they should say  hey that was cool  wrong wrong wrong the meaning of this movie is to make you shocked in movies that stallone willis van damme or schwarzenegger stars in you dont feel shocked at all if you dont get shocked of this movie then you are extremely stupid now for the movie itself this is one of the best movies ever created and for sure the best war  movie of all times the cast are spectacular the realizm shocking  as it should be  and the battle scenes incredible exiting this movie is a top movie 10 stars everytime the movie is done you just want to put the cassette back in press rewind and watch it over and over again,reality
i grew up believing that the greatest silliness the academy ever managed was naming annie hall best picture for 1977  the academy awards are trivial in the grand scheme of things true but when the english patient swept a few years back i allowed myself to be pulled back in  this brief period of interest in the academy came to an abrupt end however last march  not only was stiffed but the best picture award went to not even the nextbest film  shakespeare in love pales next to elizabeth let alone the greatest war movie ever made  yup from now on ill let my heart and head guide meto hell with lists this of course is not the greatest lesson one may glean from in this age of reckless exposure it is truly satisfying to hear tom hanks say that the memories he has of his wife are his alone  some things need to die with us otherwise our lives are mere vehicles  dont think that this movie falls to long distancing reflections about intangiblesthat was the thin red line  everything here is grounded in the mud blood and rusty mechanisms of war  that anchors itself so firmly yet still evokes such beauty is its greatest gift  maybe thats what we have been looking for in war films all alongan angel that greets us during the massacre,reality
this is by far the best war film ever made its unorthodoxed war story but it was based on a true story plus it isnt a vietnam movie  vietnam movies are beaten to death and all try to capture the psychological and emotional horrors of war which private does little of  it focuses on the carnage and reality of war  the invasion on normandy was the best invasion ever captured on film  the finale at the end out matches the invasion on normandy however it is pure carnage  you cant help but say wow  it is the fastest three hours ive ever spent in a movie theatre  it was acted brilliantly all of the actors deserved an oscar nod spielberg is a true genius at what he does he cant possibly out do himself  the most riveting cinematography ever cinematographer janusz kaminski definitely deserved his oscar the moving camera in the film makes it seem very realistic  910,reality
this movie is what being an american is all about  it showed us just how proud we should be to be part of such a great country and to love honor and respect those who fought so we could be born and be loved by the people who were meant to love us  this movie is a perfect 10 and then some  god bless america,reality
here it is a movie that demands to be seen on the big screen amazing fight sequence to start the movie it may not always be real movies just cant be but there is drama and intensity some good and solid performances terrific sets and sound overcome the plot and some belabored dialogue,reality
this is the best war movie ever it has to be one of the most powerful movies ever made the dday recreation at the beginning of the movie is the most stunning sequence ever to be put on film i still have no idea how steven spielberg was able to pull it off tom hanks turned in a great performance as the leader of the troop the whole supporting cast was excellent all worthy of an oscar nomination along with schindlers list spielberg has made the two best movies of the 90s movies like platoon and apocalypse now showed what it was really like in vietnam but now there is a movie that shows what it was really like at dday and wwii it was robbed of a best picture oscar,reality
this should be the best movie of the year the first 30 min are the most intense battle scenes i have ever seen  i think this movie should be shown in all the american history classes in the country  sometimes we forget what our forefathers did for us  this movie got me very interested in this era so i read up on it a little  i can recommend three books to read that will give more information on dday  the books are dday june 6th 1944 citizen soldiers by stephen e ambrose and the glory and the dream by william manchester i highly recomend this movie thank you robert neeley,reality
this is by far the greatest movie i have ever seen better than citizen kane better than gone with the wind and definitely better than titanic i couldnt stop thinking about this movie after i saw it the dday sequence alone is worth the admission your mouth will be wide open the entire 24 minutes  the ending battle was also very good and intense there images from this movie that i will never forget like a scene where a soldier gets shot in the helmet but it does not punch through the metal and he takes it off to investigate and get his head blown off or when a soldier runs with a lit sticky bomb at a tank only to have it explode in his hand and blow him to bits there are some funny parts but most of the film is serious this is the best film of spielbergs and hanks career this is going to get more oscars than titanic you will never forget this amazing film and hopefully it will teach people that war is hell,reality
no film in 1998 was more hyped by critics than this film the first 30 minutes of does not disappoint the editing sound and camera work are so energized combined with graphic violence that the sense of being in battle is more real than any film i have seen also spielberg is the first director to use the grotesque violence of the coen brothers and tarantino  in a war movie where it actually feels more natural all of this makes for some very thrilling moments but while saving p is a technical tour de force its script is not of the high standard as the rest of the filmthe main story lets find our guy is routine for a war film so the development of the characters is very important to make the movie work in this regard for the most part was mediocre i did not feel connected to most of these characters there was too little dialogue for them to be real many war movies deal with the squad under pressure eight iron men 1952 comes to mind as doing a better job of showing how people cope with thissaving p also presents us with the horrors of war the best movie to confront this subject is apocalypse now saving p by contrast to apocalypse now seems to have its morality upside down the most interesting character in the film the interpreter learns that the best thing to do with prisoners is to shoot them there is no adequate comment on this brutality in the moviethe effectiveness of a final scene is essential for a high quality film and the one in saving p falls apart the emotion shown by the actors works but the dialogue makes little sense as the final message of the movie because the film almost ignores the big picture about why we fought world war 2 it tries to make some sense of the loss of so many lives on an individual level by private himself this cannot be done the justification of war if any is a cause for the greater good ie ending slavery or stopping the nazis there is no other way to make sense of war and spielberg should have used these issuesgot what it deserved at the oscars the award for best direction editing and some technical awards it is very well made but has a script with too many flaws,reality
coming out of one detail was surprisingly clear this is not as gruesome or violent a movie as most make it out to be  the violence occuring onscreen is realistic but never is it gutwrenchingly unbearable  for example many images of soldiers being shot in the middle of their forehead look completely convincing but at the same time are not disturbing  i suspect this is due to the fact that the violence itself is not gratuitous or dwelled upon for long periods of time  in schindlers list there is a scene were an old man is taken out of a line and has a gun pointed to his head by a german soldier while the viewer gets a closeup of this cruelty  a couple of seconds pass where we just await the man to be shot dead  and it is in these few passive seconds where the viewer is viscerally shaken because he or she has the preoccuring knowledge that the man is about to be killed  whereas in every soldier is either shot down quickly or the act of violence is not as closeup in the viewers objectivity  the violence is not there to be just flatout disgusting but to reflect upon its effect on the characters and the films ideals  although is this the films virtue or disadvantage  anyway the hype is undeserved  never do you see a soldiers head blown away from his torso or the like  if you can handle awardwinning pyrotechnics then you can sit through this film with that being said perhaps something more important should  just is not the best war film ever made or even steven spielbergs best directing effort  it is bogged down by a number of cliches it begins to rain right when our protagonists approach danger one soldier accidentely reveals the enemy simply by sitting down the band of soldiers is comprised of the usual widerange of character types etc  it lacks the thorough plot and execution of theme that spielberg accomplished so easily and satisfactorily in his own schindlers list  the tears and awe of the experience people had when they left the theater after that film was not there so much this time  maybe thats the exact point the film is trying to get across though  perhaps its purpose and only idea achieved is to simply show that war is hell and what it is really liketo settle the look of the war film once and for all  if this was the movies objective then it does so in flying colors  but thats about all  the spiritual aspect is missing and this is why the film could have been better  schindlers list told the horrors of the holocaust but left the viewer with lasting images and lessons on basic humankindthe kind of secondary impression lacks,reality
i must say that when came to the cinemas i wasnt compelled to go see it i usually avoid films that have hoards of lemmings camping out to see it read sw episode one pvt had been on the video shelves for a few weeks before i picked it up i wasnt really looking forward to yaawf yet another american war filmthis film is absolutely brilliant filmmaking if speilberg had not made et and indiana jones he would not have had the creative control to make a masterpiece like this he reminds me of hitchcock at the height of his powers in the late 50s early 60sthis film is riveting from beginning to end every scene every shot every sound has meaning and is seamlessly integrated with the overall artistic vision of the film i have a degree in film criticism and have seen a lot of film you quickly become jaded by formula after formulaspeilberg has created a fresh approach to what could be considered a tired genre the handheld chaotic filming of the omaha beach landing along with the sizzling soundscape make this sequence one of the best in cinema history the point however is not to bombard the viewer with gory war scenes for shock purposes it is a setup for the rest of the film you are never at ease at any time for the rest of the movie they payoff for this setup is the sequence towards the end of the film in the battle to hold the bridgeone beautifully crafted sequence of many is setup in the opening sequence crossfade from the old mans blue eyes to tom hanks shaking hand at the omaha landing that crossfade is a film convention that speilberg subverts for dramatic effect when you see the final crossfade from pvts face to the old mans face beautifully done it comes full circle this subversion of a typical film convention is what makes tom hanks final scene so incredibly moving youll know what i mean when youve seen itspeilberg has gone beyond technical mastery of film he has become a consumate artist using his film making skills with intelligence sensitivity and confidence,reality
true the prerelease publicity this movie does not glamorize war nor does it pull any punches  for anyone who has never been to war this is a perfect example of what it is really like  for those of us who have been there its like going back therehollywood has done veterans a great disservice by trying to make war look glorious and something to be desired  but as private shows war often provides individuals and groups the opportunity to rise to their finest moments while at the same time showing their darkest sideswar is not something to be sought after and spielberg shows that lesson with great clarity  my hearfelt thanks to all the people that participated in the production of this great movie  i hope that it goes down in history as a great classic,reality
the film starts off with  to me with one of the most well directed scenes in the film the invasion of normandy or d day its something that you cant explain but you have to see  as sat watching the first 25 minutes of the movie   if seeing this film have great surround sound room no interruptions i never was so impacted by a film  steven speilberg is a living legend he won my total respect with this film  the film is situated around 8 men trying to find private  the reason why is because his 3 other brothers who went to the war all died in battle  so he gets to go home free  im never watching the academy awards after who i heard won best picture i give this film a,reality
my god i just saw this movie and im still shaking it shows wwii like it seemed to be i wasnt there at the time ive read all the reviews about it and one thing sprung to mindwhen soldier upham has the germans under fire he shouts a few things in german and their captain calls out uphams name do they know each other still true horror and all credits to mr spielberg mr hanks and giovanni ribisia true  out of ,reality
as a history major brought up in normandy i loved this movie  it seemed real to me every single minute of it so close to the stories i heard in my childhood  i knew what happened during the dday landing i know all the sites and museums connected to it  this movie made me realize something else the horror that these guys had to go through to make my country free  this isnt about war theories but about men who werent soldiers before wwii,reality
i spent 26 years in the military participating in more than one altercation with the other guys and i never saw action more realistic than this beyond being an almost perfect war movie spielberg has made the perfect antiwar movie,reality
i have no complaints of this movie none at all  as im sure you know the film is about a group of soldiers on a search for private james a man whose three brothers have been killed  the government wants them to save him because the mother will have lost all her sons if he dies  theres not really much else i can say about the plot because the movie doesnt really have one  its whole purpose is to show what world war ii soldiers went through while throwing in a plot to keep the movie interesting the war scenes are done very well especially in the beginning and the end they do a perfect job of showing the confusion and tragedy of war  the directing is very good and steven spielberg definitely earned his oscar for best director  i have no idea how they made it look so real and they managed to convey a real war atmosphere one thing i noticed about this movie that only a few great movies have is the continuity and importance of each scene  no scene seemed unimportant and each one i watched with full attention  there are never any unnecessary breaks and the movie as a whole has great continuity tom hanks has always been one of my least favorite actors because it seems like he plays the same character in all of his movies  but in he did a great job and i saw no resemblance to any other of his characters  one thing i also admired about him in this movie is that he never took attention away from any of the other actors  everybody seemed equally important overall this movie was superb  you should see it its practically your duty to  i felt bad because i never took memorial day or veterans day too seriously but now i know i will  the least we can do is respect the soldiers who died for us and our country,reality
its true the first 45 minutes is the best part of the movie  the movie loses some of its realism later starting with that ridiculously accurate shot by the american sniper to the german sniper  then during the last battle scene the germans look like they are trying to get killed  they dont hide behind stuff but instead just run at the americans  and tom hanks should play professional football with that incredibly accurate arm every one of those mortar shells he threw killed somebodyas for the demonization of germans in the movie i didnt see it  many critics point out that steamboat willy toot toot guy was an ungrateful bd and he was the only attempted german character development  the thing is i didnt see him as evil and i dont think i was supposed to he begged for his life which is normal of anyone who thinks he is going to be killed and he was released  so he ran into a german unit instead of an american one  they gave him a new rifle and sent him back to the front that doesnt make him evilsome foreign critics have criticized that there was no representation of the british and canadians  if this was a documentary i would wholeheartedly agree with this  however this is a story of a group of american soldiers moving from one american occupied area to another  why would this group run into british and canadians who were further eastas for the critics that say this movie does too much flag waving i both agree and disagree  i did not see any real american patriotism being forced upon the viewer until that uncalled for flag scene and the very end of the moviestill a good movie that will stick in your head for a while,reality
this is one of the best movies i have ever seen  i never ever want to see it again and feel the way i did after watching it though  i have never seen combat but to me this seemed more realistic and scary than any other war movie i have ever seen  the movie is scary sad brilliant and depressing  watch it once and it will change the way you think  life is precious  dont take your life or anyone elses life for granted,reality
i liked the movie off the bat but after a while i started to think when are they going to find this guy  there was a few funny parts but they sort of took away from the seriousness war movies of this type should have  they wanted to make a movie with a cross of comedy man vs manand man vs himself  the movie was a bit disappointing for a spielberg film  i was expecting more of a drama like shindlers list i hope the next  war movie to come out will be one or another not a combination of a few aspects of the movies,reality
is one of this years best films tom hanks delivers an oscarcaliber performance as captain miller what i like most about this film is that it shows what war and violence are actually like for this reason alone this is a film that should be seen by all while the story is not the films strongest point it still is very good i have heard many critics say that the rest of the characters were all cliche however i did not see that jeremy davies gives a performance that should win him an oscar as an interpreter who is going into combat for the first time and the rest of the cast are superb my only problem with the picture were its present day scenes i found them unnecessary,reality
the first 20 minutes was great  too much blood the next 1 12 hours was definitely above average the last 30 minutes or so was too long of a battle sceneoverall the film was a 9 ps too much blood blood belongs unless you 1 are doing a vampire movie 2 trying to only win an academy award,reality
what can i say the 25 or so minutes starting with the boats coming upon the shore of omaha beach are 25 minutes that i will never forget the carnage and desensitization of tom hanks is breathtakingi tend to agree that the plot is very thin on this film but its main redeeming value is how the traumatic events that occur in this film shape each character although everyone does an astounding job as far as the cast goes giovanni ribisi embodies the wwii soldier the best his portrayal as the medic is splendid his performance makes his character seem as if he is the only one of the 8 soldiers with a shred of humanity left telling the others to cover up the dog tags as a mass of soldiers march by staring at the dog tags laid out across the table his demise is all too real it makes the viewer cringe because you feel for this character but you know there is nothing you can do to fend off the inevitablebesides the very well choreographed battle scenes and the explosive acting job everyone does this film leaves alot to be desired if the opening 25 minutes fail to quench your thirst of seeing humanity at its worst then full metal jacket surely will definitely not the best war movie of all time although very close if full metal jacket had such brutally honest scenes of violence such as when it came to the battle scenes instead of its glorified hollywood violence it would reign supreme as the best example of war on film to datemy final thoughts watch this movie if you want to be slapped in the face with the horror and tragedy american soldiers endured during wwii but dont expect to be awestruck by the plot the only downfall is that did not portray that the war was equally as brutal for both sides  with the exception of the scene where captain millers group makes the lone german soldier dig graves for their fallen comrades was i the only one who didnt laugh at his lastditched efforts to appease the americans and make them spare his life the final complaint would be that spielberg did not tug at the strings of the viewers heart when the lead characters died  with the exception of ribisis character  whereas several scenes in glory brought tears to my eyes,reality
im not a veteran im not even male but i saw this picture and enjoyed it for one reason only because we shouldnt forget what it means to fight whatever the war whatever the cause i couldnt give a hoot about the plotline the acting whether or not there were typical war movie cliches i wasnt watching it to compare it with schindlers list or even et for that matter i watched it with my two oldest children so that when i die and they inherit their grandfathers funeral flags theyll know what those flags stand for all the comments about comparing this movie to the thin red line are silly a war movie is to help those of us who werent there understand those of us who were yes war is hell wwii was hell korea was hell vietnam was hell the gulf war was hell if there were still any soldiers from wwi theyd say the same movies like this are for the rest of us to remember why our people were sent in the first place for this reason this movie is required viewing if you wonder why your grandfather doesnt talk much or easily about the time he served in wwii this movie will explain it all nuff said,reality
steven spielbergs second great wwii epic the beginning battle at normandy to the last great words it showed war as it is opening minds to the real horrors of what their grandparents and parents lived and still live the realism was eerie you knew the men on the screen the bullets were flying at you it was your family receiving the dreaded letter it wasnt your every day film it brought you to tears it showed not only war but human goodness eight men men with lives and families risk their lives to save the last of four brothers they didnt know him he wasnt important to them they did it for him and themselves the stories told by private james made him somebody to the soldiers so that they fought for him after their duty of finding him was done told by the greatest teller of our timethe true feeling of the movie is belief in people would i have done this would i have stayed for the final battle someone would someone did many they died for you years before you were born most likely all you can do is hope that you did earn it,reality
i had to drive 30 miles to see this movie because my theater has taken the stance that they will not show it this movie shows war in realistic horror this is a movie that makes you think and wonder how anyone who lived through this could still be sane after watching this i have an even greater respect for the people who risked so much to protect us i wish my towns idea of family values didnt mean keeping us ignorant to the atrosities of mankind just because of realistic violence unlike any number of mindnumbing movies that my local theater gladly shows this movie and schindlers list which also wasnt shown here opens your mind and makes you think,reality
i saw this film the night it opened last summer i sat in awe for the entire film it was amazing so when harrison ford read shakespeare in love off the best picture envelope i was in shock i had seen both and i feel that spr is so superior in every way shakespeare is a comedy with no real message or any quality that makes it eligible i watched the film again when it arrived on video and it affected me even more on video i broke down during the end the first 5 minutes of this film are some of the most powerful you will ever see i doubt i will ever forget seeing a soldier searching for his arm on the ground or a another a intestine laying on the ground beside him screaming mommy when he bled to death these are the most amazing scenes ever shot even the longest days epic scale battles do not hold the same power this film portrayed ww2 amazingly well it was the first to really show the hell of it the early films somewhat glorified it this was the first to handle ww2 in a long time seeing it again i realize it is easily the greatest film i have ever seen the opening moments and the final battle will go down as some of the greatest battles ever filmed as well as the most realistic the academy was wrong in choosing shakespeare in love this film blew all the others away i did see the thin red line which i consider to be the worst film ever made it is horrific even its battle scenes dont affect as the characters are so dispicabule private is amazing and will be remebered as the most powerful film of the last 40s years a triumph of film making,reality
this movie amazed me like none other not even hardboiled or the killer amazed me or shocked me beyond all recognition like spr did warning this movie is extremely violent human entrailsgangrene rotting fleshbloodcloseups of bullets shooting through victims the reason i didnt mention this in hardboiled is because this is more realistic and intense this actually happened and that is why i think it is only rated 14a in canada this movie was so realistic i am beginning to love war movies now because of this ranks up with hardboiled and the killer rent this one at all costs remember though graphic violence,reality
how many people have to die so that one will survive a very important questionhow many people have to die for a just cause that what war is all about since the history of human kind there have always been warsexcept that not always they have been so expressfull as this one soopen so real hollywood has a record to make good war movies but not all of them show you the real face of the war this time we all have something to watch and learnfrom steven spielberg he did his homework and he did it very well proves just that tom hanks plays great in the movie he used to be a teacher but now he is a captain and he certainly deserves his rank if by any chance you didnt see this movie yet you have no idea what you are missing rent it buy ittotally regardless which one you choose cause you dont loose if you have a surround soundyou will feel every explosion every shot every screamand you will definitely not stop until you have seen it alli highly recommend this moviein fact you can go strait out and buy itadd it to your collectionit will be one of your favorites,reality
the other war movies ive seen are full metal jacket and glory is a good movie better than full metal jacket and glory is very well acted tom hanks was great as captain john millerhas a very good story to it im looking forward to seeing other war movies that i havent seen yet i give  out of ,reality
the movie  was interesting and profoundly impacted all those in the theatre who saw itsome will use this as an excuse of why not to go to war without realizing that what we went to war for or to prevent  was far worseit was interesting that after the credits started to roll and people were exiting there was no chattering  most people were silent and apparently contemplativeas someone said war is hell but we dont go to war for its namby pambynesswe go to war for reasons that are not dealt with in this film except in a very cursory manner see for example the scene of the soldier showing the star of david and saying judem  over and over to the powshopefully we will not have to use this film in another warno one in his or her right mind wants one  it is however necessary to realize that ideals are worth fighting and dying for and this film dealt only with the dying part of the equation touching very little on the ideals that these men were fighting forstill in all a very good film,reality
i honestly dont know where to begin in praising this film but i will say that this is without a doubt the strongest and greatest film of the 1990s it is also my fifth favorite film of all time has to be steven spielbergs greatest film i even think its better than the very highly acclaimed schindlers listspielberg has above all achieved the next to impossible to create a film so realistic that it will make the veiwer feel like they were part of the film the brutality of warfare presented in spr was so realistic that it made me cry and i never ever cry at moviesi could go on and on about how great this film is but i believe that it is to great to be completely explained in just a few words i strongly suggest that everyone see spr because if you dont see it you will be missing a truly profoundly realistic experience,reality
this movie gave me an understanding of what war is really like unlike other hollywood war movies this movie provided in unflinching detail the horrors of war in a very intimate way only one other movie had similar impact on me and that was platoonit seems to be the consensus among many if not all spr viewers that the first 30 minutes is the greatest battle scene ever created on filmi have to agree the utter confusion and slaughter of war were so realistically portrayed that i was on the edge of my seat unaware of what horror was going to appear next the movie as a whole created that feeling in methe feeling of unease and tension of not knowing just what was going to happen next the kind of feeling the soldiers mustve felt at the time although in much much greater magnitudesimilarly the last battle scene was harrowing and exciting i thought it showed the utter confusion and violence of urban combat in graphic realism the execution of some of the stunts and fight scenes were incredibly wellchoreographedall in all spr was the best war movie ive ever seen,reality
this film is amazing actually it isnt even a film it is an experience by no means am i saying it is being there as it is in the lightest sense of the word this film about the search for a soldier whose brothers have died and he has a ticket home contains the most brutal and accurate battles you have ever seen you will walk away from this film tired you will stagger out of the place i rarely cry during a film however the finaland first scene had me sobbing the final scenes hit hard and show you how powerful freedom is and how horrible war is and especially how brave the men and women of the armed forces are to risk their lives for people they dont know this film is about honor it makes you appreciate our presence in ww2 and how much we have earn it,reality
this is not only the best film of mr spielbergs career but one of the decades best it takes a lot for a movie to make me even shed a tear and this film did the performances are terrific all around this is one time that i wished tom hanks wouldve won he has a wonderful scene were he reminds his squad that hes not a hero but an ordinary man who wonders if the war is changing him at all that element alone makes this film the remarkable achievement that it is,reality
once again spielberg has provided us with some astouding visuals and rather nice cinematographybut once again he has left us with a empty film it is not only plainly acted but poorly written and it is a very very old point being pushed on us i mean by now everyone knows war is a bad place to be yet spielberg still heavily continues on about itso i found it to be goodbut not greatbut weve still got terrence mallicks world war 2 flick to go so heres hoping,reality
a depiction of war seldom seen on film  great fx and audio mixediting  i especially liked the scent where the sniper shoots the sniper  lots of great models toospielberg will direct better as in the past,reality
many people have talked about this movie in terms of the realistic violence and action throughout the movie this certainly helps to drag people into the movie but was not the most stunning thing i saw in this movie some people have highlighted the simple but effective plot as a means to prove that it was not worthy of the title of best war movie of all time my view was the movie was not really created to have detail plots to confuse people and make them think rather the movie was about how pictures and images of war can say much much more than words can ever do we not only get scenes of realistic action but fundamentally the characterisation of corporal upham is one of the best achievements in any war movie whereas the other characters we have seen before in other similar war movies upham was so unique in war movies of any sort that he blew me away should have focused more upon uphams character because it was far more interesting and realistic than all the other characters put together this movie was a character study rather than plot tangles upham should not even be in the war he is not only innocent but is the moral person in the movie who affects the decisions and lives of the other soldiers around him throughout the movie we see his character slowly change and develop to the final scenes that is so full of emotionally realism that he beats other war movie characters scenes to watch out for are 1 when he is left behind and watches his new friends take out a guarded post 2 when he sits on the steps  absolutely incredible 3 when he tries to save a german persons life 4 and the final horrific emotionally scene of realism and so many besidesthe only offputting thing about the movie is the propaganda concerning giving the impression that america is the best country in the world and saves us from losing the war when in fact they were just additional help who did not join until britain was in too much debt to the usa,reality
i will attempt to differentiate my feelings about this film  technically and theatrically this film is a masterpiece  the visual effects and realistic atmosphere that are brought to the screen are breathtaking in one way or another and are unparallel by any other  each performance made you feel like you were that characters friend or family member and made you feel emotion for them  is a prime example of what movie making should be  technicallyemotionally and personally i have to admit that i can never watch this film again  the emotions of grief fear sadness horror and despair that i felt from watching it made me literally sick  although it was a masterpiece in the way the story was told the story itself was disgusting  being a veteran of two much less violent wars i could only sit there and think of how i would have felt if i were therei went to sleep that evening after watching it was the most difficult night i have had in a while  i believe that this film should have carried an nc17 rating because if i was spielberg im not sure if i could live with a 16 year old kid even with his parents seeing the events that unfolded on that screenallinall is a theatrical masterpiece  but if youre going to watch it be prepared for having your heart ripped out,reality
this film i wont be so brash as to call it a movie confirms my belief that steven spielberg is one of if not the most talented people of the century yes this sounds like buttkissing but it isnt my grandfather died in wwii as did millions of your grandfathers fathers and brothers until i saw spr i like many others had tucked the mere thought of war into a drawer in my mind titled ignore and it might go away i am very much ashamed to admit i was one of those who complained that veterans should forget it and get on with their lives  now though i can honestly say that this film has changed my life whats more anybody who denies that it changed theirs is either lying or devoid of humanityobviously as anybody who has seen the film will know the first twenty minutes at omaha beach are overwhelmingly shocking heartbreaking and soul numbing i sat in my seat emotionally paralysed and totally disbelieving i put my popcorn on the floor and couldnt bring myself to touch it again i know people say the plot was often thin and the film slow moving but surely they realise this is far more true to life than non stop action there were weeks on end where soldiers did nothing but wait in the trenches where the build up to the finale was far more nerve racking than the action itself because you knew something had to happen you just didnt know when the film reflects this therefore it is far more true to life than all the war is hell films such as full metal jacket and platoonto those who remain unconvinced may i remind them a helpline was set up to comfort those who couldnt handle the journey back to the war i work at a cinema i have seen the effects of this film i spent over an hour once comforting a seventyfive year old man who came out of the film weeping like a child and couldnt bring himself to walk away from the buildingwar is hell and to those who fought and their equally brave families we should offer nothing but our sincerest thanks,reality
i have read many of the reviews for this movie as well as listened to my friends at work review this one  first off id like to say that all of you who complained about how this movie dragged in the middle have never been a soldier  five hours of boredom are suddenly followed by 5 minutes of unrelenting terror  that is precisely what this movie conveyedmr spielberg has done a masterful job putting you into this infantry unit the combat scenes are grittily realistic and not the least bit overly graphic  got news for you folks thats wareverything is realistic and accurate dale dye deserves a major bit of recognition for this  tom hanks and his bunch looked like an group who had seen their fair share of battle  mr dye worked his magic to the same level on platoonif you truly want to see an accurate depiction of what real war is like this is the only film to see  five stars out of five,reality
my wife our thirteen year old daughter and i saw this movie together im not sure this movie is for everyone but everyone should see it once why the hell didnt this movie receive best picture the opening sequence of landing on omaha beach is unlike anything ive ever seen yes there is titanic the star wars series and then there is it actually changed me as a person in a positive way something no movie had ever done,reality
i know it is not original but this is beyond a shadow a doubt the greatest war movie of all time  this is how the veterans want it to look in this age of sensationalizing of violence this movie sent a wakeup call to all of us about what violence really is  and through this movie speilberg continues his legacy and preserves their legacy for future generationscant wait till it comes out on dvd,reality
hilarity slapstick you name it  it has got it all  no but seriously this is a good film i have never been so locked into a movie  the battle scenes are the most intense and realistic i have seen not as funny as platoon though,reality
only steven spielberg could paint such a horrific vision of war the opening 15 minutes has to be one the best 15 minutes ever dedicated to film  its shocking moving and disturbing all at the same time  great performances all around especially to hanks  unfortunately spr didnt win best picture or best actor at the academy awards which it so rightfully deserved  at least it got best director best sound best film editing etc  kudos to spielberg kaminski hanks etc,reality
i had the feeling that spielberg made this movie at the request of veterans who told him that no movie thus far had shown what the war was really like,reality
i just saw shortly after seeing the thin red line and i can say that mallicks film is definitely superior to spielbergs  yes the combat scenes in spr were very powerful and realistic but i felt disappointed by the movie as a whole  the scenes where characters would just trade anecdotes of their lives in the states seemed tacked on and was a hamfisted way of showing that the soldiers were just regular boys who wanted to get home and of course there was the final shot of the american flag fading to credits which clinched this film as being a fairly standard issue hollywood war movie  the beach landing scene was gut wrenching but after the movie was over i really didnt think about it for too long unlike the thin red line which i think delves much further into the emotional aspects of what war is and leaves questions which need to be explored through multiple viewings of the film  is a movie you should see but once is enough,reality
no doubt about it this is the most intense films ive ever seen unlike any other war film made this film takes the view from one end of the emotional spectrums to the other and leaves the viewer with a sobering view of what our brave fighting men had to endure  giving the viewer a sense of awe disgust horror and total confusion  this is spielberg at his best,reality
as i watched i became so deeply aware of the the incredible sacrifices fighting men of all sides gave obviously  speaking from the point of view of residents in the uk i will always remember the fact that the fighting men from the allied side gave the ulitmate that a person could give to ensure that the way of life that we all enjoy possibly take for granted even  was preserved for that was truly what was at stake back on the beaches of normandy in 1944we all should see and remember this factwithout that sacrifice the world would be much different today,reality
i find it hard to compare war movie of different wars all quiet on the western front full metal jacket and platoon are some of my favorites glory an braveheart are also extremely good saying this is the best war movie ever is tough apocalypse now fmj and platoon are all great movies but dont have as great a plot or anything approaching the cinematography of this movie the cinematography of the opening battle scene is by far the greatest 15 minutes in the history of film technique it has to be experienced on a theater screen and up close to get the full feeling of the sheer insanity that takes place in the midst of a battle the story that follows the super impressive opening is no less genius its a great dr strangelove feel of conflicting morals interests and sanity tom hankstom sizemore do wonderful acting jobs and im not quite sure who plays the sniper but he steals the movie from everyone great writing and attention to detail including actual panzer tank sounds rack up more points for this movie the violence much like any real war has quite a humbling effect and the backdrop of dday often called the greatest battle in history provides the perfect opportunity to show how horrible death really is actual veterans went into siezers flashbacks and emotional trauma when viewing this movie a help line was even set up to help them cope with the visions that really says a lot about a film,reality
i truly enjoyed this movie  it was very graphic but somehow i think we need to see this  it was made up of real people not just action heroes who save the day  i think steven spielberg did an awesome job and i would love to see more films done in this honest forthright manner  thank you mr spielberg for opening up our eyes to see that war is not glamorous,reality
spielberg does to kurosawa and welles what mark mcgwire did to roger marris in the magnificently staged battle scenes that bookend this dday melodrama his beachstorming opening pushes the howmuchcanyoustand envelope about twenty feet farther than even the most daring moments in schindlers list he seems to have an unerring sixth sense for the audiences breaking point and the climaxa catandmouse game between the spottily armed american platoon and a series of tankbound germanssuggests a set piece from the great escape with nineties technology and spielbergian horse senseit was spielbergs derringdo that made this movie a monster hitnot the star presence of tom hanks as the saver and matt damon as the saved and it certainly wasnt the script which affords spielberg a few opportunities for nicely offhand veriteish livedin scenes but consists mostly of tom hanks staring at a distant cloud and delivering the most sentimental unsentimental bromides in a war movie ever hanks is supposed to be a scruffier more cynical and wisedup version of the henry fonda good american his monologues of common simple decency have the numbing monotony of a centrist democrat senator dedicating a new high school hanks morphing into a latterday jimmy stewart is dismal enough the speechifying by members of his platoon especially the unendurable ed burns commemorating his girlbackhomes mammoth breasts take the movie to flatline status the script was uncreditedly rewritten by frank darabont of the poormansspielberg shawshank redemption,reality
it is normal to believe that once a director makes a film like schindlers list he will struggle for the rest of his career trying to live up to it not steven speilberg i cannot describe with words the power of all i can say is that its overall execution is simply perfect  the depiction of the dday invasion is more than worth the price of admission and should receive special recognition as the greatest scene ever filmed  it is completely horrifying as it should be editing cinematography and sound have been given a new standard with this terrifying sequence  that scene along with the rest of the movie is ultimately a tribute to its director  in speilbergs hands the level of drama reaches unchartered territory  be patient im only getting startedthe screenplay totally delivers  robert rodats characterizations are subtle yet powerful and when someone dies your sorrow lingers because you feel you have truly known them for that brief period of time  this is a tribute to the actors as wellunfortunately fifty years from now tom hanks will probably be remembered as the guy who played forrest gump he shouldnt be  for me hanks will always be captain john miller  a decent man with a knack for leadership a man who truly loves each boy he leads into battle a man who is quietly more terrified than any of those boys  the genius in hanks performance lies not in his portrayal of an army captain but in the way he makes us believe that john miller truly is a captain a word of advice to the academy dont be political  there is nothing wrong with someone winning three oscars in six years  not if heshe deserves it as hanks doesthe supporting cast is also phenomenal  matt damon brings integrity and honor to the role of private james  you feel that millers squad has made the right decision in doing their best to find him barry pepper is terrific as private jackson the religious sniper from tennessee  edward burns hits the bullseye as private reiben the cynical chatterbox from brooklyn  the most solid supporting performance however is given by one of hollywoods most underrated actors  tom sizemore  his portrayal of the loyal sergeant horvath is amazing and at its core truly heartfelt  i pray he gets at least a nomination if not a little golden boy of his own next marchnext march is a fitting topic to conclude on  be prepared to hear steven speilberg tom hanks etc quite frequently at the 71st annual academy awards  with this stunning epic those phrases deserve to be all over the little white envelopes as they are torn open next year,reality
watching the oscars it honestly never occurred to me that spr would not win best picture i had seen all of the other movies including shakespeare in love and life is beautiful and while both were good movies shakespeare in love being in my opinion the weakest of the big three i could not comprehend how either one could honestly compete with spr was not a movie as much as it was an experience the first scene the landing on omaha beach evoked an emotional response i have never felt during a movie before i felt as if i were there as if bullets were wizzing past my head and bombs were ripping my closest friends to pieces around me when the opening scene was over i almost felt as if i were going to throw up and i was happy the experience was over was by far the best movie of 1998 and the academy showed once again that the quality of the movie counts much less than the ad campaign one puts on to win the big trophy not only did the academy rob spielberg and all who were involved in the making of the production it robbed the veterans of the war by giving the oscar to a cute little film that quite honestly would have made good ol william gag the academy turned their back on the veterans as a whole now did anyone who suffered through the horrors of that war lose sleep because of the award ceremony not likely but the academy ruined their chance to honor those who died giving us all the right to live free as we choose it passed up its chace to say thank you to all that served by honoring the best movie ever made about the terrors our men endured over there so the only thing left to say is shame on you academy for rewarding a vigilant ad campaign as opposed to a master piece of modern times best picture of 1998 trophy or not,reality
to say that is a war film would be like calling a corvette a wagon  war films tend to glorify war and show the other side as being supermeanbadguys new word  but can be more accurately described as a war drama  in it the war is anything but glorified  the scale of the war is shown on both a massive size the normandy invasion and on a more personal level  the germans seem bad but theyre just doing what we would do under the circumstances  however even with this in mind the audience cant help but hate them  this is the most dynamic part of the film and is enough to make us forget the appallingly deflated characters in speilbergs schindlers list  and of course theres the acting with hanks at his best and the rest of the cast tom sizemore and jeremey davies in particular shines as well  overall a great film  and an utter travesty that it lost the best picture oscar to the massively inferior shakespeare in love,reality

this film is an exceptionally well done war movie  it is perhaps the greatest of all time although in my mind it is waging its own war with apocalypse now for that prestigious title  it pulls no punches in its representation of the horrors of war  i am certain that most movie aficionados have heard the stories of veteran flashbacks and emotional breakdowns caused by the film  it is certainly the best portrayal of war in this decade  it has even bested bravehearts violence a feat thought impossible three years ago  the scene in which private mellish is killed by the german soldier chills me to this day  it is indeed a fantastic war movie  as a movie in general it is not quite as great  it still is a wonderful tale with moving emotional content but i feel certain it was not robbed at the academy awards  the characters seemed quite onedimensional to me and the plot left something to be desired  in the end this film did not approach the quality of tom hanks two oscar winning performances and to risk missing the forest for the trees i must say that the opening scenes of the storming of the beaches at normandy almost made me feel sick  this was not from the excessive gore and that fact does trouble me somewhat but instead from the camera work  i understand that in this age of er popularity the messy camera look has become incredibly popular  in spite of this i think the excessive motion of the camera during this scene detracted from the film  i found it difficult to concentrate throughout personally i thought the camera work during the battles in braveheart were much more effective in conveying the mood of a battlefield,reality
this movie was by far the most overhyped movie of the year it was out in theatres six months before i went and saw it and for the most part i was unimpressed it was just two very detailed battle sequences with a mediocre story sandwiched in between mind you those sequences were breathtaking and disturbing but the thin red line had more of a lasting effect on me than this this movie was far too long two hours would have sufficed it was overly patriotic with a mcgyver ending slapped on at the end,reality
they shoot a lot in this movie and it looks great all the action scenes are magnificent especially the ones on the beach tom hanks sees that life isnt like a box of chocolates luckily for this 3 hour movie 25 hours is action because the storyline isnt much spielberg the part that plays in our own time cut this out of the movie with a good story this movie would be a real number 1,reality
quite possibly the best story about war ever filmed a blunt portrayal of wars reality and its physical and emotional affects on a group of us infantrymen during and after the wwii dday invasion of occupied france highest recommendation see it particularly if you have a 17yr old in love with the romance of war this is not one for the faint of hearta very well acted film with a particularly outstanding performance by tom hanks,reality
spielberg was shunned by the oscar nominations last year in large part due to the controversy over who deserved the writing credit for amistad then of course theres the whole whitedirectorblackstory issue for which hes been paying ever since the color purplebut dont get me started on that  it may have been the best possible move for him to work with tom he can do no wrong hanks this time out  this is definitely a fivehankie picture i wept continuously for the first twenty minutes and was on the brink of tears for almost the entire remainder of its threehoursplus running time  spielberg has an uncanny ability to confront us on film with things that require our social and individual attentionconsider the color purple empire of the sun schindlers list amistad and now  that these films were made by the same man who directed jaws et and the indiana jones movies is astonishing  no other filmmaker working today produces this variety of films from those intended to prod and provoke thoughtful adults to those that speak so clearly to our children and to the child in each of us is a devastating depiction of and meditation on the costs of war a heartbreaking but ultimately affirming examination of individual human worth  tom hanks is everyman with whom we can all identify and matt damon is the titular private a beaming scrubfaced brighteyed beautiful boy whom we all want to save  what is one mans life worth  what are the consequences of inhumanity  what is the value of integrity  this film shows us that society cannot answer these questions the answers lie inside and must come from within,reality
after reading most reviews youll be ready for the first 25 minutes then it settles in to a routine war movie for a good halftime watch out for the last battle sequences theyre as intense as the beginning the handheld camera used in the fire fights makes the film throw in spielbergs knack for hitting the right emotional buttons and  voila acadamy nomination      i hope it wins best picture if for no other reason than to show the unenlightened hawks and gungho militarists what war really is we had to fight that war we will have to fight others            make it the last alternative,reality
lets forget for a second about camera angles and who used them before and what not  lets give spielberg his due without overdoing it  lets talk about the movie  i challenge anyone to admit honestly  that they were not shaken up and moved by the sequences in spr  if you werent youre either dead or jeffrey dahmer  forget the cinematography and the battle scenes the cast assembled did a brilliant job specifically giovani ribisis performance  which was underrated  and ed burns who i felt should of gotten a nod for a best supporting actor award  hanks was solid and made his character worknow to address my friends the brits who are seemingly angry at the depiction of americas role in the war and how spr glorified americans and americans only  american movie american directordo you see where this is going  let someone else make a movie depicting the other perspectives spr told the story about american soldiers looking to locate a private and bring him home  it also did something elseit paid homage to the brave american soldiers that endured that nightmare that was dday  being a veteran myself who never saw combat thank god i collapsed in my chair and cried knowing people that lost their lives in the gulf war  lets not remember private for who it didnt pay respect to because i think that most of us are intelligent enough to know that there were other nations soldiers fighting and dying but to whom it did pay homage to  the brave soldiers who fought in a strange place and died to preserve the way of life that is right  war is hell and it is wrong  life is too precious  i do agree that congress and the pres should view spr prior to making any decision  but i also know that ww2 is history and the men that died from all nations deserve my respect and my deepest thanks for preserving the lifestyle that is my own  there is a saying that says youre a better man then me  i extend that to every soldier that fought bled and died on the allied side in ww2  and being a former sailor i like the elder private extend a hand salute to themthats what private did  it was  the best war film ever made,reality
this isnt nearly as good as my favorite war moviedas boot but it has some similar elements that are fantastic it isnt one sided nor does it tell you what to think to avoid a spoiler i wont go into detail but the whole subplot with the translator is one of the highlights of the movie one thing is certainthis is a must see movie very preferably on a big screen,reality
this was truly a wonderful film from start to finish  i have never experienced war first hand so i appreciated spielbergs graphic depiction of the taking of normandy beach  the images of wave after wave of soldier being picked off by bullets or shrapnel truly gives meaning to the phrase war is hell  very few directors could do what spielberg did for this first 20 minutes spielberg was able to build on this event and develop a story and a group of characters that the audience could truly identify with special kudos should go to tom hanks whose presence on film easily matches that of jimmy stewart  in this movie hanks embodies every american soldier who put hisher life on the line no matter the reason or the locale  a classic film that will be remembered for years to come,reality
i thought the movie was excellent from start to end finally a war movie that shows it as real as it can be i find it hard to believe being an ex navy corpsman that i could have been possibly involved it that type of situation i too would have been puking in the landing craft before hitting the beach all in all it was one of the best or possibly the best war movie of all time,reality
i knew that this was supposed to be an awesome movie but it hit home to me when i saw my father four sons crying in the car on the way homesteven spielberg has done an incredible job and i hope he keeps it up 25th of april is new zealands equivalent of armistice day and until i saw spr i had no clear idea of what our veterans went through thank you for an eyeopening experience,reality
was two films for me  the opening omaha beach landing sequence of produced the most intense feeling ive ever experienced while watching a movie  spielberg manages to trap history in a bottle and the sights and sounds  especially the sounds  are terrifying  like the car chase in steve mcqueens bullit spielberg sets a marker that will hard to duplicate  after it was over i fully felt deserving of a campaign ribbon to wear on my polo shirthaving thus been promised a peek into history i was overly disappointed with part ii which degenerates into just a good action flic  spielberg junks historical accuracy for post vietnam sensibilities  captain john miller hanks and his squad of rangers are portrayed as post vietnam philosophers who dwell on the unfairness of having to risk their lives for a political necessity  saving the fictional private  in point of fact the loss of the five sullivan brothers when their ship the uss juneau  was sunk in 1942 resulted in changed navy policy about allowing brothers to serve on the same ship  the public wanted but never got a law to that effect  so the idea of would not have struck these 1944 rangers as particularly odd   the movie though portrays gen george c marshall as a callous political hack for recognizing this exigency  while the  world war ii grunt fought for the same reason all grunts fight  honor cowardice at least in 1944 was still viewed as more distasteful than death these guys need fulfillmentother lapses continued to shake me out of my trance  a cameo appearance by ted danson for instance seemed out of place and i found myself thinking about normy and carla on omaha beach  and the preproduction hollywood party when spielberg says say ted if youre not doing anything tomorrow     later this squad of savvy rangers is seen marching in file on the crest of a ridge fully backlit by the moon  hardly something out of the ranger survival guide  the action sequences as always in a spielberg production were terrific but by the end of part 2  i was cynical about spielbergs motives rated 8 out of 10 overall,reality
may very well be the greatest war film in existence the movie opens with the dday invasion at normandy blood flying everywhere pieces of body parts are missing even a guy who sits there and screams while trying to hold his guts in make that first war scene a scene you will never forget not only does this movie have realistic war scenes but also has a very good script and top notch performances by tom hanks and tom seizmore go see this movie unless youre too squeamish to handle the graphic violence  out of  for spr,reality
war is hell  for most of us thats an intellectual truth  weve had no personal contact with the brutality of battle  steven spielberg doesnt let us get away with such detachment  he forces the senseless slaughter and stupidity of war right in our faces  the first 25 minutes of this film is without doubt the goriest 25 minutes of film to date in the midst of carnage we begin to become attached to captain john miller tom hanks and his men  when after surviving the horrors of the first hours they are assigned the perilous task of searching out one soldier behind enemy lines we worry for their safety  and well we should  the mayhem is far from over  this is not a sentimental searchandrescue story  this movie is a philosophical dissertation on warthe do or die mentality of fighting menpersonal couragethe rationalizationspatriotism  its also an excellent piece of film  similar to schindlers list you want to cringe from the knowledge from the reality of what youre seeing on the screen but you are compelled to continue to watch  the acting is excellent awards are sure to follow  this is a significant film which everyone should seeif they have the stomach for it,reality
is a magnificent artistic piece it is a good lesson to all those people who are interested in war especially to the presidents and prime ministers of all those countries making our beautiful earth a violent one wars without any exception  world war internal dispute caste war or anything of that sort can only make people worried about their near and dear watch the bloodshed and firing in this film before filling your gun with explosives,reality
film stilled my voice for hours nato is in yugoslavia we cannot forget the vietnam war and we may never know enough about wwii etched forever in my memory is the scene of james franciss mother her body folding downwards and collapsing on the porch on her knees as she faces the men who bring the words of her three sons deaths  never has grief the enormity of this grief been captured with so much power and been so evocative there is the scene with the french child returning to her family who appear to be living on a shelf that is what is left of the floor of their bombedout building and this precious little girl hitting at her father after her fathers attempts to give her to the soldiers to take to safety this is a film to see over and over and to never ever forget,reality
the effect this movie has on you is devastating  the combat scenes in the movie are where you can find speilberg exploring territory that no other director has before in war movies  spielberg comes as close to capturing the madness of war by showing us the horror in an unrelenting fashion deaths alternate between quick and horrifying and slow and agonizing  its unfortunate that such a pedestrian script was used to connect the awesome combat scenes  but the frustratingly simplistic plotline serves as a way for the characters to question war in a way a postvietnam american would without making such questioning seem historically preposterous as it did in the thin red line whose hero has gone awol just months following pearl harbor  the movie would have been a 10 if not for the bookends private visiting normandy as an old man that were taken from titanic,reality
anyone whos ever doubted speilbergs past works no problem  but his last three historical epics are masterpieces this film concerns a group of soldiers in the normandy invasion who are searching for a missing soldier in which all of his siblings were killed this movie is also filmed in different formats never before seen in other war films this film was nominated for best picture of the year and lost but thats all a matter of opinion anyways this films depiction of graphic warfare is not for everyone and is not for children or the squeamish all the acting is top notch mpaa rating r graphic combat violence and profanity,reality
its tragic that the academy did not vote the best movie of 1998 those movies that deservedly get best movie oscars are known for their shelf life that characteristic that makes such movies classics rentable watchable buyable 25 50 75 years from now  has that qualityin spades  shakespeare in love  hardly spielberg has given us something special  like schindler hits us in the gut not without cause or good reason but in the gut just the same so thats what grandpa went through  people file out from the movie somber disturbed but grateful that there ever was such a generation such a bunch of men that went through hell so we could be free forever moreof course it won every award for sound  how could it not  its as if you were parachuted down to omaha beach yourself on that greyblue june morning  i watched other movie goers  people blanched  wept  gripped their seats  ducked  cursed the coward  and this movies not the best of the year  come on  such fluff as shakespeare is fun to watch but like wonder bread the vitamins the nutrients the guts have been sucked out after watching the bard an hour later you want more  you know that such fluff doesnt last sorry steven  keep writing and finding great stories for us  if we dont appreciate what youve done now we will  when were old and decrepid well make our way down to the futurama video rentalonly to see that is once again sold out  but shakespeare in love  why therere plenty of copies  imagine that,reality
the most stunning war film in cinematic history steven spielberg has crafted an unbelievable recreation of the normandy invasion and story that follows by using bleached out lighting and a guerrilla style of camerawork spielberg thrusts the viewer  into the battle januscz kaminskis camera seems to be everywhere at once without losing the viewer at the center is the performance by its cast they perform with a quiet sense of dignity not seen in films today tom hanks gives his most memorable performance to date as capt john miller a battleweary citizensoldier who has seen too much hanks is without a handicap in this role unlike forrest gump and philadelphia the character he creates is one who is faced with an insurmountable task and in carrying it out must keep himself and his men alive and without losing his own sanity and decency this performance easily surpassed oscar winner roberto benignis  alongside hanks performance is beautiful portrayals by tom sizemore ed burns giovanni ribisi adam goldberg barry pepper jeremy davies vin diesel and matt damon this was by far the best film of the year easily beating shakespeare in love it is sad to see that an ad campaign can buy a film an academy award,reality
tom hanks tom sizemore matt damon edward burns barry pepper adam goldberg vin diesel giovanni ribisi and jeremy davies star in one of the best war films ever made tom hanks stars as capt john miller leader of a public relations mission to bring home the last of four brothers sean peter daniel and james who fought in the war what makes this so hard is that three brothers sean peter and daniel are dead and the mother was going to receive all three letters at once the opening scene of the old man walking in the war veterans cemetary with his family a few steps back unless people have seen the film before we dont know who this man is or what significance it has on the film it gets tied in at the end of the film i saw twice and the opening scene had such a powerful impact on th rest of the film but it was one of those things that you must watch it more than once to fully understand it as i did saving private james turns out to become something more than what capt miller had bargained for tom sizemore is millers loyal right hand man sgt horwath i love the loyalty that tom sizemores character sgt horwath holds for his boss capt miller wars are one of the worst tragedies of america and to bring it to life with such a realistic view really shocked me the way steven spielberg brought to life the 20 minute war scene at the beginning was eyeopening to say the least at first i hated that part since it was so long and drawn out but when i saw it the second time just a few days ago i understood why it was done this way i think spielberg wanted to bring out emotions and make a statement to the audience that war is something that was devastating and something that should never have happened matt damon was superb as pvt james matt damon continues to produce box office hits as does tom hanks and the incomprible legend steven spielberg is one film to savour over and over,reality
i agree that except for the first 30 minutes and perhaps the last battle scene the movie turns into a standard hollywood war movie  in general i think spielbergs films are over rated for authentic battle scenes in other films try when trumpets fade hamburger hill and also pork chop hill,reality
seems to me that the us military will mount huge operations to save single menas well they shouldsomething on the order of 50 men were sent in to rescue scott once they located him and thats not counting the hundreds actually looking for him  so i for one find the plot very plausiblei have seen this movie twice nowand i must say that it is almost as hard to watch the second time because you know whats coming and you cant stop itfor me at least this is almost the single greatest movie ever madeand i would like to thank my grandfather and all of those like him,reality
i think spielberg bit off a little more than he can chew with this movie while the normandy invasion at the beginning haunted me for weeks and was far and away the best war movie sequence i ever saw the ending of this movie seemed too easy and neatly wrapped up it asked a question that could not be answered was worth it theyll say yes and have a tidy ending it isnt that simple and i would have taken a different approach with the ending and left that question unanswered but i guess hollywood doesnt do that too bad it really could have been one of the best movies ever made i recommend it but watch out because it is very intense,reality
we see movies to be entertained as a form of escape from our every day lives instead takes you to experience the horrors of war everything we fear about war is confirmed true in this movie the question is do you really want to experience wartechnically the movie is flawless the story about a platoon trying to retrieve the only surviving of four brothers in wwii france takes a second place behind the brutal battle scenes some of the most impacting in the history of movies some scenes you wont be able to forget maybe for the rest of your life so be prepared do not pay attention to its r ratings an nc17 a,reality
throughout his career mr spielberg has had an attraction to the second world war  in his latest film on that subject spielberg has translated the triumph and tragedy of an entire generation  as the grandson of two world war ii veterans i never apreciated what our fathers and grandfathers had done for us  they saved western civilazation from the tyranny and evil of germany and japan  and that is what makes the best film of 1998  one hundred years from now the view for the world of the most important day of the twentieth century will be this film  thankfully steven spielberg has poured his heart and soul into his masterpiece saving private,reality
i saw the other day and i was shocked at how realistic it was and how affected i was by it that night i could barely get to sleep because every time i closed my eyes i pictured wade asking for his mother or caparzo holding the letter to his parentsi also have to say that one of the reasons this movie was so great was the power of the performances not just tom hanks but ed burns  adam goldbergmellish jeremy daviesupham and giovanni ribisiwade,reality
what a movie  something for everybody action packed very wellwritten emotionally engaging a rarity for films of this genre and superbly directed  even the art direction is topnotch  i wont carp about the improbability of the setupprobably the greatest war movie ever made and surely the the best since full metal jacket back in 87  an instant classic,reality
most all that can be said about this film has been said  i wont argue with naysayers because in a sense i see some of the points they try to make  personally it is one of the most powerful experiences ive had at a motion picturei think its important to point out that though weve seen some scenes from the middle done before in other war movies that doesnt make them in any way conventional or hackneyed  the films muchheralded opening scene of the landing at normandy provides color and mood for all scenes that follow one very nearly may not have enough emotional resources left to endure the final battle scene but spielberg is not beating us over the headin 1987 my mother made me sit through the harrowing tv holocaust drama escape from sobibor for which i was resentful then but grateful now  in the early days of film audiences literally ducked out of the way reacting to a shot of a speeding locomotive  i mention these two things because i want to communicate why we go to movies to begin with  one reason is to witness the horrific events of our past in hopes that we can prevent them from happening again  the otherand this can only be done if the movie makers are skilled enough and spielberg clearly is is to convince us of the authenticity of a time and placewe go to the trouble of going to the movie theatre for a reason  we hope we are going to be glad we went  when the lights go down our muscles tighten in anticipation  i was happy to have seen saving private,reality
just as the movies 2001 and star wars changed forever the expectations of movie goers for that genre has changed what audiences expect from a combat movie  even though the characters in the movie are made up the units equipment and events are real  i had already read several of stephen ambroses books about the european theater of operations dday citizen soldiers before i saw the film  so when i heard about the realistic combat scenes i had to see it  spielberg said in an interview that there was a line he did not cross with the blood and gore  as gory as the movie was i believe that he was correct  he could have made it much worse without departing from reality the most important impact the movie may have is that it makes history interesting in the way schindlers list did  i would love to see spielberg take on other historic stories,reality
if you want to see a movie with spectacular visual effect matched with sound that actually makes you feel like you are there then this is your movie  if you want to see a movie that moves the entire audience in such a way no one moves when it is over then this is a movie for you  if you want to see the best performance from tom hanks hands down then this is the movie for you during the first 20 odd minutes spielberg puts you in a beach landing  you are there machine gunners are engaging you from far away bunkers  artillery and mortar rounds are exploding around you  brave men are falling  you will urge the american soldiers on you will duck you will smell the salt water and blood you will yell medic and you will feel war  truly this one battle is the best scene depicting war other than film taken of actual battles and this may be better my hat is off to spielberg  truly this is a great movie and only a few can even come close to comparing to it  not since schindlers list has a movie moved me if this movie does not win best picture best actor best supporting actor best director best writing best cinematography best sound best editing best effects and a slew of others then those that vote did not see this movie,reality
the first 30 minutes i sat with my toes clenched people around me were sobbing which i honestly found to be overreacting after the 30 minutes the movie begins to slow down and the wafer thin plot is introduced the characters in the movie are never really fully developed and stay two dimensional thats why i was surprised about the oscar nomination for tom hanks in my view totally undeserved the visuals are good and effectively show the chaos during combat overall i would put the movie in the same category as the dirty dozen and other mission type war movies very entertaining but not worth the hype this movie has gotten,reality
the initial 30 minutes are groundbreakingly realistic and probably give a truer sense of what it was like to storm the normandy beaches than any film that has come beforeunfortunately the middle half of the film wanders about aimlessly as the characters  a checklist of wartypes  gather themselves for the finale which sets the soldiers on a wellworn path also the attitudes of the soldiers reflects the cynical resentful 1960s generation of war protesters and draft dodgers not the genuinely heroic generation that actually fought wwii as a result i think this film like almost everything else pales next to the more authentic the longest day another good one is the big red one which features a checklist of moviearmytypes led into battle by lee marvin and is similar in structure to but more authentic as wellthat said the opening scenes and the finale feature some of the best war scenes ever filmed the movie works on another level as well were the ones who were saved by that generations ultimate sacrifice and like we should be asking ourselves what have i done to deserve the sacrifices made for me,reality
is a triumphant masterpiece about heroism integrity and humanityimaginea soldier fighting in the middle of a horrific war the date is june 6 1944 otherwise known as dday on the shores of normandy the dday invasion happens the good guys the us army fights valiantly against all the obstacles that fate has decided to utilize suddenly pulled into the heart of the battle machine guns start firing in all directions explosions could be reverberated from miles away the soldier hesitates waiting for that clear shot everywhere he goes he watches in anguish as one by one his allies fall bodies of defeated souls rest all over the place on the grass the sand and even floating dead around the sea the water is adulterated with human blood the screams of the mortally wounded echo in a whirlpool of agony medical experts rush to save the injured many are not lucky  as a soldier he is about to breakdown then the glimmer at the end of the tunnel is an insinuation for him to keep fightingthe above paragraph is an example of how technically proficient the introductory battle sequence has been directed by steven spielberg in this trenchant motion picture  is the story of captain miller tom hanks and seven other marines who go on a quest to save the life of one damned soulprivate matt damon whose three older brothers have all been killed in action millers secondincommand sergeant horvath tom sizemore along with the sniper expert private reien edward burns are obligated to save this very one life unlike many others who have sacrificed themselves in pain and suffering this particular private can not bare to lose his very own lifefor he is the last surviving member of his family so that can perpetuate the bloodlinethe 40 minute prelude in saving  private   is  one  of  the  most disturbing yet cogent images ever filmed on camera at the beginning with see captain millers perspective of world war iis toll both in human costs and emotional value little subtleties have damaged miller for life ie he constantly shakes his right hand whenever he tries to drink from a water bottle  miller a mere english schoolteacher only wants a ride homebut this timehim along with seven of his trusted allies must be coerced to get the mission doneas for the cast tom sizemore is equally stunning and mesmerizing as his cohort who tries to keep a straight composure but he loses his temper as well edward burns doesnt have a big role but he contributes heavily as another of the persevering privates proficient with his aim matt damon is also terrific as private one soldier who puts his duty before his own lifeis an excruciating experience that boldly pulls the viewer into the heart of the world war ii so realistically unlike most other films  the introduction showing everybody the devastating costs of inhumane violence is already a gory eyecatcher that may turn off much of the squeamish still dont let  the  strong  violence   deter   you    from watching this movie this film is a mustseeinstead of glamorizing on violence as usually stereotypically depicted in other movies plunges the viewer into the real consequences of war as the stark but unforgettable saying goes war is hellthough fictional has been based on the inspirational reallife story of the fighting sullivans five brothers who all served in the same naval services unfortunately for themone torpedo has claimed all five of their lives and has permanently scarred a family for lifefew motion pictures in cinematic history have touched so many peoples lives hearts and souls as this epic motion picture often living in a society where we take freedom for granted these steadfast soldiers portrayed in this indelible film have dedicated their lives to save usand the world from absolute oppression persecution and tyrannyis one splendid picture capturing every turbulent moment of the lives of these selected eight men is the archetype of the consummate war film the intro and climactic sequences for this film are eyecatching and the characterizations for this movie have never been in so much depth  the climax in where both sides take their tolls is an exemplary concept of how talented a director steven spielberg truly is the severity of war in this film and every life involved in it has been captured so well in detailif there is only one complaint i must give about its that this movie is a little bit too sluggish at times it can be cut down to around 2 hours and still be a great film otherwise this is a flawless masterpiece superb solemn and sharply powerful the lesson that has been so successfully achieved in is that confrontation on the true aspects of the horror of war can bring out only the best and heroic attitudes of anybody who has the courage  it is also amazing that in this film despite all the disheveled scenes the characters must face they still manage to retain a good sense of humor once in a while this movie deserves all exalted praises  too bad the academy awards did not allow to win the oscar for best picturerating  out of ,reality
the film is at most fun the production is speckless the action very intense in the vital moments the cinematography is excellent the sound involving all very beautifully done but it is all it is just a millionary production a little more than id4 the story is very poor and the historical context is far away from making the film outstanding it feels like anything about war one has seen only better made it is outrageous that people put above others of the genre such as apocalypse now platoon or full metal jacket the acting is hardly good not because of the actors who did what they could but because of the story which made the acting secondary since the story is so poor and the american hero appeal is not what can make it better the whole film has become just another nice and entertaining spielberg production far from deserving an oscar further from being mentioned in cinema history as the art,reality
although i found the movie chaotic even harassing at times i was left profoundly affected  just by showing a glimpse of the reality of war we spectators lived the experience only three hours this movies becomes a vehicle of great importance,reality
when first viewing this movie i walked into the theatre thinking ahhanother war movie  when i left that theatre three hours later i was teary eyed  i did not have trouble sleeping the next day but that morning after my mind finally grasped the magnitude of the losses felt by the american family steven spielberg socked it to us so to speak with his brilliant opening onthe bloodied gory beaches of normandy 1944  using hand held cameras 8mm footage and the inclusion of mistakes  like the camera being dropped showed us the confusion the fear the unpreparedness of that french beach one cannot blink for he or she is so involved in the film  that is what a movie should do to a person  to anyone who didnt like this movie i suggest you jump into the theatre again and watch it then look at your soul for it was the young men who fought that and those wars to give that soul,reality
is a film which brings up many of the important questions regarding the morality of war it doesnt try to answer any of them but asks each individual to examine themselves as so many died just so that we may live sizemores and hanks performances are of oscar caliber as is the cinematography and direction during the battle scenes spielberg overexposes the film and cranks it at a different speed which effectively takes the viewer into the surrealism of battle a truly wonderful piece of art that doesnt fall into  sentimentalism,reality
unlike any other war movies of the past vividly displays the horror and hardships of war it allows you to travel back time and allows you to feel the terror of the worlds greatest destroyer steven spielberg has presented this movie brilliantly and captured most of its audiences the actors art decorations settings and its powerful sound and visual effects made this movie come to life all this elements sums up to one of the best movies ever made,reality
the first time i laid my eyes on this film i have seen it about 10 times now i was filled with awe and inspiration  the transitional wideangle shot of the grunts being torn to peices just as the higgins boats reach the beach are the most horrifying and at the same time the most beautiful images i have ever seen on film  the halfhour that follows and i dont think that many will disagree with me is flawless filmmaking unfortunately that is the problem  the first halfhour is so damned strong in fact that it is in my opinion that the momentum of the rest of the film suffers in comparison  like braveheart and all quiet on the western front speilberg showed his ideas through emotions and feelings rather than words  i believe that was all accomplished in the first act of the film leaving the rest of the picture to fend for itself  what turned out to be a very intelligent move by robert rodat and speilberg was to use each member of the squad to express an intruiging symbolic idea  to me that made upfor the lack of any solidity to the storyline that may have existed  the level of violence and arbitrariness are without a doubt maxed out here but at good cause  anyone who knows anything about what unfolded on omaha beach that morning knows that it was a collosal bloodbath full of blood guts vomit and death  if you would read steven ambroses dday novel you would actually realize that was just an edited version of what occurred that morning on the different sectors of omaha beach nevertheless this film is a true repreasentation of raw power and gritty realism that i am sure will not be passed up for a long while in scope,reality
no matter what the oscars said was the best film of 1998 its realistic recreation of the horrors of war make it worthy of praise for years to come another topnotch performance from hanks as well as a memorable performance by newcomer jeremy davies great job dreamworks10 points out of 10,reality
is in itself a simple story and the mission of not a major event in this terrible war  yet it points out that it was still about human values and our fight to preserve them  the terror facing those brave soldiers and the agony that they lived in could not have been visualized better than in this spielbergs masterpiece  these eye to eye life to death moments of this film are icy cold realistic and closer to experiencing the wwii we can hardly get  it is an long awaited ovation to the bravehearts and the victims of this war  the lessons from wwii should never be forgotten  as in schindlers list spielberg and associates have again given us the vital lesson of realizing how precious piece and life are this powerful film is one of the greatest ever  my score is 10,reality
was 100 worthy of the best picture oscar i can tell you that no other filmmaker could direct a more realistic depiction of warfare on omaha beach during wwii it was so vivid that you were almost there witnessing but not experiencing the brutality pain and fear the soldiers went through the first 20 minutes or so of this film is increasingly graphic but if youve ever wondered the true nature of a story told by a surviving veteran relative here it isthe plot is part nonfiction and part fiction focusing on a mother who wants her son brought home after his three remaining brothers are killed in battle a platoon of men head by tom hanks tom sizemore edward burns jeremy davies giovanni ribisi garry pepper are sent to find the last remaining pvt james played by matt damon who does not overact in the role behind enemy lines  each and every soldier was different and what made it so interesting was how they interacted with one another yes they were extremely sympathetic the cinematography was brilliant as was the set which they actually filmed in international areas  another memorable scene was their conversations in that broken down french town towards the finale cherbourg speaking of romances that occurred back home and the irony of that record player working with a french lady singing about heartbreak a very unhollywoodish moviei could recommend this film to anyone and if you cant stand to stay to see the beginning come in when that part is over anyone who says this movie was boring and pointless  most likely has not seen the movie or they are just fans of the adam sandlerpauly shore genre  ignore the negative reviews you read about this film and just see it it will go right through you and you will be shocked moved and in awe as a resultranks in the top 20 as being one of the best war movies of all time and in the top 10 as the best films ever made,reality
for me a wwii vet but not european theater this was one of the three most powerful wartime movies i have ever seen all quiet on the western front paths of glory and but benefits from the improved technology in film making which makes it more powerful visually than the other two and the directors ability to make great films with epic sweep is another advantage of i believe that every american from the age of 15 on should see this film to understand what it means to go to war or to send men and women into war the realism of was overwhelming my wife and i could not leave our seats after the film for almost 15 minutes we were overwhelmed emotionally a unique experience,reality
there are those that say that this movie wont play well on the small screen it probably wont  most films dont some say that it was too violent others say that the subjectmatter has been done before but i challenge anyone to find afilm that has ever told the story war so well  like with oliver stones  born on the 4th of july   the truth can sometimes be more reality than most people handle  i left the theater numb  it became one of my personal top 10s it made my grateful to the many that paid the ultimateprice speilberg made perhaps the greatest war epic ever  and this was the best movie tom hanks has ever been in  tom hanks may have earned his oscars for forrest gump and philadelphia but  was a better film,reality
spectacular action scenes do not make a classic war movie this film has two of them that serve as bookends for a rather dull middlethe war scenes are extremely well done that much is true but many people who hail this film as a classic seem to substitute well filmed action  carnage for that of a classic how many films that came before this one have told us of the horrors of war that war is hell  this is how it really was even if the war scenes in spr are superior to that of say the deer hunter or platoon does it make it a better film no spr has nothing new to say about war it may contain more extravagant war scenes than these other war films but dont go mistaking it for a classic or the ultimate war filmsomething has always bothered me about spielbergs films he is incapable of subtlety or nuance  everything is out in the open spelled out leaving nothing to the imagination or to the mysteries  complexities of human naturehe has always struck me as a kid showing off his film making skills trying to outdo everyone elses films on whichever genre he takes heavy weight subjects such as the holocaust war slavery  cheapens them and because of the sensitivity of these topics we are not allowed to criticize him or his films because his intentions are worthy or noble its not the subject matter of his films i have a problem with its his treatment of them that i dislikecompared to the thin red line spr has a connect the dots mentalityit has none of the compassion complexity or rich layering that the trl has but because it does have the enormous amount of carnage  gore that the trl doesnt have it gets more attentioneven in a war film such as the trl there is still room for subtlety spielberg is only trying to outdo the war films that have come before his hell push all the buttons necessary  use all the tricks he knows to do thisspr is firstly an action film and thats why most people like it the bits about the loss of human life the sacrifices these men madeetc are secondary and only serve to prop the film up and attempt to give it loftier  more meaningful ideals than it actually has lets face it spr enthusiasts are going to see this film for the very thing that the film unsuccessfully tries to denounce the horror  violence of war dont be fooled,reality
i just returned from my third viewing of i get more and more out of it every time i watch the movie as a student of conflict in general and world war ii in particular i find it to be a masterpiece a tribute to those men who when history called put down their tools calmly went off defeat the forces of evil then modestly returned to everyday life without another wordtheir generation was the bravest there was i wonder if the mememe generations which followed have earned the sacrifices they made at normandy iwo jima okinawa tarawa and anziothe academy would be doing a great disservice if is not selected as best picture for 1998,reality
is the best war film ive seen in a long time the acting is fantastic everything about it amazing although some people would call it to gruesome but thats war its about time someone made a film that depicts wwii accurately steven spielberg is a genius and broke a lot of rules when making this film i highly recommend it and i hope it wins best picture at this years oscars,reality
 the title alone is brilliantly written obviously by robert rodat but the title doesnt really even begin to match the movies over all breadth and scope  yes a hodgepodge of warversed soldiers enter into heavily german infested french countryside and find many little happenstance adventures along the way to but that is not what this film wants to be about  the long extended scenes of pure adrenaline horror was an exercise in realism by spielberg never sophomoric but absolutely true in its depiction of terror while in combat  in past attempts at experiencing film terror or as alex from clockwork orange would say vidying terror i viewed some 8 or 9 snuff films known as the faces of death and my memories of those grisly scenes coincided at times in spr  one scene in particular when tom and his men are clinging for dear life on bullet ridden sand dunes and the camera frenetically shifts back and forth between screaming characters then captures tom pulling over a man with his face caved in i swore at that moment that i had seen something similar in faces of death  scenes like this or cpt miller kneeling on the beach with stream of blood trickling down his face as soldiers engulfed in flames try to carry on fighting or medic wade vaingloriously claiming to have stopped the bleeding as a bullet rips thru the soldiers helmet remind me of the gritty atrociousness not only in movies but in life  yes real life  the opening of not the normandy beach opening but the normandy cemetery is very poignant  line after line of white marble headstones extending into the vanishing point and the bereaved veteran humbled into silent weeping in their presence  then another genius stroke of spielberg the camera dollies slowly into the veterans deep transcendant eyes  and then the crash of waves into the rusted hedgehogs saltwater ebbing and flowing cautiously thru its iron legs  although as i watched spr the critic in me couldnt completely be astonished by  the warrior poetry  i saw spielberg draw influences from such directors as kubrick de palma kurosawa and even tarantino  one scene i think borrows heavily from true romance a movie written by the feverishly popculture zeitgeist genius of quentin tarantino in which the soldiers are locked in a mexican standoff with equally surprised nazis chaotically yelling profanities at each other  peckinpah i think would be especially proud with the usage of chameleonlike and unexpected violence and gore  theres one scene in the wild bunch peckinpahs answer to the 7 samurai in which a bank robbers horse wobbles and then crashes through a plate glass shop window whilst the camera frenetically weaves between slow and fast motion  in the final battle in spr this wild bunch scene reemerged in my mind when a bomb blasted soldier hurdles thru a shop window ala peckinpah  there is so much to write about this movie that it would take several days and nights to fully begin to encompass its creative inputs  ill leave with one final comment  i think the final battle was a homage to stalingrad one of the last and greatest sieges in military history where nazi and russian soldiers battled it out tooth and nail in the bomb hollowed city and in such odd places like wine cellers church bell towers and antique shops  definately does it justice,reality
its pretty much all been said i saw this movie in the largest theater in dublin and it was a full house 800 after the opening battle sequence there was a deathly hush unlike anything i have ever experienced before or since it was obvious that this was the closest anyone there had ever gotten to actual combat  that we had been transported back in time to a hell on earth and that nobody was ever going to be able to look at any war movies in the same light again for this alone this film deserves its place in history,reality
as i write i am on my way to watch it again  so much action  tom hanks was perfect for his part  so real and so raw  mr spielberg does it once again im in the military and i feel so lucky to live in our time  we today have so much more of a safety net unlike back then,reality
spielberg is the best as one of our theatre guests said war sucks this movie makes you sit still after the end titles starts with your thoughts running giving you a feeling of god i live a fortunate life in the best way you are given a little bit of humanity and you might start thinking of other people than yourself does this still happen its nud just a movie,reality
was probably the most graphic war epic ive seen speilburgs camerawork made you feel like you were actually in the battle looking around at everything thats going on when i walked into the theater i remember my dad telling me remember you dont have to look at the gore if you dont want but i sucked it up ive lived through watching 5000000 blood shed hollywood epics i can watch this i thought to myself but in the first scene at dday i was basicly in tears the thing that bothered me wasnt the blood but it was how these men had to die you see how they died one mans stomach and intistine was all over and out of his stomach crying mom i felt sorry for these people in school when we talked about world war ii we thought of it as ya it was bad but i think private actually grips you it even scares you tom hanks gave a wonderful performence  i think tom hanks will get the oscar i also have strong feelings that it will get at least director and picture also i think everyone should see the movie so everyone knows that world war ii wasnt something that was just there i mean my grandfather fought in this war he saw all this that was happening your grandfathers faught and your fathers and brothers etc if you dont leave the theater with tears in your eyes at least deep down in your heart you can at least feel sad for these people who had to risk their lives to win the warmy rate  out of ,reality
i dont like war movies at all but i went to see spr to understand what all the hype was about  i am still suffering from the effects the morning after  all the jostling of the camera gave me a headache and my mom felt like she was going to throw up  i tried to explain to her that was intended to portray the chaos of war  however i dont know how realistic the movie is since i wasnt there at omaha beach and im not a military buff  being a member of generation x im pretty far removed  through the opening scene i just thought it was great special effects  but if this is even close to what our veterans had to go through then im shocked at the horrors and grateful for their sacrificesspr was intended to show the brutal ugliness of war  it wasnt meant to entertain  the storyline itself was stupid  i dont think eight men would be sent to find one  on the whole i was very bored by the three hours and normally i would give a movie such as this 310 stars because war just isnt my favorite genre  however due to the important message it carries especially to young people i give it a 710,reality
wow like everyone says the first twenty minutes are amazing  the characters the story the script all very good  but however the ending with the old man saying tell me im a good man seems forced and unnecessary  it is weak and contrasts the mood of the whole movie  it is just so fake i wonder why spielberg threw it in  if you have the scene with the old man at the beginning you can get it and you dont need the end otherwise yes it is an excellent movie  all in all though glory is the best war movie,reality
with all respect to the deer hunter and platoon is the greatest war film there ever was and probably ever will be  many people especially in this website  criticize the film for its many flaws like story structure violence and nationalism  first of all this film was intended to be a dramatic portrayal of war but its brilliant realism made it seem almost like a documentary in some waysand people criticized the film for this  well isnt that the point of cinema to make something on a screen seem real  apparently some people on this website dont think so as for the extremeviolence hello this was a war film and war is violent another general criticism of this film was its dull and unrealstic plot whoever said that this films premise was unrealsitic should have done some research since the whole plot is based on a true story of a platoon that was sent to save a soldier whose brothers were lost in wwii  and finally the person that criticized the film for having too much nationalism was just trying to attack the film for the opening and closing scenes with the american flag blowing in the wind  those scenes were not there to imply nationalismthey were actually there to say that the countrys involvement in wwii is what was honorable  get itthe flag was waving from the beginning of the war to the end ie fighting the war was something we should be proud of  you want a film that was absurdly nationalistichow about bridge on the river kwai a film where the soldiers were so determined to give their nation a good name that they built a bridge to help the army that had captured them,reality
i have read some of the reviews on this movie and seen a lot of people putting it down as horrible those people obviously dont know what they are talking about the gore was necessary in order to depict the real hell war gives people say its too much but it is perfect when realism is required the plot was based loosely on a true story of wwii and nobody should put down that the idea has been done before we take a step in to the minds of people during war and their views along the way they fight gory battles that are nothing less than fantastic so people shouldnt talk when they say there is no real screenplay it deserves to win all the oscars its nominated for all of them any movie going against it in any way should just back down people say that it may lose best screenplay to either shakespeare in love or the truman show and i say they do have a great chance maybe better than spr does but nobody should put it down people always complain about the gore but the gore is not the problem the problem is the people with soft stomachs or dont have enough nerve to stand the violence that is as close to real life as you can get and people should just admit it the best movie of the year hands down is definitely saving private,reality
i saw this a week after youve got mail which sucks i did not expect a lot from tom hanks this film is well made well edited and is an exciting and disturbing look at war the film contains two members of the friends cast the medic is phoebes brother and the jew killed by the knife is crazy eddy chandlers ex roomate not a must see no film is but a worthy should see if at all possible,reality
this is an extraordinary movie i have seen it three times from the opening assault on normandy to the climactic battle scenes at the bridge it just overwhelms i have never seen a movie which draws the viewer into its world so completely and this is fact not fiction spielberg in his brilliance has brought the reality of war to us as no one before people in the theatre have just sat mesmerized and stunned by the scenes which were so remarkably shown it is the best war movie ever made and one of the best movies of any genre the heroism of the regular gis is portrayed here as a lasting testament to their bravery tom hanks was brilliant as was his supporting cast great movies are sometimes difficult to watch and this is no exception but if one can get past th carnage and blood a very rewarding and uplifting experience is there for the taking the sacrifice of our fathers brothers etc is shown here as never before congratulations to all involved a great experience,reality
steven spielberg has directed a masterpiece far surpassing any other of his films  he has proven himself an artist who has domintated his craft to perfection  i as a movie fan and a spielberg fan feared the worst when he directed schindlers list  a movie of such power and grim reality as schindlers can only tear the innerchild that has spawned such classics from the man who draws so perfectly from it  lost world and even amistad showed nuances of this  has proven that spielberg is still in control and can wield his storytelling prowess like a master  the gritty realism and you are there style in which was filmed allows the viewer to experience every sense around him surpassing all other war films that offer only a voyeuristic journey in a glorified battle spectacle  mr spielberg my hat off to you  i as a fledgling filmaker am in awe and consider you one of the film greats  is an instant classic  somebody better call the film institute and tell them to revise their top 100 list  ,reality
i so enjoyed this movie  it was a good story for generations to see and resee  i took my children ages 11 and 13 and im glad i did  they learned something,reality
spielberg demonstrates that he is the greatest filmmaker of all time  this film is perhaps the most spectacular achievement i have ever seen in cinema  i am still in awe days after having seen this film  i thought schindlers list was perhaps the greatest wwii depiction i had ever seen but no more  this film realism is so real it is hard to believe that this production wasin fact after all a drama and not a documentary  my mind is now permanently blown  steven spielberg is the ultimate,reality
i really really really thought this was a great movie other people do too but i dont think the ones i know like this movie the right way my psychiatrist didnt think it held up too well and my sick friends thought the gutwretching violence was funny i am very offended by their views and anybody elses views if they disagree with me i want to see this movie in theater before i miss my chance i will never watch this on video you couldnt pay me back to the movie steven spielberg is one of the worlds greatest directors tom hanks is also one of the best actors all the actors were excellent in their roles i also liked jeremy davies he was a really good character i think he should have gotten nominated for an acadamy award the direction every conceivable detail the wonderful cinematography the editing the fact that humor could be fit in to a movie like this the battle sequences from omaha beach to the final one in the destroyed german town this is just some of the things i can mention i dont have anything bad to say about this movie i only have good things to say,reality
the correlation between these two stories is nearly nonexistent  just because theres a fight in the beginning and a fight in the end and a quiet but extremely skillful character doesnt make it a kurosawa ripoff  hell if we went by the similarities mentioned you could say the same thing about the blues brothersor blazing saddlesor silverado oh wait silverado was a kurosawa ripoff,reality
the genius of steven speilberg is just breathtaking  no other director has his talents or resources  this movie is very close to being a perfect movie  the beginning scene itself is well worth admission  if you miss this movie on the big screen you will be missing greatness  it deserves best picture director and actor oscars at least,reality
i sat in a theatre surrounded by strangers and by the end of this film i felt i was pulled into the battlefields of wwii  spielbergs main goal with this film was to create the reality of war the horror the fear the gore the devastation  he succeeded on all counts  the action sequences were nothing short of incredible very realistic and frightening  but unfortunately i think that speilbergs desire to create the most visually powerful war film of all time was overpowering his ability to tell a good storythe story was not a very good one  the story is the heart and soul of a film and it cannot be compromised for the sake of expressing the strictly visual component of that story  not only was it completely unbelievable that the us army would send out a group of soldiers in search of one man in the middle of war but the whole movie you are just waiting for another battle to take place  it kind of reminded me a bit of the movie twister of course it was much better than twister as a whole but it had a similar structure good action interrupted by a bad story  all of the performances are fantastic and that makes the story watchable unlike twister and some of the rodats writing is good like matt damons back home speech but the films visual presentation of war is just so enthralling that no story could probably match it  it is the downfall of any movie which has a much more talented director than screenwriterthat doesnt mean to say that that combination of writerdirector cant work i believe that faceoff had a pretty unbelieveable story but john woos ability to intergrate the visuals of the film into the story itself and tell the crazy story so matterafactly makes it work  spielberg didnt seem to take as much interest in the progression of the narrative as he did into the progression of the battle scene and ultimately this makes the film stagnate quite frequentlyi still believe the film to be worthy of best picture cinematography editing and a number of technical awards i dont think that it deserves to win best director or screenplay but it mostly still will win  the chemistry that is essential to making a story work was not there and that holds the film back from being a complete masterpiece if you want to watch wwii film which incorporates both good writing and good direction watch terrence maliks the thin red line it at least has a better balance of the two  still watch just dont expect to start crying for the characters and their conflict but expect to cringe in your seats at the horrors of war which speilberg brings to the screen with incredible authenticity and realism,reality
spectacular cinematography  wonderful art direction  some of the camera work makes you think that you were actually there  a definite must for the wwii buff,reality
i enjoyed this movie  however my mom didnt  she doesnt like war movies very much so why she agreed to see this movie with me and her friends i do not know  however when i went to see the movie the only place to sit was in the front row  i dont recommend doing this for this movie because the camera jumps around a lot and caused me and all of the members in my party to not feel very well,reality
does a couple of things that make it a worthwhile film 1it depicts combat as hell it gives a realism to film combat that lets those of us lucky enough not to have been there realise just how lucky we are 2it lets us pay tribute to those old men we see on veterans day and anzac day in australia  new zealand we now can appreciate why they still march as for the sensitivity of some of american friends to comments regarding american patriotism of course there is no reason to criticize the depiction of americans in an american war film however maybe just maybe the film would be stronger if nationality was taken out of the equation and we saw it for what war ispeople killing each other while in fear of their own lives because of politics we can be proud of what these people did for our freedom but they didnt do it for a coloured piece of cloth they did it because they were asked to defend freedom and once in battle they did it to survive so american friends dont be so sensitive your people have done alot for the rest we know but were allowed to criticise a film maker who likes to wave flags in his war moviethats what starts them,reality
this is the reason why steven spielberg is the greatest director alive possibly the greatest director of all time  this film is about heroes real heroes and it is something that every american should seeyou look at an old man and see just an old man but how do you know what this old man has done in his life  what hes seen and done  caused me to stop and think about that  it caused me to stop and consider the sacrifices young american men have made throughout this nations history  sacrifices many of the men in my own family have made this is no john wayne war film  the heroes of this movie were young men who were there to do a job  they were scared to death  they screamed and prayed and cried for their mothers this film brings home as best as any film can the absolute horror and carnage of war and the very human way people react to such a nightmare  they were unwilling heroes just like every other dogface who went to war in real lifemr spielberg has made the best war movie ever to hit the theaters and the actors all of them were outstanding  but let this film remind you of the real men who fought for us in real battles  this film is a tribute to them and i dont think mr spielberg will disagree with that statement the film is gory and loud and frightening and it should be  just remember our fathers and grandfathers were there  think about that the next time you see an old man doddering down the street,reality
the similarity between spr and seven samurai is amazing1 the story structurethe leader hanks and takeshi both fought in the beginning then searched for team members a long march to destinywaiting for fight in the ruins or the vilage the final long fight 2 the team members are even more similar a sophiscated leader a silent cool shooter or a silent sharp swordman the youngest member cant fight but he changed in the end the theme is highly borrowed from leans the bridge over river kwaiall those above explained why there was such an unrealistic objective and they had to stay to fightthe movie is not original in many senses,reality
spielbergs 2nd masterpiece of war is a shocking and relentless epic that is a perfect blend of emotion and current film technology there has never been a battle scene as brutally realized as the storming of omaha beach and no other filmmaker has come anywhere remotely close to capturing the horrors of war you find yourself forgetting where you are and who is even in this movie i say this meaning the film seems like a documentary as well as a first hand account exemplified in the compelling scenes where hanks captain miller sees everything in slow motion blood splattering on him and all the carnage is as close to war as anyone who has never been to war can get forget apocalypse forget thin red line forget even platoon this is itactors who have participated in the film say they cannot believe what is on the screen matt damon is quoted as saying he forgot he was in the film while watching the final sequence people will ask them forever what it was like to be in this picture veterans have sent their thanks to spielberg and his crew for honoring them with this absolute classic it will be studied forever in schools grammar on up it deserves every award it will receive and we all a owe debt to those who made such an important and awesome film that shows us the depths of the human condition human collaboration and human hell best picture of the year if not the decade it will be universally immortalized,reality
is a deeply and affecting movie  the first 24 minutes at normandy is riveting spielberg carries you right up the beach with the others  it is hard to overt your eyes  i think that this was the first movie ive gone to where it was completely silent throughout the whole film and after as the audience was in awe  the movie is deeply moving and affecting hanks sizemore burns davies damon ribisi goldberg et al were stupendous in this movie,reality
is one of the best films it shows how truly gifted spielberg is it starts out with the most horrific 25 minutes i have ever seen on film what i would like to rave the most over is the acting especially tom hanks his best performancegiavanni ribisi jeremy daviesand tom sizemore the first 25 minutes of the film is some of the greatest camera work in the history of film this film shows the true horrors of war and i now have admiration for the soldiers who fought in the war,reality
while i think that is a very good film i personally had trouble watching it  all the death and destruction blood  gore set aside my trouble was with the style  i had real trouble with motionsickness when i watched the film  the giggling of the hand held camera made me physically ill  while i did enjoy it i did have a hard time  if you havent seen this film and plan to do so take a long a bottle of dramamine  if you plan to wait for video hopefully the small screen will minimize these effects,reality
my humble skills as a writer lend me no assistance in capturing the trauma that one experiences while watching this movie  the best way for me to sum it up is by telling you what typical audience reaction greets the end credits  stunned silenceit is a testament to the power of this piece of film that it leaves viewers in shocked awe of the ordeal that the wwii generation must have faced at home and in combat  the documentarystyle cinematography and gritty violence draws the audience into the terror that faced every person that came ashore in normandy that cold june morningas incredibly nervewracking as that sequence is in the film there is a hard truth that every viewer keeps in his mind  it is this fact alone that allows us to watch in fascination as scores of men are slaughtered on the beachthe undeniable truth is that this is makebelievethe bullets are not real  the blood is fake  when the director called cut everyone in the scene got up and went to the buffet  so as bad as it looks on camera we realize that its all just a lot of masterful storytellingthe films triumph lies in the slowly dawning idea that grows within the audience  by the end there is a small voice that whispers this is a movie but for many it was real  and even worse than what was shown,reality
i went to see for more or less one reason it was supposed to be movie that portraits war as it really is and that it opposes war however i was dissapointedthis movie is big rumble but it fails to deliver the battle sequences are horrific but the end seems to be slapped on it for marketing purposes this movie is about how horrific the war is for its first two thirds and then turns into romantic mush about how great it is to be a hero the ending sequence has nothing to do with opposing the waralso where is the human side of the other side where is the human side of germans spielberg fails to show that the soldiers are the same no matter what side they fight this is the true horror of war that humans are fighting humans and usually those whoe are fighting are not the ones that are in command where are all the generals and admirals and what not i ask this movie was not supposed to be about the politics it was supposed to show the inhumanness of the war and that it didntother then that of course spielberg once again has outdone himself on the technical side to shoot the whole movie without a tripod and make it look good too well that takes a genius script editing  all is superb a true oscar movie,reality
spr is without a doubt one of the most talked about films of the year i recently went to see it in the theatre to figure out why its impossible to judge this movie on a grand scale since there are so many little intricaciesstoryline less than fresh three brothers die so a team of men is sent to find the remaining brother to take him home uhhuh yeah thats realistic this movie basically has no storyline its just a bunch of dialogue strung together in the hopes that someone will make sense out of it allcasting while each one of the actors cast in the role did an admirable job with particular notice going to edward burns and barry pepper who were both extremely impressive id be interested in knowing why spielberg thought he couldnt go within ten miles of reality im sorry but the average age of a soldier during wwii was not 35 it was 20 its a sad sad day when a 22yrold giovanni ribisi is the closest thing spielberg has to a realistic soldieremotional reality in as far as getting the reactions of soldiers spielberg did a fairly good job yes war is hell which is what spielberg showed with his message that war could turn any man into a monster too bad he killed it with chain of command those officers were just a tad too willing to scream at their cosphysical reality there are a lot of complaints about the americanism of the film of course the film is americanised the only unit that actually managed to land anywhere near omaha beach was american while it is asking a little much to expect viewers to believe that the troops never ran into troops from any other army i dont think spielberg wanted to test his luck he couldnt get his own countrys uniforms aok let alone another countrystruthfulness we all know that there is absolutely no fact in this movie whatsoever spielberg may have originally touted this as the true story of the niland brothers but he recanted long ago since its obvious it wasnt if it was theyd have gotten at least one fact in that story rightmilitary reality im with the experts on this one a little less flash and trash there spielberg and make an effort next time to get the right kind of weaponry and btw spielberg no army would risk losing eight men to get one home even if he was the presidents soncinematic worth excellent while the direction at times was a little choppy and left something to be desired this was still an excellent moviemost people who are dissatisfied with this movie are probably those who expected to see a true story sorry but you got the wrong war movie of 1998  the true story is in the thin red line which in itself is an excellent war movie now sure i admit i spent half the movie hoping matt damons character would get it in the end but i was still extremely satisfied i did have to practically hold my greatuncles both of whom were at normandy down to get them to stay  both wanted to leave in disgust with spielbergs hollywoodization and capitalization on this horrific event it was well worth going to see in the theatre and i dont often do that i do think though that the movie will be highly disappointing once on video because its the kind of movie one needs to see in a theatrealtogether its not the best movie of the year but its not the worst its an excellent fictional account of what life could have been like in wwii for a group of soldiers if you want reality watch the thin red line but if you enjoy fictionalized war films like spr check out any of the films available in the war section of your local video store well okay so maybe rambo isnt the thing to go for but there are a number of excellent movies out there,reality
when spielberg makes a serious film he makes a serious film after schindlers list all i could think was that wasnt spielberg it cant have been where was the crowd pleaser set pieces where was the whimsical family aspect i really didnt think spielberg was capable of the viciousness he displayed when that film was made until i saw this one vicious doesnt even begin to describe himi came into this film knowing all the hype how it was such a harrowing account how it never flinched how it didnt look away from the gory details but no matter how much you know coming in youre never prepared enough within the first ten minutes youre dropped into this picture of hell on earthas the boats charge relentlessly towards omaha beach you can see it coming as the soldiers on board throw up from seasickness and fear the conclusion is inevitable the twenty second call is heard the palms sweat from your feeling of helplessness the locks on the landing craft doors spin open the faces of the soldiers behind it eat into your heart and then it happens theyre dead they didnt know what hit them all hell breaks loose men drop left right and centre machinegun fire rains down on them like hailstones except these troops arent punched by neat circular holes oh no theyre torn apart shredded minced arms are removed heads caved in troops turn to see the person they were dragging to safety has turned into a piece of meat the ensuing 25 minutes feel like an eternity please god let this end when the beach assault was finally over my mother who i saw the film with turned to me and said they didnt stand a chance did they i didnt replythe motive of this film was to take the heroic notions of war films and crush them totally war just doesnt work its a stupid way to solve an argument the message is agonisingly unavoidable its hard to argue a case for conflict after youve seen too many people die anyone that says that prolonged contact with scenes of violence desensitizes you clearly hasnt watched this in a similar vein to all quiet on the western front this film should be shown to future generations until the word war is removed from the dictionaries at least the first 30 minutes should beafter the brutality of omaha the film calms down to become a more philosophical study into the futility of war this is where things start to derail apart from hanks miller whose third oscar was no doubt being moulded while this was made none of the other leads get a look in millers unit is made up of a pretty stereotypical bunch whining jew sympathetic medic cowardly translator and attempts to give them an extra dimension dont really work sizemore comes close with the job of dependable sergeant but he just isnt given enough to do the germans are also given something of a rough ride whilst they are shown as being more human this time theres still an unshakable evil master race feel to the whole affair theres also the problem of the final battle sequence where omaha gave us the warmeatgrinder equation the bridge defense opts for the more normal a few good men can make a difference approach add the lack of any allied units were in france where are the french resistance and you have a rather mixed final messagethis isnt the greatest war film ever full metal jacket wins easily but its an unflinchingly moving movie which will often chill and occasionally scar it sometimes feels like a grown up indiana jones but omaha beach has to be seen to be believed you may not be the same person after,reality
like i said this is a movie just as good as titanic better actually but this is for men none of that romance stuff however spielberg is able to tell the story so great that you are moved to tears and the scene on omaha beach is some of the best action i have ever seen and i am a huge fan of schwarze negger all in all i have only seen one wwii better than this that was the famous dday,reality
the first time i saw this movie i thought i was going to get ill but it kept my attention i am only 12 years old and is my favorite movie the first thirty minutes of this movie were so powerful and graphic and that is what i like about this war movie oh yea i loved tom hanks performance i would highly recommend this movie for war movie fansthis movie is superb,reality
had an incredible beginning some of the greatest cinematography ive ever seen and much credit is due to this wonderful scene however the movie relies too much on this one aspect of the film if there was as much time spent on that first thirty minutes as in the rest of the film it would have been a true masterpiece i admit the ending picked up a little more but only in a few scenes the middle dragged and i hardly remember it now a lot of people are all talking about the great first thirty minutes and rightly so they are great but in ten years i can still only see this movie being remembered for its first thirty minutes and not the film as a whole,reality
all the other reviews have pretty much summed up how great a movie this is an instant classic so ill just add a few of my own thoughts this is a mustsee movie for a good theatre with good sound if you want to appreciate the battle sequences the surround sound puts you right in the middle of the battle with explosions all over the place and bullets whizzing by to the right and left see it in the theatre with the best sound system possible the dday sequence is one of the most brilliant movie sequences ever filmed this is spielbergs second greatest film schindlers list is still his most powerful and this is probably one of the best if not the best war films the only other one that comes close is full metal jacket which is more disturbing but not as comprehensive or as emotionally involving as far as the gore and violence its intense and brutal but is not nearly as bad as most gory horror films it doesnt even come close to the day of the deaddawn of the dead movies but its a completely different kind of violence its very real not fantasy or comicbook violence i think most 12year old kids can handle this and i think most boys 12 and up should see this film since it will show them a glimpse of what real violence looks like and maybe counteract the kind of stuff they see in armageddon and video games,reality
is the greatest movie ever  i cant believe there were 299 votes for it as a 1  you guys are crazy  if you dont like the movie because of the brutality then i feel sorry for you  watching it fills me with pride,reality
if this movie wins the oscar for best picture im never gonna watch the academyshow again i think it is a typical tom hanksmoviehe says maybe 10 linesand he is nominated for best actor im not saying that tom hanks is a bad actor i loved forrest gump and apollo 13 this movie is good but i think that the thin red line is a better warmovie the ratings for this movie is just 65 of 10,reality
i have never seen a motion picture that made such an impact on my senses emotions and my respect of all the other people who have served during a war spr was incredible in its scope of cinematography sound technical accuracy and how each of the actors portrayed their characters sure there will be some viewers who will not like spr for their own reasons but i believe most people will be glad they went to see it its a fictional story about a few us army soldiers during the normandy invasion and the mission they are given in my opinion this movie should get an oscar for best picture and possibly tom hanks for best actor i was impressed with his portrayal of capt miller he was very believable i say this because i have served with men like this but i am thankful i never had to go through what those men went though on the day or at any other time i would like to thank all those who helped keep this country great in its history i am proud beyond measure to be an american and i thank mr speilberg for bringing this story to the motion picture screen,reality
this movie made me realize how horrible war is and why it is important that we are never involved in another one  as always spielberg has presented us with such an exciting and involving picture that the experience will not soon be forgotten  there are some standout performances in this movie  tom hanks puts on an exceptional performance as capt john miller trying to keep his men alive as they engage in a mission that even he himself has trouble believing in  another great performance by a fine young actor named barry pepper as the talented sniper who quotes scripture as he disposes of his enemies  this film grabs a hold of you from the opening scene storming the beach and doesnt let go until the closing credits and beyond  about the highest endorsement i can give this movie is that my grandfather was in the wwii and he saw the film and said that it was as close to being in a war thathopefully i would ever get kudos to all involved in this amazing motion picture,reality
i agree that is a good movie mostly because to me it was able to show the horrors of war in a quite realistic way and how there are no heroes in fact for an american movie its strength was that it showed the grays not the black and whites and the first twenty minutes i sat watching as the lump in my throat grewbut why the presentpaststructure i think the message would have been brought across to me just as powerfully if it had been done in the past only without the manipulation of perspective without the dreadfully overthetop sentimental scene at the end at the cemetary without those frightfully unbelievable last words wouldnt he have thought about his wife maybe linked to that memory in the garden i couldve done without it and also without those glorious american flags that started and ended the moviewhy claim this war what i liked about it was that it was quite vague about all the different nationalities making it more of a general protest against war the american flags weaken that aspect other than that it couldve been a perfect and very powerful movie that makes me a postwar child respect all people whove experienced and survived war even more,reality
is a terrific movie and of course the opening battle sequence must be a one of a kind best ever kind of sequence   however i felt that at times it got a little overly sentimental especially at the very end that is the only reason i refrained from giving it a perfect ten,reality
is without a doubt the greatest war movie ever made not only has spielberg outdone himself he has outdone every war movie since never before have i seen a movie that is so powerful gutwrenching and brutal yeah the movie has flaws doesnt every other great movie the flaws in this movie are minor who cares about the framing sequence at the beginning spielberg was just setting us up for what was about to happen after that the movie picks up speed and never slows down the dday sequence is the best combat footage ever shot on film if that half hour doesnt affect in some way then youre crazy the way spielberg films it is amazing using hand held cameras to capture the terror and chaos that reigned on omaha beach that day the acting is superb tom hanks is a lock for his third academy award the supporting characters also do a great job tom sizemore as sarge jeremy davies as upham the end battle is also filmed superbly by spielberg not as intense as the beginning battle but a close second so to the people who thought this movie was overrated guess youre too much hooked on hamburger hill unlike that movie will be around for a veryveryvery long time congraulations mrspielberg second academy is definitely yours,reality
superb movie  harrowing realistic disturbing with just a touch of humour  one of the best movies ever  an excellent performance from all the cast especially tom hanks  deserves to win a bundle of oscars and other awards,reality
where do i even begin well maybe ill start by saying that this is the best movie ever made  i dont know how spielberg did it but this movie captures you like no other  maybe its his brilliant usage of handheld cameras but during the battle scenes you feel like youre there you feel like you are in the battle  veterans who saw the movie said that the only thing missing is the smell of gunpowdermany have criticized spielbergs use for making the movie so violent  they said the film is just too bloody  wrong  spielberg always trys to go for realism and thats exactly what he does  the film is gory because the war was gory  thats the way things happen on ddaythe film definitely deserves the oscar it is the most powerful piece of work ever put on the screen  can you honestly do any better,reality
this movie was the absolute best perfomance i have seen in a war picture the realism was constantly present throughout the entire picture a terrific job done by actor tom hanks,reality
it was two weeks before it came out and saw previews in the cinemas i was desperately wanting to see it so the first saturday of the opening week it came out i bought my tickets and ran to the best seat and started to wonder if it was all worth going all psycho about and let me tell you something yes it was i have never seen such a graphical movie like this besides say man bites dog see in the database personally i enjoyed very much i had some pros and cons to it though the pros were that it was long intense like on the battle of normandy scene was very disturbing yet it felt like you were there but the cons were that halfway through though i thought was a little bit yawnish but still i sat and enjoyed a wonderful tale of a group of soldiers searching for another soldier to take back home to his mother since his mother had 3 other brothers that died in the war too this is a type of movie that should be shown to schools worldwide but one thing i found amazing was the fact that there were old people in the cinema after the normandy scene they all left one was in a wheelchair and collapsed so i thought that the graphical scenes had to just pull you like a hand and take you into what was probably like in real life it is a must go see it 910,reality
i am almost 20 years old and i could not imagine myself being in the same position as other soldiers my age portrayed in this moviei own over 400 movies and have seen thousands and this is the first movie to actually change me  what i mean by this i feel like a better person just seeing it because it opened up my eyes to see who actually gave me what i have today  it showed me who the true heroes of this world are  not just this country but this world  if it werent for them i couldnt imagine what it would be like this film showed me respect for all veterans of all wars  you just have to respect every soldier in all wars because they are fighting in what they believe in although we might not agree with some of their viewsi would just like to to thank all veterans from the bottom of my heart and a special thanks to steven spielberg,reality
is the most uplifting movie i have seen in a long time i never felt better about being an american than at the end of the movie the scene where private returns to captmillers grave with his family and asks tell me i am all right tell me  i led a good life stirred me deeply all of us have a great debt to the privates and captain millers who fought in world war two and our countrys other wars i congratulate steven spielberg and the cast for reminding us of this in such a sensitive and touching way,reality
this movie accomplished the following a everyone should be obliged to view this superior film artifact b that being said i dont think ill go back to see it again since it was like being there and perhaps like some veterans i dont want to rush to return to the battlefieldthis summarizes how much this movie affected me  its a week after i saw it  and i can still feel it in my gutmakes you believe that those with war stories probably were not anywhere near the real battlefields  makes you believe that perhaps some of these people marching on july 4th are only representative of those who were really theremakes you want to search these noble veterans out and hug them and tell them thankyou while they are still on this earth to thanka movie that must been seen in the theater to experience the sound as well as the sightsdont wait for the tapeyoud be missing out on something that will change youthis film cannot be overexaggerated,reality
i cannot remember a film that created so many real emotions  when people asked if i liked it i cant say i liked it because the whole thing was so brutally realistic  however this is without question the best piece of filmmaking i have ever been priveleged to watch  do i want to see it again i dont think so  should everyone see it once  absolutely  i finally got a feel for the horror that is war  not what hollywood likes to present with a happy ending and the good guys dont die  it moved me more than any movie ive ever seen  and i watch a lot of movies on a scale of 110 10 being best its a 12,reality
after his selfimposed 5 year exile from film steven spielberg returns with a graphic account of world war two and eight mens mission to find one man the films beginning is one of the most realistic and drainingthat i have seen the us marines land on omaha beach to a constant barrage of fire from german troops on the cliffs its a truly graphic part of the film and one which holds your attention with masterful use of the camera a recurring piece of cinematic genius in the film is when the camera focuses on captain miller hanks and the sound is distorted its a terrible dreamlike moment of being as his face shows he cannot comprehend why he is there another scene is when sgt jackson barry pepper is attempting to shoot down a sniper which has already claimed the life of one of his comrades the shot is reversed and we see the view of the german snipershooter its a thrilling piece of cinema it is a film which underlines the futility and horror of war but also mixes in the humour which kept up the mens moral eg fubar and the bets they place on their captain telling them about himself a superb example of brilliant cinema,reality
steven spielberg my most respected filmmaker has just taken himself way above the rest by a million miles one can see the the passion and excellent story tellingdirection qualities of this film the audience feels as if they are a part of the action its documentarylook makes us believe it is real we perceive it to be real with the excellent and original style of camera work the high quality sound effects and the entire authenticity of the look and design in every way spielberg focuses on showing us the casualties of war  as if we were there and seeing helpless lives of people diminish in many disastrous ways in combat watch every detail of this film listen to all the sounds as you will actually feel like going through dday especially the last scenes as we wait for the nazi tiger tank to approach its deep engine sounds will make your stomach tremble as if it was the trex approaching this film is a master piece of film work  a milestone in film making email mirageworldnet,reality
my sympathies to the authors of the few comments critical of this film you are not alone the legion of fans this movie has accumulated seem to treat its detractors like martiansthe film is hysterically overrated and even the omaha beach sequence isnt all its cracked up to be as someone who has seen a lot of italian horror movies the graphic violence didnt affect me some might think the comparison is inappropriate but this is a movie after all not actual battle footage critics droning on about the realistic authentic truetolife depiction of the horrors of war are responding more to the dreamworks press kit than to the film itself since i cant imagine many walked out of the theater thinking to themselves thats exactly how i remember wwiiregarding spielbergs teachings on the horrors of war a subject so wellcovered in movies it sounds like a cliche its nothing you cant get from scores of other films from directors like ford aldrich coppola lean stone etc and youre better served by most of them id especially suggest stanley kubricks paths of glory or almost any of sam fullers wwii or korean war films the only thing spr has on any of them is gorethe drama between the type characters is hackneyed and hollow john williams score is slopped on like emotional fingerpainting and the politics are infantile and shallow the action sequences are ok but not as good as the last indiana jones movie spielbergs most original wwii film remains 1941,reality
usually im pretty reluctant to see movies at a friends recommendation theyre so built up by the time i actually see them and im rather disappointed  however there is no way that anyone can be prepared for the effects of this film and i was certainly not disappointed  there is no way that anyone can accurately describe what this movie containsthe people it portrays the senses and sounds it illustrates and the emotions that it evokes  it is true that this film is frighteningly realistic its certainly not for the faint of heart  however it is still only a film and it delivers only a mere fraction of what our veterans experienced in the horrors of battle  this is one of the most horrifying yet fascinating and moving films that i have ever seen in my lifeis a very emotionally disturbing movie in terms of seeing the too real horrors of war on the silver screen because hollywood is usually shiny happy and perfect  in a way its a bit ironic that something so horrible can appear in such compact form  its not supposed to be real and its supposed to comfort usisnt that what show business is about  this movie didnt do that  i almost became ill at some of the scenes  merely sitting in an airconditioned theatre with dolby digital surround sound watching this film was a bit nerveracking i must say imagine what real war must be likewhile watching this movie i felt sickened with paralyzing fear at the thoughts of war being wounded and dying in battle in my minds eye i imagined my friends and i in the same situation  i simply couldnt fathom it nor will i ever  i thank the powers that be for the men and women who did suffer through those battles  i thank the men and women who died for me who died for my family and who died for my friends  i thank the soldiers who serve today who keep the rest of us safe so that we dont have to go into battle ourselvesits films like that give me a hundred times more respect for the armed forces  this is the film that gives us a glimpse of what we normally dont see or experience  this is the film everybody should see to gain insight into how lucky we civilians really are  this is the film about horrifying truth and enlightening respect and understanding i guess thats what hollywood can be about toothank youpiriyaminister of propagandaand praise will come to those whose kindness leaves you without debt and bends the shape of things to come that havent happened yet  neil finn,reality
the single greatest movie ever made everyone should see this movie to realize what wwii veterans had to go through to make this country what it is it is a very powerful and intense movie,reality
is one of the most talked and written about movies of the last decade and i felt i had to share with the world what i think about this motion picturelet me start by telling you that from the moment i left the theatre i knew that this movie would haunt me for some time and i was right steven spielberg has really pushed the envelope of filmmaking for the years to come with a style and courage which is becoming his trademark who else had the guts to make a disaster movie about a seven foot fish or shoot a big studio production in black and whitethe opening scene is often called brilliant but had little to do with the rest of the movie i believe those 24 minutes were as essential to the movie as sound is those 24 minutes showed us that the men who surrvived that torment to tell the rest of the story could only do so not because they where brave or skilled but because they where plain lucky every single scene after that sequence was covered with a blanket of dreadfulness never to be sure whos nextthen the story about the men to some they werent very convincing i believe that they were supported with enough information to give an audience with a bit of imagination the tools to fillin the blanks its not king lear we are looking at but regular joes the kind you would sit next to on a bus and never care to notice as in fact the same kind of people who saved my country  thats why i dont have a problem with the american flag waving at the closing scene its not a patriotic gesture but a pale witness of unnecessary loss of good men men like our grandfathers fathers and brothers,reality
im so sick and tired of reading peoples criticism about the last battle have you ever heard the simple truth that defending territory is easier than conquering it  its absolutely true in all facets of life  its no different in this case  even when the americans prevailed in the end it wasnt hanks and crew that delivered the decisive blow  it was the p51 tankbuster airplanethis movie is classic from start to finish  you cant walk away unaffectedi also feel the criticism saying the bookend cemetery scenes was unnecessary is crap  i thought those scenes provided intro and the proper closure to the filmi know that the first time i watched the movie i was wondering who the old man in the beginning wasin the end i feel this is one of if not the best film ive ever seen its hard for me to understand the logic behind contrary beliefs,reality
film has never captured the grand invasion with such accuracy and detail never has the near defeat of the allies on the beaches of normandy been so graphically and accurately portrayed every actor gave a performance equating the actual performance of the real soldiers in this great endeavor the accuracy of detail is unsurpassed in cinema if anyone wants to know something about the horror of war if they think there is honor a glory in war this movie is a must see,reality
the subjective viewpoint of this film gives it a power we can only imagine from reading about war spielbergs use of experimental shutters in his cameras his use of bleached and muted color and a masterful sound mix recreate the shock and utter hellishness of combat the audience is put in the center of the action and knows what it is like to experience omaha beach on june 6 1944 and the fighting across normandy in the weeks aftercasting is superb each and every actor in this film is utterly perfect from tom hanks through the veteran harve presnell in a powerful cameo appearance the scenes of presentday visiting the cemetery cause me to appreciate anew the sacrifices of my fathers generation do i prize highly enough what was done so i might inhabit this world free of hitler and his nazi evil god help me i hope i dothe screenplay brilliantly introduces elements at perfectly timed intervals to underscore the physical emotional and mental suffering war inflicts  it is the demon face of wari ask my british cousins to not feel neglected or slighted in any way by this film the storys focus is on americans in normandy june 615 1944 it could have been a movie about british canadian or free french forces but it is not it in no way diminishes overlooks or ignores british or other allied contributions and  sacrifices without which victory certainly would not have been accomplishedsteven spielberg deserves the thanks of every one on this planet for so clearly defining the central issues of war in general and specifically what is arguably the defining moment of the twentieth century world war ii let the oscar balloting reflect spielbergs contribution to the world and to the motion picture industry,reality
the dozen or so american soldiers were able to take out so many germans was because they a had the element of surprise on their side b knew the terrain of the battle field chad a preconcieved plan of attack  although the germans probably had a few more years fighting experience the americans were also not without experience  remember at that point in the war the americans had been in the thick of it for a couple years too  the scenario of a small number of troops fighting well against a larger army has been repeated numerous times throughout history  i see no reason to think the final scene was all too unbeliveable,reality
is an interesting film as far as basis in fact goes this movie rests on the truthful scale somewhere between titanic and star wars about the only thing spielberg got right was the fact that there was a war going on at the time he owes both the niland and sullivan families very sincere apologies for butchering what he originally claimed was their true storyi had a harder time judging this movie on a reality scale in some ways the movie was very gripping and realistic but in other ways spielberg failed miserably in spielbergs wwii there were two groups of people the horrible murdering nazis and the good ol boys of the us i may be biased because i currently reside in canada but i know that there were probably just as many canadian not to mention british and others troops roaming around during wwii i admit they did do a tolerable job on the wwii ambience but did very poorly on creating a realistic military environmentwas a good movie and well worth every penny it cost to see eight times in the theater eight different groups of friends but i wouldnt laud it as a fabulous war film nor would i use it to teach military history as some schools are considering doing there were two things that really hurt the movie 1 spielbergs hollywoodization of the film and his insistance on hiring overaged bigname actors 2 spielbergs insistance until recently that was a true story spielberg would have done better hiring some relatively unknowns and making clear the film was fiction it may have just been me but seeing matt damon as private made me wish they had just left him there matt damon was the hollywood heartthrob after good will hunting and it was so obvious it was spielbergs way of pulling in the teen crowd i was surprised he didnt hire the dicaprio boywasnt the best film of the year but it was by no means the worst i recommend it to anyone over 18 who is looking for an entertaining hardhitting way to pass three hours the scenes on the beach really are well done and excellently written makes it easy to overlook the mistakes and while the movie does drag at times its worth taking a looksee i would not suggest allowing children to see this movie because many of the scenes are highly graphical and highly disturbing i have no plans on letting my children see this film until theyre old enough to understand that film isnt reality and that is just as fictional as most war films g i jane courage under fire etc if military films are a real interest i would suggest either adaptation of the thin red line it is more realistic than and as opposed to the fictional the thin red line has a high basis in fact,reality
the bottom line is this is not a work of art in any capacity  i enjoy spielbergs work most of the time especially in genres that people generally treat with disrespect such as scifi jurassic et and action indiana jones movies so im not some guy trying to put down a successful director  and im not antipatriotic by any means either  i just dont think it takes a movie with some blood to make me realize that war is badgood art has an implicit meaning from which you can learn something  this film has an explicit meaning war is bad and all those who go out to see the big famous movie take for granted that it must be good because its about america and how war is bad which is of course a very powerful message that younger people might not understand  its a sad fact that americans dont understand art anymore and the popularity of this trash is proof,reality
this is by far the most incredible movie ive ever seen  i hope to see it many more times as well  i also suggest that you see it if you havent already  the first 15 to 30 minutes are some of the most gruesome and realistic moments of a war movie that ive ever seen  so be warned those who cant take much or any blood and gore should be wary about the first bit of the movie  but if you can get through that its an incredible movie,reality
well ive just been leafing through all of these comments about and its apparent that many of you know a great deal more about moviemaking than i do as an avidmoviegoer i really want only two things from any picture a good story and good acting this movie has both congratulations go primarily to mr spielberg and to mr hanks,reality
now almost 24 hours removed from seeing spr i still get a little choked up i have several veterans in my family and until yesterday i hadnt really though about all the sacrifices they made for our country  i always loved them and appreciated their service in wwii korea vietnam but it had always been a vague idea what their experience was like i dont know anyone who was on the shores of normandy on june 6 1944 but id be surprised if sprs depiction was significantly different until yesterday memorial day was always just a 3day weekend for me  i dont know if would have been brave enough to handle the carnage i saw yesterday i know i hope i never have to find out some jerk sitting by me was laughing through the movie and calling characters wimps etc  i was unable to get over the irony of real people dying 50 years ago to defend this idiots right to see a movie depicting that struggle but thats freedom and today its not just an untangible idea for me  today i feel free,reality

the first 30 min are worst  you can almost feel what these soldiers must have gone through even though people told me that it was terrible i was almost shocked by the openingthe end however is very typical american and thats why i couldnt bring myself to give the movie 10 pointsbut its a very good film and steven spielberg has done a wonderful jobi liked it because of the actors and the story but the end is too american to me,reality
i was fortunate enough to see this movie during the second release it was my great misfortune to miss the first one  you must see this movie in the theater to get the full impact of itmy uncle who is a wwii veteran and who was also present during the dday invasion has gained a whole new level of respect from me this man has few words to say about the war and after seeing this movie he needs not say more  that is how realistic graphic intense this movie was,reality
the cappella sistina of michelangelo is esteemed the most beautiful masterpiece of the western art of every times this work of art represents what of most perfect a man will never able to carry out with a paintbrush and colors of spielberg will be esteemed the most beautiful masterpiece of the war movies of every times this work of art represents what of most perfect touching involving a man will never able to carry out with a camera and actors it will make history,reality
cmon lets face it whoever said steven speilberg was the greatest second unit director was right  the man undoubtedly is  there are huge scenes in both schindlers list and in this picture which no one could have captured in such a beautifully emotionally real and startling way  but what the hell is with the framing of this story  we have a film that as any good war film should brings up challenging questions about the motivations and morals of war  and granted it is the auteurs privelege to hint subtly at what he believes the right answers to those questions might be  but please please dont hit us over the head so you can make the ending neat  everything always has to wrap up so nicely with speilberg that you wonder where all that realism went  if he thinks we were mature enough to handle the intense violence of the opening thirty minutes then why cant we also be mature enough to decide for ourselves and grapple a bit with the ideas presented whether or nots life was worth it to see the first and last five minutes of this movie is to understand why this film does not deserve the oscar everyone so absently wants to give it call me bitter but id rather watch the longest day anyday of the week over this,reality
this is the best movie ive seen this year so far  i cant describe just how great this movie is  from the first scene in the beaches of normandy to the final confrontation the movie is a tourdeforce on the terrors of war  the battle scenes have an authenticity and intensity never before seen in film and you ask yourself what could possibly lead men to slaughter each other in such a horrible manner  steven spielberg proves hes a grand master of directors and tom hanks and company also did a great job in the acting department  when i was watching this movie in the theater an old man sat beside me  he had a purple star in his shirt  then when the movie was over everyone got out in silence as if catatonic  and the first thing i see when i get out into the lobby is the old man and his wife hugging and crying  thats how powewrful this film is,reality
i have watched this movie i think its really great for the special effects and thechinkling chinkling bang of bullet shells i agree of what our friend from egypt explained about the error scene of a soldier jewish who teased the jerry with the star and an unlucky death of him these scenes are strange moment also during that war america has to show the respect to all who involved wwii british and canada who involved in that invasion as well but where are they but anyway iam still enjoying this brilliant movie 8510,reality
im writing here almost out of desperation i seem to be the only one left in the world that didnt really like and although the other comments here were encouraging i still feel slightly at a difference with them because i didnt dislike the movie because of its cinematic defects  i just disliked it because of the message it sent about warnow ive been told that im being too hard on spielberg after all is supposedly less enthusiastic and glorifying about war than any previous movie i would beg those of this persuasion to reexamine their opinion of apocalypse now but i cant condone this trumpeting of a movie which concludes with a shot of the american flag waving in the sun as being a new representation of warwar isnt about nobility but is war is about dirt and sweat and blood and tears and futility its about dehumanization and loss there are no men in war who want to reward a mrs with the gift of the only son shes got left only men who want to claim strategic postselements of these things sometimes appear in but they disappear again in favour of a closeup of tom hanks sadbutsurviving facial expression or an old frail man standing proud at a war grave any attempt at reality is then lostthe performances are good  but everyone seems to be tripping over each other to appear the most ordinary although this was probably an attempt at allowing the viewer to identify the soldier with the boynextdoor it ends up sacrificing character depth in favour of surface considerationsall of this is not to say that is awful and could even be called a step in the right direction the movie has a good premise and hits some strong notes  especially in the strange conjecture of risking the lives of five men to find one the problem is like all war movies to date it tries to make sense out of what is happening to the people onscreen give them a goal a purpose and it will seem like the horror that was was a horror that had to bethe problem is that in doing that fails to say anything we havent heard before its not that i dont believe good things can happen in war  its just that i dont believe only good things can happen and with cinema failed once again to take that stance,reality
the graphic ugly realistic depiction of violence in sets this film apart from all other war movies  there is no glory in killing and dying herebut there is much more to than just us versus the enemy  the film asks what is the groups responsibility to the individual  what is the individuals responsibility to the group  what price is too high to pay in fulfilling these responsibilities  spielberg in his film does not supply the answers  if there are answers it is left to the audience to come up with them,reality
like someone i forget who wrote in i cant wait to see this again when it reopens on february 5  except for the last scene at the cemetery which was unnecessary i cant think of a film thats moved me more all year  the fact that its been coming under heavy criticism is yet another demonstration that a vocal minority of people have a bug up their a when it comes to steven spielberg and thats sad and shameful  if he hadnt directed this film it would get unanimous acclaim as the best film of the year  but people cant handle that the man who made et and raiders of the lost ark would make a serious film about the horrors of war  for those who say its powerful battle scenes at the beginning and end and nothing but cliches in between i say hogwash  is it a cliche when tom hanks character is screaming at one of his soldiers not to save a child  ignore all the spielberg bashers and if you havent seen it yet see it and if you have see it again,reality
i liked this film from top to bottom  i have to disagree with other reviewers and there have been many who claim the film is overly patriotic in tone  have they noticed that the american flag shown at the beginning and end of the film looks washed out almost bled down  im sure this is no accident  i felt that there was a message in that curiously colorless flag i somehow knew the instant that flag was shown that there were some bad things to come   it said to me that patriotism is a little hollow in light of the fearsome carnage that people are put through in a war  as for the flag being american well it was an american beach and the choice of the us symbol is entirely appropriate  i would expect the maple leaf on juno or the union jack on sword or gold beaches this movie isnt really about dday in a grand sense anywayi also disagree with those who say the bookends boy do they love that term with the old man at the beginning and end are unnecessary  maybe its just me but his reaction doesnt seem overly dramatic in light of what transpires for him in this story and other things that happened to many people for real  the thing of it is it seemed absolutely necessary to point the finger squarely at this generation of people  we have a bad habit of shrugging off or even never bothering to learn what it meant to live through those days and times  theyre old men now they look a lot like that old man in the film  shouldnt the mantle rest on their shoulders  be honest now arent you glad it was theirs and not yours to bear  give credit where credit is due  i think that this is a specific american story aimed at everyone everywhere  not an american story aimed at only americans  i would dearly love to see an honest treatment of the horrors of the eastern front for both the germans and the russians and the hordes of desperate souls trapped between them  now that would be graphic,reality
im only a teenager so i never experienced wwii i have of course studied the war in school however i never really understood the impact and terror the men went through everyone warned me of the first 20 mins but i never thought they would be that intense the movie was three hours and i cried through the entire three hours all young people should go see this so they can get a feel for what these brave young men gave up for the country,reality
when a film like hereafter spr is released too often people focus more upon the film itself than the message that it carries spr is a brilliantly filmed marvelously executed story but it is not a perfect film  no movie could ever be perfect and please everyone  i will not deny that the flaws many have pointed out here are not present  but i disagree that those flaws render the movie less impactful or important this was a film that needed to be made because if one can look beyond the film itself to the message that it delivers i believe that this film shows better than any other the terrible futility of warfare and the fundamental endurance of the human spirit against all odds spr is ultimately an allegory  the story of eight men sent out to find one stranger in the midst of hell on earth is not what is important  yes it is unbelievable that a situation like this which defies all logic could actually occur  but nothing about war is logical  this is proved so brilliantly through speilburgs film  take for example the scene where mellisch fights the nameless german soldier in handtohand combat  it is perhaps one of the most brutal fighting sequences ever filmed and in its brutality speilburg is showing us just how insane war can become  this situation as is pointed out repeatedly throughout the film is fubar  it defies all attempt to be processed rationally  why should eight men be forced to risk their lives to save one  why should eight hundred or eight thousand or eight million risk their lives fighting in a war to save the lives of civilians total strangers  we are all indebted to these men  we are all in a sense private by allowing us to view warfare through the eyes of the ordinary gis who fought and died speilburg is giving us as civilians a window into the hellish nightmare that is modern warfare  it is a gift of sorts  the chance to experience what those who sacrificed their lives for us went through  i for one am deeply grateful that these men found it in themselves to transcend themselves and risk everything so that i could be born in a country that is free  not only is this a powerfully patriotic film for americans it also carries a message for humanity as a whole  we must as a species consider the costs of warfare and decide whether another such sacrifice is necessary,reality
is the best film of 1998  why  it is the most accurate description that anyone living today will ever see of world war ii combat it is visceral it is gut wrenching and it was real  what we are exposed to in was a meat grinder and thats what the soldiers on omaha beach faced that day  spielberg throws us into the melee and we are there we get to feel the dread as the boats come ashore  we hear the pounding bass of mortar rounds as they roar in from above and we feel the fear that the soldiers feel  we dont know whats waiting for us on that beach and when those doors open we step into hellthe camera work during this sequence is amazing  you are disoriented and you dont know where the fire is coming from  you try to make it to cover as machine gun bullets tear into the beach and your fellow soldiers  mortar rounds deafen you as they explode a few feet away and you watch in a numb horror as you see friends vanish before your eyes  thats what war is pure and simple  no time for thoughts on what the nature of god is or any of that metaphysical junk youre just thinking am i going to livelets us see what it was like to be a soldier in wwii we get to know each of the soldiers under tom hanks command  we feel the loss of their lives because spielberg invests time with these men  we feel their anger and resentment toward  why is he so special  why does he get the ticket home and we get to stay here  the more time we spend with these men the more we know them  when they finally find our view of him changes  hes not just some punk that the top brass sent us out to find hes a soldier  hes one of us and well do everything in our power to get him out aliveyou want a meditation on the nature of war and man and what god is  watch the thin red line and have your butt numbed  you want an experience that will linger with you for days  watch then ask your grandparents about wwii  see what they say,reality
this is a monumental film as proof of that claim i offer two points to ponder firstly look at the number of user comments on this site few other films contained herein have inspired such a reaction good or bad it makes no difference people simply do not take the time or effort to make so many comments on a film of minor importance secondly the comments made represent just about every opinion and point of view conceivable many movies on this site are referred to as both the best and worst films ever made by the people who send in their comments usually those opinions display a number of recurring themes and tend to form a pattern not so for spr the comments ive read run the full spectrum of criticisms some of them highly contradictory only a truly monumental film can garner this type and degree of reaction and draw such a diverse response from so many some of the greatest films ever made have continued to be controversial for long periods after their release 2001a space oddysey is a good example its still loved hated and misunderstood by hordes of people love spr or hate it it appears to bear the same stamp of indefinability,reality
the thing that hit me the most after seeing this movie was the way that the audience upon the turning on of the theater lights simply rose as one and walked silently out of the theater  not more than a word was said and i think thats the best compliment anyone can give this movie  out of all the teenagers and genxers that were in the theater not one of us felt compelled to speak after watching this  i can say that the opening sequence hit me harder than anything i have ever witnessed in my albeit short life i found myself wrapping my arms around my knees trying to hide my eyes but unable to avoid the horror unfolding on the screen  i actually felt like somehow i was in danger  the horror i felt as the soldiers stepped out of the boats into the gunfire was gutwrenching  all the movies we watch in school all the history channel specials dont even touch what this movie touched honestly  i never realized the horror of what dday and this war was until i saw this movie  it took it out of the abstract and forced those of us who have never had to live through a real war to see it as they did it makes me want to thank every one of the men who were in this war for what they sacrificed for those of us who live here now  i dont know if i would be strong enough to handle it and i hold as my heroes anyone who wasabout the movie in itself i actually thought the scenes at the beginning and end were touching  a bit too theatrically staged definitely but i thought it was a nice beginning and end for the movie  the battle scenes enough said  phenomenal  the one and only criticism i have is that i think the script was a little weak in its character development  i had a hard time really feeling for the characters and i think that maybe the battle scenes were emphasized so much that we lost who the men really were  its hard to develop characters while the audience is concentrating on gunfire however this was an excellent excellent movie definitely a 9 out of 10,reality
the opening and closing battle scenes are among best ive ever seen yet the war torn cliches sandwiched in between are major detraction points as is the films hypocrisy and the character himself one of the worst written characters since jack dawson told rose of his bohemian days overall quite powerful stuff and the cast all except ed burns is spectacular,reality
i cant understand that someone dislikes this movie in my country you still hear the stories of this bloody war and i assure you  it was one living hellso if you cant stand a realistic movie that tells us exactly how it happened maybe you should read batman comics instead,reality
is one of the best war films ever made simply because of its refusal to leave anything to the imagination  nothing in this film is ambiguous supported by vehement images of dismembering and dying whereas water drops hit the camera lens in another movie blood splatters all over it in this one  the first 24 minutes are shot confusingly using shaky handheld camera motion ground level angle shots numerous soldiers povs as well as expert cinematography creating a newsreel footage feel gritty and fast  the war is chaotic and anything but fun dialogue in this movie is succint and to the point  most of the characters exhibit their emotions merely by staring emaciated into the camera   spielberg has created a graphic candid image of war something unparalled but highly controversial  many people argue that some things should be left lightly without gratuity to get the poignant purpose across as well as many of the themes however spielberg must let the audience identify with the characters their fears and their insanity  the human stories are bettered by the horrific images  when they lose it we dont question them  i dont question spielberg either for taking a great story and providing it with vivid visuals,reality
im waiting for the second run of spr so i can see it for a third time this is not to say i loved this film or consider it to be the great masterpiece so many have overhyped it to be i happen to love historical epics and wwii is my favorite history subject along with the rarity of this type film these days makes it the more desirable for me to view i do concur with all the rave about the opening beach landing being an intense aweinspiring film experience however the remaining two plus hours of the film are quite ordinary and only the exciting battle at the conclusion of the film rescues spr from being a dull disappointment i also find the battle at the end of the film to be a contradiction to the opening battle and confuses the whole message  in the first battle we are in the middle of massive carnage and gore and get the feel of being pinned down and what its like to fear moving an inch and being killed but if you dont move you will be killed anyway there is no false heroics only desperate men trying to stay alive and do their job this better than any battle ive seen on film convinces me that i dont want any part of combat and there is nothing glorious about it and those that endured through it deserve our greatest admiration and respect which i believe is the primary message in the film  the conclusion however resembles the rousing old adventure war films of the past  capt miller has found and has orders to bring him back to be sent home and this is his mission but instead he is talked into defending an important bridge by who doesnt want to abandon his comrades we are then treated to an exhilarating battle that does not nearly match the terror and gore of the first and all the old wwii movie clichs start to show up the rock hard sergeant who feels no pain no matter how many times he is shot and his honorable loyalty to his men refusing to go home without having to risk his life any longer and of course the cavalry saving the day at the end when all appears lost  i have a problem with films today dealing with war in that they go out of there way to try and convey too many messages as i believe there is a fear that its no longer politically correct or acceptable to make a war film for the sake of entertainment  i do believe there have been some great war films with a message such as paths of glory and go tell the spartans and others but there have been far too many that try too hard to preach war is hell and so on and spr is one of them im not ashamed to say that i prefer films like the longest day and where eagles dare as they are more entertaining and far more successful at what they are trying to be no film today tomorrow or a hundred years from now will ever convey the horror of war or will impact societys view of war alone  twenty years from now some other war film will come along and spr will seem tame in comparison but it will still just be a movie like spr is   i went to see spr for the action and my wwii interest and was compelled only by those two things not the weak story line or pretentious messages and syrupy drama spr is a good film because of two great action pieces that hold up the long message laden middle and if it wasnt for the cliched conclusion and simply returned to the rear this film would not be seen by as many people who would have been disappointed by a anticlimactic non action conclusion which is the primary reason people view war films to see combat action not be preached at about how horrible war is ,reality
ok ok you say this film is full of cliches and platoon is the best ive seen platoon and ive seen other war movies and no one has touched me more than spielbergs masterpiece spr and why because when i watched the others i was just watching when i went to the movies to see spr i was there i could feel the war in me i could feel all that human strength fighting against something they did not even knowcliche ill tell you what is a cliche in a war movie the man is shot and in slow motion camera he cries and falls on the ground his friends stop to look at him and the bullets stop to be shot to them the dying man says please tell my girlfriend i love her i wanted to have been a better man i wanted to and he dies at this moment the viewers eyes are full of tears and the director of this movie has done what he wanted to make the viewer cry in a classic war scene in spielbergs spr the same scene happens like this the man is shot in real motion camera he cries falls on the ground and doesnt stop crying looking at his body drowning blood everywhere desperated unable to think about her girlfriend only one thing passes through his mind im gonna die he cries it his friends stop to look at him and are  shot too some lose a leg some just a foot others an arm and the scene left the viewer shocked and sure that that is war that is realof course mr spielberg committed his mistakes in this movie as anyone commits in any other film the opening scene the old man is unnecessary just as the final one the american flag should be filmed after all spielberg is a patriot too but why forget canada france and england flags r the americans the only saviors of the world and at last the stereotyped german why not choose a german with a family with integrity honor why must they always be bad im sorry to say it to someone so closedmind as robert rodat but in a war you dont fight against one german you fight against a country that german could be gene kelly singing in the rain but he would still be an enemy so why make him badif you see the mistakes committed in this movie r not spielbergs they r from the screenplayer the writer i dont think spr deserves the oscar for best screenplay but spielberg is the best director and spr does deserve the title of best 1998 movie if not as academy is so imprevisible and unjust to s spileberg may people at least make this film eternal eternal as the remembrances of the worst tragedy men could live in this century wwar ii,reality
every american especially the younger generations has an obligation to see this movie for the sole purpose of having an appreciation of what american soldiers and any veteran from any nation can and did go through to preserve the freedom of their country  remember this movie on dedicated holidays like memorial day and veterans day,reality
i was taken to this movie by my 79yrold grandfather a world war ii veteran who had read the reviews declaring this movie to be based on a true story and a truly epic movie about wwii he couldnt wait to see this movie that was heralded by spielberg and others as a bonafide docudrama a true story based on a young man in wwii who lost three brothers to death behind enemy lines and the most stunning war movie to ever hit hollywoods silver screenboth he and i were shocked by the brutal reality of the scenes on the beach that was truly amazing cinematography and imagery by spielberg sure both he and i noticed the many unrealistic aspects of even these scenes minor errors in small details but my grandfather said those scenes were closer to the reality than any movie had come yetbut both my grandfather a veteran and retired military historian and i a hobby historian noticed the movie soon changed while the movie was without a doubt strong with feeling an imagery the realism is soon gone the soldiers are out of character the special effects overdone and the military equipment particularly the tiger tanks usedreferenced incorrect the worst part was that this movie heralded as a true story didnt have enough truth in it to fill an eyedropperthis movie was not however a failure spielberg did an excellent job at creating a fictitious storyline that almost seems like it was real and then used the hollywood glitz and glamour to create his version of wwii this movie is extremely well done for a war movie and well worth watching as long as the viewer remembers two important things 1 this movie is not real 2 this movie is not a true story there was no pvt this movie is extremely loosely based on the losses of two families in wwii  the nilands who lost two of their four sons one was mia and later found and the other wandered around in enemy territory for 18 days before finding his way back to camp and being told he was being sent home and the sullivans who lost all five of their sons in a 1942 loss at sea for more on those five watch the film the sullivans neither situation involved what was seen in the filmthis movie should be rated on three separate scales the only true rating for this movie can be on its ability to entertain and hold the viewers interest nine out of ten by both my grandfather and i for its rating on realistically portraying the general conditions on wwii it measures about a six and a half and on its realism as far as based on a true story this movie deserves a zero because it is entirely fictionaliseddefinitely see this movie but if youre looking for realism in a 1998 war film check out the thin red line both its storyline and its basic cinematography is more realistic and true it is only for true war buffs though  the movie rates high for both realism and truth but fairly low for entertainment value because of malicks attempt at keeping it realistic,reality
id like to say amen to allan14s comment  this movie is supposed to be a tribute to those who fought in war by showing the rest of us ignorant people what war is like  i know you cant actually get there with a movie but it made me not want to partake in the real thing  and it gave me a whole new respect for those who have had the real thing,reality
to me is more than the greatest war film ever  it was an experience that has left an indelible mark on my psyche  and im sure it would do the same for most who see itthis film opens our eyes and makes us truly aware of the utter brutality and nightmare that is war  people who see this film should realize that war is nowhere near glorious in fact it shows us that war should be the last thing that any of us even hawks would want to experiencei came away from this film with a new respect and appreciation for those people who actually experienced combat like that seen in this film  i cant believe they had the will to do anything more than curl up in a fetal position and simply wait for the fighting to end before movingin short this film does something that needs to be done more oftenit deglorifies war but glorifies the courage exhibited by anybody thats ever put on a uniform and fought for their countryeverybody should see this film  either to appreciate the heroism it takes just to stand on a battlefield let alone fight on it  or to reconsider their thoughts when confronted about the prospect of warthank you mr spielberg for opening our eyes,reality
one cannot see this movie without gaining a new appreciation for what world war ii was like  todays hightech weapons make it easy to think real people are not involved or affected  it aint like that at all  as a vietnam vet i have vivid images of the horror of war but i still never fully appreciated the magnitude of loss that was faced by the young kids during dday  thank you mr spielberg for giving us a glimpse of what war is really likeevery year each us citizen should see this film  just before veterans day would be an excellent time   every day we should reflect on the freedoms we have and too often take for granted and thank our veterans for the sacrifices that made freedom a reality,reality
its realistic its gritty its interestingsure  its just not that interesting to me  i dont think its nearly as good as platoon which i consider to be the best war film ever,reality
again spielberg outdid himself in making a movie as real as possible this movie is very well directed and the realism is fantastic i guess i was the only person who didnt think the opening dday scene was as gory as i had heard the drama in this movie wasnt good at all i was laughing at the end of this movie when everyone else was crying does this make me demented no i just believe that this movie is much overrated and that the world loves tom hanks so much that this movie exceeds the ratings it should get i thought the opening scenes where the only thing to watch here so that people can respect what happened in wwii during dday the rest of this movie can be thrown to the dogs because frankly its just another movie with tom hanks face oh yes and we cant forget that matt d guy either everyone loves him too,reality
the battle scenes outstanding the bits in between not as satisfying what price a tarantino to sharpen up the banter of fighting men who are questioning their mission and wanting to live and simply return intact to the bronx or cows bum idaho or montreal or glasgow or adelaide or hamburgthe most touching scene in the whole movie was not the final scene at the cemetery take 1 message apply it with a hammer  add 1 american flag just to make sureno the scene that affected me most was the death of the jewish soldier almost gently put to sleep by his sworn german enemy in the room religiously peaceful in the midst of battle at the same time the communications corporal responsible for that germans life lay stricken on the stairs a few metres away unable to bring himself to help,reality
i have to disagree with the idea that is an anti war movie let alone the best ever it was well shot and in parts well acted but i found it repulsively right wing when the good guys get shot they die painful deaths but when the evil germans also human too mr spielberg also with families get shot they fall over like cardboard cut outs the one german who we get a close look at turns out to be a callous cowardly pig who will happily lie to escape and then shoot the man who showed him respect moral never trust a germantom hanks was miscast his character should not have been there tom sizemore would have made a much better lead cut out the sentiment it was cloying and pointless also there was the deliberate misleading scene at the beginning old man sees tombstone and thinks back back back to the beaches where he suddenly becomes tom hanks well we know he doesnt die then because he was the one at the beginning oh how clever he was really that flag waving at the beginning was almost a joke even capra would have balked at that drop the prologue and epilogue please it was dire tell me im a good man the whole finding the wrong bit was guff and a waste of time too because we all knew dopey matt damon was on that subject brave refuses to leave his boys but when the shooting starts what does he do crouch down and start crying surely a coward like him would have jumped ship at the first opportunity another big mistake was casting ted danson the whole cinema said ooh its ted danson in a wig in unison next up at that point could well have been a madonna cameo as edith piaf in a dream sequencethe opening battle sequence was some of spielbergs best work since jaws without a doubt great cinema but what was the point it bore no relation to the story and was not anti war either it was anti being shot portraying the horrors of being blown up war was not condemmed the question of soldiers on both sides being unwitting pawns was never raised and the film was totally lacking a moral centre war was a matter of the good people overcoming the bad people and if that meant killing them with no remorse anyone in the film troubled by the horror then it was done in the name of the right wing unfortunately  by making the opening so realistic spielberg has succeeded in passing the whole thing off as history so another generation of americans and anyone else who has not studied history will think that the war between america and germany started in 1941 would it have been too much trouble to include some british french or any other european soldiers and correct me if im wrong but im sure there were black soldiers in wwii but i must have missed them in this filmyes i left the cinema angry angry that such a good opportunity was wasted with pro american revisionist flag waving claptrap and if tom hanks gets another oscar for being wet and dying then i will handing mine back to the academy,reality
a quote from a book easily comes to mind amounts of boredompunctuated by moments of sheer terror star wars rogue squadron by michael a stackpoledont get me wrong  the opening was an eyeopener and absolutely stunning and tom hanks was brilliant but the parts in between the battles like the scene when the team is resting in the church was boring and personally i dont think that military brass would concern themselves with one soldier out of millions who were dying in the most brutal war in history they would be more concerned with trying to win the war,reality
regardless of whether you like war films or are against violence on film the first twenty minutes of this film are incredible  it lets us realize why it is important to remember our past honor those who fought for our respected countries and why under any means necessary nations should aim for peace above all else  with i have newfound respect for spielberg as a film maker the fighting scenes show that no man is a hero and no man is above any other  the camera the action the effects etc left the audience speechless  hopefully this film will open up peoples eyes to realize that remembrance day is more than just wearing a poppy in canada that is or watching veterans gather together,reality
i belive it is wrong of us to depict the average german soldier as being evil  i imagine each soldier as being a man  that is enough  both sides of this struggle were only men,reality
is one of the best war movies that i have ever seen from the opening scenes on dday to the finale at american bridgehead the movie never lost a beat in its portrayal of the american fighting men  what i liked about the movie was its simplicity of message  it attempts to historically document a time in history without much of the underlying political messages  men did not fight for honor or courage like some of hollywoods creations would lead us to believe  they did not fight to purposely crush the enemy or defeat hitler  gis fought for themselves and the survival of their fellow men  also dispelled many of the myths of war  anyone who thinks war is glorious and glamorous needs to experience spielbergs masterpiece  war is not fun it is hell and spielberg conveyed that message very clearly in the opening battle scenes men were being machinegunned without knowing what had happened to them yet there were moments in the movie where i felt that i had forgotten about the war  for example before the final battle scene at the bridgehead american gis were swapping back and forth stories about the homefront  war definitely has moments of comradeship as portrayed by spielberg  overall it is one of the best movies i have ever seen  steven spielberg creates yet another masterpiece  i loved the movie and would recommend it to anyone except small children of course,reality
i dont consider myself a squeamish person at all but sitting through this movie became an endurance test for me i knew when i walked into the cinema that this wasnt going to be a nice film but i was still completely shocked at the opening omagh beach sequence i realise that some people need to see this film and understand that war is futile and horrific etc but i found being flung into the middle of the slaughter surround sound full blast quite a distressful experience no wonder war veterans watching this film could only last 10 minutes i know spielberg has to hit home and it really does and i know that a lot of men died and how messed up and bloody the operation was but  i knew that anyway and personally would  rather not know what a person looks like when they are shotblown up into little pieces but despite that im glad in a way that i saw the film as i was with schindlers list and can appreciate what the veterans went through for us and how grateful we should be its  one of those films that isnt pleasant one little bit but you should see it anyway,reality
this is without a doubt the best war movie ever mademany people have claimed this film isnt realistic or its characters are plain stereotypes i just wonder if these people have been to war themselves or at least in army trainingthose people who havent gotta have some guts if they can claim knowing anything about war to a real veteranif the battles in this film arent realistic why do the veterans who have seen this film say it was like reality at least they know what they are talking aboutand maybe just maybe war makes people stereotypes its not like ordinary life ehspielberg really hit the vein with this one keep up the good work,reality
some of you people should be ashamed of yourselves how dare you take a film that is so much based on true events like and dismiss it like it is just another cinematic experiencesome of you seemed disappointed about the amount of gore portrayed in this film saying that it was nothing more than a bunch of arms and legs getting blown off have people really gotten this narrowminded are your convictions with steven spielberg so fierce that you have to ignore the fact that almost everything you are seeing in the doomsday scene is based on factual accounts were you the same people who said schindlers list should not have been made by spielberg simply because he was not a holocaust survivor well grow upyou dont have to call the best film ever made you dont even have to like it but at the very least you should take a mature action and respect it this is not a game people it has to do with your very right to walk free today over fifty years after so many thousands of people sacrificed their lives so that we may live free this is not indiana jones and world war ii so stop pretending like it ismy grandfather fought in ww ii and he would be to say the least insulted by some of the harsh comments mentioned here for the many thousands of veterans and americans like him keep your wasteful opinions to yourself,reality
i hate to see a movie like incomplete it is a masterpiece of a film but it could have been the greatest film ever made it is not spielberg was so close and yet is not quite the movie it should be dont get me wrong it is an impressive film and im glad i paid to go see it the opening sequence on the beach is utterly perfect  there are no other words to describe it and tom hanks actually performs a role that is definitely oscar worthy philadelphia was overrated but there are mistakes spielberg makes the opening and closing shots of the american flag  didnt spielberg see minghellas the english patient the use of the older attending the graveyard  completely unnecessary  spielberg should have left it during wwii and finally the character focus on  i had more interest in the corporal upham character played brilliantly by jeremy davies i felt that at times spielberg was doing so but then he switched back to hanks and damons characters it would have proved more effective to use davies character as the main protagonist but enough of the criticising  it is nevertheless still a fine film and i think the only reason i find myself picking at these little things is my disappointment in the fact that it could have been one of the greatest films ever  and fell just a few feet short of it,reality
spielberg takes a giant leap forward as a filmmaker with this amazing movie beyond entertainment this film actually left me examining my own place and responsibility in the world  lured in by a typically cliched hollywood warfilm plot weve got to save pvt for his mama that plays to our most romanticized notions of war the film instead devolves into the incoherent bloody mess war actually is and finally with the closing scenes attains an allegorical plateau as it makes its true point  that we are all private enjoying lives of pleasure and freedom thanks to the thousands of common men who united 50 years ago to destroy the most evil human endeavor of modern times  bravo,reality
this is the most realistic war movie that has probably ever been produced realistic in that sometimes i felt that i was actually in there ducking dodging running and crawling as they were waiting at the bridge for the tanks it gave an eerie feeling i am not a veteran so i can only imagine the waiting for the enemy which you know is coming would be quite harrowing as against being in the thick of the action where you dont get time to worrypurists may complain that certain events would not have happened but those are just technicalities that do not detract from it being a superb filmto the layman in any case although i think i spotted a mistake too not a military or historical one just a minor production one just before they came across the guarded radar there was a long distance shot of them walking across a field in formation i counted 8 of them it looks like the filmclip used when they first began their missionwar veterans dont like to talk about some of their experiences and having watched this movie i can understand why many would have seen and done things that they now regret such as murdering prisoners of war acts of cowardice the making of crucial decisions that resulted in the loss of our mens lives inaction or hesitation and just being plain scaredother war veterans would have many painful memories of the loss of friends and relatives and just the ugliness and horrors of wari understand that the age range of those that went to war were 18 to 21yr olds unbelievable they were just kidsthis movie has an r16 rating however i have no worries about my 11 and 9 year old daughters viewing it when it comes out on videofor the realistic depiction i give it a 10 out of 10 for this movie i give it a 9 out of 10,reality
this film lives up to much of its hype  it is in fact a morally ambiguous film about late world war 2 told from a soldiers perspective  however i wasnt nearly as impressed with the entire film as i was with the truly incredible opening sequence  for much of its development the film seems as aimless as its characters searching for accomplishment and meaning in an otherwise chaotic environment  solid acting turns although nothing superlative from hanks damon and norton especially,reality
i gotta say that after reading some of the comments already posted that i m amazed at how many people watched this movie and proceeded to critique it for its plot enjoyability etc  this like schindlers list i think is a movie to be absorbed rather than just plain watched  after watching this movie i walked around for days with a kind of hangover following me aroundi was extremely moved by it  when somebody asks me what i thought of it i say i think of it alot  the battle sequences were absolutely horrific  and not because of the gore so much as the terrifying realization that these people war veterans  both deceased and still alive did this for their countrythis horrible traumatic experience most were very young and werent expecting what they got  the terror must have been unlike anything my generation will ever know  most people today feel panic stricken when the cable goes out just before their favorite episode of fill in the blank cmon people  take a hard look at this movie terrifying  very few movies  have achieved in me what private has,reality
left me in total awe i have been to hundreds of movies and never have i heard such silence when the movie ended not one person spoke when the movie ended not even the little teeny bopper girls who came to see matt damon i was left with ever growing respect for my elders for what they went through during that war all actors with the exception of ed burns did a fantastic job i highly recommend it,reality
for the most part is a film of great integrity and honesty  for the bulk of the breezy three hour length i thought that spielberg had enough trust in his material to allow it to stand on its own no such luck  in the final minute of the film spielberg unleashes a scene that is so melodramatic and manipulatingly cloying that it severely undercuts an otherwise fine film  spielberg needs to learn that his movies can have a powerful message and leave a lasting impression without having to tell the audience what he wants them to get from it,reality
the opening scenes of this movie are amazing  you see omaha beach battle and feel like youre really there  spielbergs directing is outstanding and the acting is good too  private captures what its like to be in battle  the cinematography effectively showed things from the characters perspectives  this movie deserves best pic more than any other ive seen this year  if can handle serious violence dont miss it,reality
im happy so many people have seen this film and am also quite happy to see many different opinions expressed as to the merits of i myself thought the movie was quite exceptional  i enjoy the film for its honesty  this isnt a film with a political agenda such as the war turns innocent children into mindless killers of  stones platoon or the corny proamerican schmaltz of the green berets  any governmental politics would have definitely hampered this film instead it focuses on war and war only  it focuses on the attitudes of soldiers and the fat cats who sent them in to battle  more importantly spr is about the thoughts and actions of eight men as they search for private  we see them as theyre crying we see them as theyre killing we see them as theyre laughing  encompassing all these facts the film provides a monumental look at the attitude of americans towards war back in the day and the attitude of americans towards war in the presentthe battle sequences at the beginning and ending of the film are some of the most powerful sequences ever caught on celluloid  yes they are indeed technical marvels to be sure  however to say that the movie depends too much on the technical proficiency of its director is not true in the slightest  the film is exemplary all around  likewise to say that this film relies solely on hanks star power and damons looks is also untrue the supporting cast especially ribisi goldberg and davies more than hold their own if not overshadow the also great performance of hanksmore importantly in its general honesty regarding the attitudes of americans during and after the war spr succeeds in being one of the greatest if not the greatest war film ever produced  true the script is not exactly the greatest ever written but the raw power of the war sequences the superb performances from all involved and the humanity given to all soldiers who fought in this war more than make up for itand to those of you who denounce it for demonizing nazis 1 what of the scene where davies screams for the release of the bawling german soldier 2 this movie is shot from the perspectives of those fighting the nazis anyone trying to kill you is going to be perceived in a negative light  3 remember  the nazis were the bad guysand for those denouncing it for its solely american perspective  the film followed only eight american soldiers and still clocked in at three hours im sure spielberg would have loved to encompass the entire story of world war ii into this film but i dont think that was quite possible,reality
more than anything else i believe that eliminating the above myth ref summary above was the thesis spielberg was trying to communicate to the socalled allies and especially the american public  when one looks at the attempt at glamour beginning with tv shows that trivialised the socalled good war in the 1960s eg hogans heroes mccales navy not to mention a warehouse full of ww2 flicks where soldiers fought with clean uniforms on dirty beaches  cranked into production beginning not long after the japanese surrendered aboard ship with two nuclear holes where cities once sat  one can certainly understand why spielberg felt the need to bring home this longoverdue messageoliver stone and others have already reminded us of how horrible was vietnam and the dmz on the korean peninsula is a living reminder of that war but ww2 remained glamourised until relatively recent times  while the first 20 minutes of following a brief but touching introduction have received much press  and indeed that stretch of film is quite an ordeal for the viewer having any level of sensitivity whatsoever to get through  it is the remainder of the film that will convince you utterly that war of any kind is a useless waste  kudos go in abundance to spielberg  co and one quickly envisages at least 67 oscar nominations on the way to include best actor tom hanks  who just keeps getting better and better with age spielberg for best director and the film itself for best picture top rating 5 stars of 5  make that six,reality
i have a feeling from reading all these negative messages about the realism of saving private that spielberg has been grossly understood by the majority spielberg was not trying to make a superviolent war movie to persuade people from warhe said himself that he hopes after people are done talking about the the first 30 mins on the beach of normandy that they would talk about what the movie is really about  those wwii veterans and the sacrifice that they made for us so we can argue whether or not spr is better than thin red line i have never been so affected by a movie all i hear is people arguing that they didnt know about radar then or that the story is not feasible and so on these people unfortunately miss the symbolism which is deeply rooted in this movie this movie cannot be summed up as it is too complicated  like a person many feelings and thoughts went into this feel and they all come out i do feel that this is a truly great movie and the best one i have ever seeni admit that it is a very american moviebut i do believe that the french canadians and english can relate is grossly misunderstood in its characters i have heard a lot of talk about how they are stereotypes and suchhardly so but none the less these thoughts are distracting you from the true meaning of this film and please forgive me for rambling on ,reality
when my friends and i went to get tickets to this movie they carded us  we showed them our licenses proving we were over 17 but that theater required someone over 21 to be present  i thought this was the most ridiculous thing i had ever heard  now my father would have to go to the movie with us well once the film started it only took about 30 seconds for me to realize why they had been so strict about letting us inmy jaw dropped during the chilling dday opening sequence and i didnt pick it up off the floor until well past the second unit closing credits  never before have i been so affected by a film and so scared  two of my guy friends who tend to be very tolerant of blood and gore were obviously creeped out by the all too realistic graphic depiction of war not to mention the other girl who was there  i wanted to leave after that opening sequence  to think that my grandfather went through that was too much  i stayed however and witnessed the most daring and realistic depiction of world war ii ever put on screeni left the theater scared to death of war and with a whole new respect for veterans around the world  i highly recommend this movie but only if you have the stomach to take it,reality
with out a doubt steven spielberg has made a wonderful film with  it is a film that will change you what i am having trouble with is what many reviewers and the general public are seeing as the message of the film  it seems to me that they think the message of this film is war is hell i feel that does a disservice not only to this film but to everyone of those soldiers  of course war is hell even those poor war movies covey that messagethis is not a film about the horrors of war its about the sacrifices of war  everyone of those grave markers that you see in normandy represents a man or woman that sacrificed for us  those sacrifices are all embodied in the character of pvt james and his family  here is a family and at the time a country that forgave their own personal needs  wants for those of the rest of the world  i believe that speilberg is reminding us all of that sacrifice  throughout the search for pvt we feel the ridiculous nature of the missionfubar  here is a group of men that are sacrificing for one man and his familyus  when capt phillips hanks says to earn it speilberg is saying it to us speilberg has earned it by the making of this film  now the question iswhat have the rest of us done,reality
is a great picture  no doubt about that even though i think theres room for better yet the first bit is wonderful realistic and i like seeing someone who at last shows the battle scenes more or less as they where however it is not as choking as i would have thought by the reviews it lacks the final shot of realism and the element of chance or coincidentnow chok in these pictures is of course important you simply have got to go out the cinema either before the ending or with a really bad taste in your mouth we owe that to the ones who fought and died and so this film was not violent enough what about the random shootings on the beaches the lacking accidential killing of fellow soldiers or at least a more sombre ending not this more or less happy ending which unfortunately is becoming a hollywood trademark but it is a fine movie,reality
this film was released back in july and its lost a lot of its hype recently but that dosent mean it should be overlooked  some of the comments are very pathetic given about this film horrible plot makes no sense whatsoever since it was based on a true story relies on special effects is total bs because what other way are you gonna make war more realistic and the bad acting ones had to go  it may have been a little too long and some scenes may have made the movie much better if they were shortened ie church scene but that doesnt stay away from the importance of the filmthe first 25 minutes of the film are going to remembered as probably the best war scene ever created  it was brutal grotesque disturbing breathtaking gruesome horrifying so many words cant describe the visuals you see during the dday experience spielburg gives us  and if that didnt give you the antiwar feeling then the next 10 minutes to see the mothers reaction when she finds out 3 of her 4 boys died is sure to be enough  the first 13 of this film stab you with any type of emotion that can ever be put into a war filmthe next 45 minutes of the film have a few scenes that drag on to give strong characterization to understand the 8 men army out looking for private  some may feel bored during a few parts even though i found them necessiry  but during this 45 minutes of the film to see french people trying to live in their torn apart homes during the war and to see the hundreds of dogtags the soldiers looked through are still dramatic  and when the medic dies toward the end of this section of the film is another scene capable of bringing tears to the eyesthe last 13 of the movie never lets up  they soon find private and when they decide to stay and help him and his platoon fight off the german forces leads to a dramatic climax which goes on just as long as the opening dday experiance  this scene has a much larger battlefield and the soldiers arent running in to battle like the opening and are rather spread apart to let us know each characters reaction to the war they are fighting in  the conclusion is just almost as sad as the scenes during the opening and definitely get across the message that war is hellit has recently been announced that spr will return to theaters shortly along with another wwii film the thin red line  the thin red line looks very promising to be another war film to receive amazing excellence but it is said that the two films differ drastically in just about every way  i imagine both films will do well at the academy awards but definitely deserves over 10 academy awards and be another titanic to go down in history,reality
probably by the time you get to my entry youll have made up your mind as to whether or not to see this movie  however if the other 600 entries still have you unsure go back and read them again  the film is unbelievably good extremely violent but its absolutely worth enduring  whyre you still here go see it,reality
steven spielberg has outdone himself with this one it became one of my favorites the very first time i saw it  its plot and characterization are thin and i dislike the sappy ending  but the combat sequences may be the greatest ever filmed and tom hankss work is a revelation hanks made his name as a boyish comic actor but in recent years hes developed a remarkable presence  as capt john miller his quiet dignity carries in a commanding yet understated performance  despite its flaws is a triumph people will remember it for years to come,reality
is without a doubt one of the greatest films of all time  the first half hour is the most powerful 30 minutes in film history the questions raised in the film are sure to trigger discussions on the value of human life  the performances are fantastic  this film is as close to perfection as one can get,reality
this is the most terrible horrifying movie that has ever been made  and it should be required viewing for everyone on this small planet drives home what we all knew about war but never felt in our guts until now it shows us once and for all that war is always wrongsuperb movie making brings us into the middle of the battlefield  an illogical chaotic insane hell  where men are driven away from their own humanity for the first time we are not viewing a movie from the outside we are in the middle of the action with bullets flying overhead and bombs exploding all around us we inevitably become nervous and start ducking involuntarily lest we be killed as well kudos to the sound techs and cinematographers is sure to become a classic it will be seen for years to come as a highwater mark in film a true pinnacle it is a film that has the power to change the viewer if only it could change the worlds leaders we may never be faced with the horror of another war,reality
this is a below average movie but contains the best technical soldier deaths ever it is unoriginal schmaltzy ridiculously patriotic and weak plotted although some scenes are technically perfect i never said anything was fake it was far from a coherent movie did you find yourself saying why didnt they justafter seeing saving pr i identified many similarities from other previous war moviesflag born on the 4th of july sniper shooting at caparzo oh my god full metal jacket urban shootout and battle full metal jacket the whole movie going after full metal jacket ragtag bunch of 812 lovable misfits brought to battle entire german army dirty dozen ridiculous against the odds battle with onebyone death of characters almost all war movies quoting lincoln every praise us movie it seems beach scene at start duke nukem 3dthis movie was soooo miscast adam goldberg tv show friends  20something psycho roomie giovanni ribisi friends phoebes stupid hick brother at times hanks seems like hes forrest gump again matt damon anyone could have done that dennis farina i didnt know the mob was at normandyif spr was cut down to just war scenes and titledreally outstanding battle depictionid give it 10 oscars but it aint best picture,reality
as i left the theatre after watching spr my first thought was world war ii meets indiana jones there were just too many spielberg standard cliches in this movie for me to really appreciate his attempt at a realistic war movie the opening 20 minutes was a good attempt at realism but somehow spoiled by later unbelievable little twists that i found silly and seemed more appropriate in a indiana jones movie yes some of the things in the movie did happen in real life but others simply did not so i question the whole reality thing if you really want to know what happened read the eyewitness accounts currently available out there in book stores i think youll find some things in the movie accurate while others far from it in addition the movie misses some of the real drama and herosim that went on down on the beaches that day what about the bravery of general norman cota who rallied the men over the beach defenses what about the role of the navy destroyers whoclosed to within 500 yards of the beach and took out numerous pillboxes with their guns those stories should be worth at least a mention in addition to all the blood and gore thats displayed by the way not all the defenders were german some were captured russians poles czechs and chinesestill with all that said i understand the attempt here at trying to give you the feel of real combat with all the horror and blood and gore but ultimately nothing can substitute for the real thing although this movie probably comes closer than any other movie before yet i felt that the display of gore was given too much focus and that the story was sacrificed in favour of this i felt something was missing after seeing this movie in the end the filmmaker tries to make up for this by ending the film with a message however the whole film ride to get to that point seems to have little in common to that message,reality
rated  r for graphic violence adult langauge adult content starring  tom hanks matt damon ed burns tom sizmore directed by  steven spielberg running time  2 hours 48 minuteswell to start off this movie should not be viewed by children under 15 that is unless you want to teach your children about the real effects of war  this movie starts off with an older james at omaha beach his family behind him  he has walked up to the marble gravestones that are placed there in remembrance of the soldiers that dies at dday which he flashes back to  in the flashback which is simular to titanic as in it being the whole movie to the beginning of dday with a shot of captain miller tom hanks and his platoon of soldiers who before landing on omaha vomit in terror they hit the beach and two rows of soldiers are taken out the others dive into the water a couple drown under the weight of theyre equipment others dying before even hitting the beach  for the first halfhour of this masterpiece i dare say masterpiece because thats what it is the soldiers go through hell a mess of blood dead bodies and gun fire thatll make you appreciate those that went through that  after that captain miller and his team of soldiers on the mission to save private matt damon along the way save they run into a run down radar tower a run down town and several other things which leave them with unexpected loses  and the final battle may be the best and most prolific  in the history of cinema tom hanks delivers an oscar worthy performance steven spielberg should get an oscar for best director and he proves his is the greatest director of our time  edward burns matt damon and tom sizemore are also giving great perforances along with guest appearances by dennis farina and ted danson this movie has major star power a great plot great dialogue and a great direction allinall this gets my vote for best movie of the year  i give it an asometimes i wonder if ive changed so much my wife is even gonna recognize me whenever it is i get back to her  and how ill ever be able to  tell about these days like today captain miller,reality
i know many people have problems with this movie  its got a poor plot it relies too heavily on special effects its too graphic  but it has finally let me understand why my grandfather never spoke of the war or his part in it  if is even the slightest bit like what he went through i can finally understand why it was too hard for him to talk about,reality
i very much wanted to love this movie however it left me cold not because of the level of realism that it portrayed war inthat i could appreciate but for the general lack of sympathy or identity that i could generate for the characters the most passion i could feel was for during the scene when the german is walking down the staircase only then was i able to feel for a character in this movie hanks usually does not do this to mewith his other movies even forrest gump i left the theatre amazed touched and in awe of his abilitybut not in this case,reality
objectively i consider movies as good and relevant based on the following a it is based on true story b it has social impact  and c flawless spr has met all these requirements and even more seeing the movie would stir ones imagination that will stay in ones consciousness for quite sometime the film is technically excellent and at par with other good war films such as platoon and full metal jacket  congratulations to mr spielberg,reality
some filmgoers have short memories when they praise the latest candiedover antiwarmessage film as the best ever for raw brutal honesty in imaginative filmmaking what about full metal jacket or apocalyse now or the deerhunter or platoon to mention just a few of the recent entries for best ever and what about still best of all all quiet on the western front issued 68 years ago in 1930 based on erich marie remarques novel all of these better than spielbergs saving pr that with his eye as ever more keenly on the box office than on telling the truth he mars with the sentimental patriotism that he laces into it as a hedge on what might not be the overwhelming popularity of his antiwar theme,reality
i am an officer of marines and have been waiting for a war to depict war in its entirety  with this movie the wait is now over  all that is needed is the smell of burning flesh and hair and one would have a realistic experience of the effects of war  this movie is as real as it getsi have always wondered why my father who was a marine during the korean war never mentioned the crazy things that happened to him during his two tours of korea  he kept these things hidden within him and they only surfaced around loud noises or when the mentioning of his old comrades was brought up in certain circles  you could see the pain and suffering that hit him  the movies ending followed this as if my dad had written his own autobiography  watching help myself answer these unknown questions and prepared me more for what my job entitles as a leader of marinesthe best part of watching this movie was doing it near a military base opening night the theatre was completely crowded with marines and their significant others  the marines enter cocky as usual proud confident and ready to see another action war movie  as i watched them leave with a sobbing friend i could see a new light in their eyes in the understandings of the effects of war  they were able to see the consequences of some of their actions in future situations,reality
this movie is a splendorthe opening battle scene will be remembered as the greatest opening shots in movie historytom hanks gives his best performance of his lifein all things are relativethe film makes you think a dangerous concept  not found often on the screen no waterboys needed here thank youthe film leaves you with a feeling of being there in ww2platoon is the second most realistic war film,reality
i really wanted to like this movie the opening battle sequence was unquestionably powerful but not nearly as groundbreaking as people seem to think all quiet on the western front and paths of glory plumbed similar ground years ago private is a good war movie but it is nearly capsized by spielbergs choking schmaltziness he undercut the emotional impact of schindlers list with his syrupy sentimentality and does likewise here im beginning to think he should go back to making childrens movies where his tendency toward cloying sweetness is more excusablebtw private is not an antiwar movie it glorifies the sacrifices of the soldiers and romanticizes their heroism thats the same bullshit the military has been feeding young men for centuries  a lie that is exposed and villified in all quiet on the western front paths of glory and the grand illusion among other true antiwar films but sentimental spielberg doesnt get it he cant resist his urge to make everything romantic idealistic and maudlin,reality
the first time i saw this movie in august i didnt know what to make of it i knew i liked it but was left numb i saw it again in sept and realized that its a great movie its no longer in american theaters but will be released around nomination time next year for the anti american sector like one viewer mentioned the beach they came ashore on was 100 percent american so it wasnt anti rest of the allied forces like people mention i grew up with all the old war movies and you cant tell me this isnt the most honest depiction of war you have ever scene and the plot to rescue one man hell i was in the military and ive seen stranger crap than this as 4 the age factor yeah most military people are 18 to 21 but if u ever were in the service the guys that stayed in were mostly in their 30s it seems once u reenlist you stay the whole course in the military so that explains the age difference youre either a 1st termer or a lifer there seems no in between  anyway i thought it was a movie that should be seen by any future military types pk,reality

when i went to see this movie i said to myself ok another war movie but i was very wrong i never cried in a cinema before but this time at the end of the movie everyone was quiet a almost everybody was crying including me that movie showed me what a terrible thing is war,reality
it was good to see the stupidity and wastefulness of war portrayed so well only critcism  some overhead beach scenes were obviously not real,reality
the beginning with the old man was so sappy and melodramatic that the scenes following were a complete shock  it went from afterschool special to completely disturbing  i havent seen a display of such realistic footage in any movie besides schindlers list ever after awhile the brutality gets to you where you just have to turn away  whats really sad is the fact that the soldiers on the field didnt have that luxury i had sitting in a movie seat besides that scene the movie turned into a flat boring mess  the acting left a lot to be desired as well as the storyline  i really dont believe that the movie would have gotten much hype if it wasnt for the direction of spielberg and the opening scenes  minus the old man of course  you knew where spielberg was trying to go with the story but he seemed to take you on a lot of unnecessary detours that could have got the viewer there 1hr earlier  overall a disappointing film,reality
sure the plot was thin at times 10 underarmed men stop an armed army sure the flag at the end was overkill but remember schindlers lists ending sure the reference to monty was insulting and wrong my dad had a fit over thisbut reallyget over it this movie is not about specifics but rather the amalgamation of a serious harsh and at times poignant images so if you thought the soundtrack was too loud oh my bleeding hearti suggest you go home and crank down the enya music for those who were disgusted by the brutality please understand that this was what it was like war isnt meant to be a nice warm fuzzy experiencelastlyif you thought the movie wasnt a testimony against warthen what the fk where you watching,reality
most war films have one common denominator or twothey either have a give em hell attitude the longest day or they deal with an antiwar theme apocalypse now  this film does bothonly on a larger scale  it has some fine acting tom hanks matt damon ted danson but that is not how i saw this movie  this movie is about war in all of its infinite inhumanityand you are thereright at the front lineswatching men brutally dying around you  in apocalypse now this was shown to a degreethen all of a sudden we are swept up into a chaotic nightmare about a renegade colonel who goes over the edge  this film explores war on a more real life scale  when the boats arrive at omaha beachyou feel what the soldiers feel  when the men decide to go after you feel their courageand their probable destiny  movies like the deer hunter coming home and paths of glory all gave us a reason to hate war  this film does the same however it explores all of the reasons for wanting to go to warand fighting for what you believe in  this is spielberg at his finestthe flip side to schindlers list  the cinematography special effects sound and score all are done perfectlya masterpiece of american film making in the last decade of the 20th century,reality
saving privates going to take a whole bunch of oscars and probably best picture but it shouldnt okay it may be a realistic portrayal of war and blahblah but lets look at it as a real movie  tom hanks doesnt deserve any sort of oscar for this he was good but its nothing jim carrey didnt do ten times better in the truman show  matt damon lets face it reeked jeremy davies gave about the only oscarcaliber performance in the whole thing  any movie that opens with a shot of an american  flag cant be too original it must have been done by fifty other movies the script was pathetic with some pretty dumb lines and not much of a story if the script is even nominated for an oscar itll show how low the academy sinks to meet hype but every review of the movie gave it 5 out of 4 stars and soon and im starting to get the feeling this is one of those movies the media almost forces you to like such as titanic and forrest gump  im not saying its not a decent movie  it is very realistic and the cinematography sound and art direction is great  jeremy davies should at least be nominated for something and its one of spielbergs best directing efforts  but as for being the best war movie of all time to this day nothing compares with apocalypse now and if wins over the truman show heck over pleasantville then theres something seriously wrong but thats just my opinion,reality
i am from israel used to hear about dead soldiers on the news when such horrible events happen the radio starts broadcasting quiet beautiful songs and a feeling of deep sadness spread i see in my mind fresh graves the teary faces of girlfriends mothers fathers and fellow soldiersbut after watching i see other things torn flesh pools of blood shattered bones impossibly loud explosions raising dust and ashes the cry of the wounded mixed with the confused shouts of officers i see bullets piercing chests and heads it is all live horrible and shockingbrings a new angle on war the personal angle that of a single human being facing the horror of death around him of blind chance deciding whether hell get wounded or killed or just scratched spielberg managed to do what no director have done before  bring you inside a battlezone and let you feel the chaos from within you suddenly find yourself crouched in your chair not knowing when the next blow will come from shaking with every bone of your body when a tank approaches ducking when bullets come nearthe film could have been a masterpiece if the plot was more sharp if the characters were less flat and if the dirty dozen ending was avoided but still its a must to see,reality
is one of the best fictionalized accounts of war i have ever seen the first twenty minutes which will most likely be cut when the film makes its television premiere are more than just war itself  they are real the real face of war pain death and lossi loved this movie for the cohesiveness seldom found in other war movies but there was a major problem with it  the claim that it was true a little research into the situation soon shows that spielberg took more than a little dramatic license  the last two hours never happened there was no major rescue mission poor pvt wandered home one day and they said oh hey we were looking for youas a movie educating people about the horrors of war though this is an excellent choice provided the audience knows its fiction its right up there with courage under fire also starring matt damon as an excellent fiction resource people wishing to check out a more realistic account of war will want to view thin red line and the canadian miniseries the valour and the horror both of which are more or less true accounts of wartime eventsalthough an excellent movie there is an inherent problem with using big name actors like tom hanks and tom sizemore not only are they far too old for the roles it was highly unusual to find a wwii soldier over 25  most were between 18 and 21  and almost every soldier in this movie is late thirties or older but viewers come in with an already formed opinion tom hanks oh yes hes the comedian who often plays an uptight neurotic whos likely to have a nervous breakdown tom sizemore cynical guy with a fairly crude sense of humor and an eye for the ladies adam goldberg ah chandlers freaky and psychopathic roommate on friends edward burns canadian actor barry pepper vin diesel and to a certain extent goldberg were far better for their roles than big time actors ted danson dennis farina damon sizemore and hanks its not lack of ability but rather lack of suitabilitythe movie deserves a high rating but misrepresentation saying the movie was historically based when it was in fact fictional and glamorizing casting big name actors to draw viewers detracted from the movie in some ways its got an 85 from me and two thumbs up,reality
spielberg is back but  theres something missing in his new movie spielberg once again showed that he is one of the best directors in the world but the problem with this movie is in the script the beginning and the end of the movie ie parts that take place in present time are redundant and belong in soap opera not in movie in the scenes on omaha beach solders die violently and realistically but as the movie develops it becomes more hollywood movie and less an intensive and relatively realistic story about war the most disappointing moment is the one in which captain miller dies why should he give his little speech instead dying like all the others is he better than the others are and even if he is better i dont think that he is  so what in my opinion the whole movie aims to justify war and tries to do so by proving that a people get killed so that other can live and b war was horrible but it made this beautiful presence possible and i dont like it when others impose their opinion on me  i prefer to make my own conclusions,reality
this is one of the most powerful war movies ever made  it shows the realism and horrors of war and whether you like the movie or not you will have a greater respect for those who fought  todays treatment of veterans is shameful but movies like this will open some peoples eyes,reality
i saw spr way back in july and i have returned to see it a few times since i like most everyone seems to have had a strong reaction to the films brutal portrayal of 20th century warfare being curious to see what others from around the country and around the world thought of the film i have returned to this page from time to time to read peoples comments upon reading some of these comments i have a few of my ownto those who thought the film was not perfect but overall pretty darn good  i agreeto those who thought the film was lousy  p offto those who thought the film didnt have good character development  get a lifeto those who thought the film didnt have a good plot  what film school did you say you went toto those who thought the film was not antiwar enough  hello the sixties are over then go back and see the film againto those who thought the film didnt answer the meaning of life  read the bible or do yoga then lighten up its just a movieto those who thought the film was too violent  war is undoubtedly worse than this film or any other could ever portrayto those who thought the film was too mushy  ask any veteran about his lost friends bring a tissueto those who thought the film should have shown soliers from the other nations involved in dday  its an american film about american soldiers in the american invasion sector on an american landing beach looking for an american paratrooper in an american drop zone enough saidto those who thought the film was too pro american  spend the next 70 years and billions of dollars in the country of your choice building your own film industry and then make your own film about ddayto those who thought the film was too hollywood  see my comment aboveto those who just want to take a poke at spielberg  what have you done latelyfinally the right to freely express ourselves as we have all just done was paid for in blood real people died to protect this right to all veteransthank you,reality
i was 100 gripped by this movie all the way through  total action great and disturbing scenes of violence on a level of realism never before reached  this movie did entertain me and was shocking  but as an actual movie it does fall downfor a start nothing actually happens plotwise  the confrontation between hanks and private when they finally meet is pure hollywood rubbish this movies tries to be realistic but the illusion goes at parts like that on the same subject people get mown down left right and centreyet our core heroes have bullets bouncing around their feet and seem immunehowever these flaws are no less than youd find in any other movie so i think it is a victim of its own success  because the action and gore is so realistic and gripping you expect too much from the rest of the movieone other thing in its favour was that it wasnt too overthetop with american schmaltzhowever it was there a tadgod bless america,reality
this movie contained the most realistic and horrifying combat footage ive ever seen  they really exceeded my already high expectations  the story however is lacking in spots  the german soldiers were far too impersonal this would have made a great antiwar film if that point had been driven home with a more balanced story,reality
what can be said about this film which hasnt already been said  the acting the setting the cinematography simply captures your mind heart and soul and brings you sometimes dragging you unwillingly on this journey into one of the darkest yet most vital and necessary moments in our history as a nation  i think this movie provided many with an insight into the reality of war on a level which has not been previously captured  there are scenes in this movie which once seen cannot be unseen  images which will last in your mind for a very long time and make you appreciate the sacrifice of so many not so long ago  we praise firemen for their courage to stand ready to enter a burning building to save a life  how should we praise the men and women in uniform who likewise stand ready to enter combat at a moments notice to preserve our way of life  yet the latter group tends to be praised or spurned with the changing of the political tides  every now and then a movie comes along which can do something to correct such an injustice in our mindsets  this was one such movie  it should become part of high school or college history curriculums for either the study of the history of war though this was not based on a true story or as a study in human character and psychology much as moby dick is a study of human obsession with a task which must be accomplished  i give this the highest rating of 10 for the superb acting the script and the courage to show us the realistic effects of war on people,reality
firstly im impressed at how many australians have commented here on what is clearly a very american movie in attitude and content secondly anyone who says this is easily the best movie theyve ever watched needs to watch more movies that said this is an exceptionally well made film and definitely worth seeing the criticisms i have with the movie dont nearly outweigh its finer qualities too many criicisms focus on what a movie isnt and should be rather than what it is this movie attempts to provide some insight into the horrors of war without straying too far from the standard warfare cute pun i also felt a touch of the cameronesque chiefly in the unnecessary use of the flashback but other things too the hooray for america line that is so common is trundled out again the only reference to the rest of the allies is criticism i was impressed though that spielberg didnt try to suggest that american soldiers were flawless saviours the execution of prisoners was an important part of this the comments of others seem to suggest some tenuous holds on reality the camera work in the battle scenes could be jerky but i thought it was effective and didnt last too long the bloodshed was unpleasant and realistic but not real if this movie made people a little more educated about how horrific war really is how chaotic and terrifying all the better i am not sure though that some glory did not attach itself to millers team and their deaths lastly i was impressed that although this was a long movie it didnt feel it at all it held my attention the whole time anyway enough already very good movie 810 9 being my highest  no such thing as a 10 in art definitely worth the price of a ticket even in the home of costly movie tickets,reality
steven spielberg has created the greatest war movie ever seen in the history of cinema it takes the audience into battle and has you looking for a way out for the characters in the film there is no way out and survival is pure luck finally this generation will be able to recognise why our grandfathers hold annual ceremony to their fallen comrades not in a glorification of war but in solemn remembrance to those they fought with but didnt return home thanks to the efforts of spielberg the generation of today should carry on their tradition and remember too,reality
a very good movie beautiful pictures good acting and good sound the only thing that disappointed me was the typical american script the story about bringing back private was so typical for hollywood but the rest of the film was so intense that you almost forgot this annoyanceis a film i will recommend to everyone with a strong stomach who wants to see a good movie,reality
this is one of the best war movies that i ever seen in my life the omaha beach part looks like real one of the gis got his head blown off by a mg3250 caliber and thats what you call it real war not like john wayne style of war movie the movie has a plot and the effect sound etc really grasp the audience moreover what the film really delivers is that no one really wins in a war but it is important that young people know about the pastyet it was an allied campaign and forces from the british empire and australia were totally involved it would have been nice if the australians got a mention somewhere in the movie,reality
while i was in a theatre watching the movie just during  the very emotional representation of the dday ohama beach landing  i watched around me and  i saw at least ten people crying the movie to me is all held in this unforgettable imageit does not make any sense  talking about the movie in itself the outstanding cinematography  the wellperforming cast the superb handheld camera work you must really watch this movie  it simply goes beyond any word go and watch this masterpiece  youll tell me,reality
i have never ducked or weaved in a film i have never imagined the true horrors of war i have never understood cowards in an army i have never felt how it would be like being there until i saw saving private,reality
ive seen many of the great war filmsplatoon alls quiet on the western front the longest day a bridge too far gallipoli  at their best these great war films made me commiserate with the plight of the common soldier see the futility and the waste of war and understand the sacrifices made to preserve the world i live in todayall of them however were observed by me  they moved me but they were still somehow distantnot so with  from the opening frame i was there  i wasnt watching a moving tribute i was being shot at watching comrades die horribly and running for my life  this movie will make those whove never been to war say my god thats what it was really like  and any veteran say my god theyve finally shown the truth  if you arent moved by this film id venture to guess you are either coldhearted or a film student who cant get past examining camera angles in order to experience whats going on in front of your faceit was without a doubt the most powerful war film ive ever seen perhaps the most powerful film ive ever seenpeople gripe about the plot  those who do dont know much about military protocol  yes eight men might be sent to risk their lives to return one home  after all it sounds like a far easier mission than it actually turns out to beuntil the chaos of a large scale military operation enters into the picture  far sillier orders have been issued in every major war in historyas for the camera work complain about the jostling camera all you want  theres only so much you can do to simulate the fog of war how everything seems slightly offkilter when the bullets start flying and your stomach knots up  the oscar for cinematography which is a shoein will be vindication enough against the naysayersif you absolutely cant stand gore and violence onscreen this film is not for you  for anyone who can please dont miss it it truly is unforgettableit will win spielberg his second directorial oscar it will win for cinematography it will win best picture and hanks will probably win for best actor  also look for tom sizemore to be nominated for best supporting actor  i know i knowthe oscar year is hardly over  it doesnt matter it was that good,reality
im sure that i could dribble on for hours on how fantastic i thought this movie wasis a powerful and moving account of a world war ii mission to save private whose three brothers were killed in actioni think that the most powerful part of this movie was the fact that the huge loss of life that the viewers were confronted with actually did occur for so many years the world was bogged down in war and mothers wives sisters daughters and the like lost some of the men that meant the most to themis one of those movies you have got to see to miss this flick is a tragedy perhaps if we are reminded of how horrific war is the world will think twice about having another one,reality
this is no doubt spielbergs best one i have seen most of his movies and this is truly something i left the theater crying i dont never cry on movies the first action scene of this movie is nothing like i have ever seen go watch this movie this is the best war movie ever made you are going to thank me after you watch this great masterpiece,reality
first person perspective shaky camera cinematography ala tvs nypd blue distracts the viewer rather than enhances mainly during the beachhead scene a lot of the motion of the camera should have been steadied anyone running usually does not see the world as a shaky messoverall a very gory account of what war is but is it necessary,reality
this film is an amazing piece of film the first thirty minutes are at the height of cinema anywhere  sound design is awesome however the film continues from such a prodigious sequence and actually improves as we get to know the finely constructed characters the film is a visual masterpiece more than complimenting any of the dialogue no one can tell a story through images like spielberg can and thats why people call him simplistic however only high minded critics that want a greater text would say this  in reality the great text comes through the images which is what film is really aboutthe battle sequences are constructed with greatness the editing is outstanding especially the sound editing which is amazing the fearsecurity contrast that spielberg always uses is demonstrated between the sound of the bullets in combat and the ticking of the typewriters another bullet like sound used effectively is the rain drops this is undoubtedly a great film it is in my mind highly antiwar and the first thirty minutes are perhaps the most eloquent statement of that  for no other film maker has really captured an antiwar message by expressing the sheer chaos of an event that saw thousands sacrificed before they even got out of the landing craft this film will raise many issues and ignite much debate  the film may look deceptively simple but behind it lie many issues that run very deep,reality
in a way that only spielberg could really if the man wants to be realistic you can expect reality nothing in recent memory can surpass the impact of that beach landing carnage its the hideous laughing face of war personified and seeing that is the most disturbing aspect of this filmunfortunately i have to agree that the work as a whole seemed flawed to put it bluntly its a story reminiscent of an episode of combat now that someone brought it up plus some moviescale battle scenes all bound by that flashback structure it all held together all right but just a tad less satisfactorily its painfully yet distantly similar to what titanic suffered fromnonetheless high production values allround good performances and an undeniable capacity to put you right there in the middle of the action the apprehension was almost unbearable during the early moments of the final battle far outweigh the gripes heck i still ended up giving it an 810 thats a go watch it rating,reality
this is spielbergs best film since schindlers list  as with all his wwii movies spielberg gets his best performances out of his actors  tom hanks does more with his eyes in this movie than most actors can do period like 99 of all war films is a protest film  it tells us why we should not go to war simply by showing us what war really is,reality
it has been six days since i saw and not an hour has gone by that i have not replayed a scene of the movie in my head  never before has a movie touched my inner spirit as spr  it is an explosive film that fills the viewer with such ghastly images that you are left numb with astonishment  filmmaker steven spielberg has given us the most realistic horrific and true vision of war we as an audience may ever see     as a college student studying to be a teacher i pray that one day this film will be required viewing for all history students     please see this film  if not for the sheer entertainment of seeing the highest standard of filmmaking this year possibly ever see it out of respect for the millions of men and women who gave their lives for our way of life     sometimes we must spend a little time in someone elses life to learn their story,reality
i am a 15year old boy living in brisbane australia i have had no experience with war and i dont often watch war movies id heard reviews and so i was anticipating a good flick and the fact that the first day of its season coincided with my end of exams we thought wed celebrate with a movie we picked the wrong one let me just say this is a phenomenal movie but not one to celebrate with myself and three of my friends were completely wiped out by the impact of this movie ive only seen it once and i havent yet had the courage to see it again i felt almost sick during the movie  it totally wrenched all life out of me i was exhausted by the end completely obliterated i never thought anything could have an impact on me like this i will see it again and perhaps i will be able to appreciate the detail and finer points of the movie i will now devote my life to never taking part in war afterwards i could not understand how anyone could possibly go to war as an infantryman and expect or hope to survive the honesty of the film allowed me to realise how awful war is images are permanently burnt into your brain leaving you to contemplate by yourself see this movie now if you havent already but as i said earlier by no means expect this movie to be light and entertaining please email me if you feel the same way after seeing this movie glen maddern,reality
spielberg has without doubt an extraordinary talent to put together images and visual structure in a film unfortunately the same cannot always be said of his ability to develop character or present the complexities of human chaos spr attacks the senses with a stunning opening sequence that conveys the noise and confusion of battle but as soon as the film has to concentrate on the characters and their motivations it sinks into a grossly jingoistic and sentimentalised version of history in which every company in the american army is made up of a representative of each personality type america saves the free world three cheers from the ever grateful british french dutch etc etc and where were the civilians in all of this and the enemy the germans are barely onedimensional caricatures of monsters and bufoons they are so much the other that the battle tanks resemble flying saucers from a 1950s scifi cartoon remember that a good old gi sock can beat the might of german demonic technology we even have the cavalry in this case the airstrike coming to the rescue in the final reelhave we grown up at all  it would appear not  maybe spielberg just cant help himself but to regard this as anything more than a hopelessly naive patronising and illconsidered attempt to present war as the true measure of a man not women you may note is to be blind to the world outside norman rockwell apple pie and the great american dreamwhat is most distressing is that spielberg has the eye and ear of perhaps millions of people and they may come away believing that this is history because of the apparent verisimilitude of the battle scenes in particularthis fundamentally flawed film flatters to deceive there is less to it than meets the eye,reality
this is a masterpiece after schindlers list mr spielberg may have created the next big oscar winneri would venture to add that if spr fails to win more oscars than that pathetic excuse for a multiple oscar winner titanic then i say the members of the academy board should all just resignfirst the bad things although mr spielberg showed both sides of the story and the atrocities committed by each you cant help but notice the obvious american bias this movie has that flying american flag before the closing credits sure proclaimed to the world that america is kingi also cant help but point out the flawed way by which the film relied on the flashback vehicle the movie was seen through the eyes of one of those involved but the thing is he never had first hand knowledge of some of the events that transpired it could have been better if two men met in the cemetery and recalled the eventsalthough tom hanks acting once again shows through the movie did not quite fully utilize his wonderful gift ditto for matt damons character tom sizemores was actually betterin any event the portrayal of the horrors which occurred during such a sad and terrible event effectively makes mr spielbergs film a classic it not only is a poignant and honest film but is also a voice for documentarytype films the cinematography was fantastic and the pacing dramatic if you havent seen it yet i urge you to do so if you have then go back and see it again i know i will,reality
i think this movie is a good first step towards making more realistic war movies but it hasnt quite reached there yet i felt that wimpy translator guy would have been a better old man than at the end besides he was there for more than 13 of the time unlike there are a few areas of improvement firstly they need to cut out all that sentimental and bonding crap and find other ways of developing characters rather than just a few silly laughs while retelling old times secondly acknowledge that the enemy in this case the germans were at least partially human and experienced some of the same emotions those heroic americans experienced f hitler man i would like to hear some of the americans say that about their leaders thirdly link those excellent battle sequences with the plot of the movie ohand most importantly dont glorify the war by making all the dead characters look like such big heroes i thought this movie was supposed to be antiwar and i cant believe how was so emotional at the end he had only met miller and co a few hours before the big battle and he barely knew miller or what they went through to save him except that two of their men died and i believe that people dying was rather common during that time oh but i guess it was still pretty good,reality
is without a doubt a mustsee movie because of the message it conveys in the first 30 minutes or so i found myself curling up in my seat cringeing and hoping not to see any more disturbing scenes while still glad that i was merely watching a movie thats how mindblowing it was but i seriously felt that the rest of the movie wasnt all that great it was simply an above average war movie and the remaining 25 hours or so was nowhere near comparable to the first halfhour of the film there was nothing extraordinarily brilliant with the exception of a few of the final battle scenes when i watch a movie for me the most important thing is enjoyment and this movie while being extremely compelling and thought provoking was hardly enjoyable anyone who has seen it would know why nevertheless i had absolutely no idea how the war sequences were choreographed to be so realistic it really makes you feel that you are in the war itself but towards the end spielberg just couldnt resist to put in his trademark sentimentality into the movie and for me that kind of ruined it because it was undoing all the brilliance of the first 30 minutes making it so blatantly obvious that he was trying to make it sentimental and dramatically heroic was in fact glorifying the war which was the exact opposite of what spielberg was trying to convey throughout the entire movie and the nonsense of the final scene made me feel like i was watching another movie written by james cameron despite all the criticisms i still feel this movie is worthy of the recognition it has been getting its brilliance is difficult to deny and personally ill give it 4 out of 5,reality
this was one of the most powerful movies ever made i saw it the first day it was out and my life was changed forever in the wellpublicized opening halfhour you get a sense of the violence and heroism of wwii the opening scenes have the best handheld camera work ever done in film history the low angles and the shakiness add to the feeling of actually being there some of the visuals are extremely touching i had chills for half the movie tom sizemore and ed burns both give great performances squarring off against each other reminesant of elais and barnes in platoon it may sound cheesey but i wasnt the same after this movie it changed me the brutality is evident but if you love movies it wont cloud the plot of this great story i wish there were words to express how i felt after seeing this movie the only thing i could do was want to write my own war moviethe title cant even begin to explain the feeling you get while you see what eight men went through to save one thank you steven speilburg and robert rodat,reality
couldnt be bothered to read all the comments but it seems like everythings been said but i would like to add that whilst spr is a damn good movie and that the actual depiction of war reaches a new level of realism and this is mainly why it is such a landmark movie various parts of it have been ripped off for want of a better expression other better moviesthe shellshocked perspectives where everything goes silent during the intense battlescenes appear to have been lifted from kurosawas far superior ran particularly the much talked about manpicksupseveredarm shotthe inexperienced noninfantry soldier attached to the squad idea was put to far better use by wolfgang peterson in das boot and the basic plot outline doesnt really deviate from the standard ww2 action movies that the film critiquesin the mr showbiz interview spielberg said he was trying not to use the war as a springboard to false adventure but he has instead used the war as a springboard to reexamine the adventure of war the war itself is marginalised the experience of war is the subject and is examined simply through the harrowing recreation of itmr showbiz also compared the films opening scene to that of the wild bunch and it does have the same power the difference is that the latter film would maintain a certain greatness minus the violence whereas spr rides on the power of its opening sceneas pure technique is genius and ranks among the most noble achievements of cinema in recent memory but as an original work of true greatness it is something less 9 out of 10,reality
this was the best war film i have ever seen and i have seen a lot it was inspiring awesome and very true to life on d day,reality
no movie has ever moved me more than  you know a movie is a great portrayal of war when you get shellshocked from watching it  i positively shuddered throughout the entire moviei saw this movie with a friend of mine  normally we stay to watch the entire credits  we make our comments give a rating and go home  i could not move if i wanted to   for several full minutes after the credits had stopped and the lights returned we both remained speechless and motionless it is that powerful  amazing  on the way home it took me a while to notice that i was driving well below the speed limit  my hands gripped the steering wheel tighter than they had ever before when we got home we stood outside my house for two hours simply talking about the movie about war about what it means to be human  any movie that can do all that and then some has got to be the greatest of all time  on this scale a 10  on my scale 98  98 is the highest rating i have ever given a movie,reality
i have to say that the criticisms i have read concerning this movie just dont ring true but some of the praise seems equally wrongthe movie seemingly uses a retrospective method of framing the main action which turns out to be not quite what it seems to say more would give too much away some have called this cheesy but i doubt that anyone would be saying that if titanic hadnt beaten spr to it its effective and sets you up for a plot twist at the end if you still dont get it thats too bad the characters are fleshed out stereotypes because they are representative characters and in a plot thats largely a cog in the whole symbolism of the thing the battle of omaha beach is not relevant for the plot but this is a movie which steps outside its plot its a morality tale not about soldiers but about the modern world where some people are safe because others have died horribly bringing that about this is what the seemingly confusing flashback is about this is what the battle scenes are about and the whole point of the screenplay seems to be to get us to ask ourselves the question that the old man asks at the end of the movie its a shame that nitpicking amateur film critics fail to see the big pictureas for the whole goriness thing thats the way it is gory you are supposed to be horrified not entertained someone described the landing sequence as exciting i dont know whats more frightening the sequence or that response and finally we have a film that pulls no punches and has so much moral ambiguity that we can identify with the characters loathe them and find no fault in them all at the same time i would say brilliant except that its a function of the sheer horrific nature of the circumstances they find themselves in and not something you feel like applaudingall in all this is a movie that should at the very least change the way that the viewer thinks about action movies spielberg has done here for the war and action genres what eastwood did to the western with unforgiven that is to say completely debunked all the old hollywood mythos and glorification with all the tricks in the book spielberg and co have created a nightmare image all from the perspective of its victims ive never seen anything like it spielbergs battlefield is like the industrial revolution gone horribly wrong a huge machine of percussive clashes explosions and fire spitting out buzzing fragments of metal tearing chunks out of masonry landscape and people hell in a can anyone who doesnt walk out of this movie in a state of numb denial muttering never again is already lostsee it,reality
steven spielberg once said if its not on the page its not on the stage he seems to be out to prove this in his last few films and this from the man who made more than one of the best films of all time here it is the first twenty minutes though the most gripping are completely redundant it does nothing for the story which has a good premise but fails to deliver are we suppose to care for any of these people that we know nothing about and the main character tom hanks would like it to stay that way because we dont know the characters we feel less the terror of the war we see it very realistically and well done but we dont feel it and then they have to remind us that everything is strange tom hanks saying that he feels its a surreal situation dont tell us show us then there is spielbergs sentimentality pushed to the limit and over am i a good man tell me ive been a good man enough is enough,reality
first there was a comment from someone about taking their 8 year old stepdaughter to this  yeah lets show a child the horrors of war in a brutally realistic fashion and then tell everyone here what a freakin idiot they are to drag an eight year old to this movie  im a parent and there are films which obviously are ones they should not under any circumstances be exposed to  1they have nightmares  2 they are very very much bothered by many of the scenes and are told dont worry its only a moviealthough its a pretty damn accurate one about a real event with fictional characters  3they are numb to depictions of violence filmed or real  they might not differentiate too much between film or real life and therefore might have a tendency to act in a violent way or be attracted to violence and shock in order to feel something because they are numb most of the timeyou get the ideaokay the film has some flaws the framing device doesnt work particularly well and feels  well like an attempt to do what speilberg in schindlers list  if the movie is a characters memory then why are some scenes not possibly the memory of the characternot a serious flaw but a really unnecessary device to use inthe filmthe characters are not particularly welldrawn and what little back story they do have with the exception of hanks is very cliched stuffthese things dont matter much however overall  it depicts in a gruesomely realistic and emotional way what war is about and thats a feat that has rarely been accomplishedthis is a powerful antiwar film for the coming millennium much as all quiet on the western front was in the 1930sthere is a minimal amount of pathos and sentimentality in the film and what there is although cliched works to some degreethere are some wonderful moments  the man who picks up his own arm or is it leg on the field of battle  the young man who is amazed his helmet has saved his life  he takes off his helmet looks at the dent where the bullet was  and then thats right he gets shot in the head and diesthe nervous breakdown hanks house in the battlethe inability of the interpreter character to be a hero and save someones lifeduring the final battle scene more affecting perhaps because some of the film does resort to cliches  but not here  when you really want it to  when you hope it will   it doesnt making the scene more powerfulbravoplease stop letting your kids see violence in movies  sex and language is one matter and isnt going to hurt them  violence particularly realistic violence not slapstick or cartoon is having an effect on young children  dont bring them to violent films please please please,reality
first of all i want to say that technically in every aspect this was an excellent movie  however i was disappointed with the movie because i went with the wrong intentions  if you want to see this movie for the plot of 8 men saving the lives of 1 and the questions conflicts and emotions that go along with that dont see this movie  i went because i was interested in the sullivan law and the internal conflicts that arise from ithowever if you want to be appalled and emotionally changed by the realities of war this is the movie for you  it is so powerful  during the first twenty minutes there was nothing but horrified silence from the audience with a gasp interjected here and there  the battle scenes were so gory and jarring that i found myself bracing myself for the next battle scene as opposed to concentrating on what little character development there was actually taking placethat leads me to the characters  i thought the acting was excellent but the character development lacking   by the time i actually began to get to know a character or care about him a battle started or he was killed graphically  i thought tom sizemore did an excellent job along with tom hanks  for the whole 15 minutes matt damon was actually onscreen i thought he too was excellenti felt like i ended up paying for 3 hours of camerashaking bloody musicless torture  intellectually i understand that this was an excellent movie but how i felt afterwards was horrible and drained and maybe thats exactly the reaction that spielberg was striving for,reality
this was probably the singularly most effective deterring war movie ever but who was it really about i didnt see a real main character throughout the movie tom hankss character does not have much to do except bark orders and be the remote leader and pvt himself we only get to know after two thirds of the film the only interesting character was the interpreter guy but he was treated like a minor character in the end this means that this movie was about world war 2 which was terrible well i had figured that out before,reality
what can i say i was gobsmacked within five minutes of this fast and frighteningly realistic war movie during the first battlescene on the beach my heart was pounding out of my chest and i was nearly sick in my popcorn the portrayal of the landings was so accurate i could cry i have great knowledge of the dday landings having read books been to france and strolled around the museums for the 50 year anniversary and watched many films and thus i can say with all sincerity that this is the most realsitic yet other films such as the longest day do not really show the full horror of dday whereas in spr i felt as if i was their experiencing the soldiers fear and anguish it was fantastic as for the claims that without the two battlescenes it wouldnt be any good they are rubbish their is still plenty of tense and exciting moments in between to keep me happy anyway if it just consisted of battlescenes all the way through my heart would have packed up also in this months total film two people have written in letters that suggest that spr has no substance and character development i do not agree with these statements as you really have to look into the film and what its about to get something out of it i could tell you something about all of the eight men as the characters were developed in such a way that was probably realistic for the period you have to realise that this is a war film not some movie about a man trapped in a tv show truman show so character development is not as important in this case although it is still crucial for a good film also the cinematography is excellent mr spielberg used a slightly slower film than normal during the battlescenes to give the feeling of speed and this is why i spent the first 30 minutes with my heart in overdrive the direction from mr spielberg was as ever excellent he attempted something new in the portrayal of injuries and deaths guy picking arm up off the beach german sniper knife in chest close up and i was overjoyed yet disturbed for too long film directors have side stepped the brutal reality of war i also liked the way war is not glorified as invariably happens in a war film in all a great movie which had the right blend of ingredients for a war movie and it has now replaced platoon oliver stone as my favourite war movie it is a particuarly exciting  but moving film and i will look upon war in a different light from this day forth,reality
wow one word that sums up the whole film i was totally blown away with it steven spielberg did such a fantastic job with furthur boosted by one of the strongest and best performances in tom hanks career for those of you who manage to sit through the first twentyfive minutes of carnage you will be totally blown away by what one can easily call the greatest war movie of all time i was in awe of the feat steven spielberg has accomplished some may place it alongside schindlers list as his greatest achievement me i rate it higherseeing the film in a cinema with surround sound places the audience in the middle of the dday invasion gruesome as it may be the opening scene may well be looked upon in the future as one of the most memorable and impacting scenes in cinematic history with strong backup performances from the relatively young supporting cast will no doubt go into the 1999 academy awards as favourite to take the honours in several main categories including best actor hanks best director spielberg and best pictureit has opened the door to reality the public can finally see what war was really like frightening some veterans have received counselling after seeing the movie but finally we have a realistic war film rambo apocalypse now the deer hunter none of the myths of war these films have created platoon is the only realistic war film in recent memory yes they are all vietnam movies but give me an example of a decent world war ii movie alongside or even above das boot is a classic world war ii film a modern classic no more no less congratulations to steven spielberg on such a fine effort,reality
no one can deny american movie makers and spielberg is a king can produce the best technical effects in movies   this movie also has some wonderfully personable stars   tom hanks is great and i liked the sergeant too and the human scenes are tastefully understated  no brash posturing here this is hollywood art  but under the beautiful technical veneer is there anything more here than an incoherent collection of clichesis consistent thought or feeling or fundamental honesty too much to ask what is the point of making another movie about world war ii after all this time   what does this movie say that so many others have missed if anything  war is a serious subject  serious is a drastic understatement if you happen to be in one  one that a new generation knows nothing about and it doesnt look as if the world has made any progress in avoiding them since the one depicted herei think its dishonest to play the patriotic sentimentality card with such intensity while claiming credit for condemning war   to show blood and guts is not necessarily to say that war is wrong  only that it is unpleasant or possibly exciting   is shooting prisoners really wrong   or only what you gotta do and the mark of a real man   is war really senseless  or is it a patriotic duty well worth giving your life fori have never been in a war but i promise you war is a lot worse than what you will see here,reality
i loved the movie  it is the best movie of 1998  give that movie at least ten oscars,reality
i would have to agree with everybody that this is a great war movie but i dont think its the best of all time  the war movie that i think is the best of all time is still apocalypse now  other than that i feel that this is a great movie  matt damon did better as the role of private than i thought he would  on the whole i would rate this movie one of the top ten best of all time,reality
this movie is below average it is typical spielberg some of the pictures are very touching and beautiful and the story is told in a way that really gets to you however it is very american no offense to all the americans it is about believing that even in the darkest places there is good in man this is sickenly symbolised by the patriotism of the brave american soldiers who are willing to give their lives for free world the opening scene and the very last shot too is the american star spangled banner blowing in the wind yuck so believe me the story has been told before and tom hanks dos not make it any more interesting,reality
was wonderful  the soundthe handheld cameras everything  speilberg has recreated the method of how to tell a war story for the better  it was a little gory but everyone should see this movie except young children and wwii vets may bring back flashbackstheyve been through enough the only thing i thought was weak about was its charactersin a war movie like platoon youre incredibly horrified to see the characters die because you feel like you actually know them  its like you were there with them  you knew them you felt for them  this was completely absent in  it was still great though  oscar for hanks speilberg the movie itself sound and a best supporting actor for either edward burns or matt damon  oscars all around for this movie  theres no way there will be a better film this year,reality
i cant understand why a lot of moviegoers keep saying that the plot of is too thin  any person who has seen a number of great films will realize that the plot doesnt really matter that much im paraphrasing hitchcock  its the feeling you get from watching it and the characters that you can relate to  its upsetting to see how ignorant some people can be especially when there is so many great emotional moments in this film  and this film wasnt made for the oscars it was made for the soldiers not heroes of wwii,reality
steven speilberg has once again amazed audiences world wide  his newest movie is the most realistic war movie ever made stunning performances from all cast members especially tom hanks who should win the academy award tom sizemore and newcomer barry pepper  the realistic first twenty minutes and the last battle are incomparable to any movie ever made  this movie is not antigerman but antiwar a first in a long time this movie does not glorify death but shows it as it is especially in war horrible  this is an amazing movie that should be shown to all children to show them that death is not glamorous contrary to most movies news and tv shows show it to be,reality

my 8 year old stepdaughter and i went to see this film  we both thought that it was great but long winded  the first scene kept us glued to the screen but after that the movie lost its edgetom hanks has done it again  he gets better and better with every movie,reality
i watched this really great movie on its opening night and i must say that this is the best movie that i have seen ever the first 20 minutes really puts you there at omaha beach with all the chaos and  bloodshed  tom hanks acting was the best one i have seen yet and this movie is a true masterpiece only steven spielberg can make  ive seen this movie twice already and i plan to see it again and this is one rare movie where you want to watch it over and over again  this movie is not proamerica or antigerman  what this movie shows is the suffering and hardships the people suffered in world war ii and that every life is worth saving  this is one movie that i would choose over titanic anytime,reality
i cant see why everyone thought this movie was so great the plot was improbable and the whole movie was two big battles spewn together over 3 hours there was no real drama to it on the plus side the acting was okay and the characters were enjoyable but overall just a senseless war movie,reality
is one of the most frighteningly realistic movies i have ever seen the sound effects are awesome you almost feel as if you are there with bullets zipping around you the visual fx are excellent and more importantly realistic and believable i have only two problems with spr 1 it seemed as though the only people in normandy were the germans and the americans what about the british canadians and all the others that fought 2 the jeeps and troops which all of a sudden appear when the p51s arrived other than that i thoroughly enjoyed this movie congratulations to spielberg this film deserves at least the following oscars best picture best sound editing best visual effects best score and a swag of others which i cant remember,reality
if someone expects a movie to capture the real feelings events and horror of what wwii soldiers felt during the war then they had better reevaluate their own reality  it is true no movie can ever give true credit to the real feelings of wwii soldiers but seems to come closei have never been close to being in a war or even in the military but has given me new respect not only of wwii but of all our armed forces today  in these days it seems freedom in america is something that almost has naturally always existed most children and teens dont realize the sacrifice that has been made to bring about that freedom steven spielberg has crafted a movie to bring that lost reality of war to us who do not fully understand the terror of it  the details in this movie especially in the opening battle scene allowed me some idea although can never do justice of what my grandfathers had to endure i was truly impacted in more ways than i had expected before viewing the movie  this movie has succeeded in making people think seriously about life and death and what it all means  i think we need more of that in america i have to say this is my favorite movie of all time but i hate the fact that it ever had to exist in the first place,reality
this is a very good movie it depicts war in the way that general sherman described it all hell there are some terrific scenes and a lot to talk about afterwards there is a lot of gore especially at the beginning but i didnt have as much of a problem with that as i had imagined i would other scenes made me more uncomfortable which was good i should be uncomfortable with themi had a problem with the presentday bookends they were ok but too sweet and there were some places where i think the movie told us too much which always seems to me like the easy way out show us instead i had a line or two that didnt ring true for me one was too modern sounding too funny i assume it was adlibbed there were a couple of details that didnt ring true and there is at least one major detail that my coworkers did not get is the guy whothe same guy whothe same guy who or are there three different guys each of us sees it differentlysoits really powerful and i think people should see it to get a feel for history but its not the best movie of the year nor is it spielbergs best movie truman show is better this year and schindlers list is spielbergs best that ive seen,reality
the most intense battle recreation i have witnessed superbly choreographed the sdds puts you in the middle of it,reality
there is no doubt that the movie has some great warscenes but it becomes to much in the end furthermore the story is very poor and has no surprises,reality
never ive experienced a similar feeling watching movies i was anguished for the rest of the night this is actually virtual reality,reality
this movie really says give us all the oscars the effects are good but this movie is made to win all the oscars and thats why its not that good but i still have to say that its the best second world war movie ive ever seen,reality
no human being of the face of gods good planet with the exception of the men who actually stormed  bloody omaha can make an objective observation of the scenes in this movie it is beyond explanation and understanding  we actually do a  disservice to these brave young men by attempting to read their psyche and lend a certain amount of honor and glory to a most brutal time  young men of all nationalities died that day not just at omaha but at juneau gold and sword beaches  lets pay homage to all of them,reality
being an amateur historian spr confirmed a lesson i had already learned next time the usa gets into a war  win it  and dont let up or pull punches until the enemy is beaten and knows hes beaten  fdr was the last us president who could make up his mind to win a war  truman split the difference in korea  granted a good move in an uncertain world  lbj sent millions into a war he had absolutely no intention of winning or even settling for a koreastyle armistice  bush with his hazy myopic talk about some new world order and the vision thing is now unemployed while saddam hussein still butchers iraqi civilians and blames the un read us for it  and clinton  great at negotiating a peace for those who want peace  but for those who donti refer of course to the scene dripping with facetoface hate where the german ss trooper betcha didnt notice he was whom they let go on a promise to turn himself in beeee good shoots and knifes some of them while the last one sits in a soiled diaper of his own fear and selfpity minerva was the grecoroman goddess of wisdom  she was also the gs of just wars  but this was the image of mars the god of combat in war  even von clausewitz refers to the hate in combatpause  deep breaththat much said i have to agree with just about every comment on spr  the story is weak  the bits with the flags and the strings are maudlin to say the least  and all the other stuff about plot developmentcharacter development  yes spielberg himself admitted it took the disillusionment of the vietnam war to make this movie yet he still blatantly tugs at your heartstrings  hes been doing that since et  ive long since learned to ignore his saccharine ploys  and yes this is one of the best movies ever made even if there were better war or antiwar pics made  only the battle scenes really make this movie  it should get the oscar for cinematographybut the thing i got from spr throughout was from the characters griping about why they should risk their necks for one man  the general theme of the movie appears to me at any rate to be this  better be worth it  the universal gripe from the universal soldier  now you tell me is any of this  worth your neck or mine if your side has absolutely no intent of winning or even getting something out of all this  the us military morale went down the toilet after 1968 and spent the 70s in a druginduced haze  it took reagans 1980s buildup to rebuild morale  without it the gulf war would never have been so onesidedno im no soldier nor some fascist warfreak in a rathole filled with whitetrashmilitia collectables  ive watched the horrors of war comfortably on my tv or my pc just like many of us surfing this site  im as revulsed as anyone else at the pictures and the newsstories  i get an impotent rage demanding do something powersthatbe knowing full well they have no idea what to do given the limits they set on themselves  im as propeace as they come  but im also progoodsense  not just commonsense  there was a difference between chamberlain and churchill one saw hell coming and tried to buy it off the other saw it coming and said get ready  and this certainly was a disciple of minervapause again  another deep breathid say more but the guys with the butterfly nets have traced me  just let me sign off by saying that if we want a world at peace then we best make our minds up to make that peace and enforce it  nobody did in the 1930s thats why there was a second world warone other thing  i wonder how will spr play on homevideo  will it be as horrifying,reality
i still am unsure as to whether or not i gained anything out of the movie true war is horrible and absurd but i dont need to see a halfhour gore fest  to realize this the simple idea of complete strangers shooting at eachother is enough in truth if spielburg intended to bring us to a moral realization by grossing us out it is insulting and i highly doubt spielburg meant to do this                i think spielburg wanted to give us a new glass with which to comtemplate war specifically cowardice the last halfhour haunts me the most because it raised the question is cowardice a vice or a virtue or more specifically is cowardice the only sane thing in war,reality
what a great movie it was i see it this afternoon and i have comment spielberg can do anything and anything he do is great and spectacular 4 stars out of 4,reality
is the best film i have ever seen  it is unforgettable i really cannot wait to see it for a third time  the second time i saw it it had the same effect as when i saw it the first time  everybody has to see this film,reality
is not only the best war movie ever made it is the best movie ever made  tom hanks is superb and so is his supporting cast  i especially liked the performances by giovanni ribisi and barry pepper  this movie is sure to win best picture and steven spielberg tom hanks and jeremy davies already have their oscar acceptance speeches memorized if you have not seen this movie yet see it now,reality
well titanic beat this i dont care how many awards you got this one takes my vote after watching this i decided not to join the army this movie earns  stars from me,reality
quite simply the best film i have ever seen  i have never been that interested in war movies before with the exception of most vietnam movies but this really has changed my prospective on them  i will look at most war movies made and compare them to this though i doubt they will ever come close the battle scenes in this movie were unbelievable  they were so realistic it made you feel like you were experiencing some of what these soldiers had to go through especially the opening scene  i have an uncle who has been interested in world war ii for as long as i can remember  he was so fascinated by this war that he had tousands of pounds worth of memorabilia of it including medals guns knives and uniforms he is also a great critic of movies rarely saying that any movie was good so i was pleasantly surprised to hear him say that he thought that this was the best war movie ever made and that it contained scenes that could never be topped it was brilliantly acted bringing what should be at least two oscar nominations for acting roles  elsewhere i am hoping it will clean up at the oscars deserving them more than a lot of recent oscar winning films have done  it will take some doing to better this film  i only wonder what terrence malicks the thin red line is going to compare,reality
this film puts to rest all previous war movies the usual spielbergs superb technique had made the greatest war movie that shows real war every sane person should avoid although it is very intense it is very touchy the performance of hanks is brilliant as usual,reality
i am growing very weary of these spielberg films that are just jam packed with emotional pauses its just too much okay i can accept a few important moments in a film in which the background music winds up and the action slows down and we get a poignant moment but these films have one of these moments on average about every five minutes this film was bad enough but amistad was far worse,reality
now i know that i am in the minority but i left extremely disappointed  i loved the first half hour and the last half hour but the remaining two hours was a drawn out generic film with poor character development and a throwaway plot  the only character who evoked any emotion was jeremy davies overly sympathetic translator  all the rest were a bunch of bad hollywood stereotypes the guy from brooklyn the hardass the mysterious commander etc  and the acting made the movie even worse  i love ed burns as a director but think he is awful as an actor especially after viewing this film and tom hanks assumed his standard heroic role doing little to draw all of the oscar attention that has come his way the two portions that made this movie worthwhile were the two battle scenes in which spielberg masterfully placed us in this horrifying world but i would have been just as satisfied if the movie consisted of just these two parts leaving out all the excess garbage  and with that you can proceed to hunt me down and have me tarred and feathered,reality
this is a visually effective war film the best i have ever seen  the actors were topnotch  finally edward burns will get recognized for the brilliant talent he is  tom hanks gave a better performance here than in forrest gump  usually i hate watching movies that are three hours long but watching this film i wanted it to be longer  a much better film than the overlyhyped titanic this is steven spielbergs very best motion picture  if there was a movie to sweep the oscars this year i hope it will be saving private,reality
this is quite simply the best movie ive ever seen  it does not promote war nor is it an antiwar movie  this is a movie about duty  everyone must do their duty  even if that duty leads to death   if we are to enjoy the freedom that we have  my friends and  i could put ourselves into the movie very easily  as we are the age of the average american soldier in ww2 when the car crawls down mrss driveway we could all see that car coming to our house  we all wondered how we would react in the situation god willing we wont ever have to do anything like this and how we would handle seeing our friends die in front of us  for young men like us  this is an especially potent movie  a week has passed and this movie still makes us think about all the messages the movie conveys this film makes no excuses and presents a refreshingly gritty  realistic version of war that lacks a lot of the usual hollywood slickness and cliches  the next day in rotc we discussed this movie with our nsi  maj aguilar and still could not get over saving private rayn   kudos to mr spielberg and company  i hope you get the oscar you deserve for this because god knows they cheated you out of a couple before,reality
great gory realistic battle scenes  some unrealistic stupidity in the plot gee all my bros are dead  think ill stay here and get killed too etc bad guys baaaaad  good guys gooood not a word about the fact that both sides sent kids into a meat grinder that kids on boths sides were scared as hell  the one german we are supposed to feel something about comes back later to kill kill killand when push comes to shove and the bridge should have been blownpoor plan  cmon guys  were these guys supposed to be idiots  i can think of a lot more defensible positions  solutionsgo see a midnight clear as it is a better movie in many respects and tries to leave you with the notion that the enemy were little different than ourselvesthis movie was good but left me without much feeling  deer hunter das boot and patton made me feel something  heck  even the older movies with limited hightech effects such as great escape twelveoclock high and stalag 17 made me feel something more than this movie made me feelnowhere near as powerful as titanic so i hope this one does not get stuffed down our throats as best picture,reality
i have been reading some of the comments posted within the imdb and i am not surprised to see a line drawn in the sand many of my american compatriots have declared this movie to be amazing moving and eyeopening on the other side of the pond we get comments like i hated it this is nowhere near to be called the greatest war movie ever made this all depends on where you grew up in the united states during the time of war wwii did not happen to us we went to fight an injustice on another shore in another world from where we were our fathers brothers and sons were dying for something that indirectly affected us so in order to make it palpable for american viewpoints the hollywood machines glossed over it glamourized it and made it bland for years we were fed this malarkey about the glory of war how our boys went over and blah blah blah this the first true representation of what our men did in this most unholy of campaigns it pulls no punches all the shades are pulled up the veil is lifted we in this idyllic bubble had no earthly idea we did not see firsthand the aftermath the tears the rebuilding that all happened over there according to our myths we went in kicked butt left and became a world power thats it no one ever talked about it except while waving an american flag to one of the many who believed the halftruth it was not just a sock in the jaw but a punch in the stomach as well the kind that knocks the wind out of you for what its worth this has been a long time coming we saw the inhumanness of it all some of my european brothers have complained that this portrayed the germans in a bad light that maybe so but for once the bad light has surrounded our viewpoint as well we are not the saviours of the world that we thought were this is the truth we were shielded from for our own good as it were the truth hurts and now 50 years too late we can finally weep with you as members of the same family thank you mr spielberg for showing us the way,reality
first this is a good movie i gave it an eight out of ten but to all of you who have called it the greatest warmovie ever you havent seen enough movies it may be the best american warmovie but it isnt nearly as good as for example stalingrad or das boot it starts out very good the famous first twenty minutes are really very good but then it deteriorates steadily especially it is very onesided some people say its an antiwar movie i cant agree with that this movie shows only the allied soldiers as human and the germans as faceless monsters the real horror of war is that there are ordinary scared young men on both sides this dimension is lost completely in this movie,reality
i dont know if it is the better war film ever made i dont know if other ones can make a better film from now i have a before and after saving i think all the people must see this film to know what happened in a war and think more before to support one in this movie we can see all the suffering the agony of anyone who stay in a war thank youmario,reality
best war movie ever done fantastic first 30 minutes very realistic thats the real dday,reality
it isnt often that i leave a movie theater with a new appreciation of life but that is what has given me  i remember driving home afterward in silence just staring at all the beauty around me and think my god i am so lucky to be alive  not only was this a brilliantly filmed movie technically but its message was so extremely powerful and necessary in a world such as ours  the vast majority of americans who have never experienced the horrors of war firsthand learn their history from textbooks which emphasize only the facts surrounding certain battles and the figures of generals who rarely fight in the trenches alongside the ordinary men  shows us the experiences of those men in graphic terrible detail and begs the question  how could these men no different from you or i transcend themselves and rise to the occasion in these terribly unordinary circumstances  this film just as in schindlers list perhaps the only film of the 1990s that equals sprs brilliance in filming and emotional intensity demonstrates the fundamental goodness of man and the endurance of the human spirit in the face of overwhelming adversity  i will not go so far to say that the film is perfect  even the greatest film has flaws and spr is no exception  but its technical merits and sheer emotional power more than make up for any of its defects  all in all it is as many have said before me a masterpiece  a film that will be remembered by me and hopefully by every american for a long long time,reality
never have i been so affected by a movie to know in part the price our fathers paid for us to live as we do is staggering i left the theatre with a form of shell shock that made my serene life in america seem surreal  i can only say thank you with all my heart to the men and women who fought and died worked and cried through a horrific war that was won only by the grace of god  thank you thank you,reality
this movie is great  i love the scene with the semiwar in the battered town  if you havent seen this movie before you will stay on the edge of your seat till the end,reality
i watched the movie today and i was quite surprised about the violence shown in it im not unused to that but seeing this and knowing that it was and is reality was a real hard trip however i think its ok to show how brutal war is in the real world maybe its good for all the youngsters to see that a man who was shot isnt dead at once and how war really works is no movie about heroes and clean fights with some blood running down the cheeks its reality how it was and how it is and its worth seeing it,reality
actually the oneliner actually covers it  growing up at a time when personal sacrifice is not emphasized or encouraged among the youth of america gives me a new sense of what the generation of my grandparents went through so i could know the world as it is today from the movie point of view this is definitely an excellent movie spielberg has mastered the art and he proves it yet again with a new style of cinematography putting the audience in the foxhole with the soldier instead of on the outside looking in  a masterful performance is turned in by ed burns but the real art comes from tom sizemore jeremy davies and of course tom hanks  though matt damon is one of the headliners his performance is short and solid but lacks the great emotion that earns oscars  the great performances in my opinion are by jeremy davies who masterfully portrays an unexperienced soldiertranslator in the heat of battle and by tom sizemore who portrays a hard core experienced loyal sergeant that hasnt been seen in the movies since john wayneeveryone should see this movie at least once in their lives  the acting is great the story is great and the realism is shocking  its wrenching tale and realistic portrayal of war should give everyone a new appreciation for the american flag and for the independence we call freedom,reality
wow for just under 3 hours i laughed i cried i was on the edge of my seat and i was craving a cigarette  this is the most exhausting movie i have ever seen  i staggered out of the theatre a shadow of my former self  i dont know if i have the stamina to see it again but dont wait for the video  the big screen is the only place this movie belongs phew,reality
wow one word that sums up the whole film i was totally blown away with it steven spielberg did such a fantastic job with furthur boosted by one of the strongest and best performances in tom hanks career for those of you who manage to sit through the first twentyfive minutes of carnage you will be totally blown away by what one can easily call the greatest war movie of all time i was in awe of the feat steven spielberg has accomplished some may place it alongside schindlers list as his greatest achievement me i rate it higherseeing the film in a cinema with surround sound places the audience in the middle of the dday invasion gruesome as it may be the opening scene may well be looked upon in the future as one of the most memorable and impacting scenes in cinematic history with strong backup performances from the relatively young supporting cast will no doubt go into the 1999 academy awards as favourite to take the honours in several main categories including best actor hanks best director spielberg and best pictureit has opened the door to reality the public can finally see what war was really like frightening some veterans have received counselling after seeing the movie but finally we have a realistic war film rambo apocalypse now the deer hunter none of the myths of war these films have created yes they are all vietnam movies but give me an example of a decent world war ii movie alongside or even above das boot and perhaps platoon is a classic war film a modern classic no more no less congratulations to steven spielberg on such a fine effort,reality
hi there i ve now seen it twice and the only thing i can say about it is that this is one of the best movies ever made although it is very graphic spielberg doesnt celebrate the violence he just shows how it must have been my favorite for the academy awards best movie best director best camera and maybe best actor you have to see this onehave fun christoph,reality
just a few weeks i saw the movie save the private i feel the great in this movie is realism on visual and sound after the beach battle the movie is very bad i have seen the movie five times but only first time i saw all film next times i saw only the first 25 minutes movie i really felt like a soldier inside normandie battleif the movie would begin after the battle beach the movie would been mediocre simply like a tv seriesthe director forgets allies i cant identify french soldiers british soldiers and so on,reality
never have i experienced something like this in a theater  i definitely have a lot more respect for the ones who have fought wars for this country the effects are as real as possiblei hope  what really makes this movie great though is beyond the effects the direction and the acting it is the tone of insanity that is felt throughout the whole film  nothing makes any sense especially the plot  this is what makes the movie so convincing,reality
amazing use of the camera during the 30 minutes on omaha beach sometimes underwater sometimes onboard the vessel scary sounds from the bullets hitting metal flesh anywhere i felt really sick during this massacre  as if i was hit by a glove in the belly and the story goes on why saving one private and risking the life of a handful of other soldiers during this mission a moral dilemma  in the hands of a master director steven spielberg my opinion is this in short the best antiwar movie ive ever seen oscar best movie best director 1998,reality
steven splielberg has again created a masterpiece that not only gives us a accurate potrail of the horrors that occurred during the warbut also sends out a plea human kind to understand that no one wins in wara steller castlead by tom hanksall give awardworthy performances that should elevate their careers to new heights with the realistic scenessteller cast and steven spielberg at the helmthis movie is the best movie you will see this yeardont miss this movie,reality
it is one of the best films i have ever watched i was completely speechless i think every one of us should see it maybe we can avoid a new war,reality
over the last 20odd years speilberg has provided us with some of the most memorable moments in the cinema from jaws through close encounters et indiana jones and most of all schindlers list now he has added another milestone saving privatethis film in the first half hour must come as close to showing the full brutality of war as anything ever seen before despite an occasional soggy middle section in the opening sequences he fully makes up for any short comings that the film may otherwise  havewith his track record now i await the time when he makes his true masterpiece and ditches his more saccharine elements in the meantime there is still plenty to appreciateps i liked amistad as well,reality
none better none equal,reality
ive been recommending this film from the minute i left the movie theatre  only a true master can give the audience such a shocking experience as does spielberg with the first scene in private  this film will become a classic on its own right,reality
its without a doubt the best war epic since all quiet on the western front 1930 the opening with dday is perhaps the most skillfully made movie sequence of all time a terrific film,reality
this is a movie on the magnitude of schindlers list  mr spielberg seems to want to make the definitive movie in many categories and he is certainly succeeding  there is no flaw to this film,reality
not bad pretty much sums it up i wasnt even alive during wwii but i think this movie gave me a good idea of what it might have been like much better than any other wwii movie still thats pretty much it its a very realistic movie in many ways but reality doesnt usually have a good plot and neither did this movie and some of the scenes were way longer than they had to bei still think that everyone should see it though and it must be viewed on the big screen a tv wont do,reality
this is the greatest war movie and one of my personal favourites and i dont even like war movies that much  this should easily be the best film of the year,reality
steven spielberg has done the most impressive scarry and disturbing movie of the year the film deserves oscars for makeupdesign cinematography sound sound effects editing actor tom hanks editing director and best picture of the year ps the first half hour is film history,reality
know this was really good the story the effects the directing everything was superbit is a movie for those of you who have stomachs for blowed up people heads blowing arms ripped aparteveryone should see this film anyway its about war and what a war does to people its very effectfull but if you think for a minute youll see that war is probably even worseits an extremely good movie its a 10 on a scale of 010loved it steven youve done it again gonna thank you for your academy award before you get it but you will,reality
this film is an attack on your senses the first half hour should be shown to all the world that all wars may end this film has you glued to the seat and everyone in the movie theatre is dead quiet the sheer magnitude of the events depicted in this film are beyond all imagination and can only leave you feeling awed hanks is just outstandingnot since shindlers list i think has there been a war movie so powerful andantiwardont miss it,reality
ive seen a lot of war movies  but this one is the best ever i think that all of the involved had done a wonderful work especially tom hanks he is the best in the whole movie,reality
i am quite disappointed to hear that is being described as the greatest war film ever made it is very simply the greatest film ever made i personally have never viewed a film that inspires more raw emotion than this gripping tale of risking eight men to save one i am glad to see that dreamworks skg has finally gotten its act together and developed a high caliber motion picture the graphic quality of this wwii tale exposes war for what it is not some heroic venture in the realm of personal glory but a horrific combination of death and destruction the use of hand held cameras and dulled color themes only enhances the experience almost to the point of suggesting that the audience is there with capt miller and his men to witness the terror first hand i truly regard steven spielberg as a genius and at the same time cannot imagine any circumstance that would prevent this film from receiving the academys best picture award in short is an amazing work of art that cannot be adequately described in words so go see it youll cherish the experience,reality
ive seen dozens of war movies but never anything like this before ive read lots of comments before i actually saw the movie especially those of veterans who said this is how it really was  i couldnt quite imagine what i was about to see now i can  i will never forget these unique pictures and the brilliant acting of all these guys who gave me an idea of what those people went through 54 years before to me its another masterpiece of a man who jumps from genre to genre and never ever disappoints thank you steven,reality
after watching this movie im both happy and sad that i didnt do my military service happy because it showed all the terror about war and sad because i know ive missed out on the great comradeship between soldiers spr really shatters the image of wars being about just sending out troups to defend or conquer a territory it shows every soldiers own battles to survive and to overcome their own fears a truly grueling movie experience,reality
far and away this movie has to be one of the best speilberg does it yet again with this long but very real movie it hits you like a ton of bricks and puts you right into the action he makes you feel the pain they feel and makes you feel determined yourself to go and find this guy yourself the special effects are by far some of the most advanced i have yet to see it wakes you up to the fact that war is not a game if only more people would take the message that speilberg is trying to put forward it would be a better worldif just 20 people got his message instead of this was good that was bad and really listened to what he is saying in his movies it would make a difference a wonderful speilbergian masterpeice as usual with a very heartfelt genuine and most effectual message i was completely exhausted after exiting the theater as if i had just been through the most awful fight of my life,reality
if you are exmilitary this movie will make you wince and you will find tears in your eyes at several places in the movie especially the ending you will curse the coward who causes the death of the tom hanks character and others and be disappointed when he does not get killed if you had relatives in world war ii you will gain a new respect for what those relatives went through so that you could be there to see that movie  this is a spielberg masterpiece and the only movie that i have ever given a 10 out of 10 rating dont take your subteen children to this movie  it is too intense and they wont understand it  the plain fact is the older you are the more you will appreciate it  my grown children and the children of my brothers and sister have seen it and were very much impressed  one nephewniece are having their american flag signed by all their friends and relatives who are military or exmilitary  dont know if it happened everywhere but the people in the theater were very  quiet and subdued before the movie and the same after the movie  it was almost like any noise would have been a sign of disrespect  i was moved,reality
i went to see this film when it was first released in the us  like many others i was shocked and sickened at what was presented on the screen during the invasion sequence  for the rest of the film i sat in a trancelike state unable to comprehend what i was seeing  i left the theartre empty and cold  however for the next few days i couldnt stop thinking about it  the movie invaded every conscience moment and i couldnt shake the feeling that i had missed something profoundthe following weekend i decided to see it again  im glad i did because it was a totally different experience for me  symbolism plays a huge part in and most of it along with character development is extremely subtle  pay close attention to the soldiers expressions and actions and you will learn more about them then by anything that they say sure there were slow boring stretches in the movie  spielberg intentions was for the viewer to experience the war as well as can be done in a film  from a soldiers standpoint  how many boring moments do you think a soldier had to endure keeping watch for the enemy or snaking across the countryside  quite a few i suppose  and just how chatty do you think war was  i doubt soldiers spouted their life stories off to their fellow comrades  and talking with ww2 vets including my grandfather the germans right or wrong were nameless faceless enemies  i feel that these instances were portrayed fairly accurately in spri feel this movie requires a second viewing  it will give you a chance to remove  yourself from the violence and pay closer attention to other details  then compare your reactions   i doubt that spielbergs point of this movie was that war is hell  that analogy is too simplistic an easy synopsis to come up with when we are presented with material that actually requires some thought,reality
i have been waiting for a movie like this to be made and its about timeit is about time that the glory was removed  from the notion of war and the abject horror be made clearthis is less of a movie and more of an experience when  i left the theatre i truly needed a week to recover form the images and ideasa must see at all recruiting stations,reality
ive read some comments on the plot lacking believability so i feel its imperative that i inform you plot junkies that the events depicted in are based on historical fact  the us government did in fact attempt to prevent the destruction of entire familial lines and in many cases the only way to retrieve those personnel was to send out small units to track them down  the fact that some find the events depicted in incredulous merely reinforces the superb nature of the structure and content in this filmthis was handsdown the best war movie ive ever seen  i wept buckets at the endafterwards finding myself walking around my beautiful city comparing it to the ravaged french landscapes presented in spielbergs masterpiece  how fortunate my generation is to have been spared such a calamitous sacrifice and how trivial all of our concerns are when contrasted with the tribulations faced by all those who witnessed or served in the wars of generations past,reality
this wonderful film and maybe the greatest sequence in all of cinema the 25minute attack on normandy intense bloody realistic and great directing combine to make that scene stupendous not to mention the performances by jeremy davies and tom hanks this 3 hour war epic had many people in tears and other viewers such as myself in complete awe,reality
as a person born just after the vietnam war ive never had do go through an extended conflict  the gulf war just doesnt seem to be the worst thing weve ever been through as a country at war  so for me to sit in this theater and feel like the war was all around me and i couldnt escape it any more than the characters could gave me a whole new perspective on war during the movie i was a bit embarrassed at how much i was reacting to the violence until i realized that that small amount of embarrassment was worth the lesson i learned that night  this movie is the closest ive ever felt to veterans without suiting up and holding a gun myself  memorial day is no longer a day off for me its a day to see this movie and reflect on the sacrifice of our nations heros,reality
in contradiction to what all the critics are saying spr is not that best war movie ever even though in the first half hour spielberg gives a superb and intense view of what the insanity of war should be like he fails to really move you in the rest of the film because after that first episode the movie slowly degrades to a sort of action movie in which way too many cliches have to be met you instantly feel what the outcome will be of ever dilemma that is faced during the travel the movie really does therefore not make a lasting impression as did some other films in this genre like platoon it is simply not convincing enough nor creative in picturing all the horrible events of war,reality
this is an amazingly good film  the opening 20 minutes is wonderful in its horror  and the liebestod is almost erotic in a bizarre sort of way,reality
the movie was great it was moving semirealistic and had a cast i could really get into unfortunately thats overshadowed by the belief many moviegoers have that it is based on a true story very little in fact almost none of the movie is fact its a great watch though for anyone whos ever wondered about the horrors that can occur in a war and the devastation that families can go through,reality
this may be the best film ive ever seen a film which gives me so much thoughts and feelings although the film is a little bit too cruel and fleshly but it is a good media to let people think about the reality of a war a campaign that can ruin millions of lives and souls the most horrible thing to take part in a war is not being killed but to watch the others died one by one besides your feet think of it they are flesh and blood not the characters in the tv games should they be killed just for one or two peoples foolish decision they all have families they are innocent i appreciate with the decision about that chief marshal to save private and send him home at any cost he didnt mind to sacrifice 8 soldiers for giving console to the old lady with 3 sons already died in the battle fieldssteven spielberg has produced a very great movie different from the other scientific films he had ever made but it is a most touching film that give a good lesson to most of the people it makes me think about the song where have all the flowers gone yes there are still battles even in this modern world still destroying millions of spirits and families when will they ever learn,reality
it starts as a good antiwar movie graphic depictions of what a bullet really doesetc but at some points we are subjected to  glory scenes which destroy the feeling of abhorrence gained in the first 30 minutes it is truly a great war movie it has a very basic story line it is well filmed the special effects are fantastic but if directors of war movies in the past had access to these technological advances perhaps their films would have been just as good if not better are we judging this film on the thought behind it or on what we see in front of us,reality
i just wanted to say that i really enjoyed this movie  as a veteran of the persian gulf war i can only begin to appreciate the toughness of situation and amount of bravery of the soldiers of world war ii and especially normandyi hope the human race never has to go through something like this again rick,reality
after making such inexcusable trash as the lost world spielberg just cant be taken seriously neither can tom hanks after forrest gump no matter how hard he tries and in his most recent attempt at redemption he doesnt completely succeed he simply cannot refrain from being the typical spielberg with his heavyhanded lofty and ultimately sappy direction the problem here is not the film perse its the fact that he tries to pass it to us as reality the supreme truth about wwii in fact not only there are many visible historical and strategic inaccuracies but most importantly the human interaction is injected with familiar spilbergian fakeness i couldnt help noticing the dialogue aside from a couple of obligatory fwords and a few explicit sexual references feels at least fifty years old when the hollywood character actors went about delivering grand allimportant speeches and witty  crowdpleasing lines sorry steven but if you wanted to keep it real you shouldve cut down on melodramatics or better yet hired a different screenwriter the soldiers suffer from a lack of character development and remain nothing but polished stereotypes their emotional responses not always justified however the reason to view this film is the two battle scenes enveloping the story much like in the wild bunch only here instead of using peckinpahs nowcliched slow motion violence the scenes are shot in realtime or even speeded up slightly to an amazing effect john williams thank god quiets down for the duration of both scenes and lets us listen to the actual sounds of war without any musical interference the first scene the storming of omaha beach is so tensionpacked exciting and stimultaneously terrifying that it could well be the best of its kind the last onea small group of men versus a veritable army  hmmmwhere have i seen this before is almost as good if not for the cheap hollywood trick at the very end which finds the movie venturing into indiana jones territory it almost seems that spr was directed by two different people spielberg and his wwii battle consultant on the very primal level however the film achieves at least one of its makers many aspirations when i exited the theatre i felt lucky to be alive,reality
is steven spielbergs finest work and can be compared to nothing that hollywood has ever produced  it is raw unforgiving violent and saddening  but at the same time it is triumphant inspiring and hopeful  the audience finally has the opportunity to see war as it ishell  is and forever shall be a timeless war movie to symolize all wars  nothing more can be said in words when the movie so vividly speaks  even screams  in a film that challenges schindlers list as one of the greatest visual stories of all time,reality
recognizing that im a person who rejects amusement park rides which are too violent i may be the only person to find saving  an unwatchable film it was unwatchable because the handheld camera was almost ubiquitous  i didnt even recognize the german soldier at the end as the same one who dug the graves  i was trying to stave off nausea rather than following the plot,reality
profoundly powerful this film is just that when you see this film youll realise that schindlers list was just a warm up exercise for spielberg everything is just incredible the acting is just one intense ensemble effort tom hanks and tom sizemore are assured of oscar nominations the direction is stunning the graining in the film the lack of sickly sentimentality an unbiased view of the germans the handheld photography visceral but vital violence the silent moments in which tom hanks blocks out all noise in the heat of battle etcetcetc there are countless reasons to see this film and they are all as important as each other i saw this movie last week and im still lying awake thinking about it and what the real war heroes went through true i cried at titanic but it pales into insignificance when compared to the sheer brilliance of this film and the emotional hell you experience whilst watching it guilt horror awe private will almost certainly clean up at the oscars but this wont be enough it should win every single award going and then some maybe then people will stop wasting their money on godzillas and armageddons and begin to make more movies like this,reality
spielberg has once again proved himself to be a true master of his chosen profession the attention given to minute detail and photography is simply outstanding technically brilliant the film strikes at every mans primal fears when faced with danger the themes of heroism cowardice loyalty existentialism and redemption are beautifully woven into a fictional story revolving around the finding of one man namely pvt but realistic awesome i may say battle scenes aside i still say it is not the best war film ever made still sitting upon that mantle is all quiet on the western front for better or worse pvt does not take a holistic view of war as it affected all sections of society of course it may have not been intention to do so and the films certainly have a different focus but for depth of story quiet is unparalleled for content all that aside pvt is still tied along with schindlers list for the honor of the most important movies of the past two decades in my opinion pvt is to war films as 2001 is to scifi films as an exmarine i was forced to think about the 12 landings my grandfather made during wwii against the japanese did he go through hell did he think about the meaning of bravery and honor or did he shake and cry and pray to god for forgiveness and hope for a better life for all go see pvt and allow your mind to wonder and explore the meaning of humanity if you come away unmoved then youre not human,reality
the most intense prologue ive ever seen is one of my favorites now  although i do believe the ending sequence should have been a little bit more dramatic  however others who want a nominee for the oscars or the academy award itself are adviced to postpone till next year hopefully this movie should get them all,reality
is the most powerful movie of camaraderie death hope and strength of men in times of war i have ever seen  anyone who wonders what it may be like for men who fight and die side by side should see this film,reality
yes war is horrific ugly dehumanizing deadly frightening stupid and pointless we who served were but pawns often asked to do unthinkable things for no apparent reasonyes war should not be our primary means of getting our own national or personal interest we should reserve it for those times that there are no alternativesvietnam or grenada or iraq may have had other alternativesbut spielberg choose to show a battle were there was no alternativethe axis had enslaved all of europe a lot of the pacific and parts of the rest of the world the list of countries invaded and subjugated is as log as your arm 10s of millions of civilians were drafted for war imprisoned enslaved tortured and murdered for glimpse see schindlers list almost every country every person every religion every language every civilization of the world were violated in some wayand this would have gone on indefinitely if the people of the usa canada australia england and other allied countries and the resistance fighters in the invaded countries had packed it in because war is hellsomeone had to put a stop to the madness and the invasion of normandy was a major step to stopping the madnesssimply imagine what the world would be like if hitler had wonim west nichts neues nothing new from the western front was more thoughtful convincing and a better film,reality
spielburgs epic of the quest for one man is not so simple there is much more involved in the story the first twenty minutes show the horror and brutality of warmy jaw was wide open  i could not believe it  i had never seen this aspect of war before  i knew about it but it didnt register  it made me think of all the other battlesgettysburgand movements not only in europe but also in the pacific  men died for me and i took this freedom for granted after the highly ironic ending i was glued to my seat  i was so touched that i could not move  i could only sit and continue to realize that this really happened  tom hanks gives an excellent performance and is greatly assisted by the supporting roles the score that john williams composed does not steal the show but it also adds to the overall impact of the film the story is only a script but it is truer to life than ever before  the cinamatography adds to the effect  by seeing war for what it is there are no winnersi hope and pray we never go to war in haste again,reality
although i hate to argue i cant say this was the greatest war movie of all timealthough it was a fantastic movie although it was far more realistic than any ive seen before i cant decide just like that that this was the onepeople walked out of titanic raving that this is the greatest movie ever made  only now they just think of it as a really good movie the best of 97 but no moreis private the best of 98  most likely unless cameron makes his 400 million dollar epic about the carpathia the ship that saved titanic survivorsall kidding aside i would like to remind you people about such films as the dirty dozen platoon apocalypse now and even all quiet on the western front before you make such rash decisions about what is the greatest of anything id like for you to take a gander at the classics  if you still think youre right then and only then would i accept your theorywill be a hollywood classic no doubt about that,reality
when i went to this film i expected blood guts severed limbs death and destruction all round and that is what i got but when the first twenty minutes are over and done with there is nothing there to see the patheticly boring insight into tom hanks character is a mere side track to keep the audience interested the film is no doubt good but only for the way in which it portrays war bloody even so spielberg goes over the top in some instances when the german sniper is killed in the village church tower you didnt need to see his brains splattered all over the wall unlike the dday landings when it was important to get a feel for what it was like in general this film was overhyped and hanks in no way deserves an oscar,reality
oscarwinning director steven spielberg and two time oscarwinning actor tom hanks have collaborated on their first film and might well add to that collection come oscar night is a no holes barred epic film about a group of rangers who land on omaha beach on dday and then get sent on a very personal mission to find one man who has parachuted behind enemy lines and is being sent home because his three older brothers have all been casualties of warthe first 30 minutes of spr is filled with seemingly neverending images of the savagery and brutality of war  it is the landing at omaha beach on june 6 aka dday hanks plays everyman captain john miller who leads his men into battle there some survive the carnage but many do not the imagery is fierce and honest from the opening of the first transport to the blood washed beaches at the end  in the middle of this film we have a philosophical dilemma which millers men try to sort out  is one man worth the lives of 9 men miller and his elite team and in the course of trying to answer this question we get to know john miller and his first sergeant horvath wellplayed by tom sizemore his sharpshooter private jackson barry pepper his translator corporal upham superbly acted by jeremy davies and the other men in his unit  edward burns as private reiben  the ny bred cocky recruit private mellish adam goldberg who is jewish and takes great satisfaction in killing germans and who also plays a prominent role in an unforgettable scene at the films conclusion  medic wade giovanni ribisi who becomes frustrated over his inability to save everyone and private caparzo vin diesel who tries to save a young french girl in the face of sniper fire but it is hanks who holds the film and the unit together with his quiet determinationalso admirable in smaller roles are ted danson as another captain who helps millers unit track down and dennis farina as a lieutenant harve presnell as general george marshall whose decision to extract private will change the lives of 10 men forever and matt damon as privatenot for the faint of heart this movie pulls no punches and spares no one as the human carnage continues throughout the film but particularly at the end where the juxtapositioning of the troops listening to a german love song while preparing to ambush some german tanks trying to traverse the bridge at ravell lends an eerie quality to the eventual fighting and emotionally charged climax of the filmone thing is for sure  once you have seen this movies you will never look upon world war ii in quite the same waynot to be missed see this on the big screen and in a thx theatre and prepare to be devastated,reality
 provides in stark relief a portrait of the american infantryman in world war ii for those looking for a whiney antiwar film in the vietnam tradition this isnt it the men portrayed in are american soldiers of the 1940s who realize that like it or not they stand between the dark night of nazi tyranny and freedom for millions they have truly gone in harms way in case you are still unfamiliar with the story private is the sole survivor of four brothers who are serving in the military two are killed in the normandy invasion a third has been killed a short time earlier at new guinea in the pacific theater army chief of staff george marshall is so trouble by the prospect that another family will lose all of its sons to the war that he orders a small unit of eight men to find the surviving marshall is haunted by the deaths of the five sullivan brothers who all perished when the ship on which they served went down in the pacific marshall is clearly not doing this as an army publicity stunt a letter he posseses which was written by abraham lincoln to a mother who made a similar sacrifice during the war between the states also spurs marshall into action parachuted into normandy with the 101st airborne division the night before the beach actions and thus will be difficult to find the men on the rescue mission are just guys nothing special about them the thing that makes them stand out is their determination to just do their job theyre not sure why is so special but they intend to find out or die tryingthis is tom hanks at his best his portrayal of a world war ii officer is never better than when he gives his men their last minute instructions in the landing craft he ends by saying and ill see you on the beach  his quiet confidence is remarkable and accuratebarry pepper is excellent as the units tennessee born and bred sniper and giovanni ribisi is outstanding as the medic  if youre looking for an antiwar message movie this one isnt it  its about duty honor and the type of men who stood on the ramparts during one of the worlds darkest hours after seeing this go thank a world war ii veteran plenty of them traded their tomorrows so we could have today,reality
i saw the film last week well it is simply spectacular all of it a master piece,reality
for most of us fortunate to have only read about and not experienced the kind of action portrayed in that portrayal accomplishes complete suspension of disbelief and leaves us completely exhausted by its end the only other film of its genre that has the same effect is wolfgang petersens das bootif the viewers draw moral conclusions strictly from the material spielberg provides many if not most will conclude that making war should never be an option of course spielberg scrupulously avoids any explanation for the presence and actions of captain millers men other than rescuing this one man this is in contrast to schindlers list which is a continuous justification for using whatever force is necessary to liberate the innocent and punish the guilty perhaps unsurprisingly schindlers list liberates the innocent without any evidence of men like captain miller his squad or the millions of other gis that made it possiblehow could spielberg if he wanted to have combined the two giving the viewer a sense of the reaction of those occupied by the nazis to the allied landings yet not completely switch the film out of contextconsider the film playing for time this tv film released approximately ten years ago achieved extreme notoriety even before its release by virtue of its central casting of vanessa redgrave redgraves extreme political left wing views are regrettably considering her occupation tainted with a devotion to the cause of palestinian statehood she played a jewish woman in a nazi labor camp the film recounts the real world assembly of musically talented female inmates who form a small orchestra and perform for the camp nazis as long as they played they gained time the continuous horror of life in a labor camp is interrupted very briefly when just before the start of a concert a male technician arranges something on stage in front of ms redgrave and opens his palm to her sight on the skin is written allies landing in france he closes his palm and goes on with his work redgrave gives the slightest of all smiles but one which the viewer understands is a shout of joy it will be over survival is possiblethis is not a scene spielberg considered necessary in schindlers listchester wilmots the struggle for europe describes an event he witnessed during the liberation of brussels he writes in one square the british tanks were halted by the belgian civilian throng and the brussels police attempted to move the crowd back but they could not restrain one little old woman who wore on her drab black dress her husbands medals from another war she made a quick dart across to the nearest jeep took the hand of the driver kissed it and said je vous remercie tommie je vous remercie and into his hand she pressed what was obviously all that she had  three cigarettesthis is not a scene spielberg considered necessary in saving privatei am extremely fortunate to have a father who was a normandy to berlin gi and a mother who was a belgian native lived under the nazi occupation and could very well have been in that brussels crowd that day through their eyes i saw as much as anyone could second hand this is not a luxury available to many people today the ww2 generation is dying and they are dying with the knowledge of what happened why it happened and how to avoid having it happen again spielberg has the responsibility to pass that information on and in that respect both schindlers list and are failures,reality
in one word its the best movie ever made,reality
i have seen every war movie to date but nothing prepared me for the emotional experience i had in this movieit touched me in a way that no movie had or will ever again the cruelness of war has never been more evident than in the first 35min of the moviethe characters are so real that i felt there emotions special effects are of such a nature the you have to keep reminding yourself that it isnt realthis review may be short but mere words cannot do this movie justiceim actually sorry ive seen it as any movie i see from now on will be insignificant,reality
very graphic very realistic very intense  spielberg once again proved to be one of hollywoods best story teller  i recommend anyone to go see this movie  bring your kids and teach them one of the most important point in the history of human kind,reality
offers viewers a stunning companion piece to spielbergs previous ww2 classic schildlers list although exceptional in its own right gives a completely different take on the conflict schindlers list examines the the evil of the war and what is was that people were fighting for gives us in no uncertain terms a insight into the savagery of war and the senselessness of armed conflict it reminds us that during conflict people die in the most horrible ways immaginable and that good people sacrifice their lives for the cause if taken on its own would seem to say that war is a senseless waste of human life and that there is no justification for this activity but when added to the message in schindlerss list which showed us the evil which the war strove to eliminate one is left asking the questionwhen is the cause worth the cost,reality
i would like to say i really enjoyed this film but if that was what wwii was really like then i cant this film actually made you feel like you were fighting the nazi army using some pretty good nypd blue camera techniquesits not your average war film where 5 guys fight off the whole army using a pistol and some well placed bombs it is totally equal the whole way through you dont know who is going to die nextbottom line see this film youd be mad to miss it but be prepared the first 15 or so minutes is not for the faint hearted gory just isnt the word,reality
is the best movie about the world war ii and tom hanks the favorite oscarnominater for best lead actor in a movie and for best movie in this year,reality
reading some of the above comments it becomes obvious that some people are busy composing their criticisms when they would do better to watch the film eg why didnt the high command just radio instructions to send home instead of sending a squad after him the answer is in the film if youre paying attention the airborne forces were scattered lost decimated by casualties and out of touch with what was going on generally  which is by the way historically accuratealso to address the moans about the lack of characterisation among the us soldiers if you met such a group in real life they would probably appear just as 2dimensional soldiers in combat only relate to each other  they dont care about anyone else through their shared experiences they already know each other intimately and nobody else counts outside of their immediate circle so nobody else gets to see the real side of their characters lets not forget that these men are in a war not a chekhov playas to the standard mix of soldiers backgrounds this is the way armies organise their units if units all consisted of men from the same town or area the social consequences can be disastrous if that unit suffers heavy losses as with the british pals battalions of the first world war,reality
my father was in wwii in the pacific and at least two of my uncles were in the european theatre both were at the battle of the bulge one was a medic  i saw this movie not to see a war movie but to be able to in some way understand the experiences of those who went through the war  i thought this was an incredibly powerful and emotional movie which did help me understand why my father never spoke of the war as i know many veterans do not or cannot  my wife and i remained in our seats several minutes after the movie ended we were both deeply affected  i recommend that everyone see this movie to get a realistic taste of the futility of war,reality
although the plot is nothing special this must rank as a major milestone in cinema history at the end of the opening battle scene i was left numbok so its a bit sad to admit it but i went to see it again within a week and found myself becoming quite agitated immediately before the same sceneid say its impossible to see this film without being affected by it,reality
this is truly magnificent filmmaking and probably the finest war movie ever made with terrific performances all around i must say however that the scene where the german soldier slowly lowers the blade into the americans heart while whispering shhh was the most upsetting scene ive ever encounteredso much so in fact that i will never watch the film again theres no denying though this is a great film,reality
even with all the hype i had absorbed i was not prepared for the brutality depicted in this film  perhaps it is not possible to be prepared  perhaps that is good  as i squirmed and cowered in my chair during the initial battle sequence i was asking what now where now before any of the characters did  i had become involved in the story emotionally without wanting or choosing to  i cared about these people and therefore when the plot threatened them i felt threatened  when they relaxed i relaxed  in that way this film brought to me an understanding of war from the soldiers point of view that is otherwise impossible to get without being there  to me that is the measure of the films merit  this is a great film with subtlety and understatement sometimes lacking in spielberg earlier films  i am heartened that a talent as technically adept as spielberg is maturing into a true master of the art of film  everyone who can stand it must see this movie,reality
ok  its one of hanks best performances it has lots of realism  it took more risks graphically than most mainstream hollywood flicks have done  i cried in anger at the waste of lives because of lessons not learned at dieppe and anzio  but ultimately the film to me seemed edgeless and empty typical spielberg all surface and no content  things were too clean too neat too packaged the biggest directorial risk he took was in presenting the film as a thread snipped at both endswe didnt see what came before and we dont get to see what happens after  the two present day sequences that open and close the movie are just pretty bookendsthe opening was spectacular and full credits to all for an incredible production  it is as close as any of us are likely to get to war and the senselessness of the slaughter that is mass war was as it should be appalling   unfortunately once we moved off the beach the movie got lost in its own metaphors and cinematic history  i saw too many pieces of older movies and cliches presented  i will admit i didnt see too many gaffes but why did that paratrooper have a full beard and that is good but lack of goofs does not compensate for lack of imagination by edge i mean taking risks  for example apocalypse now had an edge and too much imagination portions of platoon had an edge and imagination titanic had no edges but a lot of imagination the crying game had lots of edges and some imaginationso the opening halfhour gets 4 stars the rest 3 awards for special effects hanks and cinematography but thats all,reality
i believe that was one of the best war movies ever made because it shows what war is really about  i have seen tons of movies where violence is portrayed as a cool shootem up blowem up thing  this movie has a lot of violence but shows the reality of what happened a half century ago and the horrible brutality of war  the actors were fabulous in recreating the war  not to mention the battle scenes were perfect  steven spielberg has done an excellent job of recreating the events of omaha beach in the first 24 minutes of the film  this movie shows war in its most truthful sense  it made me stop and think just how many people died horrible deaths to save our country  it made me want to cry like few movies do  this movie is the closest you will get to seeing what life was like during wwii,reality
an unbelievable film forget every war film youve ever seen and any ideas you may have about the glories of conflict this is how it was blood guts and broken lives,reality
the most graphic and realistic war film of all time a must see for all film fans,reality
some thoughts about sprits an intelligent and carefully made film you must view it intelligently and carefully and see it two or three times to be able to see the detailit will be a misunderstood film i think naturally there is no one right way to view a film the better the film the more ways it can be viewed but spr has already been evaluated in a very unidimensional waypeople have commented that there is a good action sequence at the beginning a good action sequence at the end a long boring middle with no character development and bookend sentimentality the opening 25 minutes were very realisticbut is that all that the film is about you can view it that way but perhaps the film is more than a technically masterful bfilmthe films message is war is hell if thats all it was it would be shallow realism a dog has four feet war is hell sugar is sweet these are just preconditions for telling a story consider this possibility that the realism and attention to detail is more than the sound of bullets against steel or sandshallow character development you dont know enough about the soldiers to care whats that supposed to mean that you look at a crossfilled cemetery and feel nothing that you see a landing boat full of men killed before they can disembark and you feel nothing because you dont know who they were think about this veterans report not wanting to know anything about their fellow combatants it made the loss more difficult and isnt it interesting that part of the story of spr has to do with the soldiers wondering who captain miller is why dont you ask yourself why character development the war context has to do with how you behave there and then thats how you assess each other now think about whether such a message can be carried to other everyday contexts observe the soldiers and how they behave that long boring bit in the middle thats the whole film look at the events and think why am i being shown this why not something else isnt it interesting that the one german soldier that upham kills is the one who both killed miller and witnessed uphams own failure to live up to his responsibilities cowardicego see the film a second time and think about it ask yourself why amid the chaos of the omaha beach landing we are not only shown slow motion pans of miller staring without comprehension at corpses and men cringed in fear but also of him later equally whitefaced staring at coffee being poured at a man shaving at a sandwich being eatena good film can work at several levels is this a war film an antiwar film is that all that spr is about if so then the socalled bookend pieces are indeed cheap sentimentality but consider another hypothesis perhaps the film is also a character study of one person in particular of captain miller and its not simply about war the war is a context to make something else meaningful no not just earn this something elsewhen i saw the film there was a veteran who began crying when another message was given at the very endinteresting wasnt it that we dont hear triumphant music and see the stars and stripes in full glory we could have been shown this but we werent we see a bleached out remnant of something almost unrecognizable as stars and stripes and music dying away in a long sad whisper earlier we hear millers own comments on the standard emersonian line on the value of war perhaps thats his way of seeing the good side of things you can accuse spielberg of being a sentimentalist miller himself would not buy the sentimentality interpretationwhatever else the film might be spr is also good enough to give me something to think about after i view it something else about the rest of everyday life dont waste your time thinking about whether its the best film everor the best war film ever or how many academy awards it will win who caresforget about that guy looking for his arm on omaha beachview the film and then think about this are you a good person are you living a good lifethen go back and look again at those dying and dead strangers and weep for your own lifeperhaps spielberg made a better film than he intended,reality
hold on to your seats and stomachs  for the first 40 minutes of  nonstoi violence the best show of what war is like i have ever seen the non stop fire of bullets just amazed me that that really happened  just a little note here fellas be sure to check out the granddaughter in the purple shirt at the beginning  its well worth the effort  hanks deserves his third oscar he should get the one he missed for apollo 13 this is at least a 9 out of 10,reality
there is nothing new in but the standard warishell details are so well done they seem to have been reinvented for this movie in lesser hands stereotypes cliches and schmaltz in spielbergs wellrounded characters genuine drama and real emotions the only problem is that the opening scene is so real and terrifying that it upstages the rest of the story 1010  easily,reality
in a summer full of movies based on special effects and not scripts raises from the ashes to prove that great movies are still being made  even if they are few are far between  spielberg shows us all that he is still master of his craft  in a posttitanic wake hollywood was in desperate need of such a film  is by far the best movie you will see in 1998,reality
never before have i seen people cringe stare openmouthed cheer and cry then walk out of a theater in complete silencehaving witnessed the socalled greatest act of terrorism ever to occur in our nation i can only say we have been so naive  my generation doesnt understand what war is  we watch our movies and we get excited by violence and gore never feeling any guilt or sorrow for the people the actors portray  this film changes all of that  it is so hard to see the men murdered as they do their duty and then come to the realization that this really happened  these men our grandfathers risked and in some cases gave up their lives to protect all that we take for granted  today we cry and demand justice for the 169 people who died because a part of one building in a small city was destroyed by a bomb  we cant even begin to imagine running off of the landing boat only to be shot and killed by the unseen enemy  we see countless buildings annihilated in small tactically insignificant citiesthis movie has made a difference in my life  being only 20 i have to face that it could easily be me in the line of fire if our nation were called once again to defend the cause of freedom and the draft were reinstated all i can say is after seeing this movie war and violence will no longer be glorified in my mind  aside from the stunningly realistic portrayal of war i cant ignore the fact that the movie itself is spectacular  although the content takes the front seat the acting script and cinematography are superior  this film is hands down the best of the year and one of the best movies ever made four stars,reality
not native english so forgive my mistakeswhen the first 30 minutes started i almost forgot to drink my soft drink some guys left the movie with their girlfriends i guess they couldnt face the real like of ww2action films usually show that faceoff which is a fairly good movie but in another category the main characters arent vulnerable to bullets they can dance in the line of fire and they never get hit thats not possiblespr showed me the real way the opposite of what face off could come up with i realized that i want to hide i dont want to move because the feeling being on the battlefield the surround was perfect and the storyboard was ok toomy only question is that is the goverment really think like the guy in the film i mean i dont think that the defense minister of the united states can make decisions like save that guy because of his mother i dont think so but im not an american so maybe i misunderstood somethingit was good not to see everyone surviving and showing many kind of soldiersnot everyone can fight thats okaythank you very much,reality
was an excellent movie but thats no surprise coming from steven spielberg  the one thing i would comment on is that there were several sections of the movie that could have been left out thus making it a little shorter  several parts were slow and unnecessary in my opinion but overall it was a very intense emotional story that everyone will respect i recommend it to everyone,reality
the harrowing torment of combat has never been so accurately portrayed this is a study of loyalty courage leadership and sacrifice and it is a tour de force for tom hanks who has filled the shoes of jimmie stewart his quiet portrait of leadership is a cure for the swaggering macho of stallone and segal who lied to a generation of americans about what soldiering is all aboutyou must see it you must take your parents and your children and you must tell your congressman to see it  dont be put off by the violence it is not just part of the story it is the story  i saw enough combat in vietnam to really understand and yet i cried for my father and his friends when i saw this film,reality
this movie had more of an impact on me than any movie i have ever seen  i was pretty apathetic about going to see it at first as i thought that it would be just another war movie  i was deadwrong  what this movie does is bring to life the realities of war at least as far as it can for someone who never has and probably never will be thereto the people who would wish to go to war for any reason watch this first to those who would dodge military service of this country yet still call themselves americans and reap the rewards of those who did watch this movie and think about all of the kids who did your job for you  to those who would exercise their right to burn the american flag in protest watch this movie and consider the price at which that right was purchasedalthough i realize that it isnt much it is heartfelt when i say to all of the people who have ever fought in or who have lost loved ones in a war thank you from a grateful citizen,reality
is the most hauntingly realistic movie of all time while sitting in the theater witnessing this extraordinary piece of cinema history i couldnt help but think about what it must have been like that day in normandy  although i felt like i was right there on the beach with the brave soldiers who risked and gave their lives for us  this is a movie that makes you think  oscar caliber performances delivered by every member of the cast especially tom hanks  the story involves private whos brothers died in the dday invasion and the eight men sent to return him home  eight men sent to save one may be unfair but their soldiers and will follow orders no matter what the cost  this movie has many very gory moments but what else do you expect from the man who brought you schindlers list and amistad steven spielberg  this is my favorite movie of all time and i recommend it to anyone who can handle it  its been said that war is hell  but i cant imagine a hell being any worse,reality
this is probably one of the best war films ever created the sound is incredible the images are sensational and the acting is very good it maintains a high level in all its other aspects the first 5 minutes of battle are just what i expected there are many original points not present in most war films and there are even funny points in the dialogue ah one more thing i also must say that perhaps i made a mistake before going to the theatre i read the user comments at the imdb in them people say things like its the best war film in history or im not the same after watching this movie well i must admit its a great war movie but nothing else at least for me of course its not the best film ever created anyway you shouldnt miss it my rating is 8 out of 10,reality
over the many years of films being released many have been named outstanding and have been given 4 stars  the godfather star wars the usual suspects pulp fiction and the godfather part ii all stand a big place in film history  however i was never expecting a film to be as important as schindlers list until now and by the same director  steven spielberg has once again made easily one of the best and most important films of all time many past war films have tried to be important but nothing has came as close to reality as  from the scenes of graphically violent war where gun shots are the only noise you can hear to the different aspects each character has it is definitely the most realistic war film ever made  after seeing this film you will be reminded of the many people who have died for our freedom today and what it is really like to be on a battlefield  some people may find it to graphic to watch but must know that this is a true story and this is how graphic a war is  definitely one of the best films i have ever seen and if there are movies in the future that are even better than this one not many will forget this film and many of the scenes you see in it will be kept in your head for many years to come,reality
just saw it hard to say anything spielberg at his best brilliant direction the cinematography is also wonderful all the actors are great there is no need to single out the best im awed filmmaking as it should be  a pure crystallized masterpiece,reality
this movie is tremendously acted directed produced and is a visual masterpiece  the best war movie maybe the best ive ever seen and had awsome effects great sound a terrific script and could make you go to tears in more ways than one  great acting job by hanks sizemore pepper goldberg burns and everyone else including the small but extremely sequencial role of damon,reality
i did not expect to like this movie as much as i did  i figured the fictional plot would be silly since there was so much that really occurred that couldshould be told but the plot allowed spielberg to show first person not just the most realistic landing scenes ever made but allowed him to continue into the confusion of the airborne assault the night before in a way that has never been shown beforethe haunting scene that will always remain with me is the view from the german defensive positions showing them waiting for the ramp of the landing craft to open so they could fire their machine gun into the densely packed men on the crafti believe this movie should be shown in every school in the united states every year so our children can know what sacrifices their parents and grandparents made in the past no movie ive seen shows this better,reality
the writing and the story were weak at times the reason given for why the military would risk the lives of eight soldiers to save one was glossed over technically the movie could not have been any better the acting was superb all around spielbergs direction is to be admired the cinematography is gorgeous in an eerie way unfortunately spielberg bookended the film with two scenes that were unnecessary and for me took away from the impact of the film but this movie was not about its story it was about a war the plot was a vehicle to illustrate the war and in that respect the movie successfully completes its purpose,reality
is speilbergs attempt to help the viewer now what war is truly like to put it simply he didnt pull any punches this movie was an experience that no one should ever forget this truly should make you appreciate what the veterans of this horrible war had to go through,reality
this movie is no doubt a mustsee for everyone who still has the opinion that war is a necessary thing never have i seen such dramatical and yet realistic scenes of war theres one big message war is the last thing you ever want to get stuck in in my opinion this movie exceeds even schindlers list which was excellent as well,reality
the landing scenes are excellent and seem to make everyone think about the suffering that must have taken place the rest of the the story is ok but not great theres nothing there that hasnt been filmed a hundred times already definitely worth watching on a big screen with big soundhaving said that i couldnt help thinking that it had many similarities with starship troopers lots of blood guts gore big guns evil faceless enemies team bonding battlefield documentary photography landing craft invasions tank busting and more,reality
when i went to see this film i thought i knew what to expecta gory realistic war drama about a group of men whom we come to have emotions for not unlike the characters in platoon or full metal jacket but i was sorely mistakenthis film was not only realistic it was heartwrenching and thrilling and never before has a film had such an emotional impact on me  never before have i pitied and felt so strongly for characters in a movie because i always found most movies to merely be entertainment with the exception of a few other films dealing with equally significant issues but something was different about  it made me reflect on my own life and i actually found myself thanking god that i have never experienced something as horrifying and gruesome as the experience of the soldiers as portrayed in the opening and closing scenes  a month after seeing it i still find myself contemplating the horror experienced by so many men and i cant fathom the misery anguish and suffering encountered by those soldiers the character private was superfluous to the story a mere gimmick in my mind for spielberg to portray the hell that must be combat,reality
yes its that good never before have i sat a full 72 hours later and still have a movie indelibly imprinted on my mind thanks to wonderful cinematography and the modern digital sound the feeling of being there was inescapable i doubt that the same atmosphere could have been created 20 or even 10 years ago the previous epics of wwii a bridge too far and the longest day although classics of their time pale against the new found master of the genre a must see,reality
theres only one word for this movie  awesome  steven speilberg probably the most prolific film maker of the twentiethcentury has done it again  he magnificently combines all of the elements of war to create a masterpiece,reality
not your typical wwii film where heroes go charging down the beach engaging the enemy without fear this film shows what war is about mainly death in extremely violent ways a very historically accurate and moving film of men in battle if youre interesting in the history read stephen ambroses novel dday ambrose consulted for the movie,reality
if anyone sees this movie and doesnt come away with an awed feeling of what our fathers and grandfathers endured to secure our way of life they will never be moved by anything i have been to countless movies in my lifetime and never have i witnessed such silent devotion as the audience was leaving as for this film and sprinkle in a few gray  bent old men with tears in their eyes and as i said it was awesomethe scene where mrs collapsed on the porch at the approach of the military vehicle was without doubt the most poignant and revealing of the entire film makes you know how horrible it was thousands of times for families during the war and i have never seen it portrayed better if this film tom hanks who nevermore will be thought of as forrest gump and spielberg dont all win oscars they might as well discontinue it for it would be meaningless for any other to  receive it,reality
steven spielberg films come with high expectations youve come to expect a sense of wonderment of magic of taking the audience places theyve never been to before in film  unfortunately as spielberg has said himself his films the past few years have not touched or grabbed us the way they used to this is most likely due to a combination of our high expectations and spielbergs losing touch with the general publicthat said has well exceeded my expectations and may be the finest film of his careerthis film shows you how powerful movies can be marrying the creative ingenious minds of spielberg and cinematographer janusz kaminski with new film technology provides us with the most realistic war movie ever madethe opening 24minute invasion sequence relentlessly assaults your eyes  ears the combination of jerky camera movement by using handheld cameras  stuttered framing by skipping some frames special film for grittiness  slow motion surround sound and perfect choreography make this section of the film an instant classic and worth the price of admission  from the second the ramp drops on one of the landing crafts the audience is a participant in this invasion i peered around the audience for a few seconds and as the bombs and explosions reflected light off their faces i was able to see their eyes in them i saw fear shock horror and disbeliefthere are two scenes which bookend the movie that force you to absorb the carnage  chaos of war at a deep level in both scenes you are watching the bloody battle all around you through captain john millers played by tom hanks eyes the sounds of gunfire and explosions which only moments before were piercing your ears are now all but silent these two surreal and haunting scenes provide the audience with a few seconds to step back feel themselves breathing heavier feel their hearts beating faster and truly see the horror  devastation of war another scene that will stay with you is seeing corporal upham played by jeremy davies glued to a stairwell panic ridden with frightacting barry pepper as private jackson the expert marksman and tom sizemore as tough sergeant horvath stood out among the cast hollywood plot devices eg family gathered at cemetery airplane appearance etc and weak dialogue at times prevent this film from being a true 4 star classic  never the less this is still the most realistic and powerful war film ever made and will be remembered throughout the annuls of film historythe film is rated r due to graphic violence the film may be disturbing for war veterans who may not want to invoke their battlefield memories,reality
is without a doubt the best war movie that i ever seen before seeing it i had heard that it was amazingly realistic and that some war veterans had to abandon it after 30 minutes because of horrific memories flooding back and i have to agree with this the opening 25 minutes or so in particular are like nothing i have ever witnessed some of the scenes of the dead and wounded are really gruesome but this only adds to the overwhelming effect this film has on all who see itit is quite a long film but it doesnt feel it i was disappointed when it ended because i was enjoying it so much spielberg really captures the essence of war in this film and hopefully would make all who see it realize the grim reality of war and turn them against violence for life all i have left to say is that if you havent gone out to see yet do so now it really is as good as everyone says it is,reality
just been to see very good war movie battle scenes deserve all praise they are getting does not add anything to war genre or why people go to war bit shallow and american gung hosmultz basically a shoot em up the redeeming factor is that it shows that gore and the viciousness of war and the brutality of the us soldier did not just appear with vietnam   cross of iron does the goodbad honourdishonour etc much better i think  apocalypse now is better at the mission is a journey to find ones self stuff battle of algiers as documentary style that said worth it just for the battle scenes would go and see again at the pictures,reality
one of the most powerful war films of all time  the most intense graphic direction to come from steven spielberg with superbly innovative cinematography editing and sound  performances were all around excellent supporting characters are surprisingly as strong as tom hanks in the lead modern day bookend is the only thing that detracts from the rest of the movie,reality
is one of the best movies ever madeit had a great cast and the best director in the world working on itthe first 25 minutes of the film were filmed in chlorecho beach in cowexford ireland i am from new ross cowexford ireland,reality
yet another movie that is considered great simply because the name spielberg is attached if not for the hyperrealistic combat scenes this film would simply be averageon the plus side the movie takes full advantage of todays audiovisual technology to provide the most immersive film experience dealing with war   any war the violence is so realistic and plentiful its at times desensitizing a common feeling among soldiers in world war iion the negative side the movie revolves around the gore and the combat and as a result fails to resolve many of the questions the movie raises  namely whether risking an entire group is worth saving one manthere are many other movies that more strongly illustrate the wide range of attitudes emotions and pure brutality of war among those all quiet on the western front the original the big red one and platoon involve the viewer on a much deeper emotional and intellectual level than this film,reality
id read plenty of reviews both here and in magazines before i saw this film  most described was the first twenty minutes of the movie concerning the omaha beach landings in france the horrors written in those text prepared me for what i knew were going to be gruesome scenes  or so i thought wrong wrong wrong the first twenty minutes will be stuck etched on my brain until i die  if nothing else they serve as the best reason ive ever seen for pacifism when the first boat lands and the bullets rip the occupants to shreds you feel you are right there with them  then you know that no film review will do justice to the visuals in this film to say it s the best war movie ever made is a kind of injustice  i didnt feel i was watching a war film more a documentary youve seen people shot before a million times on film and tv right wrong again  you feel every bullet thats fired in this film and beleive me every one feels and sounds like a hot piece of metal that kills when the first twenty minutes are over you feel numb and you stay like that until the last image of the film has left the screen to complain about the plot is essentially pointless  sure its straight forward and sure its one sided the germans all being depicted as pretty much emotionless skinheads  the only one in the film for any length of time being a nasty piece of work who you want to die anyway but i dont think this is meant as a film in that way to me its a document of the horrors of war and of the futility of it  if i were a young man thinking of joining the forces before seeing this id rip the application form up after any romantic ideals of that lifestyle get ripped up with it in this filmsee this movie be hurt and haunted by its images but most of all remember it as a document of why we are free todaysometimes i wonder why they bothered,reality
even though this movie was excellent i did agree with some comments about how the old man scenes were played for sympathy and how character development was a bit stunted but i think thats part of the point these arent supposed to be complex characters with inner demons or personal problems theyre supposed to be ordinary joes just like the millions of others who fought and died if you were going to develop personalities you d either have to cut out the fighting or make that movie really long in that respect i had no problem about the believability of rescuing one man have you at all been paying attention the sullivan law which prevents all of a familys sons from being killed in combat had been mentioned ad nauseam so they had to rescue him it was the freakin law how is that romantic hollywood someone also said that the point of the movie was to say war is bad well duh well then i say duh right back to you because dont you think spielberg already assumed we know that hes not that stupid to make a movie with such a superficial obvious  message one of the main goals in addition to depicting the reality of war was to show all of us how much we take freedom for granted example how many of you actually celebrate veterans or memorial days in memoriam for people who served in combat and how many of you simply go woohoo no schoolwork today like its just a holiday people celebrate martyrs and thats good  but how are the poor shlubs who went to die when freedom really was on the line any less important to paraphrase a source if they failed whether or not you can imagine it wed all be doing the zieg heil i have been nowhere near a war and wouldnt want to after having seen this film but the only people whose opinions about the honesty and treatment of the subject matter matter at all to me are those who have been through and seen such carnage as in the war of all the veterans of wwii who ive seen interviewed about this film i have yet to see one who says that movie sucked or was only okay the reason i trust the realism of it for one thing is because they had advisors who experienced sht like that firsthand truth is everything is subjective you can read lots of stuff and watch tons of films on war and have a good imagination but you honestly cant say a damn thing about it until youve been through one yourself i am part cynic but i do not think the purpose of this movie was to win oscars why shouldnt a movie like this deserve to win anything but sound and visual awards anyway platoon did after seeing this movie i have a greater understanding and appreciation of our history im all for the freedom to express opinions but id like to see someone do as good a job or better with such profound material a statement not yet if at all applicable to the thin red line im no filmmaker but that movie was pretty darn good oscarworthy i dont know there are still months left in the oscar year,reality
what can you say about the opening battle scene at normandy and the climactic final scene in the village they are probably the two best war scenes ever recorded on film the images from the beach landing will haunt me for a long time the soldiers praying crying vomiting and then dying dying so fast and furious you dont even have time to breathe before the next one goes down and yet they are all very human which is what breaks your heart the same can be said of the final battle scene the way the momentary peace of listening to edith piaf singing in french while the educated young soldier interprets for the others is shattered by the rumbling of the treads of the german tanks your brain starts going why is this happening for this reason the reality and ridiculousness of war is made clear there are other good scenes in this poignant and terrifying film most of the deaths are treated with the shock of cold reality and at the same time with dignity however i was totally disgusted by the directors good guy vs bad guy depiction of the nazi soldiers im sure that the germans loved their mothers too that they were afraid to die that they were also following orders from above and not deranged hitlers the lone german character in the film is portrayed as a sick evil clown and that is all were allowed to see him as how sad that we have to do that to appreciate what our soldiers did for us woudldnt it have made it an even better statement if the movie had shown us how crazy war is from both sides of the fence it was an opportunity lostbeyond that i agree with the other viewer that i also would have appreciated seeing the daily hardships that the soldiers must have gone through the cold the wet the hunger etc i think this would have made it a more complete and realistic filmstill congratulations to spielberg he gave us his heart,reality
several things crossed my mind as i watch the horror and drama unfold on the screen first i was truly sorry for not taking time to remember our war dead last memorial day seems like many of us are more concerned about a long holiday weekend and our plans then remembering the reason for memorial day or veterans daywe post our comments how spr moved us and shocked us  lets see if we remember this with some sort of action next memorial day the second thought i had was picturing relatives and friends from wwii total of 6 in those circumstances  and then how would i react to the same stimulus how would i react during those terrifying landings long campaigns gaining and losing  commrades  very thought provoking,reality
so often a movie will glamorize the act of armed conflict  making it sexy or romantic  case in point would be starship troopers  we watched people die constantly and we the audience hardly noticed or caredspielberg did it right  i am a soldier in an army town and the movie theater was silent silent because what we saw wasnt glamorous  it was honest and the truth was very blunt  we were forced to watch people die people panic and people that actually behaved like real peoplewe saw a compelling view of the mettle required to be a leader in combat hanks undertook the role of a captain as the army would like its officers to be  he was focused on his mission and his commanders intent  he had to lead those that werent motivated and he even had to be human and deal with his own shortcomingsthis movie inspires patriotism but it defines war as a sobering test of a soldiers true character and dedication  it is not for the timid however schindlers list showed spielbergs talent for honest perspective,reality
by the time you read this youll probably know what is all about without even seeing the film sure the fighting scenes were realistic and etc but this is not what drew me to this film now im no expert in movies and i havent seen a lot of old war movies the only one ive seen is the longest day but i think this movie stands out among the others because it is real the characters are real they dont have incredible luck beating odds every time you see grown men crying out for their mothers screaming out in pain when theyre hit the movie focuses on the characters the people it shows the human side of this war it shows how men devolve into savage creatures who are just trying to survive it shows that every life taken is another bit of humanity that is lost eg shooting surrendering prisoners beating up a pow the mission theyre assigned is probably one of the only good deeds they will accomplish in the war the little bit of humanity that is left in them compels them accomplish their objective and helps them redeem their soul the team dispatched to save private evolves from a group of savages trying to survive to a higher moral level a level in which they are willing to sacrifice their lives to do something good something they rarely donow you may disagree with my point of view i dont really care but whether you agree or not you have to see you a least owe it to the veterans to see what they faced when they fought for our freedom,reality
this movie at least the first 20 minutes or more seal my opinion of the filmand the rest was rather curious at least to the last half an hour of the movie nowas a civilianborn 1958i certainly dont have the experience to talk about this warbut i watched documentaries that bring tears to my eyes i assume that i am personally  not friendly with many serviceman in civilian life past or presentbut i deeply respect the blood that was given and that they continue to give since it was and is the price of my freedom i am blackand aware that this period was not the best for black servicemen nevertheless i am proud of the ww2servicemen whiteblackand any other race of americansthat served during that period i hate to see in films about ww2american soldiers dying or being killed i didnt notice in this film any black soldiersbut that wouldnt make me any less proud of the superhuman courage as represented by the actors in this film as white soldiers under such inconceivable pressure to secure the freedom that i take for granted i didnt at first want to see this moviebecause i thought that it was nothing more than a big budget filmand that it would depict a theme of heroism that was going to be a romance about gunho characters the characters were very humanand the late actor john wayne if he was in this movie as one  of the characters his character would have been scared silly by the battle scenes in this filmno one is dying pretty in this film  it is a real war movie or the real deal of fightingsufferingand dying ,reality
this movie has found a place in my all time top ten  i cant name the other nine right off of the top of my head but i have to say that this movie would be in it  there isnt a lot you can say to explain this movie because its a huge heaping dose of reality encased in three hours of film the plot is simple four brothers go off to war three die and the government wants to bring the sole surviving brother home  after a grueling and gruesome landing at omaha beach the men who are sent after him search all over the war theater of europe during wwii for the lone living brother  still if they had tacked much more of a plot on to the movie with the time they used it wouldnt have had the same impact the movie would have to have been longer  i wouldnt have minded if it had been the characters dont have a lot of time to be developed due to the nature of war and the film but the parts are all well delivered and acted im sure at least partially to the direction of spielberg but it is tom hanks that makes it all stick together  i read another review of this movie which said that tom hanks performance was a quiet miracle this is the most accurate description of the part he plays that i have read to date this movie illustrates the differences between modernfacesneverseen warfare and warfare of a past era  you have to wonder after seeing this movie if violence wouldnt be so prevalent in our world if it war was now as it once was in the past  the first 45 minutes of this movie are so overwhelming i would be surprised if a person could bring themselves to speak after it  in fact ive never been in a theater with such silence throughout an entire movie except for when i saw highlander ii and that silence was more due to disappointment and disgust than any profound impact  the whole sequence of events moves at such breakneck speed with such reality that you forget there is a camera filming it all  at times it seems as if youre seeing it all through the eyes of someone on the field of battle  the climax of the film in relation to the beginning of the film has a slight plot twist thats how i perceived it that makes the whole thing come together plotwise and it attempts to give a little tug at the heart strings i didnt mind i should say as i finish this that this isnt a movie for those with weak stomachs  the movie isnt filled with blood and gore for the sake of blood and gore  it is very realistic though almost sickeningly so  take all of the war movies ever made strip away the bravado the glory the bravery and the chest clutching sort of tough guy attitudes throw in the violence and horrific injury that accompanies that kind of combat and youll have the feeling of a good part of  at least i think so  basically i wouldnt take the kids to it and i wouldnt go if the sight of blood makes you ill  amazing impacting overwhelming horrifying and realistic are words i would use to describe this movie wow,reality
if i was asked to write a one sentence review of it would have to be this is the single greatest movie ever made  quite simply no other film has personally moved inspired educated and brought me to tears like did nearly every single element of the film is perfect  spielbergs direction is unbelievable hanks performance is probably the greatest that i have ever witnessed and the story and script are aweinspiring  i could go on and on but you probably get the point  is unbelievable and you should immediately go to see if you havent had the opportunity to do so  is rated r for extreme violence and a heavy dosage of profanity  the mpaa actually considered giving it and nc17 due to the extreme realism that it portrays  fortunately however they didnt every single american no matter what the age should be required to see this movie  dont let the strong rating and its respective reasons scare you away  the insight into war that this movie portrays is unsurpassed see it on the big screen while you can,reality
yes i am a veteran also of a less glorifies war i also found not very interesting  the movie moved at wagnerian pace many times i thought of walking out mostly out of sheer boredom i kept dreaming of scissors oh how i wished they cut the balcony scene between the french parentsgirland soldiers it wasnt even in good taste lets walk out now i told my familybut wait youll be dragging a loss of nearly 2000 lets stay well cut it to pieces during supper  and the dialogue how many war movies did they cutandpaste to come up with such witticisms as i dont give a blankety blank about this blankety wari want to go  homeand my  most favorite quotation  all these men dead for one man  in summary ive seen dozens of more interesting and truly more representative war moviesmy summary of the movie is what else is new you dont have to go digging into the annals of history for carnage reserve your seat at your local hospital emergency room on any saturday nighti didnt learn much from this movie perhaps nothing at all and goodness how long it was,reality
the battle scenes rang true but there was too much hollywood schmaltz in the script not to mention the overdone music track full metal jacket was a more honest film with a more unflinching look at the horrors of war and free of any little circular plot devices to tie it neatly together the greatest antiwar film imho was prisoner of the mountain a film that came out of russia a couple of years ago,reality
this is without a doubt one of the most powerful movies ever made  it is one of spielbergs best right up there with schindlers list  the opening few minutes are some of the most visually stunning in movie history  and the story keeps you involved and really caring about miller and his team from the landing on dday right up to the end  while most certainly not a movie for children of any age everyone old enough to appreciate it should see this film  spielberg and hanks should both get oscars for this effort and the film should win best picture for sure  definitely one to be remembered,reality
this movies violence in this had a much more serious approach than in any other movie that ive seen  i am a huge fan of action movies faceoff the rock and those types and the violence in those is so overblown and off the wall that its fun the war scenes in are far from fun  they are graphic and brutal  thats what makes the movie powerful  while reading another persons comment they said this is nothing like real combat  i cant disagree with them because i have never seen real combat  i can however say that it shows that war is not something that should be glorified it is a brutal and painful experience and besides that it is a story very well told,reality
the first segment makes you say hmmm i wonder what this is about  then it cuts to the omaha beach invasion  as warrealistic as spielberg wants us to believe it is the most realism that this segment portrays is the excruciating pains ww2 soldiers felt as compared to our excruciating headaches we received from this vibrating cam  dont get me wrong  i think the first and last war segment should have been shot with this camera but all the segments in between should have been toned down  any scene shot with this cam would make just about any person want to vomit whether it be a love scene or just a still scene  i understand that spielberg wanted to mix the effect received psychologically to make one uncomfortable with the effect received from the explosions blood guts and screaming to make this movie seem real  well it worked  but still it was a movie that people want to be entertained and the only entertainment received was during the calm scenes on the imdb scale i gave it an 8  bad spec writing but good rewriting by frank who gave us malice get shorty and out of sight  great direction bad cam bad,reality
the movie is sensational from the first moment to the last i am a rotc cadet and this is a firm wake up call that war is not for the weak hearted  and that comradery is the most awesome thing in the world,reality
my family has been in the military for many generations  i was in the air force and flew in desert storm  even though im out now i play a lot of paintball so that i can get a taste of the thrill of combat  in a way i ve glorified war all my life with my particular wartime experience and all the war movies that have come out its been easy to think of war in a detached sort of wayafter seeing spr ive totally changed my mind  i dont cherish the thought of charging on a battlefield anymore  what i did in ds was antiseptic and was nothing like what someone would encounter on the ground  i really felt like i was there with those ground troops i dont ever want to be there for real  just that small taste of the real horrors of war is enough for meeven so if i am called to defend my country once again i would do it  i wont refuse to fight for america and its allies if i have to i just wont be the first one in line calling for military action,reality
the deep rumble of huge diesel engines heading to an obscure shore a hopelessly choppy sea soldiers praying soldiers puking soldiers scared beyond words  this is just the opening 60 seconds of the already timeless dday scene  no words are spoken in the opening minute but the images and sounds portrayed make up for that in a heartbeat  i was already moved but the first minute only slightly prepares the viewer for the impending landing on omaha beach  the scenes which follow last around 25 minutes but may haunt thousands of peoples minds for years  the realism which spielberg brings to the normandy assault is staggering and profoundly disturbing  the ocean was red with the blood of young soldiers that morning and spielberg will make us remember it this opening scene alone is worthy of study and countless accolades  in fact the opening dday scene is the most heart wrenching and realistic combat scene ever captured on film  the normandy scenes could be newsreels from the actual time if they were bw the movie is amazing through and through but i am only reviewing the first thirty minutes until i absorb the rest of this amazing work,reality
obviously this film has the best war sequences ever made and blah blah blah this does not make up for the fact that plot character development and any sense of originality were left out of the picture dont get me wrong i think it was a stunning movie and i would recomend it to anyone i just think people can get to excited over something too fast also the opening and closing scenes with the old man were the biggest waste of my theatre time in years not since twister have i felt so used the design and realism was incredible and i left the theatre feeling very moved and it lasted for a while but best war movie ever made platoon or apocalypse now were not as graphic but i will never forget the feeling i had when i first saw these war films i am very interested in checking out thin red line later this year to see how it,reality
this film should not sweep the oscars even though it will  the only awards this movie should get are best sound best sound efects editing and best makeup  people are so crazy about how this film is a groundbreaking achivemnet for humankind  this film does not have a new message  its message is basically  war is not good   gee reallyyou think  lots have people have done war movies and a large amount of them were better than spielbergs  and people are saying that is the most gritty and scary war films ever made  it is not even close to attaining that title das boot is my choice  the truman show is the film that should win them all  it had original ideas and it dealt with them in an original way  it had a message that nobody had fully confronted yet  is only my second favorite film of the year and is not even close to being as good as the truman show,reality
im only 16 years old  ive never been even remotely connected to a war  i hope i never am either  after seeing this movie i am horrified at the thought of people fighting people who are just like eachother except they live in different places and follow different ideas  this movie makes all the emotion and passion of war real  the camera movements and close ups of the death gives you a feeling of sorrow for every soldier who has ever died and ever will die  i hope people of my generation will see it and realize how horrible war really is,reality
was the best war epic ever created  when i say best i mean that it was the most powerful recreation of war ever seen by those who have not partaken in it  but most of all i mean that it was the most truthful  veterans from all over the world can now finally share the pain and suffering which has tormented them for so long if my country asks me to fight i will not cower  but i do hope sir that my leaders will have seen this film will have seen the horrors the anguish the death and that ultimately they will see the alternatives,reality
is the greatest portrayal of war on film that i have ever seen mainly because it works like a documentary during the battle scenes  it was as close to the action as possible for the viewer and for that it is great  everyone should see it just to experience ithowever i do have some complaints  there are several instances that were far too manipulative on spielbergs part  the little girl and her family the german soldierprisoner incident  the aging veteran  all very questionable and probably not necessary  the sheer content of the picture was moving enough why elaborate on other things of much lighter substance this deserves a nomination for best picture but if the thin red line lives up to expectations id hesitate to give it a win  unforgettable all the same though,reality
this movie gave me a headache  the photography i must tell you is unique the camera is never still during battle scenes  it made me nauseous watching a 70 screen shake as the cameraman follows soldiers around a battle scene  spielberg purposelessly made the camera vibrate rather than damping it a la shaky cam  if spielberg likes this effect i dont  not for every single shot in every single battlebesides poor camera work the plot was somewhat thin  it was a complex plot for a war movie but it was still lacking  i would give the screenwriting a c only because there was some good comic relief  but the entire movie was so predictable that the length over two hours made the movie languish  toward the end all i wanted was for the men to find finish their little war game and send him home  so i could go homethe characters well what can we say  they are stereotypes what the movie script writers call composite characters  the guy who freezes up  the intellectual  the guy whos the gungho nofrills groundpounder  the guy everyone looks up to  the guy whose every other line is a halfaudible prayeri could almost see the script as i watched the film  it was because the characters even though they are welldeveloped are still one dimensional they are almost completely staticoutstanding directing average screenwriting excellent realism and effects average music and superb sound make this movie one of the best of 1998 but i watched this movie the same day as i saw gone with the wind and im sorry theres just no comparison  7 out of 10  go see vivien leigh again,reality
very realistic ww2 movie about the real horrors of war and what it does to you   one of the best ive seen this year  speilberg also redeemed himself after the disappointing jurassic park the lost world  hanks should be considered for a third oscar,reality
i hated and loved this film and believe everyone should see it  maybe then we wouldnt glamorize war,reality
the technical effects of the normandy landing as well as other battle scenes overshadowed the dialog  maybe my hearing is not as acute as it could be but i could not hear much of the spoken dialog amid the shelling explosions and other noise  if the movie was a display of special effects it succeeded if it was to tell a story it was marginal in my opinion,reality
at the end of you feel as if youve been punched in the stomachnever before have i seen war portrayed so graphicallyand for people like mewho had family in world war 2 it was especailly moving,reality

had anybody else made this movie i would call it a flawless achievement  but spielberg is capable of better  its a great movie but he could have made it even greater if he had just pushed himself a little harder,reality
saw it yesterday  the theater emptied in complete silence  only other movie ive seen have that reaction was schindlers listthe sounds of bullets smacking into flesh are still with me,reality
war as true to life in its blood and death as well as its human drama and spiritual element as could be short of being there this will go down as one of the most powerful movies ever made i do not lightly call it a masterpiece our country needed thisgod bless stephen spielberg,reality
say what you will about the movie  you may have loved it hated it thought it was the best or worst film ever  you may have thought the battles were amazing disturbing or both  maybe the story wasnt enough for you maybe it was too much  i wont bore you with my accounts of the filmyou need to judge that for yourself  what i will say is this the most touching part of the film for me was looking to my right and seeing and elderly man in his dress uniform watching the movieproudly at times sobbing at others while his wife held his hand tightly  the movie touched him  he other vets like him and those that died have gone unappreciated for far too long  its about time someone did something that touched them,reality
left me with some of the conflicted feelings id had toward spielbergs schindlers list  i wanted to admire the film but as powerful as parts of it were i felt it didnt quite achieve what it was reaching for the first halfhour offers a searing recreation of the invasion of normandy rightly so but after that chaotic gory opening the movie seems to lose its way steven spielberg apparently wanted to make an epic film  without any epic characters at least schindlers list had oskar schindler the american soldiers who are assigned to try to save private are with the exception of captain miller and corporal upham pretty much ciphers someone might reply youre missing the point  men in combat usually dont have time to get well acquainted but private doesnt seem to be about the anonymity of war this is not to say it needed the jolly ragtag group of stereotypes youd get in a john wayne war picture but the characters  the ones we care about  should have loomed a bit larger and while spielberg gets credit for avoiding the clichs of a john wayne picture he still falls back on a hollywood style of story telling complete with silhouetted figures against a dying sunlight and uplifting john williams music on the soundtrack as surprising as this may sound i found myself halfwishing that john wayne had played captain miller instead of tom hanks i can picture the duke shouting hanks line were not here to do the decent thing were here to follow orders wayne by his booming presence would have automatically filled up the general blankness of the character hanks miller doesnt seem interesting enough to justify the pool his men are running theyre wondering what his occupation in civilian life was seems to suffer from spielbergs desire to make it the definitive world war ii movie just as schindlers list seemed to suffer from a desire to be the definite holocaust drama the scene in which general george c marshall makes his little speech in favor of is very touching but i couldnt help wondering if the us army is that concerned about the last of the brothers why were all four of them sent to the front lines in the first place,reality
i loved this movie i thought it was one of the harshest depictions of war i have ever seen  the fading of the color in it made it even more realistic great performance all around even matt damon as private who shows up in the last quarter mr spielberg you have done it again,reality
finally a good film about dday since the longest day this movie reflects the true stress and thoughts of soldiers during a war not only the sets and locations are right but also the feelings of the soldiersto make it a short comment this movie got it allaj,reality
my first suggestion to anyone who has not yet seen this movie is go  dont wait for video dont think it cant be half as good as they say dont use the 1000 different procrastinators excuses  just go  is every bit as moving amazing and harrowing as youve heardand then some  more importantly gives the audience just a taste of what it must have been like to be a soldier in what is called the last great war and in the process shows you in no uncertain terms that no war is great  also made me realize just what a sacrifice the men who fought world war ii made to ensure that you and i and everyone that came after lived in a safer freer worldyes the 25minute omaha beach scene is terrifying intense and graphic but stick it out  youll see some incredible feats made more so by the realization that real men actually did these things  a small non spoiler example  one of the medics with his corpsman going down a line of wounded soldiers bullets are flying all around men are still being killed and maimed in horrific ways yet here is this medic performing triage knowing at any second one of those bullets might find himspielberg and especially tom hanks bring you into the war you truly see that to the soldier war isnt about opposing ideologies but about accomplishing your mission and getting your guys and hopefully yourself home in one piece  thats it  not patriotism at least not on the front lines not idealism just survival and duty and loyalty to your guys  and hanks shows you how in the midst of loss and destruction and almost intolerable inhumanity a man can still do his duty more than any other actor in the film hanks shows you how a man normal and mildmannered back home finds the strength to do what is asked and continue doing it until the task is completefor me tom hanks makes this movie  many reviews have pointed out that tom hanks delivers another of the brilliant emotionally threedimensional performances we as one critic put it have come to expect of him  tom hanks work in private is so subtle so real yet so breathtakingly beautiful that the academy will have taken leave of its collective senses if they dont give him a third oscar  in my humble opinion tom hanks is one of the greatest actors of this generation  you can keep your deniros your hoffmans your pacinos give me tom hanks any dayits a powerful movie not perfect but very nearly so  dont deny yourself the experience of seeing on the big screen  its a trip worth making,reality
it smells war it smeels drama and it smeels reality in every corner in this film its got to be good when spielberg do it he does it over and over again and we have tom in the main role he fits very good in a war film fabolous job tom i was suprised how well he did this role i thought tom belonged to comedys and romantic dramas but no tom is a great soldier in the greatest movie ever made prnow july 2001,reality
the first half hour of this movie is incredible i watch it in awe but after that the film has to rely on the story and charactersit kind of is a let down the story is kind of ho hum i think this file would have been better if it were structured differently i think starting off so strong only made it more difficult to keep the audience interested in its characters and story i think the intent was to grip the audience in the beginning and that theyd have no choice but to be involved in the story i didnt find this to be the case i would give this a 11 out of 10 for the first 30 minutes it really is the most gut wrenching thing ive ever seen on film and a 7 out of 10 for the rest of it,reality
is the best depiction of war ever steven spielberg has shown us once again that he is one of the best directors of all timethe writing is ok and the whole film could have been 30 minutes but the direction is where this film is so amazing  the cinematography is wonderfull maybe intense is the best word and spielbergs shots are beyond deserving of best directorthe film is extreamly graphic bloody and violent but this is why it is the best depiction of war  the camera doesnt pan away when someone gets shot instead you see full on the horrors of warif you faint at the sight of blood then dont watch this movie youll probably have a heart atack  if you dont faint at the sight of blood watch this movie its amazing,reality
if ever a movie needed a ghost this one was it  just a bunch of guys running around europe fighting the koreans and fixing an endless amount of boats at every river they crossed was not enough to sustain a featurelength film  if there had been a subplot where maybe they had to chase a ghost into ireland who then showed them some magical charm that turned them all into geniuses it might have won best picture,reality
i dont know how people could have such awful things to say about this movieit is one of the best movies ive ever seen and definately my favorite the script was written beautifully and had an interesting plot the characters were amazingly welldeveloped it was historically accurate and the actors did a great job not to mention the great directing job this is a perfect war movie so what if it has its bloody moments i honestly have seen much worse i would rather watch the dday scene a thousand times than any stabbing in scream or some other dumb horror movie the blood and guts in spr help tell the story it is needed to show the realities of war so if u can handle a few minutes of a very realistic omaha beach scene then i suggest this movie for anyone,reality
an absolutely wonderful film  tough to watch yet hard not to stare at the screen like a rubbernecker at the scene of an accident on the freeway  spielberg once again shows us how important of a film maker he is i highly recommend  it is sure to be in the front of the pack come oscar night,reality
tom hanks  is very good in this action thriller about a unit sent to find one man who has lost 3 members of his family in ww2 it centres round private and the soldiers sent to get him home in one piece the start of this film is very bloody indeed but so real you can feel the pain of the injuried and dying men this is one watch again and again 1010,reality
spielberg was robbed  spielberg was robbed  this was the rallying cry of the 1998 oscars as shakespeare in love went on to win best picture in place of this dark portrayl of dday and the days following  this however is not my opinion  the film itself was robbed of appropriate actors a strong script and a good endinghowever before ripping to shreds let first tell you the good  the first scene is horrifyingly good  the stark real unedited scene truly shows you the horrors of war  furthermore it is mixed in with the artistic craftsmanship of steven spielberg pay attention to the part where bullets pierce the underwater environmentnow on to the bad  tom hanks great as he may be was not a smart choice for the leading role  he is so gentle in the role that you expect him to put the word please after every line  second matt damon as the dreadfully forgettable  the last scene which is drawn out long and at times boring  and finally the final scene which defies the meaning of corny by ending with an american flag flapping in the windis a good movie not a great one  this situation would be best described as its parts are better than the whole  particularly the first scene  so see it for what it is and please resist the temptation to shout cool  this is a war movie not gladiator,reality
aside from the first 15 minutes where the near disaster on omaha beach is effectively portrayed the rest of the film is a standard john wayne sands of iwo jima type propaganda film made up of the most mundane and unbelievable tripe if the truth be told the american forces at omaha would have been pushed back into the sea except for the british and canadian forces immediately on their left flank who achieved all their objectives that day and pinned down the bulk of the germans forces within their hq area centred in caen and thus prevented them from swinging south and completely obliterating the omaha beachhead aside from that historical fact not referred to in the film the movie had other major shortcomings ie  no combat commander in his right mind would risk the lives of a full patrol to rescue a single private no matter what the reason  no platoon leader played by tom hanks would go into combat with his officer stripes shining brightly on his helmet to do so would invite an immediate sniper bullet from germans who specifically targeted officers for priority elimination  no platoon leader would insist on attacking an enemy strongpoint unnecessarily  especially since his orders were to only to get private he could have detoured around the strong point but instead chose to attack it and lose some of his valuable platoon members why  tom hanks and his heroic defence of the french town which climaxed the film was frankly unbelievable the germans may have been the enemy but they were not stupid in real life hanks and his little patrol would have surrendered or been brushed aside within seconds by a determined german force backed by tanks when oh when are the americans going to produce a realistic war movie which truthfully captures the events flavour and outcome of combat reality without the john wayne histrionics,reality
the realism of this film grabs you from the beginning and holds you throughout  this is a film that everyone should see at least once,reality
is in my opinion just another yankee war movie but it has one fine advantage its very realistic unlike in most american films in this they die like flies especially in first situation where americans are running against machinegun fireit tells fairly well about madness of total war and does it very well but as story goes further it starts to look like another action kill em all movie,reality
what made me perplexed about this movie is the message sent by spielberg during the dramatic sequences of the normandy battle i thought he was attempting to show the horror and absurdity of war but he chooses to dehumanize the german soldiers more you should not spare the life of one even a unarmed prisoner because that ungrateful coward will comeback to kill you and all your journeymen with pleasurei guess it would be to difficult for spielberg to show that the horrors of the holocaust and of the war were not perpetrated by a different species contained in a certain  time but by men like every others and under certain conditions these could be reproduced anywhere elsewhy not make a film that makes us realize even the jewish that we could be are those monsters so history does not repeat itself instead we have another one about courage under fire and the starspangled banner in triumph shall wave oer the land of the free and the home of the brave,reality
this a film like no other not only does it rise above all other war movies it is among the best movies out there the battle scenes are simply unbelievable and leave you breathless and on the edge of your seat the realism is to the point that you actually feel like a participant in the war i havent always liked spielbergs movies but when i saw this i was sold it has quickly become my favorite movie and contributed to my fascination with the history of world war ii and with dday and the campaign in europe particularly from the opening credits it brings you right into the invasion at omaha beach within a few minutes this scene is an unforgettably realistic portrayal of one of the most important days of this century it is a true crime that this picture did not win the academy award for best picture i own it on dvd and have watched it over 20 times i can hardly wait for the hbo miniseries band of brothers based on the stephan ambrose book,reality
portrays brutality of war more accurately than any other movie,reality
it seriously makes me sad that so many people are so ignorant when it comes to films like this  is the best film ive seen in my life time  it tells the truth about war and if you say its fake or overrated then ask my grandfather who fought in this war  or maybe my greatuncle who stormed the beach of normandy  this is a film that only certain americans may like  there are english viewers way too full of their god save the queen attitude to actually give it a chance  europeans canadians and australians might act as ignorant as the english and bombard this masterpiece with their racist criticism  this is only a film for the openminded and warmhearted american viewer  since other countries hate to see our flag waving it would be best if the film remained watched by only american audiences  i love this film and i think its one of the best,reality
ive seen the movieand read the comments a few minor points to the response regarding the unreality of the kissing the crucifixes et al as a former marine infantry rifleman in vietnamabout 23s of my comrades and i carried everything from st christopher medals to stars of davidand we did kiss them hold them and talk to them that isnt unrealistic or hypocriticalits fact and wwii had a more religious cadre than vietnam to the response on how bad the cinematography was how boring the non combat scenes were and how grotesquely horrific the combat scenes were spielberg was trying his best to show reality he succeeded the cinematography wasnt badjune 1944 was a miserably cold rainy monthit looked dreary because it was periods between combat are boringstupifyingly so combat is horrificthe only way mr spielberg could have made it more realistic would have been to pour blood excrement and puke into the theatres and occasionally step up behind a viewer and whack him across the back of the head when a shell exploded nearby thats reality people good cinematography gives us reality the comment regarding the ordinariness of the participantswell that is what makes them heroes wwii was not fought by supermenit was fought by normal people admiral halsey once commented there are no great menthere are only extraordinary challenges that ordinary men are forced by circumstance to overcome finally in regard to the complaint that the story was absurd it wasnt after the five sullivan brothers all died aboard the uss juneau brothers were routinely separated to avoid precisely this kind of occurrence that is historical fact there was a set of brothers involved in normandy one died with the 4th infantry on utah beach one with the 82nd airborne one was missing in burma and one presumably the pvt was missing with the 101st the one in burma and the one with the 101st eventually turned up safe bless them but the situation was not unheard of and the generals were not being overly gentle although contrary to current opinion wwii generals werent monsters and could be gentle they were trying to avoidprevent what could have been a horrible morale blow to the american people one set of sullivans can be inspiring two sets can be terribly depressing it was a legitimate actioni was wounded twice in vietnam i fought and killed is a truthful movie the violence is real as opposed to gratuitous the horror is real and its very mundane quality is what made it horrific the premise is neither ridiculous nor evil read about how joe kennedy was killed and the military theory behind that mission then come back and explain about absurd theories in war being made up it is a great moviea schindlers list for the infantryman by the waythe germans werent protrayed as that bad they fought and died just as the americans did consider the first battle scene the americans on the attack and getting pounded then consider the last battle scene the germans on the attack and getting pounded attacking isnt easy nor funthe odds are with the defense not eviljust fact and regarding the german who was released and then eventually shot hanks character from that range and in that situation it is doubtful he even knew who he was shooting there was no evil intent just bad luck another truth about combat enough thank you for the chance to comment,reality
i watched 34 of in another language which i did not understand and i still loved this moviethis is what the 88th wonderful performance tom hanks has giveni loved the cinematography and the film itself,reality
often hailed as one of the greatest war movies of all time i have to wonder if i saw the same movie as all those other folks dont get me wrong there is no arguing that the opening scenes of the americans storming the beach at normandy are graphic and thanks to modern technology all too realistic but these scenes are pretty much where the war movie ends and the melodrama begins for a movie about wwii the film lacks giving any information about the war why the soldiers are there or any other facts in regards to what occurred in normandy or elsewhere during the war  what ensues is a very pathetic character study of a group of entirely uninteresting individuals while some performances stand out there is not much to work with the script is such a gloss hollywood piece of work but then anything about the war seems to be one of the best films these days for those who argue this is one of the best warantiwar films ever take another look at catch22 or better yet dr strangelove or even slaughterhousefive great depictions of the horrors of war and the toll that battle can take on people i give a whole 3 stars out of 5  mainly because of graphic elements and believable combat scenes,reality
first of all im happy that movies can be made to look like the real world old warmovies had very poor action flics but but they had a story remember the battle of the bulge real suspense makes you watch and be excited for the whole two hours what does this film have it makes you go pale andor throw up after the first few minutes you swear not to touch a rifle in your life and after 30 minutes extreme nothing no story no dialogues no acting yes extremely poor acting the whole movie is like a bad tv show disturbing action flics nothing but blood and guts sure it is a great success to make a movie that can give you a very realistic feeling of war but picture this ive read a book written by a doctor about the siege of budapest in wwii that book had bigger effect on me than this poor movie just text it takes more than a few flying limbs to make a movie next time if steven spielberg directs a movie showing exploding barrels for two hours will it be nominated for best moviebookwhatsoever,reality
the opening of this movie is one of the best battle scenes ive witnessed in 50 years of movie viewing  so many appropriate superlatives about this scene have already been written by other reviewers that i cant add anything moreunfortunately once this scene is over the movie becomes a rather pedestrian wwii moviejust too predictable and at times stretching ones willingness to suspend disbelief to the ultimate and beyond  its worth watching but the bulk of the movie is just a rehash of cliches from just about every wwii film made in the 1940s and 50sopening scene rates a 10 the rest of the movie a 4 average 7,reality
some classic movies are very entertaining and pure fun like star wars and raiders of the lost ark  other are powerful and moving like schindlers list  is at the top of the later category  it maybe the best movie ever and it is without a doubt the best in its genre  it is truly a movie that one shouldnt miss  go see now,reality
1st watched 5311999  8 out of 10dirsteven spielberg realistic wwii war story which is wellplayed by the cast  different view of this war than weve seen without callouslike characters which we are used to in war filmsthey actually have feelings,reality
as a 17yearold i find the thought of war particularly harrowing since i and my peers would be eligible for the draft if war were to break out  if it did i honestly dont know what id do but the action of going into the middle of the battlefield surrounded by bullets and men with blood streaming out of their bodies seems too terrible to contemplate  and its all too easy to intellectualize war particularly for those who are well beyond draftable age saying yeah it would be terrible but its your duty as a citizen  thats not considering the complete picture people who have such a simple answer cant possibly understand what being in a war would be like   in all its brutal realism should make people think twice before saying something like that so nonchalantly  because the fact is people go into battles and get their limbs blown off get shot five times in the chest or worst of all get hit where they dont die immediately and then just have to lie there whimpering that theyre going to die  people who havent been in war can say its terrible but if youre called its your duty but i imagine that most people who have experienced war will only tell you that its terrible  many things have already been said about this movie that i neednt repeat  it definitely was an outstanding motion picture  but there is one thing i want to say about those who are so intent on complaining about the bookend scenes being too sentimental and thats this  the sentimentality wasnt the point  at least not in my mind  at the end  when the old man  is looking at the grave of one of his comrades his wife walks up to him  she looks at the grave too but her expression is blank and her gaze quickly away from the grave to the old mans face a face that has written on it the knowledge of what the man whose name is on the cross did for him when i saw those two people i gasped because i realized that the two of them were on opposite sides of the spectrum of experience and were therefore seeing completely different things embodied by the cross to the woman the cross was simply the life of her husband he was what mattered to her  but to the man the cross was everything the war had been the terrible fighting the killing the sacrifice that the man in the ground beneath him had given for him  that was what i got out of the bookend scenes and i found that moment to be one of the most poignant moments of the entire movieschindlers list transcended the form of cinema it didnt even feel like a movie or a documentary for that matter it was so welldone  still struck me as a movie save the first scene which really puts you there but it was nevertheless one of the most powerful movies ive ever seen,reality
the first time i saw this movie i sat with my eyes wide open it have perfect soundeffects good acting i cant mention an only negative thing about this movie i have seen many warmovies in the last years and i have never seen a warmovie thatss this good this must be one of the best movies to steven spielberg since et the movie got a great story about some people that get a mission to save private in world war 2 after the invasion in normandie they get their mission from some high rank generals it is full of action through the hole movie it wont be a minute where your bored it is good from the beginning to the end if you havent seen it you should not seeing this movie is a big mestake take my advice and see this huge movie,reality
a powerful movie that strips away any notion that war is anything but brutal  indiscriminate random sudden and unpredictable  most other movies have bombs and bullets killing people people in clean neat ways  spr doesnt  its real and as a viewer it is very believable and that is what gave it the emotional impact  in the middle the movie drags some never engaging me as much as schindlers list did  nonetheless a potent film that like schindlers list should be seen and not seen for entertainment value,reality
it is a movie like this that tells me why steven spielberg is a god of all the war movies i have ever seen this certainly tops the list not platoon apocalypse now full metal jacket the deer hunter can prepare you for this experience    8 for 1 what an odd math equation why would eight men risks their lives for the sake of 1 this is spielbergs question posed and answer it he does tom hanks is the reclusive capt john miller sent to lead seven others into the heart of german occupied france to save one private james matt damon    i dont want to explain what happens because i want you to see the movie yourself    no stomach for violence i hope you can survive the first 24 minutes the battle scene that will go down in the history as the greatest invasion ever filmed it is the infamous dday invasion the invasion of normandy to others hell on earth to those who were there i dont know if this is accurate and all im 15 the closest thing to war i ever had was my grandfather so i dont know firsthand but i leave it to spielberg to tell the truth    it is a film not about war but men in war the feelings of love loss courage and cowardice all of it is interwoven into well the best film of the year and one of the greatest of all time it is so beautiful and horrific it wrenches your soul and you know that hey this actually happened men fought and men died i have a new found honor for those who fought to keep me free and those who died trying    i only have a thousand words so i should keep it brief spielberg has crafted a gory yet beautiful gritty yet polished film this will not be the film he is not remembered for that was schindlers list but this will certainly put him the legends books at hollywood    of 4 stars               in the last great invasion of the last great war the hardest mission for eight men was saving one,reality
this is one of the best ww2 action movies made to date a must seefrom start to finish you are on the edge  of your seat the movie is as close as those who were never in combat will come to the real thing,reality
this movie starts out with one of the most powerful scenes i have ever seen on the big screen the viewer is taken right down to the front line of soldiers of the dday invasion of normandy in 1944 the camera transfers the fear and helplessness of a war directly to the audience it was really a really strong scene nearly painful and a mustseethus starts out as one of the greatest war movies ever however the exaggerated american patriotism and superiority mixed with typical hollywood production soon makes this film just another film about the heroic american gis,reality
many just dont get it  this is an antiwar movie the plot concerns a group of men sent to do something kind of pointless and futile in one of the most necessary and important wars of the last 2000 years  this plot is based partially on a true story however the true story happened during the civil war not during world war iifor a wide variety of critics of this movie a copy of t2 and matrix would be all they need to keep them cinematically happy for the rest of their lives  do not i repeat do not go to see this movie or some actionadventure  go rent raiders of the lost ark or some other wornout mindnumbing eyecandy moviethis movie is really different  it is arguably that only war movie in history that is 100 realistic all the way down to the pacing of the war iteself  war consists of periods of ferocious fighting and abject terror bookending long periods of introspection and fear  the closest thing to this movie is all quiet on the western frontthe musical theme for this movie is also superb  it can be compared to the outstanding theme for patton  however the tone and emphasis of the movie and the music are the polar opposite of that of patton,reality
scratch the surface of this excellent war movie and you find the same film that was made dozens of times in hollywood during ww ii  theres a bloody battle too bloody for me here despite all the hoopla suggestion is often more powerful than realism theres a gold star mother theres an italian theres a jew theres a kid from brooklyn theres the nerd theres the officer with a heart of gold theres the allknowing top sarge need i continueperhaps most viewers have forgotten how moving those old films were  most of course cant remember them  to those i say spend 90 minutes in front of your tv set the next time one is aired youll be surprised by how good they were,reality
while watching the first twentyfive minutes of all that i could think of was oh jesus oh jesus which is what im sure the men were thinking when they landed on omaha beach that day bullets were flying through men like they were tin foil this movie is the most realistic war movie ever made  when thinking of dday most people think of a glorious battle that helped turn the tide of war in reality it was a large group of men trying to stay alive in whatever way they could  this movie is not an antiwar film whoever says it is is wrong this movie depicts war the way it is those men gave their lives for their country and saved many others  however all the people who see army advertisements and are thinking of joining need to see this film first,reality
there are good aspects to this movie  quite strong characterisation the most stunningly horrific depiction of war ever and a sensitive treatment of the subject matterof course this is not to say that the subject matter is anything but the most insulting piece of american historical revisionism to cross our screens in years  apparently tom hanks is still the conversative white all american hero he hasnt played any other role in years which tells you something about his self image politics and ego the americans were the only people involved in world war ii and all american values are the best thing to fight for  they almost covered the humanity of the germansbut no  they almost mentioned other countries but nothey almost gave a treatment of war worthy of the first 20 minutes oh hang on  no they didnt  they sunk into sentimentalism flag waving and tom being a hero at the price of the story and quality  insulting to the memory of wwii vets from around the world,reality
is perhaps director steven spielbergs greatest works it illustrates clearly the stark reality of war using graphic images that previously have not been seen in more traditional movies of this genre visually it is stunning yet disturbing at the same time however the shocking images displayed only further reiterate the brutality of war the comradery between the soldiers in the film is strong and probably a pretty accurate account of the importance of brotherhood during times of war all alone in a foreign country with little more than a backpack and a rifle to call their own each man is dependent on his peers to carry him through and keep him going through such difficult timesif you have a weak stomach or prefer the glossed over unrealistic version of life then is not the movie for you  you should stick to cheerier films like the sound of music or romantic comedies the movie evokes a range of emotions in the viewer from laughter to sadness and i would strongly recommend it to anyone with an interest in history particularly war and to those looking for a good wellshot classic film,reality
is the most heartwrenching and terrifying thing ive ever seen  tom hanks is quite possibly the best actor of our time  his performance was outstanding as were many of the notwellknown supporting actors  this movie is as valuable to society as schindlers list  speilberg is brilliant  the effects and scenes were so incredible that for three hours i crouched on the edge of my seat with squinted  tearfilled eyes  i applaud anyone who was involved with this masterpiece of american history  and bravo to the men who survived and those who didnt the terror of world war ii my  heart goes out to you,reality
i say speechless because that is how this movie left me  i cant remember another movie that made me hold on to my seat so tightly or hold my breath so long  it is a rare movie that while awing you with the spectacular sights and sounds of battles allowed me to feel so close to all actors involved that i felt a great loss if and when they died,reality
this is an excellent movie it makes you feel like your really there capt john miller tom hanks has to risk his life as well as the lives of eight other men to find private james matt damon who lost his three brothers who were killed in the war this isnt the best family movie but it makes you realize how tragic the war was this movie is very realistic and very well made the actors did a very good job in giving you the impression of how scary and depressing the war was,reality
i must say that is one of the most moving and powerful films that i have ever seen  i have always tried to look at wwii veterans with respect my respect gratitude and awe have increased a millionfold  with this film,reality
steven spielberg and tom hanks have succeeded in creating an excellent world war ii film that vividly depicts the sights of war while providing a story with a heart  the character driven story of a band of american soldiers sent to rescue private is powerful and moving and the performances by all involved are impressive to say the least  viewing the beach scene at the beginning of the film moves you to honor and respect the sacrifice made by those brave men in wwii  the music the camera work and the directing make this epic a successful film worth watching and keeping in your own collection,reality
if providing the world with schindlers list wasnt enough the soon to be steven spielberg kbe has yet again achieved greatness on film although every critic in the world will praise the cast for superbly acted performances you really have to congratulate the crew on an outstanding contribution to the movie the sets look incredible the sound is amazing and the camerawork is second to none tom hanks seals in concrete his position as the greatest american actor of all time with another beautiful performance however the highest praise of all has to fall to steven spielberg he is without a doubt the beatles of cinema and if schindlers list was his revolver then is his sgt peppers,reality
spielberg does it again  i have always been a fan of his but this is his best film  from the first scene to the last it kept me spellbound  i could hardly believe the time almost 3 hours went by so fast  the cast is superb especially hanks and sizemores roles  i highly recommend you see this film but i must warn you the combat scenes are not for the squeamisha 10 out of 10,reality
yesi think that it was the most impressive film i have ever seen and also it is so tragic cause a lot of people die for one personit was so sad for meespecially the last partthe bridgeof the film was sadand john h millers death is very tragic because if he could wait for a minutemaybe nothing happens to himalso all of the people acting at the cast are very successfuli havent seen a film like this before,reality
all i can say about this movie is that it blows away any other war movie it is accessibly to anyone who watches it from a highschool drop out factory worker to some rich guy with a doctorate in film studies it leaves you with an impression that only a movie could deliver this is what it was likesome pople may not know this but the plot of the movie is based on an extraction of what almost happened  one single mother sent her four sons into the war and on one day recieved death notices for three of them two died on dday one was lost and presumed killed in the pacific theatre though he was actually captured and returned at the end of the war  the us army sent the last son home for the same reasons as in the movie fortunately in reality a chaplain found the homewardbound gi very quickly  the movie asks what would have happened had he not been so accessiblewatching this film it really gives you more an idea of what the war was like  im a history major and my focus is on the second world war ive read at many dozens of books on the war and written more than a few essays including several on dday itself  still nothing brought me closer to a visceral understanding than this movie  everything is so real from the opening sequence to the more subtle body of the movie the two times cityfighting in the french town are amazing  it does not rely on any pansy artistic nonsense in the directing to make its point as the far inferior thing red line does it simply presents the realityto address some of the complaints of the moviethe lack of other nationalities is understandable  normandy was divided into five zones two of them were american it is in one of those two that the story takes place  simple  also the man the story is based on was american so thats were he is in the movie  and to be honest the american landings on utah and omaha beaches were more exciting than the canadian one of juno beach and the british ones on gold and sword beaches this was true because the commonwealth armies were competent the americans messed up by overplanning their landings and by declining to engage in prelanding naval and aerial bombardmentive heard some complaints about the gis comments on british general montgomery but those comments were true to what the american troops believed  further montgomery like most allied commanders was no great shakes  its like that in almost every field in the war  rommel was better than patton and montgomery combined isoroku yamamoto was ten times the admiral and the man chester nimits was and so on  face factsto close up here that this film lost the oscar to shakespeare in love is almost criminal  there can be no comparing the two filmssee this movie if you already haventspoilers the most profound part of the movie comes with a single line as hes dying tom hanks character says to the man six men died to save matt damons character earn this  the look in damons eyes easily his best moment as an actor brought a tear to my eye as the screen faded into an aged version of the same character fiftyplus years later  to live be told when youre a teenager that six people died to save you and have to somehow live a good enough life to earn itwow  i can hardly imagine that sort of pressure  very intense,reality
is a great movie people criticize it for its weak story but its more of an allegory of how soldiers are supposed to obey orders instead of question how much sense they make the opening scene on the beach is one of the best ever there should have been more fighting though it got absolutely robbed at the oscars this is a movie people will remember not forget like shakespeare in intestinal discomfort or whatever,reality
i was just curious but when is uncle sam esp during the time of war when they have hundreds to thousands of young sons dying on the battlefield gonna remember poor joe blow even if hes the last of whole bunch of sons blown away by nazi storm  troopers if spielberg wouldve logically answered this question during the course of this film then i guess he would not have a film to make would he it seems to me that the root of this film is rather illogical and rather unlike the uncle sam ive gotten to know over the years and makes the whole point of this film an unbelievable but entertaining mess,reality
i was late into the theatre and entered right when all the bloody stuff was happening  the woman behind me gasped every time blood was shed like every9876 of a second  i sat there for three hours close enough anyway without even knowing itspielberg had done it again  and he got his richly deserved oscar for best director the fact that best picture eluded them was a cheap move on the part of the academy  most war movies paint the enemy in a way that makes them really easy to hate ending up as a fascist pseudopropagandic piece but this wasnt  they werent on a mission for war secrets or to assassinate a nazi general but to get this one guy out of the madness theres captain miller with a yossarianlike attempt to escape the madness his relentlessly cheerful staff the roadblocks and obstacles and finally who theyd not expected  it didnt focus on the evils of the war showing only the soldiers and not the kind of antiwhatsit speeches about their enemies and it didnt promote the greatness of american power despite all the patriotic music  except maybe when you see the starspangled banner at the beginning and so on but otherwise it was pretty neutral politicallyat any rate it deserves its place among the 200 best films of all time according ot imdb and all the blood and guts and gore somehow wasnt brutal or sadistic but merely showing it as it was,reality
i was simply stunned when i saw back in fall 1998 i had very low expectations because the movie title sounded flat director was spielberg who had not directed any gruntlevel war movies so far also tom hanks was starring iti regarded him unsuitable to the role despite being versatile actor but these thoughts quickly vanished from my mind as landing crafts hit the beach and german mgs began peppering the shoreline i began to feel almost as uncomfortable as the us troops pinned on the beach everything was chaotic tracer bullets whistling in the air limbs blown off by mortar shells men dying and screaming in agony waves colored red with blood everything in these first 20 minutes or so was done in amazing detail and accuracy it forced me to adapt totally different attitude towards the rest of the movie this was war nothing less or more just war like it was in summer 1944 in bocage hell of normandycaptain miller and his squads mission is to bring back private james whose all brothers are killed in various theaters of war almost at the same time and he is now the only surviving son of the family despite this naive plot setting and some emotional and patriotic overtones like scene of gen marshall referring to lincoln they seem irrelevant since the movie is all about a squad of army rangers their fighting suffering and griping in normandy battles the chaos of war is captured very well with airborne troops and german units scattered all over normandy cut out of command and communications sometimes only a wall separates germans from americans and solitary german machineguns and snipers take their toll even before captain millers hanks squad even reaches privates unit in a remote village as they finally reach the ruined village refuses to leave and miller decides to stay also to defend an important bridge as the troops wait for a german attack there are some good scenes like idle soldiers killing time talking grunt talk but also the worst scene in the movie matt damon starts to tell miller about some hilarious events taking place with an ugly girl at attic of his homesteads barn i think this scene could have been easily been cut out now it looks only a clumsy attemp to bring depth in the characterthe final battle is another longer combat sequence in this movie and it takes place in the streets of ramelle the fighting is again shown in a realistic manner but i doubt that the elite german ss would advance the main street with tanks like in a parade while expecting us resistance and at some scenes germans just seem to run mindlessly towards intense us machine gun and sniper fire without any cover there are some macho scenes like sgt horvath sizemore and a german running out of ammo and throwing helmets at each other  but these issues might only matter to wwii history buffs like me and generally the combat is more realistic and intense than anything ever seen on the screen beforeat the end of the bloodbath only two men are left of original millers squad with miller gasping earn this with his last breath to private the very end is a return to the beginning of the movie with shown as an old man making visit to millers grave in normandy the final dialogue is between and his wife and the scene is a bit spielbergishly overmelodramatic with asking his wife is he a good man and he then makes a military salute to millers grave which i think is a proper end to to this great war movieoverally this is a classic war movie perhaps not the greatest of all time but at least best of the 90s the acting is excellent tom hanks making his best role so far as emotional yet tough captain miller certainly would have deserved an oscar for that supporting roles are also good but perhaps kind of one dimensional and shadowed by hanks milller character effects are equally good on the special and sound department the washed colors work well and add to realism the general feeling of being there is captured very wellimportant historical note some british comments here state that there were other nationalities like british and canadians in normandy invasion of course there were but this movie is about a squad of men not the whole vast scope of the invasion if you are looking for that watch also the longest day spr is by no means telling that the americans made normandy invasion singlehandedlythe scene where miller and some airborne officer are talking about the progress of the invasion and refer to general montgomery as overrated or he cant get through at caen they were just talking about how american gis really thought during summer 1944 there was a certain amount of friction between western allies and this movie is not claiming that british were incompetentit merely show what was thought in those daysi give the best war movie of the 90s a score of 9510ps the thin red line the other big 98 war movie is nothing compared to this masterpiece makes you think by just showing what war really is the thin red line shows what war really isnt and wants you to think like director has already thought for you,reality
while i may be a bit prejudiced on the subject since i consider myself a wwii buff this is by far the greatest movie i have ever seen  while the extremely graphic violence is not for the faint of heart it is done with a frightening degree of accuracy and that is a large part of what makes this movie truly great  the fact that it was denied the best picture academy award is a crimetom hanks was wonderful as the leader of the small band of men in search of a missing paratrooper  his performance was by no means bad but i personally do not believe it was impressive enough to earn him the oscar  or perhaps to be more fair it was not as impressive as some of the other work done in the same yearspr is a blueprint for how to make a truly wonderful what i would call a fictional documentary based in fact but with a fictional plot linethe most telling moment for me was the first time i saw this film in the theater  when the final scene faded out and the credits rolled there was total silence  not a single person in the packed theater uttered a single word and for a few moments no one even moved  then slowly everyone quietly stood and left  this is the only movie i know that has left an entire audience totally speechless  probably because mr spielberg had already said everything there was to say,reality
i think is indeed the greatest war film ever made it shows in graphic detail and with intense realism the true horror and senselessness of war the fact that this film lost the best picture oscar to shakespeare in love is a crime and shows just how much a farce these awards shows really are,reality
walking into the theater to see this film i knew it would be a great film if you havent seen this film yet you already know its a great movie by going on what you have heard watching the movie and afterward i realized that is much more than a good movie it was like i was sent back to normandy in a time machine to witness the actual event my stomach was churning and i experienced for the first time ever in a movie feelings of fear and pride i actually had a felling in my stomach like i was getting ready to fight in a battle when you hear the nazi tanks coming closer to you it makes you feel the same way i felt proud to be an american watching this movie and every moment since private is an absolute must for everyone but bring some kleenex and a solid stomach for the experience,reality
now that 2 years have passed and everybody has calmed down or has seen it more than 20 times ask yourself this  if it werent for the superbly awesome beginning and ending action sequences isnt this just as routine and regular as any other war movie in memoryif theres brilliant writing i dont see it  what else besides those 2 sequences do 999 of the people marvel over when you mention the name  the tearjerking scene of tom hanks jerking tearsthose 2 mindblowing scenes rendered us defenseless turning us into turnips forcing us to willingly nod our heads to an otherwise corny storyfor me i watched this movie 4 times in the theater  from the second time onward i left the cinema shortly after its a hitler youth knife and came back a little before reiban get on that rabbit,reality
this is without doubt steven spielbergs greatest film and probably the greatest films of all time the director has captured the horror of combat with stunning realism and has drawn magnificent performances from his casta must see for any film fan,reality
this is a film that really demonstrates the horrors of war and the depth of character needed to be a good soldier the battle scenes are truly harrowing spielberg has steered clear of glorifying any event or of undermining realism with cartoonish style violencemy only criticism is that the film portrayed the war as an americangerman conflict despite the dday landings being a joint allied operation we only ever see american troops and equipment,reality
before i saw this movie someone asked me what my favorite movie was and i didnt know  now i have an answer  iand no one else who wasnt there can never really understand what the men who fought world war ii experienced and what the sacrifices they made for us were but this movie does as well as any can to tell a bit of their story  normally when a movie is over people walk out chatting and laughing but there was nothing to say,reality
this film is about one soldier who has to be rescued by tom hanks and his men the first few minutes show the horror of war a sad film with a solid human feel with very good acting by the cast i would recommend this film 1010,reality
stunning simply amazing  the realism of this movie is unparalleled blood splattering on the camera the first person camera angle on the beach in the beginning nearly every little detail has been pondered and analyzed in order to make the film as believable as possible  maybe not the best war movieapocalypse now or full metal jacket but definitely one to be remembered  tom hanks delivers another spectacular acting job while matt damon plays his normal pussy character too helpless to do anything perfect casting  maybe not top 10 caliber but definitely in the top 20,reality
it would be easy to criticize a war film produced with such zeal for recognition by one of hollywoods most talented and ambitious directors  it would be satisfying to downplay the significance of a film like star wars that is wildly popularbut the reality is that like star wars is an inspired film created by a director at the height of his abilities  it is both a love letter to the greatest generation and a warning to us younger folk that war is indeed hellthe famous opening battle scene probably changed more minds about the utility and glamor of warfare than all of baezs and dylans protest songs combinedspeilbergs bravery in bringing such a scene to the popular audience has rightly been rewarded by placing this film in in the pantheon of the best films of all timelets hope that this film sets a new standard for the war film genre  lets take the glamor out of war and leave it where it belongs like on a beach where the only thing being blown up is an air mattress,reality
this is one of the best movies i have ever seen but there was one thing that niggled me that is why is it in every movie about the world war ii which are made in the usa why is it that it is always the americans who did everything right and no one wrong i mean there were mostly british and french people who were fighting in normandy oh yes i know that usa soldiers were there to so the big question is why isnt there a film about the fight in omaha where usa refused help from britainbut on other notes the film itself is excellent i loved every minute of it except that it wasnt historically correct spielberg is the master and tom hanks is the best,reality
this movie is an example of the greatest generation and the hardships they endured in wwii in europe and the pacific campaigns this film is about as real as it gets i am a combat veteran of the korean war and i know what those veterans had to go through i am amazed that they have no memorial in washington although they are supposed to start one on the mallwhere it truly belongsthis spring i hope because we are losing them wwii veterans at the rate of 1000 per day can you believe there are idiots in this country that do not want the memorial built on the mall i am glad the powers to be have over ruled those idiots because that is where it belongs god bless all the wwii veterans and their families and especially those that gave the supreme sacrifice jim kelly,reality
all in all an excellent movie with the first part 25 minutes being amazing while the rest of the movie is very good but with some flaws here and therewhat annoys me a little is all the people out there complaining that it is too usa the usa did not win the war on their own thats right but i dont think its right to complain about not having the other allies in the movie its historically correct as it is the americans landed on some parts of normandy while british troops landed on other parts and as long as the story in this movie is as it is theres no reason to mingle with other nationsive also seen people complain about the flag in the end i think that is to show great disrespect for all the americans who were wounded and killed in ww2 all that participated for that matterthats my humble opinion,reality
was a very good film i loved the gritty realism of wwii that spielberg depicted the performances were all outstanding a few complaints1 lack of character development with the exception of maybe hanks character we learn next to nothing about these men the characterization has little depth2 the sound effects drown out dialogue i dont know if it was intended or not but it was very annoying3 a little unrealistic towards the end ive heard it was based on a true story so maybe im wrong here butoverall i was a little disappointed and i thought schindlers list was far better and remains spielbergs best film,reality
steven spielberg has such an enormous ego that he thinks he can slab a few cardboard characters together make one of them tom hanks who cannot act to save his life and whooppee another oscar and 200 million bucks will come his way unfortunately the uneducated buy anything that is told to them by a screen american public justifies his ego by buying tickets to his films is just another war film written by an ambitious highly paid writer hoping to slap a few scenes together with as little thought as possible and win an oscar as a result if this movie was released in 1999 it wouldnt have been nominated for anything if you want to see a good movie go see girl interrupted being john malkovich magnolia or even toy story 2 they are all far superior to this attempt at saying to americans we won the war with no help whatsoever and we beat the rest of the world yippi if americans knew the real truth oprah would have to extend her contract another 10 years just to talk about it with her brainwashed braindead american housewife viewers,reality
there has only ever been one other war film in existence that delivers such a compelling story with such brutal realism and that was made by speilberg too pools together an gritty harsh truth with stellar performances from each and every member of its cast from barry peppers bible reciting sniper to tom hanks battle hardened captaingenius is certainly a word that is thrown around alot with little to back what it is normally labelled to but to give this movie any other name would be putting down the film and the message it delivers this is a film that is guaranteed to make you feel everything that speilberg wants you toshamefully ignored at the oscars for best film and best actor a consolation can be found in the fact that it was given 5 other oscars including best director,reality
fairly realistic war scenes but sometimes a bit hollywood  we agonized over decision to rescue one boy at the expense of others and can understand both sides of argument  still havent made up our mind  very graphic war scenes showed the horror of war and maybe new generations will be slower to get involved  but i doubt it  tom hanks was masterful,reality
was one of the best films i have ever seen  filled with realistic wwii action it is a very accurate film  i recommend this movie to everyoneits as good as any history lesson 1010,reality
i believe that every american man woman and child over 10 should be required to see this movie  it will give you a new outlook on life and a new appreciation for freedom  it depicts the realness and the sacrifices of war perfectly  i felt i was on the mission with capt miller  perfect acting by all perfect directing perfect photography  this will win the movie director and actor oscars and certainly many more  move over citizen kain godfather schindlers list et al  this is the best movie ever made,reality
i dont have the time to read all the comments so this may be a repeat besides being a war movie that tells it like it is the real message to me is when tom hanks says earn it to young the message to all the survivors of that war and to the succeeding generations is that many lives were sacrificed in order for people to live under a democracy and freedom thats what wwii was all about thats why we should never forget,reality
the one thing doesnt make sense to me is and im no military history expert why dont they blow up the bridge in the first place if everybody has a little childs voice inside of their subconscious when it comes to movie viewing there must be a voice of this little old country lady inside their head  imagine this lady with her arched back halfopened mouth and commenting oh lord look at that  isnt that something   i sure feel that way,reality
is the best war movie ive seen but yet its not all about war it makes you realize that war is a real hell of course you already knew that but all of those who only see war on the news at home really gets to know what war is like by watching this moviethe movie won five oscars best director cinematography edit sound and sound effects but i think that its worth much more than that the acting is brilliant the effects are very and almost too realistic and its the best movie from the whole year of 1998its really breathtaking,reality
this movie will be a classic its one of the best of all time one piece of advice if you havent seen it dont watch it on video to experience this  movie youll need a full surround and a subwoofer so try to watch it on a dts or dd theater or try the dvddts or dvd51 dts is better,reality
the only thing that keeps me from disliking spielberg is his ability to step away from the block buster dollar signs and go back to the place where moviemaking is still dignified  it is as if he doesnt care if it makes money as long as he can replenish his commitment to being a storyteller every now and then with something strong and poignant  now mind you i have a personal reason to loving this movie and that is because i grew up in europe and heard first hand stories from a ninety year old woman about the german occupation  despite the gore which did not deter me from my meal we were at a cinema pub the movie gives the new generations a good look at what true war  not smart bombs and such but real war and real people it is a super movie but that is stating the obvious  personally i would like to thank mr spielberg for reminding the world what the costs of war can be  and how devastating wwii was for the people of europe and the allied forces  a for the flick and a big tip of the hat to mr ss,reality
while is certainly a good film and a major technical achievement it is little more than that  after the stunning first twenty minutes the movie begins to falter  the storyline seems to be based in asking the question what is the value of one life  the characters struggle with risking all of their own lives to save just one  is duty and honor important enough to die for  what if turns out to be a complete degenerate  it is a pretty heady and ultimately unanswerable question yet with the modern bits tacked on the beginning and end of the film spielberg answers the question for us  this is pure schmaltz made to get one last tug on the heart strings  it cheapens the film  when hanks admits to being a schoolteacher back home it is the worst kind of melodrama  when the soldier does his bit in the church about missing his mother we somehow know hell be dead in ten minutes when they release the german soldier we somehow know well see him again  how many cliches and obvious plot devices can one throw into a realistic movie  how about the celebrity cameos that feed a directors egobut serve only to distract the audience from the film hey isnt that ted danson  for the most part it is completely overblown gratuitous melodrama  it isnt even the best war movie ever made much less the best movie ever  its worth the three hours but not much more,reality
is by far the best movie ever made depicting the brutality carnage hope and hopelessness of war  the stark reality of this movie is reality itself  thank you to the men whose blood was shed to ensure the freedom of myself my family and the world i know,reality
this is one the most important films of the 90s and another great in spielbergs close to perfect career tom hanks is extraordinary as always and the supporting players create the perfect ensemble cast the 25minute recreation of dday is the most realistic war sequence ever made every detail was paid close attention to in the making of this extraordinary motion picture that has become possibly the greatest war film ever made,reality
is a good movie i agree with that nevertheless is too light for explaining the story of course it is plenty of traditional stupid humor and a pathetic actuation of tom hanks  thank you god almighty for giving benigni the oscar the red thin line who was less hear in tv shows is infinetly better,reality
the quality of this movie is suburb sound and vision makes it one of the best war movies i have ever seen as far as it is possible i believe that the opening scene comes as close as possible about how it really was the rest of the film is also very catching and very real,reality
i own this movie on dvd and it still remains very solid amongst my large collection  spielberg is truly a master director  finally someone has accurately portrayed what it was like in battle  from the ultrarealistic depiction of gore and violence to the drama of the dying medic get to that laterand most importantly portraying the wounded in battle  i also like the way spielberg kind of exposed or degraded the film to kind of give it an old gritty look to it very nice effect  is honestly in my opinion speilberg at his directing best  however there are a few gripes first off i have yet to see a war movie which combined all of the needed elements to make it the best war movie ever  full metal jacket is close but no cigar  anyway one of the most important of these elements would be character development in which case had none the whole story behind was to figure out who the old man was  and what little character development they did have turned out to be fruitless and not very interesting  another element missed was emotion true the soldiers frightened faces and yells of mass hysteria was great and all but i thought if this movie would some how have implemented a narration of some kind then maybe i would care for the main characters a bit more third element missing was the plot  what can you do in 3 hours when the whole plot revolves around going out to find someone  walk a little talk a little fight walk a little talk a little fight die fight walk  it seemed kind of muddled and boring  and another gripe which isnt really a big deal is how the medic died  what the hell is he doing charging at a machine gun nest  since medics arent allowed to carry weapons i was just pondering why they would have him run along with them  i mean whats he going to do when he gets to the enemy heal them to death  or maybe just maybe if he was in syringe range he could take an enemy out with a critical stab ahhh die germans die anyway with all gripes aside i still loved this movie  thanks to spielberg that is  i enjoyed it in the theaters and i enjoyed it at home the war scenes are unmatched music is great and overall it was well done kudos  out of ,reality
what can you say about this movie i know one thing i can say is steven spielberg is a genius this movie tells outstanding story it is the story of 8 soldiers and their quest to save one man mr spielberg did an amazing job of telling this story the characters are very welldeveloped the scene where the mother receives the telegram telling of her sons deaths is one of the most beautiful scenes i have ever beheld i could go on forever about the cast the scenery the realism and the action however i will just tell you if you havent seen this movie you have to see it one thing i would like to ask is why for petes sake did anyone ever give this movie a rating of 1 instead of 10 they must be the type of people who dont have any beauty in their life i give this movie all four stars i rate it 10 its great its beautiful etc,reality
to compare this movie to other war movies is just wrong  most war movies have no true emotion as far as what is would be like to be there  the realism of this film can have so much impact on your life if you just let it and understand the real sacrifice that solders have made  solders who are real people and not just names on a wall or in a book or on a death certificate this movie was not made for your entertainment it was made for the vets of wwii and american vets at that  i dont believe that there is any possible way to know the impact a war can have on your life when serving in combat without experiencing it first hand  is the closest thing possible to that  i have more respect and admiration for those who have fought for their country now that i have seen this film this is by far the best film ever made,reality
i loved this movie just watched it on dvd and even though it wasnt in the big theatre it was still great does anybody know what the conversation was between the german soldier and cpl upham right before he shot him and what did tom hanks character say in the ear of edward burns character right before he died ive played these scenes several times and cant figure it out,reality
the movie starts and ends with a sunbleached american flag whipping in the wind between these images we see several intense and very believable battle sequences we get a good glimpse into the nightmares of every modern war veteran but this movie isnt all just battle scenes gore and death it has characters we can associate with the normal guys who find themselves in extraordinary situations  not action heroes or superstars who fit right in to battle scenes their fear expressed in highspeed stuttered camera techniques everything comes into sharp focus we watch one mans capn miller descent into insanity we watch eight men fight for a simple idea of military etiquette we watch hate grow in both our heroes and the germans we watch poetic injustice this movie questions the cost of war the cost of human lives and ideas and it recalls a memory that in a couple of decades will be lost forever in the graves of ancient men this is not just another war flick  its deep meaningful intellectual and real and as a film student id be ashamed should this impressive and powerful film not receive both popular and awards recognition,reality
steven spielbergs world war two war epic is a realistic and bloody portrait of armed conflictpicture opens on omaha beach where the first gis hit on june 6 1944it moves from there to a squad whose ordered to find a private whose three brothers have been killed combatthe film packs a heavy emotional punch and proves once again the master that spielberg is  ,reality
steven speilberg has done it again with his quest to tell the stories of ww2 time  in this epic film set in europe a squad of soldiers lead by capt miller tom hanks land on omaha beach barely survive that and they must find private to send him home to his mother  great photography with an excellent opening war 25 minute war scene  hanks burns and damon all give good performances  but with speilbergs direction who could expect anything less than perfection  won the oscars for director editing cinematography sound and sound editting out of ,reality
staring tom hanks is a masterpiece of a wwii movie i recommend viewing this movie if you have a strong stomach  features gruesome war related violence strong profanity  tom hanks performs a realistic act of a wwii commander  overall it was a great movie i gave it a 1010,reality
is a blockbuster masterpiece it features an allstar cast such as tom hanks tom sizemore edward burns barry pepper vin diesel giovanni ribisi and matt damon  this movie contains desterbing war violence and profanity  this movie is good for anyone with a stong stomache  and of couse if you are a tom hanks fan  was a great movie all the way through  it had a strong plot and i gave it a 1010,reality
i saw this with my dad and as we left after the credits everybody was still there and it was silent it is hard to describe this movie because it was so visual you really have to see it to get the full impact so i am describing this for lack of better words it was just like being in war and it just shows how bad it really is it really opened my eyes to war i think that the last lines of the movie will go down in history in that theater if you werent crying yet that line would put you over the edge i made one of my friends cry just telling them that line this movie is good for all the kids of my generation who think all this viloence is funny and cool no i am not saying that all kids think that but a lot do so do not be offended by this statement this was the best movie i have ever seen in a long time,reality
starts out with a very graphic difficult and fascinating scene of american soldiers storming the beaches on dday  the scene is tragic and merciless but probably almost exactly what is was like for the real soldiers in wwii  tom hanks plays a captain john h miller one of the first soldiers on the beach and a leader of the attack on the germans at the fortified beachheads  three days after that first landing on the beaches of normandy capt miller is given a new assignment  he is to take a special task force of eight men through occupied wartorn northern france to try and find one wayward paratrooper named james francis  the reason for this seemingly absurd mission to find one man a simple private is because his mother back in iowa has already lost three sons and the army wants to do the decent thing and let the last brother james have a free ticket home to be with his mother  the movie is long graphic and painful to watch at times but it has absolutely excellent acting writing camerawork directing and cinematography  this is definitely one of the greatest war films ive ever seen,reality
is steven spielbergs masterpiece and the best war film ever made with paths of glory platoon gloryand apocalypse now not far behind the opening 20 minute dday sequence is the most realistic piece of combat action ever put on film after watching it you feel so bad for the men who had to suffer through all that that really shows you that combat is hell on earth tom hanks should have gotten an oscar for heroic performance and all of the supporting actors should have gotten oscars too this film should have gotten the best picture of 1998 oscar instead of shakespear in love is far more moving and has a better storyline this film can also get very emotional especially toward the end absolutely brilliant war picture 1010,reality
i think this movie got it all dramaactionhumour and the best actorsyou got tom hanks one of the best actors ever and matt damon who also will be one of the greatest actors everall those other actors are great too especially barry pepper he is also a great actor i hope he will make more movies i also liked him with tom hanks in the green mile also a great moviebut i think this is the most realistic world war 2 moviei still dont get it that this movie did not win the oscar for best movie i dont get it its a spielberg classic and it will be one of the best movies ever made and for me its the best movie ever made,reality
the greatest portrait of any war on film ever spielberg really is the ultimate teller of stories through film at this moment in time its the whole package that stands out not just one item on its own whenever a new spielberg film is released people flock to watch many without even checking the contents due to his fantastic track record and i have to admit im one of those people but this film has scenes that take your breath away there so good for me this is a film i can watch over and over again and i will,reality
spielbergs rightfully lauded wwii masterpiece gives war several faces both ugly and beautiful  a wonderful cast led by hanks in a careerbest performance not an easy claim to make gorgeous cinematography and a hauntingly realistic script make for a shattering experience to be appreciated studied and educated with  the opening sequence has rightfully already become a classic  unnecessary bookends are a minor flaw in this major accomplishment,reality
i was impressed with both of spielbergs second world war movies  schindler s list and  they created a level of realism that evoked  an emotional level very much like grief that one experiences through family loss  spielbergs  development of the character captain miller was effective in symbolizing the general level of support for the warteacher turned warrior  similarly oskar schindler represented  higher values in a chaotic setting spielberg is such a force that one would have to go back to dw griffith to find a director who was the star of the picture as a baby boomer who grew up on war entertainment i can tell you that most war movies did little more that heighten my hormonal levels  both schindlers and pvt made me cryheaving types of release that one would assume would be reserved for family losses  now that is empathy by the viewer i was impressed by the way that spielberg recreated battle scenes rather than inventing them  i am sure that the veterans had a sense of flashback whereas the uninitiated were merely horrified spielberg gave the viewer the opportunity to identify with the struggles and sacrifices of veterans an opportunity to attempt to understand the trauma suffered by all combat veterans,reality
just this last weekend i watched this movie with my daughter and soninlaw  he had told me i really needed to watch it he thought i would like it   wow what a cast tom hanks was just great and so were all the others   it really made me stop and think of all the hell our soldiers must have went through and just how many families suffered these kind of losses  i barely spoke a word after the movie was over  it was one of the best movies i have ever seen  really makes you appreciate the brave men who fought for this country,reality
i think is a very good movie i know it was a very violent movie but thats what made it a good movie it was also very sad and it had excellent acting i think should have won the oscar instead of shakespeare in love,reality
my oh my spielberg just cant stop from making teardrop dramas if its about extra terrestrial fungus or about the holocaust or world war 2 he just cant resist throwing in that teardrop pathetic stuffthis movie would have been the worlds best war drama if it was not for that partbut i must say that the d day landings are unmatched in the history of film making,reality
from very impressive opening scene and through entire movie  spielberg forces only one message  war is dreadful beast which consume everybody and everything it lay hands on taking the beach on dday in this movie is one of the most bloodiest scenes ever recorded on motion pictures shocking scenes of destruction and killings are very strong and horrible for example scene where nazi kills a american soldier with a knife in a house where nazi talks to him on german and american shoutsstop stop wait wait listen to me listen to me is very lifelike and its not classical hollywood scene or sniper or tanks oreverything the idea of film is very noble  i dont know is this action ever take a place but fact that many brothers fathers childrendied in that monstrous event before 60 years is scaryover 50 million people have been killedyou really have to earn something in your life as did then you understand the importance of life itself,reality
take the hype tom hanks and the first 20 minutes of this film away and you have a very routine war film with all the usual cliches gungho american gi superhero gunk alllookslost ending and loads of flag wavingin fact even with hanks the film stinks there are far better war movies around the underrated thin red line cross of iron the full subtitled version of das boot the boat and perhaps best of all sam fullers the big red onebut of course they didnt get the kind of success they so richly deserved because there was no spielberghanks collaboration to get the hypemobile movingwith the exception of the truly outstanding 20 minutes where no other film apart from truelife documentaries has ever come close to the realities of war spr sucks through a long thin strawit sometimes amazes me how speilberg can hit all the right notes jaws close encounters schindlers list with lots of decent action  rounded believable characters we feel for and then comes out with dross like spr  lost worldfor those that live outside the states this film will probably leave you cold  especially if youre one of those allied countries that also served in france during ww2 but didnt even get a sniff in sprthe only decent acting came from tom sizemore as sergeant horvath but even he isnt allowed to develop his character before his off on another mission shooting at people and banging on that war is hell etcif you want heroes if you want emotion if you want drama if you want a true depiction of how bad ww2 really was go and buy schindlers list,reality
the opening and closing sequences of this movie are the most realistic scenes about combat that i have ever seen they convey the disorientation shock crippling fear and chaos far better than anything else on film steven spielberg is the most gifted director in the business tom hanks deserved another best actor award for his powerful performance of the battle weary captain from the hand tremor to the thousand mile stare this is a must see movie,reality
i can remember the hype on television tom hanks on oprah ed burns and matt damon on the view i thought nothing of it at the time i thought it was just another big movie by steven spielberg then one day in late summer i decided to go see this film i walked out of the theater that day a humbled 16 year old boy crying like a child what was that i had just seen did those things really happen whyis the single greatest movie i have ever seen a lot of people recommend movies that make you think about something whether it be a cause an emotion or a question makes you think it makes you think of the price of our freedom this movie and this movie alone shows the horrors that our fathers and grandfathers had to face this movie has sparked several conversations with my grandfather about what he went through during the years of 19391945 and boy would his stories make a good moviei just can not describe the emotional impact this film has had on me and the ones close to me it was made with such precision and care it is undescribable the story is moving the acting is absolutely flawless the realism is beyond comparison to any other war film and the time spent on historical accuracy must have lasted for years just watch the omaha beach sequence and you will see what i mean about historical accuracy john williams musical score is amazing and heart felt as is mr spielbergs directionin closing is a masterpiece a masterpiece that should be shown in every history class across this great nation called america,reality
i cant express how much i love this movie everything about this movie is good the acting the action the plot everything the part of this movie that i love the most is the drama this movie is so powerful i swear every time i watch it it gets better and better this movie should have won best picture i recommend it with great honor 10 out of 10 stars,reality
with the possible exception of glory and platoon and neither of those was about wwii is the most spectacular and as far as i can tell accurate portrayal of a major world war except for maybe one point war is worse and heres the difference i have with most reviewers and even spielberg himself i believe that every child of about 15 in age should see this movie if only for an understanding of the absolute horror of killing other human beings and fish by the thousands in the name of democracy or some other damn thing i confess that i never really understood such issues as the taking of omaha beach on dday at least not beyond the reflection of poets and storytellers and those men took that beach i never realized quite how terrible the ground war was as an air force cadet i studied the aspects of the worlds first air war which in and of itself was bad enougha friend of mine was telling me what he thought of the movie today and he said it was enjoyable well thats not quite how i would describe the experience excruciatingly emotional is more what i was feeling yup i cried and one line at the very end between a man and his wife strikes me even now two days later eric knows what im talking about im sure ive been crying a lot at movies recently which is odd titanic i cried at but sort of enjoyed having that little damn burst before that braveheart got me every time even deep impact got the tears flowing a bit but those were all a little fun in the release as i was walking out of in a theater that was although sold out absolutely dead silent as people exited most looking at the floor i felt not a cleansing but a slightly gnawing guilt ill see it again mostly so i can pay more attention to the technical aspects of the film if i can and try to determine how i might someday make a film half as good as the one steven spielbergs genius has wrought this time his best possibly but its hard to differentiate five or six five stars out of five movies if youre looking for another less gory but still brutal look at wwii from spielberg check out empire of the sun a movie that was far better than its box office take and one of the first people movies that makes me cry,reality
its hard after viewing not to feel numb from the experience its not a pretty movie from the opening battle shots your senses are assaulted by the violence  terror that men facing death must feel has raised the standard in presenting war films in a factual nonpropaganda style watch this movie  feel for all those who have given their lives defending what they believe as right you just might realise how lucky we are,reality
is steven spielbergs second worldwar2themed filmthe first was the excellent schindlers list we follow some american soldiers who are fighting against hitlers wehrmacht in normandie  the opening scene is spectacular and extremely violent but then that was how the allies managed to get over the english channel and over to france the movie is very good it has both realistic warscenes and great dramaalthough the thin red line focuses more on drama all in all i can honestly say that spielberg has gone and delivered the goods again and what we have here is yet another important movie  i prefer this over the thin red line even if it doesnt have the excellent soundtrack of the thin red line 910,reality
is the best war film ive seen my favorite war film was the memphis belle until came alongthis film captures the real horrors atmosphere and emotion of ww2 a lot of scenes in are really emotional tom hanks plays the part of captain john miller who leads his team of soldiers deep into enemy lines to save private because both of his brothers have been killed and he needs to be saved since hes the only brother leftthe start of the film is amazing but very bloody it shows what those brave young soldiers had to go through in ww2amazing brilliant and breath taking just some of the words i can describe with1010,reality
i cant get the image out of my head of the landing on the beach  i have always known that this was a tremendously bloody battle but this scene really brings it home  the fact that anyone would willingly go onto the beach is amazing and demonstrates the level of committment that these young men must have had  this is courage with a meaning not foolish macho courage as it is so often depicted  throughout the movie i found myself in awe of the way spielberg presented these men as real people with emotions fears and flaws who were trying there best to serve their country and keep their sanity in such an awful and trying situation  its so seldom that one gets the chance to see true character development that is subtle and adds to the movie rather than simply being written in as an afterthought  forget titanic this should have been recognized as the best movie ever made  everything about this movie is great and a great misservice was done for the academy to not recognize it not only for its technical excellence but for its purpose in trying to realistically portray the horror and courage of war  kudos to spielberg and everyone else involved in this movie,reality
the movie deeply touched me  i have seen it three times and each time powerful feelings were evoked i encourage everyone to see the movie not for entertainment purposes but out of respect for the servicemen who gave their lives at only 23 years old i have found a new appreciation for what those sevicemen did and what they stood for i have visited the dday museum in normandy and the american cemetary  ironically i have never been to a more peaceful place than omaha beach walking through the bombed out bunkers i felt a presence of what it was like to be there on that day in june i hope that others especially people not old enough to have lived through a war can begin to appreciate what the american military stands for and what they protect the freedom that they continue to defend is something that should never be taken for granted i would like to thank mr speilberg for and for schindlers list another emotionally touching film about the 1940s massacre,reality
as i left the cinema after watching this film  my first thoughts were it wasnt as good as the cruel sea and i have to say this film loses out in every aspect against the old black and white classic jack hawkins acts tom hanks off the screen even though he had just had his larynx removed because of throat cancer the script is excellent and well written and fully highlights the inhumanity of war that fails miserably to do all in all if you want a good thought provoking war film watch the cruel sea,reality
i believe that steven spielberg has three objectives here 1 to prove that war is really hell 2 to shine a spotlight on the veterans who gave and risked their lives defending our country at a time when patriotism meant something and 3 to tell a poignant story  he succeeds in all 3 but only the third is what really interests me when seeing a movie  the other objectives lead to overdoing the gory aspects of things and some uncharacteristically poor editing and confusing use of slowmotion  in fact much of the camerawork here seems to be uncharacteristically selfconscious for spielberg  that being said this still merits viewing   it is quite memorable,reality
the story is too unbelievable i was not able to put that thought away during the whole film but when it would be a realistic  brutal warstory the masses would not like itthe story is maybe too superficial but i liked this is a very nice and professional movie  fun to watcha must see oh yeah  forgot to mention  everyone outside america skip the last ten seconds you will see some stupid flag i didnt understand that part,reality
this movie has got to be one of the all time great war films the realism and the newsreel style provided a powerful cold sweat effect the only thing missing was the sea spray and the smells of war i am sure that will be next,reality
all im going to say is that if you havent seen this movie before i recommend that you do  if you can handle graphic scenes of blood and gore and hundreds of people getting shot up you are ready for this if you are sensitive to blood and dont like the realisticness of this kind of war movie dont see it because this movie shows it almost exactly how it was in wwii,reality
this movie cant even be considered a movie  its too real for that  this movie puts you right in the middle of the most horrifying war of our time  every emotion a man can express from fear to grief to grittiness to whatever is shown in this movie  one guideline everyone should follow before seeing this movie  if you cant handle gore show up a 12 hour late to the movie  it opens up on d  day   wwii wasnt all happiness and brotherhood among men  there was a war going on as well  tom hanks easily earned his third oscar with his role as the captain of a unit on a mission to find priv james  speilberg easily gets an oscar as well,reality
spr is a wonderful movie filled with the history of wwii it touches your heart in more ways than one can even start describing this movie makes you stop and think despite the language and the reality of this movie i would let any child see it over the age of 10 it meant a lot to me when i first saw it i was 12 when i first saw it the day i saw it i watched it over 4 times it touched my heart in so many ways i have the movie the soundtrack and i am happily reading the book now this movie is a 4 stars must see ps i love you barry  private jackson ,reality
while i am not usually a big fan of war movies and while this qualifies in many ways this is not your ordinary war movie  the amount of violence is not gratuitous and provides an avenue to get closer to the characters and the situation  its been awhile since ive actually seen it but i do remember giving my first 1010 for this masterpiece  if you can stand the blood and gore you will enjoy this movie,reality
there will never be another war like wwii and though hollywood has done everything in its power to glamorize fullscale combat is an important reminder that war is not glamorous noble nor pleasant in any way in steven spielberg delivers some of the most terrifying battle scenes ever committed to film and in the process uncovers the lingering bits of humanity found in the hearts of all men even soldiers in the midst of an all out invasion most of the action intakes place on the battle field the brutality of war is a story of mutilation soldiers bodies are torn in half exploded gutted sliced stabbed dismembered and generally desecrated in every way imaginable and for their trouble the lucky ones receive a quickanddirty burial in a mass shallow grave its this reality that spielberg embraces never giving the viewer anything less than a closeup and graphic look at the carnage but unlike slasher or hong kong action movies was not made to impress the viewer with its creative violence the graphic violence is meant to scare the living hell out of the audience and give some kind of explanation for the surviving characters state of mind with war comes suffering for all not just the soldiers technical mastery despite the horrors of war depicted in the movie even the most squeamish of viewers will find it difficult if not impossible to tear their eyes away from the screen during the disturbingly intense battle scenes from the handheld camera work complete with occasional dropped frames for that classic wwii stock footage look to the devastating visual effects of bombs exploding bodies being torn to hell and most of all bullets flying everywhere is a thing of absolute wonder and yet the visual effects pale in comparison to the sound effects which are thick and powerful and do more to bring the audience into the world of the movie than anything actually on the screen the opening scene beach invasion is the most intense battle of the entire movie what about beyond the amazing effects sets and spoton performances from sizemore burns davies and pepper fails to deliver the knockout punch in some aspects of the story yes private is the last remaining brother of the family and of course it will be difficult to find one foot soldier in the middle of a war but thats about all you get tom hanks as solid as his performance is never quite takes his character where it wants to go and matt damons character proves practically meaningless making it difficult to justify the loss suffered trying to save himso does it work will leave your nerves absolutely frazzled and give you plenty to think about on the subject of humanity and though there are a few disappointments along the way the negatives are few and the strengths are many and impressive,reality
my god the first 30 minutes are indescribable there are so many horrible details that come back to haunt your mind later the shouts the blood hits you right between the eyes or in the heart burns scars into your memoryafter this who can watch starspangled movies like the longest day or the guns of navarone without laughing at those pathetic attempts to describe war,reality
when i think of dday a picture comes to mind in life magazine robert capa the famous war photographer had a picture he took at dday he landed with the men at normandy on june 6 1944 and was nearly killed the water was very cold and the beach still more than 100 yards away the bullets tore holes in the water around me and i made for the nearest steal obstacleit was still very early and very gray for good pictures but the gray water and gray sky made the little men dodging under the surrealistic designs of hitlers antiinvasion braintrust very effective he said later of the day the photograph is very grainy you can see the steal barricades and a soldier blurry in the foreground gritting his teeth swimming towards his destiny clearly capa was afraid while taking the picture speilberg has filled in capas grainy blurry photo for me i can see speilbergs  capt miller scared crawling towards his destiny the destiny of many i always thought that these men were brave but it seems more real knowing the specific horrors the endured it is no longer a blurred and grainy life magazine photo,reality
i would just like to comment on the movie by saying it really kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time because it was so real compared to the real war and the camera shots made it look so real the tactics and actors they used and explosions and so forth just made the whole thing come alive and make you ask your selfwhat if i was in the warit wasnt too long agomichele,reality
no question the special effects in this movie especailly the first 30 minutes was great but i dont consider a movie great if special effects are all it has this movie was not very good other than special effects it was just like all the other war movies i have seen but i guess when youre steven spielberg you can throw up in the camera and the resulting film people will flock to see,reality
with out a question this movie is the best of all time it has touched and affected so many people that have seen it emotions run rampant tears fall people are in suspence any movie that can make old wwii veterans leave the theatre because of its realism has got to be number one it was brilliantly directed brilliantly written and the acting was superb spr is the best of the best better than the godfather better than the list better than any motion picture of our time this movie is simply surreal go see it if you havent buy it if you have with out a doubt it proves that spielberg is one of the greatest directors of all time,reality
steven spielberg is back in business again it has been five years at the release with schindlers list 1993 but now he strikes back better than darth vaders empire who fell in jedi anyhow might not be anything out of the ordinary the first scene is of course an exception but it appeals to me in a strange way the opening dday scene is a classic piece of arttom hanks of course mrgoodguy is an officer leading tom sizemore edward burns among others to find a private matt damon which three brothers has been killed however you can trust the thin red line that is the plot of the mission is something to discuss but it doesnt make the movie any worsethe realism is shocking and the warscenes are just as intense as exciting great acting and the result is simply very memorable,reality
i heard that someone says that all other war movies are representations of war and spr is war i completely agree you can see how the difference between heroes and soldiers is so thin that not all the friends are good and not all the enemies are bad that the war is a terrible common mind state that makes ourselves animals that there will be no peace till there is only 1 war in the world respect to steven the master,reality
as we all know the opening 30 minutes will go down in cinema history along side the odessa steps scene in eisensteins potemkin 1925  russia as pure classic the rest of the film is a journey taken through the madness of war by captain miller tom hanks and his men the production values are of the highest order achieving realism and emotional impact i admit to be in fits of shakes during the opening and then crying on my way home but do we have to see what we already know and that is war is barbaric in death and destructive to those who survive it maybe yes because you value life just that little bit more after seeing this only complaint the ending battle im not quiet sure if that was a sign of patriotism or stupidity but it almost had the flavour of the dirty dozen kicking nazi butt but not quiet so by this stage it was enough war carnage,reality
one person said characters were static i thought given the scope of the film that the characters were developed very subtly  for example the scene in which the medic was rewriting the bloody letter home written by the first man killed while confessing a wish that he had not pretended to be sleeping so his mom wouldnt chat it up with him very real the camera work was intended to make you feel first person intensity which it did try running with 40 pounds strapped to your back with a helmet bobbing around on your head while trying to find some cover the camera caught exactly what you would see it took some visual adjustment  but was part and parcel to what made this movie effective im not trying to find flaws i agree that we should  should  not needa reminder that war is hell or that if we do need it there is something wrong with us i think that we do need it we do seem to forget what it meant that these soldiers took a bullet to gain a beach there isnt anything wrong with us we just get complacent we should remind ourselves any time we are about to romanticize war we need to do it memorial day and veterans day do not just mean long weekends they stand for something and we need to say thank you not only to the people who sacrificed their lives but to those who survived as well and helped to do some part to put an end to it we should do that by taking up the most difficult burden ever laid on a human being  the one put   in the end make it all count for something how could anyone live up to that the message of this movie do your best to do exactly that with your own life make it count,reality
really showed the horrible facts of war no real heroes here just the plain fact that war is a very ugly fact of life that history has repeated so many times before the terrible reality that there is no glory in war only sorrow and pain the good guys like so many previous movies have not shown have about the same chance as others to come through alive or not there is no such thing as luck but just the brutal reality and grim truth things humans must endure this is a great film shown in such details never before seen i recommend this film to everyone cant say i enjoyed this film the special effects were all too real and painful,reality
i was deeply moved after seeing  it is simply the best war movie ever made  and to the european critics it was not meant to be an allencompassing work about the allied effort in normandy during world war ii see the longest day for that  it is an american story about american sacrifice made by a master of american film  its purpose is clear to help remind and educate our country about the sacrifices made by the greatest generation and this education is long overdue  if spielberg had to wave a flag and tug at emotions to do this so be itbeyond mere words this film has spurred people to action  many americans now seek out world war ii veterans to give them the respect they deserve and to hear their stories before they are gone  for me it was a catalyst my father landed on omaha beach on dday and it was with great pride that i took him back there last year for the 55th anniversary of the event  he was able to meet and discuss his experiences with many american canadian and british veteransin a particularly personal and memorable moment and reminiscent of the opening and closing sequences of the film my father and i visited his buddys grave at the american cemetery in colleville sur mer  his friend was killed in action on omaha beach on dday  memories of the friendship shared and lost overwhelmed him and brought the visit into perspective yes there is honor and glory in war but also incredible waste  may it never happen again,reality
this is one of the most powerful and emotionally moving movies i have ever seen it is a true modern work of art  the story is a extraordinary with many well defined characters brought together by the incredible acting  the story shows us the american side of the war and our feeling towards the germans but it also shows the cruelty we showed towards them too  steven spielberg does an absolutely wonderful job in capturing the horror of war a prime example of this would be the dday landing sequence and the final battle  as i said before the acting is fantastic especially tom hanks performance as a captain miller  the music has that grand powerful feel to it which is what you come to expect from john williams  do yourself a favor and watch this classic,reality
i just saw this movie again on hbo this weekend  what a triumph  the cinematography plot characters  well actually the lack of character depth was probably the only downside to the movie like most spielberg films the fact that the academy thought this wasnt as deserving for best picture over shakespeare in love shows what dolts run the academy  50 years from now no one will remember it  however people will see wwii come to life in spielbergs epic film,reality
steven spielberg is back in buissnes again it has been five years at the release with schindlers list 1993 but now he strikes back better than darth vaders empire who fell in jedi anyhow might not be anything out of the ordenary the first scene is of course an exception but it appeals to me in a strange way the opening dday scene is a classic piece of arttom hanks of course mrgoodguy is an officer leading tom sizemore edward burns among others to find a private matt damon wich three brothers has been killed however you can trust the thin red line that is the plot of the mission is something to discuss but it doesnt make the movie any worsethe realism is shocking and the warscenes are just as intense as exciting great acting and the result is simply very memorable,reality
this film is truely a masterpiece  no film in history has made war so real hanks gives his best performance to date  he is the man of the movie  the film seems real at times  the actors are first rate  10 out of 10,reality
certainly spr is powerful mindnumbing stuff but so are most decent war movies if you spend three hours in the cinema maybe it was just that the beginning was so hyped that it didnt quite have the impact i was expecting although a few fantastic moments did stand out the lucky guy whos helmet gets scratched by a bullet for example the problem is that for a movie which is so brutally honest in its depiction of the horrors of battle the film is lazy to the point of dishonesty in so many other areas and insodoing it undermines its credentials as an antiwar filmto start with a point made in a number of other reviews the germans are utterly unsympathetic the one german we feel sorry for turns out to be a real baddie eager to kill the heroic americans as soon as he gets the chance the result is a movie whose values are completely the wrong way round  the war was rightful insofar as it attempted to check an aggresive and horrifically inhumane regime it wasnt justified of itself by american patriotism rather patriotism provided a powerful rallying point yet the stars and stripes are far more redolent of america than of liberty itself in spite of the perceived american monopoly on freedom  by making the americans heroic and the germans either faceless or treacherous by excluding the involvement of canadian british and british imperial troops and by the emphasis on the worshipful flag spielberg turned the second world war into a matter of americans vs germans american patriotism vs german nationalism rather than right vs wrong it was the noblest of sacrifices for these men to die in a country that was halfway round the world from their homes many probably most fought for their country rather than for france or poland or for any ideal of liberty but if you argue that patriotism actually justified the war then youre back to dulce et decorum est spr certainly doesnt make war dulce but it comes pretty close to making patriotism decorum when this is precisely what many of the vilified germans were fighting forthere are other problems with the film with its story and characterisation most however are covered in other reviews one thing though the film was much praised because all of the major protagonists are terrified by war yet the same old cliche remains  the weak link in the team who is too scared to fight but ends up finding his courage admittedly after one of the most brilliant scenes in any war movie where the knife fight is happening while the cowardly soldier waits on the stair its just a bit disappointing so many things in spr are brilliant and uncompromising like the knife fight people blowing themselves up with their own mines etc that all the copouts and compromises are additionally galling a pity,reality
this film when it is good its very very good but when its bad its horrid the sentimental scenes the graveyard bookends the church scene the generals office are so cloying in their emotion that they come across as crass the battle scenes are incredible in their realism and the photography looks amazing in its documentary feel tom hanks gives an outstanding performance again the storyline as mentioned before seems unlikely and is poorly implemented the whole film feels a tad too long unlike schindlers list which whizzes by,reality
if there ever was a movie that could be described as a tour de force would be it  from the muchtalkedabout opening to the concluding battle spielberg has combined involving human drama with masterful technical expertise ranging from bravura camera work to jolting editing to stunning effect and confirms spielbergs status as the leading director of recent years  while the relatively plotless but never less than compelling middle section has attracted criticism in terms of sheer visceral authenticity and dramatic impact is absolutely peerless  tom hanks gives possibly his finest performance yet and the rest of the cast despite essentially playing a selection of stereotypes do admirably welladmittedly the battle sequences are quite bloody and it is not quite as great as the shatteringly unforgettable schindlers list but is none the less a towering achievement and essential viewing1010,reality
without doubt the opening scenes bring home some of the reality of just what it might have been like to be on the front line in a major assault during the second world warseveral individual scenes during the film are also equally well played and directed  all of which makes the john wayne style gungho final reel a bit of a let down and the film as a whole rather less of the inspirational epic that id expectedin a nutshell if you were hoping for an up to date equivalent of all quite on the western front forget it its a good action film but in truth really is no more intellectually stimulating than first blood,reality
i did not see this movie in the theater which i am very sad that i was never able to because this is one moving film  my friend recommended it to me and i went out and rented the film  i was so moved by the film that i watched it twice in one  day this is just one great movie  i cannot find the words to say how touching moving and sad this movie is10 stars,reality
ive heard many people say that vietnam was the most horrific and vicious war of this century i always said yes it was bad but no worse than any other war i think that this film proves my point better than any book or essayive always been fascinated by world war ii and have enjoyed many of steven spielbergs wwiiera films as a result after seeing this one i see every other wwii movie before it as almost an insult to the reality of war but i dont think a true account of what it was like on normandy beach would be possible before nowunlike other war movies this one shows a larger picture as seen from the perspective of individual soldiers the characters in are certainly the emphasis of the story but spielberg does not shy away from showing us the countless others they meet along the way all of the characters in the movie are believable not exaggerated as in many other war moviesanyone who enjoys the battle scenes is so completely desensitized to violence that even this movie wont be able to resensitize you anyone who says the movies story is weak or that spielbergs direction is a problem has either not seen the movie at all or made their minds up before they saw it to fully appreciate one must put themselves in the soldiers shoes which in this case is made excruciatingly easythis films only weak point is far stronger than most american wwii movies the germans perspective is represented here but could still be better stated i suggest das boot as a movie which shows what the enemy really thought about the war,reality
after seeing the movie on video i thought to my self why not see what my fellow humans think and of course i logged on to this database and read the comments on the film and i must say that i am somewhat agreeing however a lot of people think that the start and end scenes of the cemetery is dull i really disagree those scenes are crucial to the lesson of the film reading the book makes you realize that the directing is sublime this film is as stated in other comments not a true story but ive heard wwii veterans claim that the only thing missing in the film is the smell being the greatest wwii movie ever i think that both spielberg  hanks deserves a round of applause for their great work,reality
powerful movie intense combat scenes do not detract from an excellent story  accurately depicts many facets of combat duty from the uniqueness of each individual to the single mindedness represented by the squads mission  portrays the captains duty to achieve the success of the mission while attempting to ensure the welfare of the troops he commands,reality
i have always been a big fan of war moviesand i was looking forward to this one more than others i had seen before it being a speilberg was going to be as special as the kubrick full metal jacket wasthe starting twenty minutes had everyone shocked and i can guarantee that for i saw it at the premiere and you could see that in everyones facesthe way speilberg uses the camera the actors the music scores all come together in this movie tom hanks is in a class of his own as far as this movie is concerned my favourite character in the movie was the sniperif i ever became a soldier thats who id bewell behind all the bloodshed death victory and joy there is a message for us allwar is never worth itit doesnt matter on which side you end up,reality
first of alli really liked it i am sure you have heard quite a bit about this movie already and i need not reiterate that but i will share a few thoughts the battle scenes were extremely realistic and quite elaborate in detail while there are many warnings about how graphic this picture is it almost seems that there should be no age restriction on the movie so that everyone of all ages can see the horrid side of war the story line is a good one though not true it does remind you of the true story of the sullivan brothers five brothers who were killed while serving on the same navy ship in wwii i feel the movie could have been a bit more emotional or played to the audiences emotions better instead it was oriented more toward the details of war and less to the personalities of the persons portrayed serving in that war bottom lineit was a great movie and definitely worth seeing,reality
the best movie i have ever seen  this movie showed in graphic detail and fast motion that war is hell  it did not show war as glamorous as other movies have done  it revealed how anyone fighting in a war is susceptible to death at any given time no matter what side youre on or how careful you try to be  it was also a story of unselfish sacrifice whether for god country or duty,reality
this movie was riveting its gotta be oscarbound i want to see it again i cant begin to describe what you feel when you are in that theaterwhen the movie is over and you are just kind of sitting thereits like you are in aweyou know that stuff like this actually happenedthat this is the most true to life image of this war to date and you cant believe that it actually happened this way in such graphic detail throughout the movie you sit there and you watch the soldiers get killed one after another in many different ways and you want to look awaybut you dont because you know that this is a part of your historyyou have to watch because if you dont its like hiding from the truth this movie really shows us that war is hell the intricate camera angles and speilbergs genius in this film make you feel like you are in the crossfire and in the 28 or so minutes that you sit through the omaha beach invasion all you want is for it to be over already i felt like running out of the theater just to escape its brutality but i couldnt tear myself away you begin to get to know the soldiers and you feel their bond as they set out to find the only remaining brother out of four you accompany them on this journey into the depths of the war and at some points all you want to do is cry if you havent seen it ive done my best here to not ruin it for you so you can go see it yourself its well worth it and more,reality
i hope that this is the closest that i ever come to combat in my life thank god for the men that put their lives on the line to keep us and the world free hats off to spielberg for the realism of the combat that should be enough for all of us to make a promise to ourselves to personally thank as many vets as we can for serving to keep us free war is no walk in the park and this movie comes closest to capturing just how close to hell it really is this movie teaches a lot about sacrifice courage heroism and emotion sometimes there are causes greater than our own selves which are worth sacrificing for a great movie for this era too many men of that generation have passed away  this captures a little bit of what was special about that generation a must see for all kids as soon as they are capable of handling it,reality
i was really impressed by that 20minute introduction thats what cinema is made for it crashboombangs just from everywhere and you seem to be incapable moving from your seat great work 10 pointsso far but what comes next  as it is forbidden to use spoilers in this text i can just say what comes next is one of the most stupid stories in film history ever spielberg must have been of the opinion that the audience might be busy thinking about that impressive introduction until the movie is over and in this case the film doesnt need no such thing as a sensible storyline according to the imdbmembers rating of 86 making it the 12th best movie ever spielberg was obviously right and even if the story is missing there is enough patriotism in this film to make it successful in the us my rating 6 points and far away from the being one of the top 20 movies,reality
first off everything you may have heard about the opening normandy sequence is true this is quite simply the most amazing battle recreation footage youre ever likely to see definitely not for the squeamish it paints its horrifying portrait without ever allowing the viewer to glory in any kind of excitement which most battle simulations end up doing on some level even the wellmeaning ones spielberg uses every ounce of his talent and ingenuity to show combat the way it should be shown as pure hell a nightmare that it is impossible to waken fromas for the rest of the movie which follows this opening sequence   well im not sure the first time i saw it i was caught up from the beginning and the rest of the film seemed to hold me equally well but upon further viewings the flimsiness and basic illogic of the central plot become far more noticeable i dont know its a tossup there are still several compelling scenes here and tom hanks gives the performance of his career his dramatic career anyway  im one who still believes theres much to be said for toms earlier work in comedy but there just seems to be an overall falseness in the structure that undercuts some of the films power i wish a better framing story could have been foundbut by all means see this movie warts and all its the kind that only a truly great director could make  and the opening alone is worth the cost just dont expect a masterpiece think of it more as a flawed gem,reality
if you like this movie you like it because of the style  the battle scenes are amazing and some of the best ever put on film this movie could have been great had someone paid attention to the script there are so many problems with it apart from being quite an average plot i dont even know where to start  lets point out the obvious one  the movie is told from the matt damon characters point of view  and he wasnt even in most of the movie  theres no way he can know the story of how hanks found private because he wasnt there if you want to know why this movie lost the best picture oscar thats it the underlying structure of the script is so flawed it undermines everything spielberg did with the movie still this is a good movie  a very good movie even and it is certainly worth your while  im just sorry most people will rent it on video because it really benefits from a cinema experience,reality
is an amazing movie and has the greatest battle scenes ever filmed  i still havent figured out how this lost best picture one of spielbergs best,reality
weve heard reams of praise for private  were sure to see it win some major film awards in the coming months  lets be honest this film is well above average for a hollywood product spielberg is a bonafide talent and has proved that he can make serious engaging filmsstill as much as i liked i left the theater feeling strangely unfulfilled  the story of the dday invasion and dubiously honorable search for one soldier is very well told and pays homage to the finest and most brutally honest wwii films ever made  spielbergs smartest decision in this film was in using john williams score rather sparingly  the sight of soldiers jumping off the gunboats to their immediate deaths is horrific and we dont need music to remind us  the story plays itself out very naturally  not every gruesome event happens for a reason were reminded that war has no immediately discernible logic  even the recognizable stars arent spared the horrors of warhowever this film is bookmarked by an opening and closing sequence in the present day that while wellintentioned is more of a distraction than anything else the apparent message is that not a minute of your life should be taken for granted when others make great sacrifices for youwe study history so that we may appreciate our existence not so we can plug into mindless entertainment  when will hollywood realize this,reality
in my opinion is the best war film ever made it is my personal favorite movie and i will tell you why many people claim this movie is too graphic and violent but the fact is that it is based on dday an actual event taking place in world war 2 by seeing this movie you get the experience of what combat in war is like an experience you cant get from just reading a book many veterans and other people have stated that the battlefield scenes in this movie are 100 realistic and the only thing missing is the smell of the dead bodies i think spielberg has done a wonderful job of making a good story out of history with a great and original plot believable characters and realistic events i suggest you see this movie as soon as possible especially if you are into world war 2 movies like i am,reality
is the best movie i have ever seen  it is one of the few films ever made that actually attempts to depict war in its actual horrific form  all of the other war films feature soldiers dying sugarcoated deaths suddenly falling to the ground  this occurred maybe 1 of the time in reality  in truth soldiers were more likely to suffer greatly before their wounds took them  war is brutal and this film depicts it very accurately  it makes me think very much about what the soldiers in dday went through on june 6 1944 and in any other battle or war  they all helped to make the world a better place  my heart goes out to all who dare to change the world in such a wayit is important to remember that the carnage of war was not only abundant during world war ii but that this happened both before and after  from the american revolution to the civil war from world war i to world war ii from korea to vietnam and beyondeach time i see i think even more about the sacrifice a dedicated soldier will make for his country and how many soldiers are willing to do just thatif you are one of those soldiers who helped to change the world by risking your own ultimate sacrifice and are reading this thank youif you are one of the many people out there that does not care about sacrifice at all and saw this movie i have no idea what will make you care,reality
when i went to the theatre with some friends to see nothing had me prepared for what was about to come  the opening scene on the beach of normandy was so graphic and realistic it was truly a sensoryoverload experience  throughout the movie spielberg lets action to speak for itself instead of settling for hip dialogues that tries to sound smartso far this is the most wellmade and greatest war film ever made  forget what other people have said about other war movies  is the only film where i almost felt pain whenever i see bullets and explosions annihilate the soldiers  it has succeeded where other war movies have tried unsuccesfully to do to shock the nerve out of you and to make the audience fully realize the stark reality of wardoesnt lecture about war  instead the scenes will do it without words  my friends and i left the cinema feeling so shocked and affected and thats how i knew that this is the best war movie ever made we get the message alright because spielberg is a true film genius,reality
i am one of those baby boomers who arrived just after wwii and escaped vietnam  so this movie seems to me to portray the horrors of war in such a realistic way that it has changed my view of conflicts such as this forever  who cares whether it was accurate in terms of the weapons used or from a  historical persepective  the first 30 minutes show what war is really like and that for me was the power behind this movie  i am sure people will talk about this movie for ever,reality
this film ranks right up there with schindlers list the color purple and to a lesser extent amistad as spielbergs greatest endeavor from a dramatic standpoint is by far the best war movie ever made the film displays a sort of inyourface realismwhich is probably the next best thing to actually being there no bombastic music accompanying battle scenes here the only music youll get are from rifles and explosionsi imagine people will be talking about 50 years from now as being one of the great classicsrating 10nitpicks minor spoilers1 the opening sequence shows old reminiscing about the d day landing in normandy as if he was actually there but in reality was nowhere near normandy on d day therefore should the perspective had come from someone who was actually there2 after releasing a nazi pow to the protest of a few of his subordinates who wanted to seek revenge on for slaughtering one of their friends captain miller tom hanks gives a nice speech on how killing a man makes him feel further and further from home each time yet he doesnt take a seconds thought when clipping a few nazi goons in the final act i guess millers philosophy is he doesnt like killing people unless he has to,reality
i suspect that only a veteran who actually experienced the horrors shown in the film could attest to their authenticity however the scenes have the feel of reality as do the reactions of the soldier characters to their situations the peg of the story that the high brass would sacrifice other men to save one man for public relations reasons certainly rings true we are shown nothing to make war look attractive as the camera and special effects move from one aspect of bloody death to another without pause one may carp that spielberg takes a parochial view of the war in that no mention whatever is made of other allies fighting hitler it looks like solely a us war thats most likely just what it did look like to the grunts facing the krauts and the japs in 1944 he is also accused of taking a middle class view of the war ie officers were teachers or other professionals while other ranks were not well that is just about the way it actually was so far as officers were concerned but plenty of educated folks served in the ranks nobody in the film talks about the lofty ideals of the war again thats realism as a noncombat soldier in ww2 who served only stateside i cannot recall ever being involved in a discussion about saving the world for democracy there was a lot of talk about the viciousness of the enemy though both before and after the us involvement i expect the soldiers over there were not much different lofty ideals are mostly spouted in the speeches of politicians i doubt that anyone can view this film without being profoundly moved by the sheer monumental brutality depicted note that it is a recreation of brutality that actually happened it is not the fake horrors of your usual hollywood action flick,reality
a harrowing journey which is amazingly filmed edited and choreographed the story drags you into it even though youll be shocked at the pain and tragedy these soldiers went through and it makes you believe and feel for the characters like no other film ive seen in a long timehanks is wisely restrained and the supporting cast are very good i wonder if spielberg is the talent that brings the best acting rather than choosing the best actors aroundthe death scenes are unbelievably realistic and are undoubtedly very unnerving one scene remains in the mind long after youve seen it and its not the famous opening beach scenegreat realism which instills fear panic and confusion almost a brilliant work of art if not for the forgetfulness for the other nations concerned,reality
the best war film ever i say and its the truth i have never seen such realistic in a film beforetom hanks a great actor gives everything he got for this film and no to one of the most wonderful directors as he can make movies yes sirthis film is worth a big audience all over the world see this film recommended,reality
this is one of the greatest war movies of all time defentely speilberg at his best this movie is more graphic than stalingrad i thought it should have won all those oscars this movie is true to war the most realistic ive ever seen,reality
ive only recently seen the movie and i had to stop after the initial sequence and rewatch it twice before carrying on with the film the effect was amazing just to realise the sacrifice that was made by young men puts life in perspective to see the first landing craft hit the beach and not a single man surviving was just awesome spielberg is a genius you actually think you are there in the water with the blood and the bullets flying around watching it with surround sound does make a differenceafter seeing the film twice in a row i found some web sites with comments made by gis about what happened on that day they confirm what i felt about the filmshould have won the oscar ,reality
first i want to say that i was thoroughly shocked and impressed by this film i cant say i enjoyed it because as you know this wasnt the type of film to be enjoyed this was the type of film to be remembered and hallowed which i will for the rest of my life as a member of generation x i have to agree with all those who have said that younger people need to see this before i saw this movie i have to admit war was merely a concept i learned in history and the realism of spr opened my eyes wide not to mention my mouth in that first half hour or so and i also agree the message was to us i have yet to experience a loss or a sacrifice that even comes close to what those families went through and of course i hope i never have to experience anything remotely resembling it especially after seeing this movie before i end this message i would just like to clear something up the meaning of sending eight guys after one guy besides the figurative meaning the reason given in the movie is addressed in the first half of the movie general marshall read a very poignant letter that had been written by abraham lincoln to a woman who had lost all of her children in the civil war the brothers had been put in the army together so they would be with people they knew putting family members together in the armed services was a common practice up to and including wwii the reason general marshall sent those eight men after private was so that he could send home instead of his body in a box like he would have to do for so many men from so many families this movie is not entirely fiction based there were many incidents during wwi and ii in which whole families were killed all at once after wwii it was declared that members of the same family had to be split up so that the chances of that family having sons left after the war were greater than before besides all that if more families lost more sons theyd have more contempt for the government for sending their men into a nowin situation which makes it a good thing we won but all of that speculation aside i choose to ignore all those who complain about the shaking camera whats that about take some dramamine for petes sake i also choose to ignore those who said the movie lacked character development and emotion look a little deeper that was the whole movie in closing id like to say that all is not lost in trying to reach the heart of human compassion if steven can do it so can we,reality
i cant understand how it got anywhere near the top 50 unbelievable tom hanks to use an americanism really sucks as usual although i will say that if the intent was to make an awful film then the choice of an equally awful main actor would be the case so no surprises here i dont mean to offend the people who liked this film really its just that in the same page i noticed apocalypse now and i thought no no no this just cant happen im no fan of war eto war films but apocalypse now is art this well is not i remember the indescribable fear i had the year it was candidated for the oscars i nearly cried when i saw the results and they were not tears of happiness,reality
this is literally the worst movie i have ever seen and i hate myself for seeing it the four soldier leads are all just empty shells each with one dominant characteristic  we have the alpha one the quiet one who tries to fit into a war dominated environment and fails the stereotypical beta character and the obvious soontobedead the only female actor that has more than five minutes of screen time is a man and he is closeted whose character doesnt seem to have two brain cells to rub together and therefore correctly represents in the eyes of those sad individuals who stand behind this piece of st of a moviethe entire male population ironically he still manages to kill every german he meets because hes nonnazi this movie is just bad and i would tell you to avoid it like the plague but if youre anything like i am all these bad reviews are probably just making you want to see it even more do so at your own peril,reality
id missed this first time around and kept meaning to see it through after the first twenty minute roller coaster and despite the poor special effects i still had hope the rest of the film felt like a remake of all those 60s 70s  80s find something war movies like the dirty dozen id written about all the homages sniper shot etc all of which were visually and dialoguely underwhelming i know spielberg can be sentimental but phew it was a veritable lasagne of cheap emotions and i love john williams but the pull a tear jerker strings and last post bugles all the time i love tom hanks but i struggled to find him believable a lot of the time band of brothers was light years better but that suffered from patchy acting sorry i thought it was dreadful,reality
in the aftermath of dday tom hanks and his platoon of soldiers are sent off on a glorified prmission into harms way to rescue and bring home the last surviving member of the familysteven spielberg can be a truly great director but is an increasingly tiresome and nearly unwatchable trudge through war movie clichs after the harrowing opening recreation the film slides inexorably downhill into a rut from which it never emerges for all of the heralding by critics and fans of what a great film this is it is predictable mindnumbing and finally buttnumbinga minor history lesson while it is true that in events where an entire generation of a family enlisted and all but one died there were efforts to extract and return the soldier in question home however extraction often meant waiting for the soldier or his commanding officers to be in contact and then make appropriate arrangements for said soldier to be removed as soon as possible try as i might i can find no historic evidence that documents what happens in this film in that an entire platoon of men are placed in constant lifethreatening situations in order to extract a single private for a glorified pr stuntspielberg often has problems with conclusions especially in his more serious endeavors that is definitely the case here which features a wraparound which opens at arlington cemetery with the aged and concludes there as well the entire segment is badly directed and heavyhandedthe script itself is almost ridiculously slight particularly for a near 3hour running time the men in the platoon are all marching clichs reduced to types seen in a thousand other and in many cases much better war films each actor pretty much fastens in on one character trait and allows that to suffice for a performance hanks fares best as the everyman leader and tom sizemore is adequate as the secondincommand but they have given very similar performances elsewhere worst performances come from jeremy davies who overacts hysterically in the final third and edward burns who somehow manages to make his character supremely unlikablefor the duration of the film it hits the same tedious notes the men trod through the ugly war zone one of them confides something personal and is then subsequently obliterated in an often painfully protracted geyser of gore the platoons slog resumes someone else confides a personal story and then said person is annihilated shortly thereafter over and over again and againuntil a handful remain to find their quarry given that their losses do not endear the survivors to their quarry it comes as no surprise when they finally face private solidly played by matt damon who is such a congenial awshucks middle american nice guy that not only are the surviving men immediately charmed by him but when refuses to leave his post our survivors defy their orders to extract him immediately and stand by him in the chaotic final onslaughtthere is pretty much nothing in the way of surprise in the film and everything unfolds in a slow and tortuously predictable fashion about the only surprise is how needlessly and relentlessly brutal spielberg is with the violence after the opening moments of horrific carnage i think everyone gets the whole war is hell scenario unfortunately spielberg never ratchets back the violence  releasing freeflowing blood gore and body parts at the cameraworse the film is incredibly ugly to look at many ww2 veterans recount the beauty of europe during their service yet the entire color palette of this film consists of mud brown bleak greys and depressing blues and of course dark red blood spielberg also overutilizes the now too common place shakecam 4000 in which the camera jitters all over the place like its got palsy or is afflicted by st vituss dance which i gather is supposed to provide a you are there authenticity but instead generates motion sickness migraines and frustrationa really tiresome and criminally overrated viewing experience by the climax when the elderly questions whether it was all worth it you may well find yourself responding negatively,reality
summary a good movie but it is a times painfully sentimental american centred and while suggesting realism historically flawedsentimental because the movie is laden with strong emotional moments the most marked of which is the one when the aged drops to his knees at the grave of a the captain who saved him exclaiming did i do goodamerican centered because while the us characters are lifelike all others are not most absurd are the germans for instance the climax of the movie sees the us cast being attacked by ss men ss where no that oldaverage age of ss rank and file was between 1721but they where also not bald nor all that ugly nor that ineptfront assaults with what is obvious a 20 mm gun is a laugh tiger tanks where general deployed in groups not in single instances tanks where usually covered by infantry to prevent them from being ambushed by enemy infantry etc but most of all there where no ss at that moment in time at that place the ss units moving up to normandy which could have intervened where delayed by an exceptional campaign of sabotage and interdictions the airborne where in fact opposed by regular infantry and the unreliable osttruppen most of the time the only crack units that crossed swords with the airborne in early june where the fallschirmjaeger units near st lo these did not posses tiger tanks the story while breathing an air of being historically true is in fact mostly true to the american part all the others are just to embellish the story in this movie the us cast had to fight the ss equipped with tigertanks because in the us mind frame that was the best the germans had to offer ironically an inquiry among us soldier what they feared most put the tiger tank at the top of the list its ironical because of the 1350 odd produced tiger tanks 23 went to the eastfront 13 to the south and west front what reached the normandy frontrunning the gauntlet of interdictions and sabotage where mostly deployed against the english sector and not the us sectoryes more than 50 of the forces landed where non us the chance therefore that the us airborne would have been facing tigertanks in the early days of the invasion was equal to zero and then the strange plot twists the main characters land on omaha beach giving birth to one of the most intense movie scenes every filmed it had to be omaha because it was the hardest fought for but then comes the weird part the heroes are charged with saving who could have been better reached with less hassle by starting from utah beach which was closer to the drop zones and less opposed by the germans no the logical move would be to be shipped to the other beach but instead the story lets the saviors take a roundabound trip of 30 odd kilometres through enemy held territory without any explanation given the movie wasnt aiming to be the historically accurate it was a movie which made heroes of soldiers who did their job despite misgivings and in the face of adversity i somehow feel that the way the movie display heroism is wrong that it is detracted in the way this movies tells the story the stories main emotion is exemplified by the sentimental looking guy who looks at the stars thinking of home murmuring something about the cakes his mother made for him when he was ten investigations into the mindset of the average soldier paints another picture home was another planet there was no time to look at the stars if you had that time you went to sleep for there was always a lack of sleep if you didnt sleep you ate or drank instead of creating a band veteran soldiers shut themselves of from others because most of those others would be dead within a months time there might have been a band but it wasnt one of brothers it was a band of survivors like letters of iwo jima it isnt an overtly political statement but it is historically flawed and overtly sentimental to the point of being untrue nevertheless it is still a good movie that should be looked at as being fiction and the sentimental part can be skipped and the historical vaults forgiven,reality
for once the hype surrounding a spielberg film proves accurate the first halfhour of the film which shows the wwii allied invasion of normandy is every bit as powerful as youve heard a knockyouflat piece of filmmaking that surpasses every other cinematic image of wars hell unfortunately dday as such has absolutely nothing to do with the story of once this brilliant sequence is over we are left with a highly sentimental tiresomely repetitive and completely unoriginal film that drags on and on to an extremely obvious conclusionthe story concerns a young man matt damon whose brothers have been killed in battle leaving him as his parents only surviving child top brass decide that pvt must be sent homebut they are not entirely sure where he is in wartorn europe capt john miller tom hanks is accordingly snatched up from the dday battle and along with a handful of men is sent to find and bring him back in one pieceand at this point the film pretty much comes to a grinding halthanks once again proves why he is among hollywoods most bankable stars like james stewart he has an everyman quality sure to appeal to most viewersbut although he remains as likable as ever the script really doesnt give hanks much to work with and neither he nor his costars are greatly memorable indeed once the opening battle sequence ends the film becomes so slow and so repetitive that you could easily nip outside cut the lawn and come back in to find youve not missed anything at all final word the opening battle scene is worth the movie but dont think youre missing anything if you cant stay awake for the endgary f taylor aka gft amazon reviewer,reality
there is a line however fine between cinematic masterpiece and good filmmaking  though i believe private is neither i would definitely place it in mediocre standing towards the latter category  it is a questionably solid example of a type of filmmaking known as realism that is what is more important than how  notice the lack of character development and the absence of closeness with organized plot  most movies today whether they be masterpieces or not are at least cinematic private should not have been marketed like these other films  it is not cohesive nor is it engaging  it is meant to shock us into believing that this is how it was in wwii  therein lies its merit  spielberg should have promoted it this way my film is a realistic recreation of difficult and dramatic events not a flick  he should have shown it in art houses and college classrooms  i wish that i could say his isolated attempt to engage audiences with realism was precise but alas i must also note that speilbergs idea of realism is offbase  the movie to me seemed technically poor in some spots with inconsistent lighting and obvious computer manipulation  however the real problem with the format of the film lies in its breaches of realism  we get glimpses of character analysis with the very plastic opening and ending scenes in the cemetery in addition the inner scene in a crumbling old church beautiful images out of place where the young medic remembers his mother lets us journey far too deeply within the mind and soul for realism  on a more positive note the acting was superb all around  if speilberg has accomplished anything with private he has revealed the strengths of some outstanding young actors,reality
12 out if 10this movie is so dull and boring and the acting is so wooden that you cant help but fall asleepi dont what it is with me and the past 2 or 3 blockbusters that have came out spr titanic american beauty these films are just all hype and no substanceif this movie was about an hour shorter and the actors at least looking like are awake this film wouldve been a whole lot betterthats my opinion and im sticking to itthin red line is a better war movieand a tad shorter,reality
it was just ridiculous thanks to god i watched it on tv because i woudlnt spend a broken penny on it it was just laughable sending so many soldiers just to take some home because his brothers died and he is last son like there was just only one mother that lost her elder sons during the war and only the younges was leftthe whole story is just clich typical nonsense drama to make millionsi would give it 710 if the action took place somewhere else but for christ sake not ww ii310 just because its laughable,reality
preposterous repulsive mindless yank trash you lot just dont get it do you sewage like this is the main reason we hate you so much  your sickening blinkered love affair with yourselves and your stubborn refusal to credit any other nation with any good points at all spielberg even had to drop in a disparaging comment about field marshal montgomery who is still a national hero in england im thankful none of the money i spent on this filth a pound in a charity shop will find its way into american pockets incidentally i cant agree with those criticising the portrayal of the germans whether or not individuals were keen to be in occupied countries is irrelevant  they all bore some responsibility for laying waste a whole continent and the murder or enslavement of its population ive felt for years that the whole of germany should have been handed over to the russians in 1945  theyd have handed out adequate punishment,reality
tom hanks is totally out of character and does a very poor job and is unbelievable i thought the movie was boring look elsewhere for a more historic depiction of what happened on normandy,reality
this is definitely one of the more powerful war films out there if not the most powerful i will admit when i first saw it at school i found the first halfhour extremely upsetting to watchthe acting is outstanding especially from tom hanks and matt damon and the music alongside schindlers list is john williams most haunting score ive heardit does drag in the middle and the dialogue doesnt always flow as well as it should but what we have is a historically accurate extremely well made and directed and unashamedly brutal film i mean in the stabbing scene towards the end my english teacher had to leave the room it was like watching frankensteins monster tearing out elizabeths heart8510 for a truly emotional and appropriately sombre warfilm that is a little slow at times but it deserves to be in the top 250 really it is that good bethany cox,reality
has all the ingredients a good story  a young paratrooper private is dropped into the confusion of the dday airborne landings unknown to his three brothers have all recently been killed in action the commanding general orders that the last surviving brother must be located and returned home a small squad of rangers led by hanks is despatched into the normandy countryside to find private and get him to safety dramatic battle scenes  spielberg sets the style which has now often been copied for graphic and realistic battle scenes eg fury copied the style but had a rather silly ending although a fictional story much of gorebattle scenes recreate eye witness accounts so is very realistic great acting  tom hanks matt damon vin diesel and the cast all make this very very believable a fully satisfying quality war film with a great and poignant ending up until now i was unable to think of a war film that was comparable in all departments  storyrealismactinghowever having just seen hacksaw ridge i think that just pips if only on the basis hacksaw ridge is also a true story is a classic war film that can be watched many times 910,reality
more than just a soldier and more than just a man a historical fiction action movie that won many academy awards and golden globes staring actors like tom hanks matt damon and vin diesel its a very exceptional cast in a time of war where good menmany good men are killed and losing men is rationalized by how many they save the perspective changes to a mission of saving a life instead of taking that of the enemies some see this film as just another movie glorifying war but the intentions are to show how hope can remain for the brave men in the darkest of times and most dire instances i rate the movie a 10m out of 10 for the true depth of the movie represented so much more than a man or soldier,reality
steven spielbergs has some of the best directing of all time one of the greatest performances of all time from tom hanks and truly is one of the greatest films of all time as well as the greatest war film ever made the opening scene alone makes this movie a masterpiece its just the perfect way to set the stage for the threat and brutality of war and showing the solider who fought in it to be human beings who are just as terrified as anyone else would be in the same situation but the film doesnt stop after that the hunt for private is incredibly investing because you understand the reasons as to why even if you dont agree with them you understand them perfectly the fact that the main characters choose to address the somewhat unfair nature of picking one particular solider to go home out of the thousands was a very good decision because you cant help but see their point of view and understand them more another good decision was the fact that we dont meet private until about 23 of the way through the film it puts you in the characters difficult situation of finding one solider out of thousands like is said before tom hanks is truly amazing in this movie he gives his greatest performance in my opinion and one of the greatest of all time a lot rides on matt damon as private in this film because he has to come across as innocent enough and likable enough to justify all the hard ship and death that the characters go through in order to find him but he doesnt doesnt want to leave and feels immense guilt for all that has been done in his name and this makes him a much more compelling character while the opening scene on normandy beach is still the films best action sequences there are plenty of other amazing ones because they feel so real you know the danger these characters face when they charge into battle war isnt glorified in this movie its shown for what it is and nothing more tom hanks final words to earn this is haunting and forces the viewer to think about how they would earn such a gift of life and creates for a truly emotional last scene with which is the perfect ending to this masterpiece there are few films that are more universally beloved than for good reasons it does everything that not only a war movie should do but movies as a whole a100,reality
simply the best recreation of the most harrowing battle in the history of 20th century warfare june 6th 1944  france epic jaw dropping eerie disturbing and engrossing that is just the first 20 minutes unbeatable storytelling cast and performances a must see for all tom hanks at his best it contains all the elements of noble storytelling which is representational of all nations who fought on dday this movie captures the fear and terror as can only be imagined by those whom were not there i myself got a true taste of that fear while strapped into a chinnok helo over afghanistan in 2011 when we were shot at to be trapped in a bus with no way out but forward through the hail of maelstrom is an experience i will never forget and i am eerily reminded about during the opening scenes,reality
i had heard about the near 30 minute opening scene how graphic and scary it was i had actually dreamed about these scene before watching this film and there an all too haunting identity to it this was d day aka the battle of normandy where those small navy boats came onto the shores and the soldiers were picked off like chickens at a shooting gallery many didnt make it ashore where others that made it ashore became bloody graphic examples of what this deadly and horrific war was like this is the most scariest and bloodiest scene ive seen in a war film where its near thirty minute duration as it violently depicted what went down in depth highly benefited but made the rest of the other film drop or seem standard but i mean that only in contrast to the war sequence which really set the bar high in one sense the scene prior to this in the cemetery which comes back at the end makes this story only the more heartbreaking as we view a sea of graves just to show you how shockingly easy the lives of these boys were lost now moving on captain john miller hanks assigns a squad to track down one private risking the lives of his squad for this one guy there are more shockingly violent bits in this too the atmosphere in the last thirty resembling that of the ruins in full metal jacket which unlike that this one remarkably dodged an r certificate what surprised me acting wise was vin diesel as one of hanks squad who unfortunately buys it early in the piece while hanks wasnt bad but i have seen better from him while barry pepper again steals their thunder i like ted dansons brief performance too as another squad captain we bump into on our search for that one party where his two other brothers didnt make it ill be frank spr has a very unsettling and frightening aura to it like ive never felt in any other war film another way of saying this is in the how easy to die scenario which which ive never felt stronger as in this spielberg again has pulled off something respectfully and undeniably brilliant but as someone whos created the most scariest war film ive ever seen he should be widely commended where this film should of walked away with the best film oscar,reality
is one of those movies that you can watch with regular intervals of time and even if youve seen it multiple times and am familiar with the storyline the movie is solid enough to be watched over and over and keeps on being entertainingthe story quickly summarized is about a small squad of soldiers during the 2nd world war who are given a mission to find private in wartorn europe after having survived the dday onslaught at omaha beachwhat makes good is a combination of multiple things first of course is the storyline but also the way it is filmed which puts the audience right in the midst of the action most importantly though is the more than impressive cast who perform above and beyond the call of duty so to speak no pun intendedthe action is formidable and impressive showing that war is brutal and bloody and it is presented in a very realistic manner again adding to the conviction of the entire moviethe cast list for was impressive and there is a number of actors who really prove their acting talents and break out of the stereotypical roles and genres they tend to cling to tom hanks of course is the center of the movie and he fitted so well into the role and the movie usually i am not particularly fond of tom sizemore but he was perfect for this movie and did a great job ted danson was a breath of fresh air and he was a great addition to the movie as were paul giamatti barry pepper was phenomenal in his role and brought a good amount of flavor to the movie however for me it was jeremy davies who was the most outstanding of all in the movie proving once again what a phenomenal character actor he isand it is always a plus when germans actually do speak german in a world war 2 movie and not have those awful german accents added when they in fact are speaking englishis a movie experience that everyone should have at least once it is an impressive and very entertaining movie to say the least,reality
living the war with privateis a fantastic film by steven spielberg and written by robert rodatin colors which was produced in 1998 in america its a wonderful war drama and action film about world war ii we find such wellknown actors as tom hanks playing the role of captain john miller tom sizemore playing the role of sergeant michael horvath edward burns as private reiben barry pepper as private jackson matt damon as the role of private adam goldberg as private mallish and vin diesel as private caparzowhile the allied force land to omaha beach miller has to lead his platoon behind the enemy lines for a dangerous mission  find and return safe and sound private james francis whos got three brothers who died in the fight within three days while the platoon progresses on enemy territory millers men wonder themselves  is it necessary to risk the life of eight men to save the only one from it  the acting presence of the actors is successful we feel different emotions with actors the pain when for instance two policemen announce to mrs that her three sons are dead there is no dialogue and it makes us understand that there are no words to talk about death we cant put some words some good words not to destroy somebody to soften the pain steven spielberg reveals that we can see this old woman falling down on the ground devastated and this scene tear our heart sometimes the camera zooms on a soldiers face and we feel deeply in our chest that they are petrified and they transmit this feeling very wellthis film is visually breathtaking because of the landscapes and the sets are so realistic that we lose ourselves in them and live  discover the atrocities of the war at the same time as the soldiers we follow them we belong to the platoon and on top of that sometimes we are surprised to hear an explosion to see the ground explode as fireworks as if it were next to us it permits the spectator to live the war as never we are both an actor and a soldierthe story line is downtoearth  first there is no love story like in pear harbor which gives a sweet side to the story here there are only blood bravery brotherhood fights and a duty to fulfill it permits the spectator to really know what happened during dday moreover even the good characters die some scenes are violent for instance when a german stabs a jew very slowly to make him suffer because its important to say that during world war ii germans tried to eliminate all the jews  its called a genocide this film doesnt hide the reality of warbut this beautiful and fantastic film reveals something about soldiers during world war ii  they were both loving and ruthless they are presented as survivors and heroes soldiers are always filmed with the high angle shot except when they are crying or dying because at this moment they are weak respectful men brave because they face danger even if they are afraid because they are willing to fulfill their duty for their country wives and children and we can see this at the beginning of the film when the american soldiers land to normandy tom hanks appears totally lost his helmet on the floor he discovers the nightmare of war he could have given up but we can finally see a light of determination on his eyes and all of a sudden he catches his helmet and put it on his head  he really wants to achieve his duty hes courageous soldiers also appear selfsacrificing and brotherhood is highlighted in this film because they landed together and they will come back home together no matter what the music by john williams contributes to release feelings deep in the chest of the spectator and music is useful to carve the image of the soldier we have a patriotic music when for instance a soldier talks about his life at home with his family to show that they are heroes and that they will come back home or to show that they had to leave them behind to accomplish their duty for the country so the spectator is totally overwhelmed with feelings thanks to music which makes soldiers appear both brave and heartbroken because they miss their family and we can identify ourselves to them  its a very moving film which turns our hearts upside downthis film received two awards  in 1999 steven spielberg got a golden globe for the best director of a motion picture with then in 1999 the film received a golden globe for the best motion picture moreover the film received some good critics  the new york times said this film simply looks at war as if war had not been looked at before which was very positive in the city review carter b horsley said with extreme gore deep sincerity fabulous cinematography and great acting is a stupendous movieis a film which remains important in time it echoes to the past without lies it presents world war ii soldiers as selfsacrificing heroes and they can be fathers brothers too  they have a heart will never stop moving us and make us admire what soldiers did to help us to live in the world that we know nowadaysby sangiorgio marine,reality
many things are flawed in this fiction which seems to be far away from reality this does not touch at any point better than saving pvt are the pianist downfall and even apocalypse now and even the tv series of the pacific is a lot better i am not a historian so i may not be 100 correct in many of my thoughts but in my opinion the kind of sentiments that have been shown in this movie by the military and military general  is unbelievable and somehow ridiculous especially if it is related to world war 2 and when america is just getting up from the great depression why one boy is so important who had been admitted to the army to serve his country now army wants to protect this baby funny every soldier has a mom and wife and family at many times when the soldiers should shoot the enemy they are letting him walk away in the name of pow that kind of kindness never happens in reality and i listened a lot about the opening 30 minutes scene that it is really fantastic but it was horrible the opening scene of shooter was much more realistic and exciting why the army will land on the beach in such a suicidal way for the massacre of their own men this is just a good action movie like black hawk down or matt damons green zone,reality
i wasnt too impressed with this film when i saw it more than a decade ago its a very corny and sentimental retelling of the landing in normandy during world war ii and subsequent battles in france the film starts and closes in a veterans cemetery during the present times that is around the time it was filmed and perhaps one of the reasons that the filmmakers made it so sentimental is that around the time it was released and for obvious biological reasons many ww2 veterans started dying i remember that another film dealing with world war ii was released at around the same time terrence malicks the thin red line which dealt with the war in the pacific and it was far more gripping and stronger and far less sentimental movie private opens with a now famous scene of the landing in normandy that is very well done but the film sort of goes downhill though not catastrophically from there on the character of the german prisoner for instance is very crudely written and performed i have to say however that one thing that impressed me about the movie is that it shows american soldiers killing german soldiers as they were surrendering this undoubtedly happened quite a lot in world war ii and in many wars i suppose yet few films show such things and spielberg shows this matter of factly he doesnt give moral judgment on this for this honesty i praise the movie but on balance i think this movie is only fair,reality
when i was watching this movie the 1st timei have watched it 8 times the 1st scene itself made me feel cold and tense as if i myself was there on the beaches of normandy alongside tom hanks  the 1st scene is undoubtedly the best 15 minutes of war footage in cinematic historythere is only one explanation u can give for not having watched this  u r dead  watch the movie and let steve spielberg mesmerize u with his beautiful portrayal of a unique platoon with a unique mission and dont get surprised if u hear bullets whizzing in ur mind even after u have stopped watching it coz this is a movie meant to stay forever in the minds and hearts of all movielovers  1010 definitely,reality
i cant claim that spielberg has overwhelmed me on many an occasion i tend to find his work somewhat sentimental and too bright and upbeat for my worldview but here he delivers the first thirty minutes or so of this will pretty much tell you what you need to knowand i mean that in the most positive way possible and few will manage to avoid being pulled in right from the start in a grip that only really lets go when the credits roll the production quality is rather close to setting a new standard for highest the direction is spotontheres some beautiful underplaying going on here and almost all of the emotional material is done exactly rightthere was perhaps one bit near the end that just it is not quite there the pacing is flawless this never loses your interestin spite of being close to three hours nor moves so fast that the audience is lost the acting is impressivethis things got enough acting power to fuel half a dozen of these even mark vincenteven if hed prefer we called him vin diesel isnt badyeah i knowi could kick myself and no thanks amy the realism is an accomplishment the situations the reactions the people everything almost the entire way through is so close to the real thing youd swear someone colorized actual footage or something there is some hollywood herein however but the scales are tipped so far in favour of the authenticity its a very very minor complaint cinematography and editing are just amazing they really bring the scenes to life and give you a sense of what it must be like to really be there this has got atmosphere to spare there is a lot of violence and language the writing is remarkable and many details are magnificent the story isnt the most engaging ever in an antiwar film but it certainly is good i recommend this to any fan of war movies just do realize that this holds little back in its depiction 810,reality
in another spielberg masterpiece a mother is about to receive a message stating that three of her four boys were killed in battle in wwii the government learns of the fourth private matt damon and declares a search for him to be found and sent home after invading normandy on dday cpt miller tom hanks takes 7 men with him behind enemy lines to search fori love this film it is so well done interesting to watch and still great after many repeated viewings a powerful look into the great war of our time i feel that this is among the best films of all timethe acting was great by all cast members i dont recall any missteps and there are certainly spots of fantastic acting in this film as for the plot im not sure how true it is if even but i think that it is one of the greatest plots a war film has seen the action is spectacular and frequents with necessary and brutal war violence brings the harshness of war to the audience yet still is entertaining and thought provoking rather than just plain senselessfurthermore the visual effects were all great and i never felt like i was watching a movie so much as that i was there it definitely gave me that rare thing a film can do every once in a while allowing to completely be immersed in iti think that this is among spielbergs best for sure and i can highly recommend it as a must see piece of film historyfinal rating 1010,reality
this is my favorite movie ever it has great action great acting and its realistic and suspenseful dday and the last battle were 2 of the best battles i have ever seen on any movie i loved all the different stradagies they used in the last battle the movie makes you like the characters so much it makes you almost cry when they die i wished more characters could have survived at the end escpesially captain miller and private jackson the most suspenseful part by far was when mellish was upstairs and they hear something in the stairways and they dont know who it is this movie was great and everyone should see it if you havent,reality
because i have younger siblings most war films i have seen are the least realistic ones that are just fairly decent tears of the sun behind enemy lines upon finally having my siblings out of the house i was able to watch it let me tell you i was blown away the movie was incrediblethe first thirty minutes are all about dday the bloodiest battle i have ever seen on screen it was very realistic and accurate the dead and the wounded were lying around everywhere getting plowed down as the ships opened not too many survived one of the survivors is one of my alltime favorite actors tom hanks he is affected by the battle severely and he recruits men afterward to hunt down private whose other brothers have been killed in combatthe next two hours show us the complete trek to finding private and developing all the characters to their fullest every character has his own personality and you learn so much about each and every character each one does a great job at showing what type of person they are along the way they have to fight off some nazis and two men are killed this effects each and every soldier in tom hanks squadron and the life of war is seen taking its toll on each man emotionally and mentally breaking them and hurting themevery time a character has a meltdown it is very powerful the moments are calm and slow but not soft on the heart and yet they must press on through the washedup world until they find private and have a historic showdown in cinema historyheroes die men are wounded and left for dead only some survive the final battle is merciless and although not as bloody as the dday invasion in the beginning its more difficult to watch because more men die and you know each and every one what makes it even sadder is that it was all realeven my grandpa who was in several battles in the korean war and held as a prisoner for two years in korea said the movie was fairly realistic steven spielberg cinematic genius of the 20th century is not afraid to show the blood and gore and hammer disturbingly devastating pain into the hearts of the viewer and after the movie you find yourself silent quietly honoring the heroes of wwii that is what did 9810,reality
in hollywood war film tradition epic warfare orbits on the actions of already acquainted heroes in steven spielbergs judicial and exacting masterwork thousands of horrorstruck and nauseated men most of them green to battle are chucked into the grimace of devastating german fire the opening sequence is as detailed as any war footage in the bloodsoaked opening steps the landing forces and the enemy never connect eye to eye but are just faceless clots of men who have been commanded to shoot at one another until one side is overwhelmedspielbergs camera makes no comprehension of the engagement that is the function of his approach for the individual soldier on the beach the landing was a cacophony of clamor sludge gore entrails and morbidity the scene is filled with various nongermane fragments of chronology as when a soldier has his arm blown offthis landing sequence is essential to form the remoteness between those who give the order that pvt be saved and those who are dictated to do the saving for capt miller tom hanks and his men the landing at omaha has been a melting pot of crossfire for the army chief in his washington office war feels more secluded and nationalistic his advisors doubt the judgment and even the plausibility of a mission to save that sets up the second act of the film in which miller and his men infiltrate spryly inflamed french terrain while entertaining defiant ideas about the prudence of the assignment all of millers men have served with him before save for cpl upham jeremy davies the translator who speaks excellent german and french but has never fired a rifle in rage and is frightened nearly to the point of his moralitys deterioration the war was fought by civilians just like him whose lives had not readied them for the brass tacks of combatsteven spielberg is often thought of as a throwaway name to refer to when speaking of the greatest directors of all time mainly because his movies are often romanticized hollywood blockbusters and not hard tough cool grungy stuff spielberg while he demonstrates a mastery of pace and story crescendo that should be taught in every film school in the world proves with not to mention with the more recent munich that he is capable of true grit and shocking realismthe story begins with the most gutwrenchingly violent battle scene ive seen in any war film this prolonged sequence depicts dday in the most realistic possible way not only with gore and violence but also with the ambient violence that must be dealt with in moments of hasty contemplation and desperate but emotionally diluted dialogue the film then segues into a story that applies the deeply affecting theme of the mother what makes the film so profound is its core drawing of sympathy from the audience for the common boys mother and the pain and worry they endure in times of war that we can only imaginehis cinematographer janusz kaminski who also shot schindlers list brings a newsreel texture to a lot of the footage but thats rather elementary next to his most substantial stroke which is to make everything manifest lucid following the meticulous pandemonium of the landing scenes kaminski handles the attack on the machine gun nest and an extensive climax concerning the fortification of a bridge in a way that keeps us aligned its not simply men shooting at one another we learn the plan of the action the subtle victory of optimism over despair the spontaneity the corresponding locations of the soldiershanks has a subtle sense of drama in his personal commitment to the role of capt miller an english teacher who has outlived ordeals so overwhelming that he doubts if his wife will even place him with a reserved collected and even exacting bearing his hands nonetheless quiver he is on the verge of breakdown but he does his best since that is his duty all of the actors all the countless noteworthy faces playing the men under him are compelling somewhat on account of spielberg defying the inducement to make them stereotypical caricatures in the custom of wwii movies and makes them emphatically everydayeverything approaches the third act when private is found and the soldiers determine what to do next spielberg and his screenwriter robert rodat have done a penetrating and personally transcendent thing they have made a philosophical film about war in effect thoroughly in circumstances of action their sweeping ode says things about war that are as intricate and demanding as any essayist could likely assert and does it with expansive forceful imagery with brutality with coarseness with movement with rapport it is conceivable to get across even the most sensitive notions in the most elementary words and actions and thats what spielberg does with keen instincts because he signifies his impressions in visceral reactions not words steven spielberg is as technically accomplished as any filmmaker alive and due to his mammoth eminence he has admittance to any asset he entails both of those facts are relevant to the punch of this seamless period piece he knows how to express his emotional fervor about men in combat with utmost moralistic intensity and he has the apparatus the greenback and the running dogs to make it happen,reality
the storyline was something new to look at with the brilliant photography it makes u stick to the screen for 230hrs i can say that its one of the few good movies i have seen the battle scene in the start was brilliantly shot i dont if thats how things are in a warbut i think it was an ambush and so it was acceptable people who havent seen the movie do check it out if you are an admirer of war movies acting of matt dammon and tom hanks was really good no name a few its a fast paced movie doesnt get u always think about the brutality of warsbut the thought of mankind killing fellow mankind to extend their boundary lines or to show their superiority but the story line was new but dont know if thats how things happened at the time of war 10 people having on the line to save guy but its a must movie to watch,reality

nominated for 11 academy awards and for good reason when released on video several years ago i watched about the first 5 minutes and turned away with no stomach for the blood and graphic violence in the opening scenewith the release of the special edition dvd and its reasonable price and many accolades i had to buy it to add to my collection and am i glad i did first steven spielberg and tom hanks were absolutely superb as director and actor respectively no one in tinseltown could have done a better job with a war movie and spielbers objective was met with me anywayknow why we celebrate memorial day and veterans daythis movie will explain why the cinematography in this film won the oscar and rightly so i watched the special features and spielberg stated he extracted something like 60 of the color to allow for more of a dated type film appearance to look like footageand it workedit made the movie so much more believableand bring you to the time and place and the horrors of war and heroes we hear about but never meet the viewer is spared no brutality no violence of warits frightening but gripping hard to watch but also hard to look awaythere are many tearful moments in this movie so its definitely a have a tissue nearby film sad poignant profound moments that if youre human ie compassionate will force you however subliminally to remember what honoring our fallen heroes and the survivors of war is all about tom hanks and steven spielberg will bring you into the lives of the soldiers of wwii and this movie should awaken the viewer who sees it now to the honor that our soldiers from any way whether its wwi wwii vietnam especially and now iraq deserve to be honored for their lossesfor theyre lack of tomorrows are for our todaysa 1010 kudos to spielberg this will join the movie classics of all time,reality
this is one of the best war movies that i have ever seen it had a wonderful plot and was based on a true story it not only entertains us it also gives us a small history lesson what the war was like how many people gave their lives to save this country the weapons that they used all in all i would give this movie a ten out of ten and proclaim it the best war movie ever also the actual way they fought back then was very interesting like the last scene in the movie when they fought the germans to keep a hold of the bridge that they were protecting even the character that were fictional appeared to have real lives and actually participate in the war there was only one thing that i did not like and it was not enough to bring my vote down from a ten and it was the fact that some of the lines that they used were a little bit crummy o my god they shot me while he was still moving first scene of the movie this was one of about three lines that i really do not believe should have been included in the final script otherwise this was still the best movie that i have ever seen in my entire life,reality
spielbergs continued descent into narrow arrogant lowbrow revisionism is at best a languid patriotic trumpcalling movie with nothing better to do than applaud the glorious morally superior american armed forces who were in actuality nothing but teenage thugs who beat german prisoners and raped french women and looted european cities he starts off with kleenex totting bravery and then leads us into brutal images that have no other point than to entertain the violent video game minded geeks of american malls he then regresses into heavy handed sentimentality that leads the viewer to conclude that americans were all good guys this is not the case history has shown us so americans for all their good intentions in world war 2 were just as loathsome as the nazis they had a deep segregationist attitude in the states which killed people because of skin color arrested and imprisoned innocent hard working japanese people and locked them in concentration camps kept black soldiers in separate units which often were the lowliest positions fire bombed nontactical european cities most notably dresden hired former nazis to combat the communist threat and finally dropped two atomic bombs upon an innocent japanese civilian population and after the war things got even worse the red hunt which resembled the trials in nazi germany in the 1930s occurred under a madman named mccarthy so if you want to be blindly led by spielbergs glorious war message that is simply propaganda then by all means do and watch this film which has no redeeming qualities,reality
well the movie starts off with a credible depiction of dday not shying away from the insane violence and carnage very shocking and puts you right in the middle of ww2 combat unfortunately the movie goes downhill from there the production quality is still on a highlevelbut the story itself isnt spielberg is too fond of his hollywoodtype heroism and spices his otherwise gritty tale with unecessary blandness the worst part is the display of the german troops they are displayed as mindless thugs and not as humans even much older movies like battle for arnheim portray germans in a more acceptable wayenemies like the japanesegermansvietkong and later on the russians former ww2 allies  are always shown in uswarmovies as pure cannonfodder for the americansback to spielberg has a fixed mindset about germans probably heavily influenced by the comicbook nazis of his own raiders of the lost ark which is a good and entertaining movie btw he doesnt trust his story and thinks he has to pump it up with some patriotic music and heroic dialoguejust terrible i was very dissapointed why is it not possible to make a movie at least trying to show both sides from a soldiers perspective ah well,reality
the reconstruction is excellent the visual effects create very accurate images but its like titanic in wwii a lot of movies has been made on that subject and there are lots of true stories that deserve to be told without such sugarcoated style maybe if spielberg had made a remake of the longest day with the production used for this movie he would have made a great movie he wouldnt have to resort to  the predictable last scene when pvt salutes john millers grave,reality
i wish someone had saved me from this film it was like watching paint dry except with very little oxygen in the room dying painfully this film was supposedly a classic but it felt more old fashioned than record players on a star wars spaceshipi went to see this film because it was supposedly a classic and a film as my friends said i must watch well now i must go and wash myself clean and go find a breathing apparatus or i may pass out from the sheer terribleness of this filmthe worst parts of the film were the action scenes and the dialogue i think michael bay or george lucas would have turned their noses up at it,reality
this movie is considered a classic but i ask you what is classic about something so gay the answer everything to review this movie in a positive and energetic manner would be troublesome and false this movie had a bad script bad special effects and contains one of the worst scenes in history the scene is the one where the sniper gets shoot through the scope terrible the story is so predictable and the character development it poor tisk tisktom hanks his worst acting performance to date compare this performance to his best work turner and hooch and you see that his acting is terrible and embarrassing i felt ill after watching this movie and it wasnt because of the cheesy gore tom hanks hang your head in shameto sum up and reiterate this movie is terrible dry predictable sloppy riddled with editors mistakes and a complete misinterpretation of world war 2for a good ww2 movie watch the classic hercules in new york,reality
this movie was overall a great movie but big scary letters but only the first 20 minutes were actually historic i know maybe it wasnt meant to all be historic but doesnt a war movie usually have to be like the real thing the actual omaha beach scene at the start is the only real historic event the rest is all fictional thoug i cannot reveal why it is not all fictional i can still tell you that whatever the movie describes andor you think it is war is not always actually like what you seewar is gruesome painful depressing x 9222845363 terrible and basically it is one of the most horrible things that can ever happen dying is not horrible as everyone is meant to die but the pain and agony and all the other things that go along with war isso basically id like to stick to more historically accurate moviesalso america forgot or maybe just didnt want to include the countries that did most of the dirty work like canada like great britain how can you forget them too also the movie was incredibly corny it was not true at all except for the first 20 minutes its like they say about north american cars and european cars they add more gadgets and take away all the qualityyet we must remember the ones whom actually fought lest we forget,reality
following the example of jaws and la confidential steven spielbergs cinematic masterpiece falls victim to the idiocy of the academy awards is arguably the best picture of the year and one of the best of all time the performances are perfect throughout and the characters are very wellwritten this is doubtlessly the most historically accurate movie ive ever seen even the dialogue is perfectly written with surprisingly close attention paid to the accuracy of even the mildest most casual and brieflydealtwith topics of conversation the battle scenes are excellent and the carnage is both realistic and necessary to add to the films power and the underscoring subtle and sparingly used is truly beautifulwill go down in history it makes us both understand and appreciate the sacrifices made by our soldiers over 50 years ago thoughtprovoking shocking effectively dramatic beautifully made and highly intriguing this movie is a brilliant example of cinematic art,reality
i am still trying to understand why people love this movie it is about 3 hours in length and it feels as if every scene is the same scene over and over again i understand that its a war movie and that there has to be a decent amount of war in it but the story was just so shallow and soo boring i am not a hater of war movies but this war movie in particular to put it simply was just a bunch of noise with guys wearing green marching through battlefields for 3 hours watch the movie hacksaw ridge that is a real war movie that will make you stand out of your seat and applaud at the end of the movie,reality
this is my favourite all time film and i think will remain this throughout my life its brilliant every way to the acting all the way to the cgi and locations of the shoot easy to get to grips with and lots of action easily the greatest film of all time imo i would recommend this film to anyone it would be enjoyable for everyone who would understand the story and appreciate films as much as i do i am yet to find a fault in this film and i really dont think there is one it has everything,reality
i watched a couple of years ago rated it 9 but couldnt remember much so watched it again yesterday and the extras on the dvd which adds quite a bit to the whole experiencethis might seem odd but i am impressed with the absence of the crude mf language which i have never heard a real person say and which is so prevalent in a lot of other war moviesthe first part on june 6 1944 is awful in its realities this is what those guys went through and again at the very end hand to hand fighting in the village we see the fear and dread in the jeremy davies character my only tiny adverse comment might be about the scenes at the war graves place the green stuff looks like astroturf and the head stones look like polystyrene,reality
is more or less a character study not of only one person but of us philosophy why send a squad to find one guy and send him home the premise is that the mother had already lost 3 of her 4 sons to the war world war ii or the great patriotic war and that she should not be expected to lose her 4th and final son to the war she had lost 75 of her children and shouldnt have to lose 100 of her childrenhowever what about the mother who watches her only child go off to war if he dies she already lost 100 of her children to war its an issue that comes up many times in the film and we get to see every man in the squad fight with this issue in his own mind during the filmthe private character matt damon fights with this issue too hes already been designated as an object of hatred and contempt by the entire squad before they even meet him he understands that the mission is both justified and ludicrous at the same time he didnt ask to be rescued and he doesnt want to be rescued but he seems to understand why he should be rescued he represents the feeling that the usa shouldnt lose all of its children to the warthe main characters are a brilliant mixthe captain who is fulfilling his duty to his country in its time of needthe sergeant a crusty old lifetime war veteran the kind of guy who actually eats mres because he likes the tastethe sniper a soldier who feels that his god gave him an amazing gift specifically for the purpose of defeating the german armythe jew who joined the army specifically to fight against the antijewish nazisthe tough guy an almost mafialike character from new york city who has no problem with getting in the face of his sergeant and even his captainthe good guy who initially seems like a tough guy but ends up being a softhearted guy who royally screws up by trying to save the life of a little girl in a war zone at an inopportune momenti didnt really care for giovanni ribisis character in the film the character just didnt seem realistic to me however the rest of the cast is a total home runthe film does a great job of capturing the horrors and realism of firstperson warfare and the story is awesome too surely one of spielbergs finest films,reality
spoilers ho the first scene in the normandy cemetery of is enough to put me on my knees and from there it gets even more emotional as we see the faces of the troops about to be the first to set foot on omaha beach which has since become a synonym of hellish warfare its hard for me to watch anything about vets of wwii without losing it just the damn trailer for deserves an academy award brilliantthe acting is great to notsogreat depending on the actors and nonactors i think you call it screen presence wherein you like seeing some people while others make you cringe great tom sizemore tom hanks ed burns barry pepper giovani ribisi matt damon adam goldberg i wont go into detail on those i didnt like but to contrast the cast of this movie just take a look at band of brothers i loved every character in that series i just jotted down a few thoughts as i watched this classic for the umpteenth time the initial fight for the beach was about as intense as movies about war can bealthough a visual masterpiece the scene of the official car going to the home of the slain soldiers was a bit overthetop as far as americana she should have been baking an apple pie any home in american any crappy flat in new york would have served the same purpose without being quite as maudlinvin diesel couldnt get killed too soon for me had he met his maker during the opening credits would have been better but this was soon enoughthere is no freaking way they would have let that german soldier go he would have picked up the first available weapon and continued fightingthe pansy translator kid was terrible both he and his role i didnt like anything about him and the film would have been better without this character there is a right and a wrong way to do smarmydying sucks we get it already i just thought they overdid this a bit i realize this is a movie about one of the bloodiest wars ever but the long drawnout death scenes became corny and not dramaticthere were a couple of great moments in the film when tom hanks sort of splits through the tension verging on mutiny with the story of where he is from and what he did was the best of scene in the film matt damons dialogue about the last night with his brothers could have used a little work the story about his brother trying to screw some ugly chick in the barn it was a poor bit of writing,reality
i knew going in and it being spielberg that there wasnt going to be much variety but wow there is almost none most of the movie is focused around of course and yet it almost feels like the movie is more about how much spielberg is at his old tricks most of the characters are one dimensional and hardly get any development other than tom hanks who is as always golden the worst of them though is matt damon hes pvt hes stereotypically arrogant and seems like the type of guy whos all talk and no walk it makes him pretty much impossible to like and leaves you with the desire to shut off the movie once hes on the screen as for the story what story most of what should be story is hampered by more arguing and attempts at comedic more lighthearted moments in the middle of war really and the film being nearly 3 hours feels so padded and stretched out that its like watching a 90 minute movie in slow motion so if you want my advice skip this and rent full metal jacket,reality
theres a fairly standard narrative in war films today that wars are hell but that the men who fight them deserve our respect and its perhaps unsurprising that stephen spielbergs film about the normandy landings essentially repeats the message the movies structure an initial battle an interlude and then a concluding fight is also typical and background music slow motion scenes and a present day topandtail to the story are added in to make sure that the audience knows what to think in spite of this its not a bad film fully depicting the chaotic horror of war and resisting the temptation to easily close at least some of its subplots although on other occasions its too clear how a given tale is going to end a bigger problem for me however was the absence of a character i could really care about tom hankss hero is just too heroic for me to care about not in a silly way but a character for us to admire rather than for us to feel empathy for although a lengthy movie it didnt feel like one but in the end i didnt feel moved by its respectful conclusion,reality
yes this may sound like blasphemy but yes spr is better than apocalypse now how exactly well for one thing while sharing some themes spr is just so much more moving than apocalypse now and at least spr doesnt go on and on and on and on dont get me wrong i liked apocalypse now but spr just didnt leave you with the feeling that theres no hope for the world it left you with the feeling that theres hope for the world that theres hope for humanity and that it may be easy to descend into the heart of darkness its just as easy to ascend into the heart of lightand as i was saying from the beginning about how spr is more moving than an in the first 24 minutes i felt like crying watching all those people dying imploding exploding being amputated and etc i realized that had i been 18 in 1945 i could have been one of those people and i further realized that one person in that film represented 10 others and that was just a softened version of the great dday invasionalso brilliantly showed how the suits in washington thought of their soldiers as risk copyright by parker brothers and hasbro co pieces preferring to send 19 or so soldiers to their death to satisfy an unhappy mother than send them homeis by far my most favorite war movie 1 2 glory 3 apocalypse now it has won 5 oscars deserved every single one and more and is one of the best movies out there,reality
first of all i would like to say i thoroughly enjoyed this film and historically it was right on the ball for the landings and the subsequent movement of the other american troopshowever after doing a lot of research on dday i was really disappointed in the way the filmmakers seemed to leave out important facts about the others who got involved in the war primarily the british and the canadians who sent thousands of troops in to other beeches and didnt even get a mention another example of hollywood feeding americas we single handedly saved the world egohowever like i said a fantastic film great actors and a great pulsating story filled with some amazing war shots and some great dialogue between characters earn itnow i now this film was primarily about and not so much about dday in depth i think this is a fantastic opportunity for hollywood to make an indepth film about dday by that i mean the intensive three year planning that had begun even before america joined the war the raf missions over callais and other bluffs to make the germans convicned the attack was coming there even during the middle dday they were still convinced that another wave would hit elsewhere and prehaps more about the thousands of paratroopers who took out the legendary pegasus bridge in the early hours of the morning to hold the entire post invasion operation togetherhowever random tangent aside i highly recommend this film to anyone who is interested in history it is incredibly accurate in all the other area apart from where i mentionedi gave it 8 ,reality
stands alongside schindlers list as one of steven spielbergs greatest achievements as a director and just recently i had the pleasure of rediscovering his empire of the sun and realized then how well he captures on film the horror and brutality of war without going in for stereotyped charactersduring the 40s when war films were largely produced for propaganda purposes and for injecting much needed patriotism into all americans while we fought hitler and mussolini and the japanese we had films like a walk in the sun or guadalcanal diary or so proudly we hail all of them were fine in their own way but often resorted to creating hollywood stereotypes among the characters the soldiers and nurses who fought during the warnot true here from the startling twentyminute opening sequence on the dday invasion through the intricacies of interpersonal relationships among a disparate group of men we never once feel were watching stereotypes but real people all of the performances are firstrate beginning with tom hanks whose everyman personality is put to excellent use here others too numerous to mention do great jobs in the large supporting castno cheap heroics here just a compelling war story extremely well done and holding interest from beginning to end recommended highlytrivia note john williams score is never intrusive enough to damage the stark reality of some of the most brutal scenes,reality
without a question one of the greatest films ever made in my humble opinion its very sad gripping and often disturbing jaws was amazing but this is my favorite out of steven spielbergs films i have not yet seen schindlers list but will soon this film actually managed to make me shed a few tears at the end it was very sad this is extremely well made and brilliantly directed by steven spielberg using great shots especially during the war scenes this film will stay with you long after you have watched it and its very moving beware though if you have a weak stomach dont watch this movie the scenes between hanks and damon were awesome and very touching the plot was awesome but sending tons of soldiers just to find private a lot of people had a problem with that but i loved it this is now the 2nd war film i have seen and i will be seeing lots more very soon this movie is extremely gory we get a leg blown off severed arm hundreds of extremely bloody gunshot wounds one to the eye cringe inducing one to the neck that spurts tons of blood blood everywhere someones guts falls out of someones belly as he tried to hold them in  very graphic surgery you see guts intestines more graphic surgery blood keeps pouring from a gunshot wound very bloody badly wounded soldier bloody corpses tons of people explode into pieces arms torsos and other severed limbs fly everywhere hand bitten on tons of graphic bloody gunshot wounds to the head with blood and brains spurting one of the goriest films i have ever seen the acting is no doubt oscar worthy tom hanks gives a performance of a lifetimeand deserved an oscar for his incredible performance he is incredible just incredible he is extremely likable and what he said to james near the ending was very moving he is one of the best actors out there matt damon gives a wonderful performance here as the young i liked him lots in my opinion he is a very talented actor him and hanks had awesome chemistry togetheredawrd burns is good here and did what he had to do well tom sizemore was funny and did very well here i liked him lotsjeremy davies is very good he showed vulnerability and did great adam goldberg does rock solid here as the tough guy of the bunch barry peppers also did well giovani ribsi did not have much to do vin diesel was good in his limited screen time ted danson has a cool cameo harrison young does great as the older overall i cant recommend this movie enough you must see this as soon as possible if you havent  out of 5,reality
before i saw i wasnt interested in anything wwii related every time there was a documentary on i would change the channel i couldnt stand classics such as the guns of navarone the eagle has landed and the longest day i even didnt liked schindlers list and then i saw saving privateis more than just an ordinary war movie its realism makes it important to watch for the entire world it shows the horrors of war in a very direct way it is mainly important to see for the young generation these days and those to come sure you can watch tons of documentaries and read dozens of books but watching this movie is the closest you can get to the real thing its that realisticthe first 30 minutes is a real wake up call the normandy invasion is really impressive and made very realistic with lots of noise and body parts flying around the cinematography and the sound makes you feel like you are right in the middle of it yes after that the movie becomes a bit slow but it never becomes uninteresting the movie takes its time to build up the characters as a result there follow some typical spielberg sentiments but in this case ill forgive him for that i even forgive him for some of the american patriotism he puts in the moviethe dday landing isnt the only impressive thing about this movie all of the battle sequences are filmed in an unique and very realistic way the final battle is very tense especially in the beginning when the tension gets build up right before the battle begins and you can hear the tanks approaching while the men nervously await my heartbeat went at least 3 times faster than normali also like the portrayal of the german soldiers in most other earlier movies they were portrayed as the ultimate bad guys that love to march and kill and follow every order they receive without thinking for them selves in they are more portrayed as just soldiers sure they do some bad things in the movie but so do the american soldiers shooting surrendering germans for instance show that there are no real good guys in war which is very close to the truth i thinkthe characters are very realistic with real emotions it also doesnt matter in the movie if youre a main character or the most interesting character of the movie just like in real life everybody is vulnerable the characters are wonderfully portrayed by an at the time and still relatively unknown cast with the exception of tom hanks and matt damon of coursethe movie and its style set the standards for many later war movies to come but none of them comes really close to this masterpiece1010httpbobafett1138blogspotcom,reality
steven spielbergs is one of spielbergs greatest masterpieces and i loved it  it affected me like no other war film since apocalypse now which is saying something  spielberg always makes great war films and this is his best yet he also won his second oscar for his direction  with violent yet necessary war sequences photographed by oscar winner kaminski and some better than average acting by tom hanks and a great cast this film will make you think twice about world war 2  the best film of 1998,reality
what an epic war filmthat first 20 minutes alone is worth an oscar if theres any war film that evokes brutality and emotionally making u feel every moment of death this film succeeds in all of this brilliantly acted by tom hanks and brilliantly directed by steven spielbergworth a watch,reality
growing up in the golden age era of war films i have always had a glamorized idea of soldiering i remember as a child watching a soldier get hit and his telling his buddies go on without me and quietly passing on changed all that for me the use of sound in this movie truly puts the viewer into the action the sounds of bullets and explosions combined with the graphic but true to life reactions of soldiers being hit makes the horror of war seem very real to those of us who have never served in combat screams of soldiers for their mothers soldiers in shock picking up their own limbs and soldiers being vaporized by explosions are all too real no film before or since has had the same affect on a viewer every american should be required to watch this film in history class to be given a realistic understanding of the sacrifices that so many made in protecting our freedom,reality
as always spielberg at its finest in order for someone to be able to fully encapsulate all the emotions and little aspects involved in war one has to be out of this war all the scenes in the movie were crafted in such a way that viewers get the ability to feel the psychology of those who go through war blood scenes including the cruelty of war give you the insight of real war where everyone is ready to kill and fight till they die amazing work from the perspective of cinematography however the scenario is somehow weak they could have picked a better one that will convey more meaning good movie overall,reality
from the beginning on the graveyard to the end on the bridge a goddamm great movie,reality

this film is absolutely brilliant it is a must watch for anyone who likes war films even if you arent too keen on them you should still watch it it would be a mistake to miss it it has some very good action scenes that hit hard and leave you wanting more and some extreme tension later on in the film the opening scene on omaha beach still stands as one of the best openings to date it manages to make you care about almost all of the characters it follows it will even make you care about vin diesal thats an achievement right there if you have seen band of brothers but not this film you owe it to yourself to watch this if you have seen this film and enjoyed a lot much like i did check out hbos band of brothers mini series it is fantastic,reality
a single death is a tragedy a million deaths is a statistic joseph stalin the most renowned war epic of modern times and perhaps all times exemplifies this quote quite well though not perfectly now im sure that the normandy invasion sequence was extremely emotional for those who were present for it or who had relatives and friends die in the attack but for the rest of the audience i would expect that the following scene that tells of the three brothers deaths was more striking sometimes i feel bad when i watch movies depicting tragedy like this one because i dont always feel for the characters sufferings i know im supposed to but it just doesnt always happen i only share this because there are probably people who feel the same way and maybe it will help them make sense of their own lack of sympathythat aside i can see why this is held in such high regard it has great visual and audio quality in the battle scenes an allstar ensemble multiple emotionally charged characters historical significance a simple plot decent character development and an above average script that is translated proficiently on camera by spielberg none of these made watching it a great experience it certainly didnt top any of my lists and was frankly rather forgettable but i was still able to appreciate it for what it was but part of appreciating it is having ties to the war itself which is something that cannot be gained intentionallythere could probably have been less minor characters included had they been based on real people or generated conflict or been more important to the thru line i wouldnt say this but there got to be too many of them you recognize each one and get to know them a little but are never thinking about them when they arent on screen its a little disappointing but probably intentional that private gets more character than most of millers soldiers in about a third of the amount of screen timeif youre concerned about it being american patriotic propaganda i wouldnt watch it if youre going to be trying to pick out propaganda the vast majority of it is subtle the characters question their mission but never once question the war as a whole privates aversion to going home is more blatant as are the voiceover letters to soldiers families the portrayal of the one german soldier might put some people off he isnt portrayed as evil but you could argue that he is made an object of ridicule for the audiencedont watch this if you dont like long run times the scenes are put to good use but the movie as a whole could easily have been made shorter and retained its quality ill let you make your own decision on whether to watch the normandy invasion but be warned that it is very gory and uncompromising in its depiction if you like any of the actors expect a good performance from them but dont expect that to make it a great movie for you there are some slow parts so dont choose this if youre looking for action prospective viewers looking to make a career in making action movies and special effects should definitely watch this or at least study the dday invasion scene and the climax overall rating 8310,reality
steven spielbergs gripping epic was a film that went to great lengths to accurately depict the events of wwii the 1998 best picture winner starring tom hanks matt damon and a great ensemble cast tells the story of the sacrifice of many for the one conveying the message of brotherhood and sacrifice spielberg drove the message home through his grand wwii epic opens with the allied invasion of normandy with an intensely elaborate 12minute scene in which spielberg captures the essence of war with incredible accuracy during the invasion two brothers are killed along with many others previously a third brother was killed as well and thankfully a sharpeyed stenographer noticed that the mother mrs amanda boxer would be receiving all three telegraphs informing her of her 3 sons deaths on the same day when the army general george c marshall harve presnell learns of a fourth enlisted brother he takes the opportunity to alleviate the mothers stress and find the fourth brother and return him home safely to his family marshall assembles a group of 8 men on a death defying mission to find private and get him to safety i will doubtfully never tire of a film told backward as was we first meet an elderly gentleman that we later find out is presentday private visiting arlington national cemetery with his family spielberg especially uses this technique to its full capacity in this film allowing the audience to see how much sacrifice is worth when we see a trove of people that wouldnt have been possible without the mission to save private the opening battle scene with the invasion of normandy was obviously intense and gripping spielberg went to great lengths to ensure the films realism even down to the positioning of bodys on the beach on a much lighter note it was fun to see the cameos that were frequent and unexpected throughout the movie we see ted danson and bryan cranston with bit parts in the film and unexpected big name cameos that dont distract from the story are always fun there were several scenes with great use of characters storytelling throughout the film this device was well utilized and helped distract from how much the film slowed down in the middle or how needlessly long some of the battle scenes were i typically find spielberg films over the top and just aiming too hard for the jugular of the audience was probably doing those things too but it was a better film in spite of it than some other spielberg productions,reality
this in my opinion is the only film that captures the true nature of war films often glorify war exposes the beast for what it truly is the first five minutes of the landings are the best example of the second world war for what it truly was the sacrifice and the suffering that was felt by men on both sides and what the effects where on the survivors as ever hanks delivers a fantastic performance that is both believable and gripping the supporting actors at first appear distant but the film creates a bond between the viewer and the men involved as we experience the same events as they do that exposes us to their incredible story the film also stimulates a debate was it right for the lives of several men for the life of a last brother through this the film shows the true sacrifice that comes with war best war film ever,reality
1998 dir steven spielberg  cast tom hanks matt damon edward burns tom sizemore barry pepper superbly crafted war film about the value of a single human being three out of four brothers die in the war 1914 while the fourth was a paratrooper deemed lost private james is still alive and tom hanks is ordered to bring troops in to extreme danger to bring him home at the request of his mother the first 25 minutes are horrifyingly realistic as distorted bodies pile up on the omaha beach director by steven spielberg details the reality of surviving an explosion only to discover that your legs are missing this can easily play double billing with his schindlers list tom hanks delivers an excellent performance as captain miller who leads the mission and is committed to life itself matt damon is well cast as james who makes a turn for the good of others edward burns tom sizemore and barry pepper are also featured among the squadron the problem is that most of these supporting roles are cardboard types that are always overshadowed by the two leads even the scene where an enemy is saved only to later gun one of them down how likely is it for that same enemy to turn up again with someone set to avenge his act featuring some of the best war footage ever shot with a strong human story of havoc heroism and the value of human life score 9   10,reality
this is such a spielberg movie such a hollywood blockbuster such a wwii drama i cant even all the cheesy dialogues the sentimental scenes the horror of the war the pathetic american nationalism with the movie beginning and finishing with a take of the american flag the old war veteran speaking to the grave all the possible war tropes the nice guy who is afraid of killing the highly moral doctor the macho vin diesel the jew fighting against germans the rebel who doesnt follow the captains orders and of course the heroic brave captain ive seen these a million times though probably never as well puttogether as in so i guess you could say that it is among its kind the best even if im not a fan of that kindthe opening scene is a whole different story though the normandy landing is quite masterly filmed and it probably ranks among the best opening scenes ever cant really think of any other opening scene as memorable its cruel bloody and impressivethe ending on the other hand really put me down everything was so clich and whats up with the allied troops ending thanks to the lastminute nevermentioned help of the air force script writers take note never let the plot be solved by an element that you never mentioned to the public nothing creaks the illusion of reality as much,reality
recently war movies have aroused great interest accordingly a plethora of this sort of movies has invaded our cinemas maybe the two most popular war movies in recent years have been directed by steven spielberg focused on the normandy landings and flags of our fathers directed by clint eastwood focused on the battle of iwo jima together with letters from iwo jima the japanese view of the conflict whose premiere in spain will be held in few weeks both films show bloody scenes of fights and as a result the cruelty of the war in addition a large part of both films is focused on the miseries and attitudes towards death danger and desperation of a small group of soldiers also common to both films is the fact that the main characters are actually antiheroes the spielbergs film takes place mostly in the battlefield and is perfectly linear on the other hand flashbacks are used in flags of our fathers in order to show both the war and the propaganda campaign undertaken by the main characters going across the united states by virtue of this we can see a different drama in this film related to the feelings and problems of the soldiers when they come back home to undertake a mission they have not been trained for furthermore we clearly identify with the leading actor in tom hanks on the contrary the three actors in eastwoods film actually share the prominence the strength of lies in the intense representation of the war and it is a typical war film maybe better than others but a war film nevertheless however flags of our fathers is more complex with his usual skill eastwood shows a combination of war and politics death and propaganda,reality
this film is one of my favorite movies of all time there are so many great actors such as tom hanks tom sizemore damon diesel burns just to name a few it was a great movie that really had a great group of actors who put on such a great performance i gave this movie a 10 out of 10 because the performances that were given as well as a good script and director this is one for the history books and every time i watch this movie it makes me more proud to be an american i appreciate the brave lives that were given to defend our country i think it had a great beginning middle and end with an outstanding performance i especially liked how the movie ended with private at the grave of his fellow soldier,reality
everything in this movie was great the camera work special effects and the scripts the most gruesome scene is by far the opening beach assault scene in the movie as it was very realisticaction packed and made your stomach turn its characters like pvtjackson that movies like this great especially with his bible quoting and inch perfect shots the other most significant character in the movie for me is captain miller captain miler the school teacher is perhaps one of the most inspiring people for me personally his leadership awareness and overall calmness is amazing this is perhaps spielbergs best ever moviedebatable and it will always be in my personnel top 10 because of its realism and one of its main themes the basis of war,reality

tom hanks and steven spielberg have proved many times that they have a great deep respect and understanding of war and the ones who fight on either side and this along with band of brothers is probably the best on screen portrayal of war that ive seen personallythe opening sequence of captain john miller tom hanks and the rest of the army rangers landing on omaha beach is one of the most jaw dropping openings ever put into film i still remember my reaction to the opening scene when i first watched this and i was literally stunned when they show the soldiers in the boats immediately getting struck by bullets the moment the doors open up the rest of the battle sequences are filmed with so much authentic realism and are never seem glorified in the slightest and the final battle is one of the most intense nail biting battle sequences ive ever seen a lot of detail was put into the locations and the american and german army uniforms and tanks the sound design and the camera movements by spielberg make you feel like youre right in the middle of the action this is one of those times where shaky cam can be used with skill given that its set in the middle of a war zonestory wise its very well done captain miller and his men are sent deep into german occupied normandy to look for private james of the 101st airborne division after his 3 brothers are killed in combat elsewhere in the war and they question why they should even bother going along with it up until you meet james and get to know him the movie does a good job of posing the question why should we sacrifice all these lives for just one man i dont know the answer to that question but it seems to me that when they meet him at the final act they see what kind of person he is and they decide hes worth saving and literally go through hell to ensure his safetyas for the castcharacters each character gets their own moment to shine even if its not that long this is one of tom hanks best performances and the scene where he breaks down after losing wade shows you how great of an actor this guy is matt damon is the best actor they couldve chosen as private james even if hes not in it that much edward burns character gets on my nerves a bit on how big of an ahole he is until the end when he decides to help private in the end tom sizemore is really funny giovanni ribisi and barry pepper are very good in their parts as is vin diesel surprisingly as for upham jeremy davies a lot of people hate his character since he didnt rescue mellish from being stabbed in the chest by a german soldier and while i do agree that he shouldve helped at the same time i cant really blame him for being scared the way he was ive been in the national guard for the last two years though ive never been in combat but i can tell you that not everybody is going to look and act like the terminator when theyre put into a life threatening situation some people just cant deal with that plus i found it pretty satisfying when he shoots the same german soldier in the end not only for mellish but also in response to shooting captain millerand another thing ive appreciated is how the movie doesnt portray the germans as monsters the story is told from an american perspective and dont really focus on the german side on the war and even though there were some who truly believed in nazism most of the germans were just human beings like you and i they were just doing what they were told fighting for their country family and fellow comradeseven though a lot of directors have done this with their movies spielberg has this cool way of pulling all these familiar faces out of thin air into his movies even if its for a brief amount of time bryan cranston from breaking bad is in here as a fan of the show i get all giddy whenever hes on screen ted danson paul giamatti dale dye leland orser the late dennis farina and fans of joss whedons firefly will pleased to see nathan fillion in this movie even if its only for about 3 minutesin the end this is one of my all time favorite movies and probably my favorite war film by far it has a well executed story well realized characters intense battle scenes a great musical score by the one and only john williams respect for the historical setting and finally the part where captain miller says to private earn this chokes me up every time i watch it spielberg has done great work before and after he made this movie but he really outdoes himself with this one,reality

three brothers have been killed in the line of duty all within days of each other the fourth brother is somewhere in normandy orders come from the highest level to bring him home improbable as the scenario may be this provides the setup for one of the best war movies ever madefirst off is one of the most realistic portrayals of combat ive ever seen it pulls no punches when it comes to the sheer brutality of war the opening assault on omaha beach was possibly the bloodiest sequence filmed up to that time and the subsequent engagements have no shortage of carnage either but this is no splatterfest while it doesnt shy away from the blood and gore it doesnt dwell on them either the violence is here because thats what war is like not for shock valuethe same approach is taken with the numerous death scenes when a member of the team is killed the movie doesnt just move on and say oh well it makes you feel for the deceased and for his comrades yet it never falls to the level of melodrama there are no halfbaked dying speeches nothing about how he was supporting six kids who will now be left on the street and yes i have seen that line used although it was in the context of a mining collapse also deals with the thoughts and emotions of ordinary men thrust into war the men of the second rangers battle hardened though they may be are not career soldiers they answered the call of duty but more than anything else they just want the war to end so they can go home alive every time captain miller tom hanks loses a man he consoles himself that one life was given so that two or three or ten could be saved that the war is bigger than one man but this time the mission is about one man a man they cant even be sure is still alive it is a testament to these mens courage and sense of duty that they continue on a dangerous mission that few of them believe inas for captain miller he is quite likely hanks best role since forrest gump hes quiet and reserved to the point that theres a 300 prize for guessing his hometown but he knows what hes doing and cares about the men under his command he is ever the example for the men never complaining or expressing doubts in front of the men he praises them when they do well tells it to them in no uncertain terms when they screw up and does whatever he has to to keep them focused on their mission even if deep down he thinks the whole thing is fubar and when hes given the choice between returning to headquarters his objective achieved or risking everything to make a stand against long odds he makes the right decisionand in the end when the now aged james stands over the graves of the men who died to save him it was one of the most moving uplifting cinematic experiences ive had spielberg and hanks have created not only a gripping war film but a fitting tribute to the american soldier,reality
a few years after winning his first oscar for his best movie schindlers list spielberg wins his second best directing oscar for his next war epic arguably the greatest war movie of all time in my opinion this is tied with apocalypse now as the best both are fantastic war movies but theyre too different to really pick which is better but i do agree when people say this should have won the oscar for best picture my favourite movie of the year was american history x but was a better piece of film the movie that beat shakespeare in love was a great and deserving flick but not as deserving as thisthis movie has a very simple concept a war captain hanks leads a group of eight soldiers in the normandy invasion during the second world war to rescue a private damon and bring him back to his mother the closer the group gets the deadlier the mission becomes with the men dying one by one why are eight men risking their lives just to save one best war movie or not this is the most realistic bar none the camera is shaky and distorted to capture the most realistic experience possible even more realistic than schindlers list so much that it looks like actual found footage that is what makes the movie so brilliant and so disturbing the deadlier the mission becomes the more exciting the movie gets a fascinating tale of courage and heroism the end result will leave you clapping with joy,reality
is technically excellent it achieved what very few films do  it set a new benchmark the films harsh aesthetic and desaturated colour palette has been emulated many timess influence can be seen in films from we were soldiers 2002 and rambo 2008 to black hawk down 2001 and fury 2014 although there have been some decent efforts i am yet to see a film that equals let alone surpasses the beginning 25 minutes the final battle in the fictional french town of ramelle and everything in betweenthe film follows the 2nd ranger battalion the salient characters of which including captain john miller tom hanks the affable yet authoritative leader sergeant horvath tom sizemore the platoons second in command private jackson barry pepper a stylishly ultra accurate cross kissing sniper from the bible belt private reiben edward burns an incendiary man from brooklyn private mellish adam goldberg a jew who relishes informing german captives of his heritage and t4 grade timothy upham jeremy davies a very timid man who proves wholly unsuited to war the mens mission is to locate and send home private james matt damon on the compassionate orders of chief of staff george marshall who has been informed thats three brothers have all died in combat their mother receiving the three telegrams simultaneouslyyou wanna explain the math of this to me i mean wheres the sense of riskin the lives of the eight of us to save one guy says the argumentative private reiben he addresses what im sure many viewers were wondering  is this premise plausible although inspired by and probably keen to emulate lincolns bixby letter would george marshall have really possessed such compassion during a state of total war its interesting to note that screenwriter robert rodat developed the idea after reading a monument in putney corners new hampshire that listed the names of eight brothers who died during the american civil warunlike brad pitt in the recent fury tom hanks gives the performance of an everyday man a middleclass secondary school teacher thrust into an extraordinary situation hanks character captain miller reminds you of what is now the unthinkable idea of conscription reminds you of how civilians with little or no prior interest ability or training in the army were mobilised to kill and conquer theres not much to be found outside of captain miller in terms of characterisation however millers men are quite flat and unremarkable apart from private jackson whose ultraaccuracy is displayed with a stylish flair thats out of character in a film whose violence is appropriately ugly jackson is also a good ol boy a selfrighteous bible spouting stock character who was recently emulated by shia labeouf as boyd bible swan in furywhat i also found slightly troubling was the construction of the germans it was somewhat crude of the countless german troops we see in the film the only one that is given any depth steamboat willie joerg stadler is shown to be a horribly callous backstabber although considering the context of total war some may argue that he was just a soldier doing his duty the narrative arcs of willie and upham the coward of the platoon intertwine climaxing in a scene that i think is ethically dubiousdespite both narrative and character development being somewhat thinly drawn theyre not that bad and crucially not the centre of the film the films great accomplishment lies in its seminal depiction of warfare cinematographer janusz kaminski is to be commended for his raw grisly aesthetic and his perfectly judged use of erratic camera movement a style that has been messily emulated to nauseainducing effect far too many timeslike many others have i could praise endlessly the new level of gripping realist cinema that introduced to viewers however almost all of this commendation is being delivered by people who have never experienced battle how do we know what a battle truly looks and feels like the majority of what i witnessed seemed realistic to me but i cant offer solid corroboration as i stepped foot on omaha beach 70 years too late surely the ultimate endorsement and affirmation for saving privates authenticity is from the people who have experienced warwritten in the florida times union on 15th august 1998 was an account of dday veterans enduring this included bill faust 78 who was accompanied in the theatre by only one other as the rest of his north florida dday veterans group walked out  i should have never gone to see that damn movie faust said in my mind most of the details of dday were gone all this did was bring them back its better to keep them tucked away where they dont bother youthe article continues  vietnam veteran ed kelly 57 left before the opening scene was over  i just couldnt handle it kelly said the kid holding his guts i had seen that in vietnam that was it for me i got up and walked out it was the closest thing to the horrors of real combat that i have ever seenthere was also jerry markham 79 who walked out of the theatre impressed and depressed amazed but saddened by the realism of the sights and sounds especially the instant deaths after the landing craft ramps were lowered markham was a navy chief petty officer on a demolitions team on dday and saw his commanding officer die this way  that scene broke me up that was how it happened bodies were flying everywhere i wouldnt recommend it for young children but anyone 14 15 or older should see it they should start learning about how horrible war is i think all of this speaks volumes for saving privates credibility90for the full travel

great war movie saw it listed as a documentary which it is not based on a small kernel of truth 90 of the movie is fiction there was no trek across france nor any battles to retrieve niland  the real pvtdont get me wrong i am not complaining but fiction is fiction usually with a hefty dose of drama and ton hanks portrayal of the captain in charge of the group sent to find and bring back is great all the supporting cast is also great the action scenes are superb i particularly liked the scenes of the armour halftracks tanks etc however this is still a work of fiction to call it a documentary does a disservice to filmmakers and servicemen alike,reality

loved this movie great acting and a great story a powerful and realistic recreation of wwiis dday invasion and the immediate aftermath spielberg does an amazing job with this movie although there is a lot of blood and guts it makes it more real tom hanks is one of todays great actors he did an amazing job in the movie the start of the movie is hard to watch at times however it makes it so real and puts you in the place of the soldiers the special affects and sound make the movie seem more real too goes beyond technical dazzlement to put a new indelibly terrible face on war it makes you realize what they went though for our freedom,reality
if it is possible to make a majestic film about a hellish war steven spielberg has done so with spielberg beautifully blends the arts of filmmaking and storytelling with such an accomplished director at the helm it is no surprise that this is such a technically proficient film that it looks so spectacular so real but this film is so much more than the stunning often horrifying visuals this is a film with a magnificent inspiring story and spielberg tells that story so well taking you through the emotional wringer tom hanks leads an outstanding cast janusz kaminskis cinematography is breathtaking john williams provides a powerful and at times haunting score and credit must also go to screenwriter robert rodat whose story is so incredibly compelling so many people contributing so brilliantly to an absolutely fascinating film everyone did their part and spielberg put all the pieces together perfectlythe film begins on dday with the normandy invasion which of course could be an entire film in and of itself this sequence is unrelenting spielberg sparing nothing in his depiction of the inconceivable violence on omaha beach never has any film so brutally illustrated that war is indeed hell thousands of men bravely face what for so many must seem to be a certain death as the bodies fall and blood turns the sea red captain john miller continues to push his company forward they make a critical breakthrough but at such cost miller and we look down at the carnage below on the beach so many men lay there having made the ultimate sacrifice the camera focuses in on one of the dead on his backpack we see the name s and we know that this film even as it tells the tale of a conflict which engulfed the whole world is going to tell a very personal storythe we see lying on the beach is one of three brothers killed in action a fourth brother james is missing in action having parachuted behind german lines from washington comes a very unusual but very clear order captain john miller is to find james and send him home miller assembles a small unit from his company eight men will go out into the french countryside still occupied by germans mind you to find and save private eight men will risk their lives to save one suffice to say not all of the eight are particularly happy with this assignment but orders are orders and off the men go into the great unknown no simple mission this danger lurks at every turn spielberg ratchets up the tension keeping you on the edge of your seat you care so much about these men because spielberg certainly with a great assist from screenwriter rodat has done such a fine job of allowing you to know them these characters come fully formed you feel you know them really understand them almost from the moment you first meet them so many different personalities in the group credit of course must go to the actors portraying the squad the performers bring these soldiers brilliantly to life hanks is the star the leader and he is excellent but the other actors match him stride for stride tom sizemore edward burns barry pepper adam goldberg vin diesel giovanni ribisi and jeremy daviesnone put a foot wrong an amazing cast which does justice to an amazing storyit is the story which really sets this film apart it is a film about war but really it is a film about one man but maybe that one man is not private plays his part but is this story really about captain miller an ordinary man thrust into an extraordinary situation a leader of men doing his duty doing whatever is necessary to get his men and himself home hanks does such a terrific job portraying this man who remains an enigma even to his own men sometimes you get the sense he is an enigma to himself he has lost the sense of who he is or at least who he used to be war will do that to you the worldwide conflict is ultimately fought by individual men and spielberg allows you to get to know some of these men and miller and horvath reiben jackson mellish caparzo wade and upham each has his own story to tell and seeing each of their stories play out takes us back to the films opening to omaha beach so many men died there no film can tell every one of their stories but with this film spielberg has honored them all a film of staggering scope and awesome power but with a personal touch that did not win the best picture oscar is sad quite frankly absurd but honoring the film is not really important honoring the men who died so that we may be free is what really matters and this film does just that,reality
a beautifully sad war film  almost sounds like an oxymoron because there isnt anything beautiful about war yet a film like shows the rare beauty in humans in times of warthe movie seems to be heartfelt by all the actors because each played their roles so emotionally  as if the movie was their reality i guess that is what makes a great actor they tend to experience or act out very well real emotions while making a filmthe ugly reality of war is seen throughout the movie and is heartpounding action during those scenesthe ending of this film will bring a grown man to tears in fact anyone to tears that has a heart9510,reality
film review of saving privatethe film 1998 is a masterful period piece on the life of a select group of american soldiers during and shortly after the normandy invasion in world war ii the films plot is based on a small force of soldiers assigned to go behind enemy lines to find and bring home a young soldier whose family has lost all of their other sons to the war effort their interpersonal conflicts thoughts and physical efforts to fulfill this duty provide a gripping emotional and action packed film the theme revolves around the sacrifices of men during war to accomplish difficult if not seemingly impossible assignments and goals the viewer of this film experiences the personal point of view of the main character capt miller tom hanks during this battle and assignment we see a range of emotional and physical acts of courage strength and fear that each soldier exhibits as he battles toward the front lines since the majority of viewers did not take part in this war the film brings to light many of the horrors of war along with the exceptional responses humans are capable of producing during such times the men that fought this fight had to be overwhelmed and horrified to watch their comrades die as well as for the majority experiencing killing for the first time spielbergs directing and the acting of the main actors relay the realism emotions and fears of war to the audience director steven spielberg creates an exciting adventure film with the use of different cameras angles and points of view the use of the flashback point of view of pt matt damon from the initial scene in the cemetery throughout the film is a pivotal technique for continuity and emotional impact the sound effects and surround sound evoke a strong and emotional response by adding realism the lead characters capt john miller tom hanks sgt horvath tom sizemore pt reiben edward burns pt jackson barry pepper pt mellish adam goldberg t4 medic wade giovanni ribisi and corporal upham jeremy davies all delivered believable performances with examples of the varying personalities any group under extremely trying circumstances would exhibit captain miller is the lead character commanding his team through many difficult obstacles this team had not only enemies to fight but at times each other the interplay between the characters adds interest and depth to this film again revealing the theme of sacrifice as each character struggles with the amount of sacrifice he is willing to make to complete the assignment of saving pt tom hanks again progresses in his acting depth by taking on an intensely dramatic role his performance is an excellent mix of intensity frustration and caring that will mark this piece as one of his best thus far is a fictional piece but based on true events from wwii where three sons in one family were killed within a one week period the united states war department then sent a group of soldiers to try and find a fourth son before he too was killed post wwii the fighting sullivans 1944 was another film in a similar theme based on the true story of five brothers all dying when their battleship the us juneau sank wwwhistorynavymilfaqsfaq721htm the director and actors brought realism to this story and the entire film spielberg and hanks along with the rest of the cast draw on skill and emotions to reveal the core of human strength in times of sacrifice and war in while the film is long almost three hours it is well worth the viewing and highly recommended,reality
steven spielbergs is the best war movie ever made of the emotional impact and the excellent shooting scenes the most emotional scene is the very beginning because of dday and the massive amount of casualties of war the movie stars tom hanks as captain john miller who unfortunately did not win an oscar for this movie when he really should have won director steven spielberg has crafted his best movie since his first oscar winning turn since his 1993 holocaust movie schindlers list also in the movie there were a lot of other good performances from matt damon tom sizemore edward burns and vin diesel this movie goes on a par with war film classics such as black hawk down patton the deer hunter platoon sands of iwo jima flags of our fathers the devils brigade and 633 squadron another reason why this movie was great is because the shooting scenes looked so realistic this is a triumph that is the best movie of 1998,reality
opens with a 30minute cinematic tour de force that is without a doubt one of the finest halfhours ever committed to film this sequence a soldierseye view of the dday invasion of normandy is brilliant not only in terms of technique but in the depth of viewer reaction it generates it is certainly the most violent gory visceral depiction of war that i have ever witnessed on screen spielberg spares the viewer nothing of the horrors of battle using every tactic at his disposal to convey the chaos and senseless waste that lies at the core of any engagement we are presented with unforgettable bloody images of bodies being cut to pieces by bullets limbs blown off entrails spilling out and a variety of other assorted examples of carnage and when the tide comes in with the waves breaking on the bodystrewn beach the water is crimson those who are at all squeamish will find the opening of unbearableits a condemnation of war wrapped in a tale of human courage and sacrifice captain john miller tom hanks a hero and survivor of the omaha beach battle is chosen to lead the team of eight men whose goal is in millers words like finding a needle in a stack of needles his hand picked team includes six men who have served with him throughout the war the supporting cast is uniformly excellent these are a cast of characters who are unforgettable and the film takes the time to flesh them out and let the audience interact with them in their journey to findis a powerful experience im sure a lot of people will weep during it spielberg knows how to make audiences weep this film embodies ideas after the immediate experience begins to fade the implications remain and growthe films central question when is one life more important than another is never really answered for those who are willing to brave the movies shocking and unforgettable images offers a singular motion picture experience,reality
captain miller tom hanks and his men land in normandy on dday the group is ordered to find a private afters brothers are all found to have been killed in actiondirector steven spielberg creates some of the most thrilling action sequences in a movie the dday landing at the start is some of the most visceral realistic war action ever it is unforgettable the movie is bookended with heart stopping war action the final battle is just as epic the hand to hand fight with private mellish is devastating the goal doesnt have the same epic scale although it does have the sense of poetry which spielberg often likes to inject the only minor objection is the mission which strikes a different tone from the unrelenting realism of the opening landing,reality

erwin rommel is hardly the one to blame for mistakes made by the nazis in the assumption that normandy would be to blame for the landing there rather than at the pas de calais that was the one thing that ike eisenhower and the command staff should receive great credit for all they did to deceive hitler rommel is still characterized as the one of two geniuses in the wehrmacht the other being von runstedt and his development of the blitzkreig which was so successful in france and the beginnings of the fatal mistake of invading the soviet union in fact rommel was convinced that just as in the salerno invasion the troops would come ashore in normandy and in so believing he vastly made the invasion more deadly by increasing normandy beach hazards and in flooding the landing spots for airborneglider landings and this is a great film in spite of the fact that tom hanks simply has to play the very role of the great hero general norman cota the eldest american on omaha beach and the leader of the breakout with such brave leadership and by using the rarely used bangalore torpedoes to shatter the second strand of barbed wire and leading the troops to great valor with his leadership my only regret about the film was the failure to credit general cota somehow in the breakthrough to the murderous machine gun fire,reality
by steven spielberg to the question what is your favorite movie or what movie you have seen many times the first movie title which comes up to my mind is by steven spielberg the movie won 5 oskar it is the best movie about second world war which was shooting by american cinematography i saw spr on tv the cable tv which we had back home was translating a lot of international movies american movies are one of the best the whole world knows about american movies big budgets filming skills and actors are best in america by those criteria spr caught my attention and dipped me into the atmosphere of bloody war the film is about american soldiers encounter with german forces at the coast line during the first day of dday american army organized with allies a massive landing on the normandy beach north france also thousands of paratroopers landed into deep into center of france the story begins with scene where private shown as already old man who is walking with his family at soldiers cemetery came to honor the memory to the significant person of his life the person who saved his life the price which was the dead life of whole rescue group the interesting part begins after first scene the picture quickly changes from silent soldiers cemetery where the grass is green sky is blue and people wearing bright colored cloth to the normandy beach in 1944th before year of victory france was still occupied and controlled by germannazi army germans built a massive defensive line along all france beach territory defenders set up a big number of bunkers and fences on the beach all that picture of war was presented in high quality massacre begins with lending american troops to the beach where germans starts to shoot them american forces loses thousands of people under the machinegun fire during the first hours of landing on omaha beach that how was named that sector the main actors are identified at the moment when camera showing american troopers sailing to the beach and that entire scene follows captain millers squad,reality
when the captain in charge of the typing pool brings the three telegrams to his colonel the map behind the colonel is a mercator projection of the world split at the international date line mercator projections in 1944 would have placed north america in the center and divided the eurasian continent equally on both sides the decision to split the map at the international date line wasnt officially made until the national geographic society decreed it in 1988when the soldiers are at the seawall during the dday scene miller explains to horvath that dog 1 exit is to the west right after that the soldier behind miller with the bar leans up on him and shouts theyre killing us because we dont have chance and that aint fair when he is saying chance the camera changes angles and the soldier who was yelling is facing the seawall and not even talking even though and that aint fair is still being said,reality
what is war about to win it to represent yourself as the better and stronger country policy origin what exactly hid in that hideous scenario of world war 2 own conflicts of soldiers and the life of a single individual james francis from iowa a life for many deserves a mans life when it has to be more a question for some of the soldiers doubt whose life is worth more they wonder that one of their fighting men or a desperate enemy of the results shows a new impression in the second world war and illustrates how the soldiers were eaten up the mental images of decisions the sense of justice and balance policy does not matter its a story about the soldiers and just about them with all their strengths fears and weaknesses but each with his own spielberg shows how cruel and dirty the time of the second world war with excellent performance and proves that there isnt just indiana jones and jaws in him but still completely different surprises,reality
breathtaking no doubt it was really how do i say this graphic and realistic it made me feel how ww2 affected soldiers like the ones in the movie it also taught me war was more bloody and gory not what i see in movies like apocalypse now or the longest day id also praise the actors performance they seemed to have the right emotions and i could tell each and every single character personality but somewhat i have lots of questions i have lots to ask but heres one how was it possible thats mother managed to get contact of her sons deaths in only days after they died how did they even know sean peter or daniel died in the first place many other plot holes i didnt get so i gave this film a 910 thanks for reading,reality
if god is for us who could be against us the recreation of the normandy beach invasion is an american monument to bravery and valor this everlasting memory raises this almost propagandaesque drama to represent the second world war for many encompassing idealism each battle is in turn more personal especially as our troops move forward towards victory spielberg places us in the middle of treachery using t he staff translator as our untested ears and eyes i believe this is speilbergs sincere thank you to wwii veterans shows regular young men being extraordinary yet a moral dilemma of one mans life being worth many others will always remain at the heart of the film a truly worthy battalion of actors were chosen and the battle cinematography was horrifyingly breathtaking,reality

the beginning scene at the grave is well done in that it doesnt give away whose grave it is nor who the old man isthe dday battle was grotesque horrible chaotic and raw  a great portrayal of how ugly war can get and how horrible this particular invasion was i felt this scene was one of the best war scenes ive ever seen in a film and just for that i feel this movie deserves acclaimthe hopelessness and evil of war was well done but i felt that things slowed drastically after the initial battle scene the rest of the movie moved a bit slow for me and the ending was not the great for me the beginning scene though is what saved the film,reality
this movie goes directly in depth with actual views of the war it is a very strong and emotional movie that should be seen to see the full effects of war and the toll it has on a persons mental stabilitywarning the following text contains spoilersthere are many heartwrenching moments in this movie like the death of most of the rescue squad at the ending of the movie most of the characters also have a background like miller who is a teacher before being dragged into the warall in all the movie is terrific and i give it a full 1010 one of spielbergs best,reality
removing the halfhour normandy scene that is so gorgeous and realistic  removing the first halfhour of normandy scene shows us the face of brutal war  captain miller and his soldiers to save a man what is the rationale to risk the lives of eight people and set out the question after arduous struggles to recover from a person is going to sacrifice many soldiers private captain john miller died and his life is affected by what you told him right on the bridge trying to  of course every human life is very important of course effort to save the life of a human being is the place many people are justified however later stages of the films ask ourselves the following questions  does every human being deserves to live german soldiers taken captive by digging pits to stay alive unless he knew he was going to die what a thoughtprovoking work to gain time is not it so no matter which side of human life how important  of course like i thought upham beginning  captain john miller thought so  but we have seen that in a future some people say that life is not so important  this means that some people do not deserve to live for akllanmadklar they should die  captain john miller captured but allowed to live by the freed us to think and question referred to the killing of german soldiers are shot dead by  directed by steven spielberg film that deserves a realistic production until the end of the oscars  10 out of 10 points,reality
this film really puts you in the scene of the dday beaches obviously with a amazing director such as steven spielberg who has directed my favourite films it was bound to be good but it really surprised me by how good it actually was the acting was great but with actors such as tom hanks and matt damon i expected none the less this film is very emotional as it makes you stop and think about the soldiers that died in dday it also has sad parts in it when friends die ect this film has amazingly realistic special effects and make up yet is quite gory i would recommend this to anyone who enjoys waraction films 1010 times,reality
im not quite sure how it has taken me almost 15 years to watch somehow i guess i just never got round to it well i finally did and was left with mixed feelingsfar more experienced movie critics and war experts than me have extolled the opening scene so theres little more that i can add its power to shock and sadden surpasses almost anything ive seen before it and for that alone the film has earned its place in movie historyof course the downside is that if it surpassed so much before it then it inevitably also surpassed the 100 or so minutes that followed it ill forgive that though ultimately in the story of the normandy beach landings the landings were the beginning and so although its not perfect from a movie perspective its the only way to tell it i did though find much of the rest of spr remarkably standard yes the acting was excellent however the characters were distinct caricatures the bitter jew the loyal lieutenant the brash new yorker and the good guy medic they were all finely portrayed but their characters brought nothing new to the screen it was only jeremy davies interpreter who could have come from superior war films such as platoon or full metal jacket or even the vastly different but more cerebral the thin red line which spr overshadowedmy other issue is the portrayal of those damn germans inglourious bastards revels in its over the top portrait of just about every german during wwii being satans sidekick however that film has its tongue firmly in cheek spr does not and the german soldier who is let free by tom hanks super hero captain hell be picked up soon enough and then returns as the face of the enemy is pure hollywood clichdont get me wrong spr was a fine film the opening is shocking and the remainder is thoroughly enjoyable the caricatures which prevented it from matching the greats also offer a large degree of comfort they allow us to feel like we know all these characters and emphasise with them immediately with little effort spielberg paints by numbers in the last battle scene though it being all too predictable to fully believe any battle in any war ever quite happened like that its for this reason that in the context of the great war films or the few ive seen to date id say it falls a little short,reality
this is a perfect film for those who want to watch a waraction film that shows the reality of war during world war 2 an easy to follow but still interesting plot leads no viewers confused or bored throughout the director was able to capture the violence and brutality of the film in the first 15 min of the film and is able to continue those themes tom hanks performance adds the the realism of the characters making them seem more like real people rather than hollywood action heroes but adding in an theme of unityband between the squad overall it is a film great for understanding the horrors of war and for its action however the plot does seem quite linear and is not very complex,reality
a war film unparalleled in almost every respect is framed by a presentday story about an elderly man visiting a military cemetery with his family he reaches a nondescript gravestone and falls to his knees uncontrollably weeping within this frame of reference is another set of bookends two unforgettable battle sequences like its epic world war ii film predecessorsthe longest day and a bridge too farfeatures a long list of key and supporting actors including tom hanks tom sizemore edward burns vin diesel giovanni ribisi matt damon ted danson paul giamatti dennis farina and bryan cranston also like its predecessors the featured actors who may or may not have served do justice to the material and pay tribute with earnest portrayals to the men who helped make their comfortable american lifestyles possible the first battle at omaha beech during the landings at normandy is staggeringly realistic in its brutal recreation of june 6 1944 the omnipresence of spielbergs documentarystyle camera assures us that the relentless intensity of that violent confrontation does not escape our attention even if no single viewpoint could have witnessed the totality of the carnage back in the states a woman in a government office typing sympathy letters to mothers of soldiers killed in action notices what appears to be a discrepancy but reveals itself as the premise of the plot a soldier named james has lost all three of his brothers in battle the order to find and secure his safe return home falls to captain john miller hanks who along with those members of his squad who have survived the landing embark on a rescue mission the value of which they question every step of the way writer robert rodat makes a valiant attempt to weave character development philosophy and humor into the actionoriented middle much of it succeeds some of it rings false the more effective moments of character revelation are in those scenes that are divorced momentarily from the action like the one that takes place in the ruins of the church or the one on the steps easily the most heartwrenching and gutwrenching scene finds medic irwin wade ribisi downed by gunfire surrounded by the group trying to tend to his wounds through his guidance he asks them for clinical descriptions of what they are seeing and feeling and then becomes anguished when he deduces that he has been hit in the liver they beg him to tell them how to fix him resigned to his fate he just asks for more morphine when we finally meet up with private damon he refuses to abandon the only brothers he has left there is some talk about conflicting orders and impossible decisions but it seems obvious what has to happen miller and his men will assists squad in securing the bridge before sending home the development ofs character is to say the least disappointing i have two brothers of my own and i find it hard to believe that a man even after two years of displacement would not be able to picture the faces of any of his brothers and the only story that he chooses to relate about his brothers and the only one we witness is frivolous emotionless and unfunny i also find uphams cowardly hesitation a bit difficult to comprehend as genuinely moving is his moment of redemption in the end what we learn about these men is that they are ordinary the emotions we feel at their passing are not for distinctly drawn sympathetic characters that we have come to know and lovewithout whom we cant bear to endure these overtaking emotions stem from our projections onto those real men who lost real lives in defense of our own therein lies the successful failure of whether intentional or not the noncommanding presence of its fictional characters paralleled by john williams brilliantly simplistic threenote theme leaves room for the audience to ponder and appreciate the quiet commonplace heroism of those average people who fought the actual war when captain miller tells private to earn this in a sense he is asking us to live our lives in a way that will earn the price paid by those bands of brothers who sacrificed it all,reality
war films have been made earlier and will be made till eternity but will have the image of what gandhi has today irony intended this has set a standard so high that i think it would nearly be impossible to have a portrayal better than this especially the first 30 minute scene now this first part is what the world recognized thoroughly and it deserves that but the second and the major part of the story is equally amazing the film captures the journey of a group of 8 people who set out to find out another of their comrade named james they have to travel all the way to him just to deliver the message that all his brothers are dead and that he is relieved from duty during their journey they encounter snipers moral dilemmas etc the idea of 8 people putting their lives at stake for just one person is an intriguing story and to supplement that you will see a hell lot of action this is a film not to be missedpros spielberg is a man who does things with huge perfection there are many ways to see this film one might see it as a nice action film in which people are assigned a task and they accomplish it by fighting a lot of people its the simplest way to put it but the other way to see it is in a question format first the question arises as to why 8 people were sent on a near suicide mission to find just one person why cant let the war finish and if he is alive let him be relieved but then here comes morality the superficial answer to the question is that the mother who has already lost 3 of her sons and so her only son should not be risked so in a way we are taking quantity to be the major factor in here the analytical reason to send them on such a mission is left to the viewer to decide on his own some might say that it is just a form of duty correct some will say that loss of 4 compared with loss of 1 or 2 is greater ok some might think that a person who has lost his three brothers is more eligible to leave the war than any other because his grief is higher ok so in a way this first question is a direct check on how you view rules of lives or your perception towards human decisions i would say this is a perfect question and portrayed in the best ways second question is direct and is asked by the team people themselves they are perfectly right in their thinking are their lives not as important as any other one who is fighting people who watched carefully from the starting and thought about the first question nicely they will be counter attacked by this phase of the film isnt it intriguing to have included the viewer so closely in a film during this second phase the team is under a lot of emotional turmoil they want to abandon the mission from this moment the third question starts which is  is doing the duty and obeying orders so important that you put your lives at risk while most will say to this question that they are doing the duty for the country but keeping myself in their positions i feel too much agitated about the objective of the mission why should i risk my life for this purpose none of them were reluctant in doing their duty for the country but the objective of this mission stirred them next we come across a very emotional moment when tom hanks says that he is doing this so that he completes the mission and can go home peacefully he says this line with so much emotion that you will forget everything about the three questions and look for yourselfthis film has everything for people of all ages it also has light humor at appropriate places the beauty of the war films is that you have a funny moment and just after that you come across a heartbroken statement after watching the film you will definitely get convinced that war changes people one other scene that i will never forget is the authentic knife fight between a us officer and a german officer that fight depicts what a person behaves in his last moments of death also i felt sad over the two strange people fighting and killing so ruthlessly just on some ordersalso i would like to explore the message of the film in detail tom hanks in his last moment says to  earn it these two words alone have a lot of depth the inner meaning of the word is that the life is wonderful one should make good use of itmessage earn your life verdict a must watch,reality
this movie is just amazing in a general sense the effects story sound everything one of my favorite movies ever made however this movie is definitely not for everyone the gore and violence is extremely present and may disturb some viewers also the ending is very emotional as are most deaths in this film the whole overtone of the movie is also extremely dreary and bleak a very good film though not for everyone but if you can handle it it is guaranteed to be one of the best movies you have ever seen this movie is right up there with other great films like the shawshank redemption the godfather and apocalypse now,reality
this film is absolutely amazing the mix of emotions and action scenes is perfect and the feel of the film is breathtaking there are so many different ways to explain how i felt watching the filmthe acting was also flawless each soldier have their own personality and the characters really stand out tom hanks played the leader role in his group and you can literally see his respect and care he has for his comrades as well as his leadership tom hanks isnt the only star of the film every actor was immaculate and perfect usually in war and action films parts can look fake when people are shot or blown up but i could not see one fault in this areathere is nothing bad about this film it really is that good it is simply amazingjust watch it and youll agree,reality

friends this is my first post im not a type of guy wholl sit to write a review for a movie not at all im too lazy for that but this movie has compelled me into writing all this this movie is simply awesomerather i would say its magicit just blew me awayspielberg is a magician he didnt make me see the movie he actually made me live it u can feel the characters their pain their sorrow everythinghe has shown it how movies should be madeand tom hanks u know what this man is capable of and he also truly has shown his class i think this movie needs no rating actually it can not be rated so just make sure u see for urself what a masterpiece it is,reality
usually i dont take the time to review films because its pretty pointless trying to argue with all the fools who gave this film a bad rating but this time i really think it needs some backing up ive watched some pretty violent gory films before but this was the first one where i actually felt sick not because it was so unnecessary or because it was overdone but because it was so damn real the opening scene was so intense and realistic it explains everything about war that cant be learned just through reading books studying history or ever looking at old photos the way the sound muffles to show the audience shell shock and people lying in the background screaming for their mothers its a bit overwhelming but better that than completely fake what i really want to point out is that in order for the audience to want the main characters to succeed there needs to be some purpose to the film hence the storyline of a small group of soldiers searching for the last of four sons otherwise it wouldnt have the emotion or engagement of the audience that was intended also when people complain about it being unrealistic yes the story is fiction but how do you know something like that never did happen maybe there was one german they let live who returned later to kill their comrades maybe they did send a tank through a small alley id like to point out that the film is in the eyes of american soldiers its meant to portray how they saw the war how the enemy looked in their eyes basically if you didnt want to see any of the slight exaggerations or sympathy to the americans go watch a documentary on war not an incredibly realistic movie,reality
spielberg directed this epic war film in 1998 it stars tom hanks as capitan john miller matt damon as private james is only surviving son of mother and government decide to call him back they give this mission to john miller and his companions then the chase beginsbefore watching it i heard many positive reviews about this movie when i watched it i said yeah they are right i have seen many films about war but this is definitely something extraordinary this is probably the most innovative war film of all time it has great cultural impact spielberg created famous game medal of honor after this then it influenced some films like black hawk down and s after 1314 years this film still have its effect on peopleat oscars film was nominated for 11 oscars including bes picture and director it won best director for spielberg but it lost bp to shakespeare in love everyone was shocked this is probably the greatest oscar upset of modern times and of course another spielberg snubwatch and enjoy,reality
since the popularising of pacifism in the 1960s the war movie has largely existed only to convey antimilitarist sentiment but by 1998 there hadnt been a major decent one of those for years and it was time for another makeover harks back to the genres peak in the late 40s and early 50s when war movies were exciting pictures about heroism and unquestionable moral reasoning however the intervening time in cinematic and social development cant be ignored and so this time around combat must be realistically hellish and there has to be some kind of philosophical questioning going onthis is all very well but is also very much part of the modern eras blockbuster strand and it seems a conflict between brutal realism and cornball simplicity in between the battle scenes there is some woefully clichd dialogue and dramatically flat moments characters like upham are just lazilywritten stereotypes and the pointmaking about the perils of showing mercy to the germans is heavyhanded then theres the john williams score which is just like so many other overblown and slightly smugsounding john williams scores you wouldnt think a musical score could be condescending but this one isdirector steven spielberg won his second oscar for as with schindlers list the frequency and arbitrariness of the killing soon makes us desensitised to it and immerses us in a world where randomised death is a constant threat and spielberg clearly knows how to balance this for example about halfway through the battle we see hanks and his men gradually making some headway the troops arent dropping like flies anymore but the sheer brutality of the previous ten minutes means we never forget the danger the men are in but the trouble is spielberg occasionally resorts to techniques like slowmotion and sound distortion putting the experience upon us in a way that feels obviously artificial as oppose to letting the images draw us in and he makes a basic error i feel in showing a few pointofview shots from the german gun positions surely the whole point of this scene and the movie in general is keeping us with the us troops and never being objective and yet spielberg violates his own premiseand yet this is overall a wellmade piece and there remains much to like despite the weaknesses in the screenplays minutiae its odyssey structure gives it a powerful sweep and makes up for the deficits in characterisation the picture gains resonance is it goes along and to my mind the later battle sequence at ramille with its eerie sound effects and manversustank dynamics is superior to the opening one is not without its flaws but it is enough to reinvigorate a genre that was starting to flag,reality
you could see all the effort that was put into this movie as amazing a movie it is it wouldnt be nearly half as good without the technical decisions that were put into this movie from the deep emotions and feelings to the action packed battle scenes every part was beautifully depicted with spielbergs technical skillstheres no doubt that the opening invasion scene left viewers entranced and possibly with their mouths wide open the fast cuts character actions camera movements and camera placement all contributed to portraying the horrific details of war blood was everywhere bombs were going off in every direction bullets whizzed past everyone special effects were a everywhere switching from shots of units to shots of neardeath individuals the film made sure viewers knew exactly what was happeningafter the rifles have cooled down a bit towards the middle of the film spielberg started to employ calmer camera shots and movements shots were slower but nevertheless effective one may never even notice the cuts as the shots are fluid and invisible this shows spielberg is still taking consideration into these shots but is avoiding anything unnecessary from low angles to close ups the viewer involuntarily receives the messages spielberg wants to conveyalmost the whole film was actually a flashback which the viewer learns towards the end the low angle shot of pvtmatt damon beautifully dissolves into a low angle shot of grandpa not his grandpa this ties everything together the old man in the very beginning was actually who visited the grave of cpt millertom hanks and had a flashback of the war which was followed by him coming back to the present how spielberg made the actual film in this manner provided such a stronger impact on the viewer towards the end than if it wasnt a flashback at all,reality
yes 1998 by steven spielberg is a war film but it can be seen as much more than that throughout the film spielberg placed a great emphasis on the emotional and psychological effects that a war can place on soldiers captain millers platoon is put through several situations that cause them to lose loved ones and throw morals out the window as their mentality about life changes their grueling lives are shown to be an example of the real aspects of war and let people around the world think differentlyas the soldiers are placed on normandy beach they have a hatred for the german soldiers that can be seen throughout the battlefield some soldiers yelled dont shoot let them burn while others shot the enemy point blank even when the germans surrendered no mercy was given the soldiers lost their human nature and became angry killing machines their hatred blinded them from seeing that the germans were human beings also who were in some cases ordered to be on the battlefield just as american soldiers were drafted into the warin a later scene where private wade dies the effects of the war are seen taking a toll on the soldier several soldiers hit torture and ridicule the german soldier for killing one of their beloved members imagine watching one of your good friend dying in front of you that moment will have a great impact on you since you will be living with that memory forever these soldiers had to face this moment so rage overcomes them to hurt the german soldier even when the german desperately tries to relate to the americans by singing american songs and chanting f hitler and the captain lets him go some of the soldiers still want revenge the hardship of the war is psychologically affecting them their hatred begins to build and build to the point where the soldiers yell back and forth while holding the other at gun point the tension just keeps risingthe last battle scene showed a great representation of the effects of the war and showed a change in some of the characters attitude after the frustration of losing two soldiers private reiben was livid when private didnt want to leave his post edward burns reiben gave an excellent performance of this frustration that his character later turned into a brotherhood he began to let go of the hatred to fight side by side with as did the other soldiers to successfully protect the bridge when corporal upham shoots the german soldier who was let free from the wade scene was a special moment in the last battle scene i think that upham was a representation of innocence being deteriorated by war throughout the film upham was the morally right character who believed in doing things the right way he had a special innocence during the war but after seeing the soldier shoot the captain that innocence is gone at this point he begins to see the life of war for what it really is upham gains a war mentality and kills the german soldier with no regretsthis film was a medium to let viewers get a peek of the lives of soldiers in wars but i also feel that this film ask important questions like when considering the amount of deaths is war really the answer,reality
what a breathtaking film you honestly know exactly what these soldiers are feeling its unbelievable ive never sat through a 3hour movie without being bored well this was the first time i was not bored whenever there wasnt war action there was emotionally touching moments that grabbed your attention even more justwow also most of the battle scenes were incredibly accurate the first scene dday was extremely accurate that my old history teacher let us watch it for an accurate depiction after doing the research almost the whole 20 minute scene was historically accurate i dont want to spoil anything but its well worth the 3 hours one of my favorite movies of all time fantastic film1010,reality
first off i absolutely loved this movie the first time i saw it and i still love it the first hour of the movie is about as real of a depiction of war as hollywood can get and to this day i have not seen a more realistic and justifiably gruesome and wrenching depiction of war probably one of the most intense moments of the movie is not when the actual fighting is happening but when the letters are being written to the families of the deceased soldiers and the subsequent visit to the farm the last hour or so of the movie was a little over the top for me considering how spielberg had made the first hour of combat seem so believable but i digress the soundtrack is excellent and the style of filming is vintage spielberg the length of the movie a nearly three hours may discourage some of the viewers but this one is definitely worth it,reality
is a very fast paced war movie with lots battle scenes throughout one of the best war movie ever released in modern cinematic history this is spielbergs best film along with minority report jurassic park jaws and schindlers list the look of it is phenomenal and th acting is very well done tom hanks is really at the top of his game in this epic his best performance since his role in the movie forrest gump and every scene is shot with very well shot and the filmmakers payed very close attention to detail although the movie is not historically accurate it does give you some insight on how brutal world war ii was if you have not seen this movie yet rent it or buy it right away is a true masterpiece,reality
was a well made film by spielberg that was researched throughly the action scenes dramatic scenes and other scenes actively portrayed what war was actually like during world war 2 while in real life an individual named private did not exist the director makes you feel everything that the troops are feeling through use of sight and sound this film in my opinion is a classic that all generations must witness this movie is not for children however due to graphic content viewers must be aware of excessive violence language and sadness all but three individuals in the film are fictionouse and do not nor have exsited all similarities between characters portrayed in the film and individuals in life are simply coninscidence,reality
steven spielberg has created another masterpiece along with his famous schindlers list it can speak for itself with all the academy awards it won such as best director and multiple nominations like tom hanks for best actor this movie released in 1998 is ahead of its time after watching it i considered it to be an instant american classic the movie starts off in modern day with a family walking with their elderly veteran of world war ii in a memorial cemetery they follow him to a grave labeled captain john h miller tom hanks where he breaks down and begins to cry the story then flashes back to 1994 following tom hanks as he storms normandy beach on dday if you want to see a movie that reals you in right away in the first 30 minutes then is that movie the first half hour of this movie are the us troops storming omaha beach in normandy and i believe this is the best war action sequence of all time it is shockingly intense as it portrays the horrific realism of war at its finest it really makes your stomach weak when it gives tom hanks point of view where he sees men literally trying to survive the onslaught american soldiers after the first 30 minutes the story then goes on to tell how captain john h miller and seven other men must search for a paratrooper james francis matt damon who is the last surviving brother of 4 who served in the us army the opening omaha beach scene reveals the death of the other 3 brothers who were killed in action the morale of all these men are at an alltime low after watching their fellow soldiers being slaughtered on omaha beach to make things even harder for them they are now chosen to go on a dreadful mission that increases the chances of losing their lives the possibility of finding private james francis is almost impossible or as miller says its like finding a needle in a stack of needles all of the men have seen combat before except one upham who is just a translator they all have an internal conflict of why they have to put their lives on the line to save someone they dont even know is even alive the movie is based off a flashback of a world war ii veteran the movie has the ability to suck you and make you feel as if you are in the battle yourself because of its realism due to sound and special effects of machine guns grenades army tanks and explosions what makes the movie so intense that there is no music throughout the story music is usually used to set the tone of a scene or hint things to the viewer adding no music to the story gives the viewer a hellish and gloom feeling for the characters the only music is nondiegetic and is played before and after the flashback of james francis it is a brutal movie yet that is what makes it so satisfying this movie would not be what it is if the lead role was not performed by tom hanks tom hanks has the credentials after winning multiple academies for best actor in philadelphia and forest gump and was nominated for best actor in this movie he plays the role of a humble captain leading seven men on a nearly impossible mission he does an amazing job displaying fear with his actions such as shaky hands before battle and then shows great poise during battle he still keeps in mind that the only way back to his wife is to find private the supporting cast does their job to create an epic movie but do not nearly do as well as job as tom hanks edward burns reiben who appears to be one of millers best men in the film who uses pessimistic humor to cover up his doubts of the mission at hand jeremy davies who plays as upham creates a character who will make you scream at his cowardice but also makes it extremely believable and sympathetic because of the gruesomeness of war he witnesses the climax of the movie is when matt damon private is found he plays his role very well as you feel compassion for the soldier after he hears the loss of his close brothers there was only one little problem with the movie the movie although it still does not make the outcome any different about how i feel when the men discover that private james francis was still alive private refuses to go home because its unfair to the others my grandfather was in the korean war which was not even close to being as bad as world war ii and he left with no hesitation my good friend told me his grandfather laughed at that scene because he said no man wanted to be there if you talk to any war veteran they would say they would leave in a heartbeat especially in privates case he is the only remaining child in his family which should be motivation enough however one could depict it as commitment to military service or patriotism usually when i watch an american war film it is either an action film of heroism or of tragedy this movie contains both and that is what makes it unique and compelling to watch the plot of this film is amazing because of gripping realism i still cannot describe the outstanding intensity of the battle scenes throughout the movie thanks to the direction of steven spielberg as the men travel through europe you may ask yourself throughout the movie is one mans life worth the lives of eight others the movie is a must see for audiences of age 17 and older,reality
this film deserves the title of film it is not just a movie steven spielberg does an excellent job of instilling historical accuracy he made it a priority and it paid off is a movie that will stand the test of time i could show this to someone who knew nothing of world war 2 and they would be quickly caught up on the things that happened the characters portrayed the actual feelings of soldiers during the time most soldiers were scared and unsure most war movies portray fearless and unquestioning soldiers which is not accurate after the sullivan brothers this type of situation was more common this is informative yet interesting it is not dry like most other informative pieces this is also addresses the fact that most veterans are still affected by the war,reality
this is one of the greatest war movies i have ever seen i feel they did a really good job portraying the emotions of the people the opening scene was amazing with how realistic he got it to be with them throwing up in the boat and getting shot before they got off the boat i like how they made the towns look old and made replicas and what not of the tanks and weapons they used i also like how when they finally found private he wouldnt leave his squad behind and that he would stay there and fight the enemy i was really surprised in the end when cpt miller died because it was one of those things you dont expect to happen,reality
i found this movie to be enjoyable even though there are some historical inaccuracies i feel that this movie does an incredible job of portraying the landing at omaha even though the portrayal is not exactly how it happened it gives the audience a glimpse of what it was like to be storming the beach i felt that spielberg did a good job in the way that he showed the explosions in a lot of movies when a bomb goes off its just a big fireball when bombs and artillery hit things in this movie debris actually falls and it looks a little more realistic another thing that a lot of war movies get wrong is that they show people die automatically after being shot in this movie not everyone dies instantaneously after being shot which in my eyes is more warlike another aspect i thought this movie did right was the amount of ammunition you always see guys in movies shoot constantly without reloading or running out of ammo for example when the one german soldier comes up the stairs a hand to hand battle ensues because the two americans were out of ammo you can pick any movie apart if you look for errors the big picture is what counts and this movie is accurate in the way it depicts war for the most part,reality
i liked this movie a lot i was really into it because of how action packed it was also it was very realistic now that i have seen this movie i have a better idea of how the war was and what kind of bad things happened i liked how it portrayed the soldiers being scared and nerves i also thought found it kind of interesting that the main character tom hanks dies at the end of the movie i did not see that coming i also like the story line itself i liked how they had to go find private the movie changed my moods a lot because of how realistic it was at some points in the movie i wanted to cry now that i have seen this movie i understand why some people that served in the war did not want to see this movie or had to walk out during it most of the movie was very accurate i think this is a good movie to show to people if youre trying to show them how the war was and some of the horrible things that happened in it this movie was great and i rated it ten stars i would love to watch it again,reality
is an incredibly good movie not only was it historically accurate it was very entertaining tom hanks and matt damon performed very well the accuracy during the opening scene when normandy was attacked was very well shot most movies ive seen are inaccurate because so many things go the way of the heroes took me by surprise because it shows the constant struggle both physically mentally emotionally etc event though the story might not have happened as far as soldiers it is a very good story and can be thought of as a great movie in my opinion will be added to my collection of my alltime favorites tom hanks has got me interested in world war two,reality
this movie was an awesome representation of dday and supplemental missions i thought that the although fake mission to save private was also fairly accurate people do not realize that war was a terrible place to be and that many people did not die as quickly and peacefully as other movies depict i also must commend the director for portraying the character of upham spielberg created a character that everyone absolutely hated the screenplay as well as cinematic feel of the movie were better than any other movie to date in my opinion the inaccuracies of the movie do not take away from the story and are all just minor things that most people overlook the major flaws are not even that big of a deal just things with emblems and the such all in all this movie shows a fairly accurate portrayal of wwii,reality
i thought that was a well put together movie it is very realistic to everyone that watches it but especially to the war veterans this is one of those movies that will hit you emotionally but at the same time you will want to watch it over and over again the actors did a really great job and steven spielberg did his part in directing this really great movie too anyone who reads this review should try to watch this movie even though it was made in 1998 you would think that it was made just a few years ago or earlier thats how great this movie actually is i will never get bored watching this movie and i give full respect for every person that has ever served in war because it takes a lot of strength and courage to do what these men and women did and still do today,reality
this film deserves historical recognition privates story is loosely based on the story of the niland brothers the niland brothers all went into the war and only two of the four survived when our guys landed on the beach steven spielburg did an excellent job at making it realistic he didnt have all of our guys ready to fight and kill the germans he showed that some or the soldiers wouldnt have been able to handle it he showed their fear he also did a very good job of making us not like the translator i liked how speilburg ran the story line of actually going out and this way the audience got a chance to connect with the characters and it gave the death of wade in particular a lot more of an impact like all war movies they got stuff wrong some of the weapons fired more than they would have been capable of the time period or blew up before they got hit i think tom hanks did an incredible job of playing his role and that the audience was able to pick up on that also the ending was a complete blind side i thought for sure the old guy in the beginning was captain miller because of how they introduced him and to find out that it was actually private who survived caught me completely off guard i also thought that it was ironic that the soldier who wanted to leave the mission was the only one out of the eight to survive all in all i would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to learn more about how combat on dday actually went had to be one of my favorite war movies of all time,reality
i thought that this movie was a great change of pace the dday scene was a great depiction of what actually happened on that day it showed how the soldiers acted and most of the people today would be very surprised to see that i thought searching for private was a great story line you got to know the characters and really understand what soldiers felt when they went into battle is one of my favorite movies because of its real life action scenes they actually have to reload in most movies it seems like no one is reloading and no one misses shows them running out of ammo missing close shots and throwing your helmet because that is the first thing that comes to mind that is why i think that is such a good movie,reality
this movie was really great and really showed how it was back then during that war the characters really did not over exaggerate any part that they had if i wouldnt of know this was a movie i would think that this would be some clips from that war steven spielberg did an awesome job i would watch this movie again if i could definitely a great war movie the place they shot it at looked so real tom hanks did an awesome job as well he worked with the other soldiers my favorite part would probably be when they found private he really stood up about himself and his other soldier friends he obviously did not want to go anywhere,reality
before beginning with this review i must say this movie is tom hanks best acting role out of all of all his many different roles he has played as the movie progresses it show the bonds of brotherhood that are made with soldiers during a very dark period as this movie continues you the viewer also get caught up with these bonds and you almost feel like you belong while watching this spectacular movie i must praise steven spielberg for his directing in this movie as the bonds between the soldiers of war continues you are able to feel the pain suffering and emotions that soldiers go through as they take their last breaths although this movie is based on a dark period of time this movie becomes an eye opener to the general public of how painful and cruel wars can be although we cannot ever fully understand the pain and suffering soldiers go through in a war i believe that this film is the closest representation of the suffering and pain in a war that can ever be expressed in a movie this is a very amazing and emotional movie which will leave you in tears,reality
well in most of the reviews written about this movie you can find one thing in common ie the first 30 minutes of war scene depiction no doubt that is one of the best ever war depictions ever made weve never been to any war to vouch for something as real but the first few minutes of the movie looks like straight from the battleground a sheer raw terror is unleashed the story is all about saving one person whose all three brothers are dead according to a policy of the us government the lone survivor of the family should be saved the whole movie shows the efforts of the us troops to find out the person there is some amount of banality in the movie but overall the movie is a good one and considered one of the best war movies ever made,reality
this is one heck of a war movie the first 27 minutes deserves special mention which was so realistic that it felt they had cameras in real war zone,reality
now that really doesnt mean much as of now i have only seen four real war movies inglorious besterds shindlers list hurt locker and this and of those four the only two that involve combat in the field are hurt locker and this and i hated hurt locker that being said i still loved this moviefor one it was shot perfectly the scenes that dont involve fighting are nice and still and the scenes that have fighting have just a little shaky cam not too much to make me angry and dizzy tom hanks and matt damon are great as well as the rest of the cast the production value is very hight every explosion is great and most importanly i was never boredevery thing kept my interest the fighting the struggles of the crew by the end i actually wished it had been a little longer and that is the sign of a very good flick,reality
this movie really touched my heart because it showed different characteristics about war besides the great story the acting and the picture was fantastic warning spoilers so the main part of the story is that there were four brothers 3 of them died and the forth one james francis had to be evacuated out of the war so the general orders cpt miller and his men to find him there were some scenes that really made me cry like when the medic died and there were other scenes that warmed me like when appam hes the shy translator was giving a cigarette to the german that killed wayne the medic so anyway this is my favorite movie of all time keep up the good work steven and i think it deserves a 11 out of 10,reality
following the ww2 dday normandy beach landing a platoon of soldiers led by tom hanks are dispatched on a glorified public relations stunt to locate and retrieve the title private from the front linesdirector steven spielberg can be a great filmmaker but one must beware of his serious efforts designed to win over his detractors film critics and oscar voters these serious films can run from the masterful like the color purple or schindlers list despite a few missteps in its final moments to overrated misfires the empire of the sun spr falls squarely in the overrated mediocre category oscar voters actually made the correct decision in passing it over for the best picture oscarthe opening moments  depicting the normandy landing  are impressive unfortunately the film loses that momentum the moment its story kicks in for one thing no one is rooting for a mission that takes these men into danger for what is basically a rather asinine publicity stunt while it is true that the us armed forces did attempt to return home men whose siblings had all died serving their country to avoid wiping out an entire generation of a family this was done by sending word to that soldiers unit of his planned extraction and then doing so at a convenient moment entire platoons were never sent on glorified rescue missions for lowlevel serviceman that placed large numbers of people at unnecessary risk so the plot is largely preposterouswhile there are a number of great war films that can get away with presenting types in place of threedimensional characters this film is not one of them there is very little camaraderie among these men and they largely blur together we know them less as individuals than by the types they are presented as  and none of them are truly able to break out of these constrictions for instance we identify them solely as the second in command the italian guy the jewish guy the newbie coward the medic the sniper the jerkincredibly for spielberg who usually features rich cinematography this film is ugly to even look at everything is filmed in shades of gray washedout blue and dirt colors often using a jittery handheld camera for a you are there feel that functions more to generate either a headache or motion sickness rather than any sort of authenticityonce the men start off on their mission the story repeats the same steps over and over again one of the men will reveal something minor about themselves ie a personality trait and then be brutally killed in the next scene in the most drawnout agonizing way possible then the men will trudge forth another man will reveal something and then be eviscerated in the following scene one could almost do a lawrence welk to this  and a onea and a twoa and blam the predictability of the action becomes wearisome and the only suspense lies in figuring what manner of unspeakable demise will pop up next will it be a bloody gunshot wound or will someone be blasted apart with spielberg uncharacteristically allowing the gore and body parts to drench the jittercam this predictable nature also allows to realize exactly where the film is headedfor instance if the film remains true to clichs then once the surviving men meet private we anticipate that he will be a sunny allamerican young man impossible to hate we also anticipate that he will be a standup guy that will refuse to abandon the other members of his squadron in their hour of need so that the surviving members of his rescue mission will be suitably impressed enough to stay to fight with them when the diminished rescue party does reach him and be turns out to be matt damon drawing out his biggest awshucks grin and practically oozing middleamerican likability you know the film has no surprise anywhere on its repertoirethe majority of the supporting cast could change their roles and no one would notice so little impact are they allowed to make and so few are the facets to their respective characters two exceptions that stand out and not in a good way are jeremy davies absolute descent into pure ham with his breakdown on the stairs and edward burns unintended utter obnoxiousness throughout the course of the film tom hanks is likable as usual but he is playingtom hanks only this time with a slight quiver to his hand to key us in on the toll this war is taking on himby the time the film rolls into its final moments it has been an exhausting unpleasant viewing experience  or something misguided people like to pretend is powerful anyone with an iota of sense knows that war is hell but that does not mean we want to pay to have it inflicted on us for nearly 3 hours without break i think i finally had enough at the climax when one of the men held on to a grenade too long and literally blew apart  with all of the gore that implies i stayed to the foregone conclusion but i think i had shut off from that moment onand a foregone conclusion it is since spielberg rather strangely opens the film with the elderly living visiting arlington cemetery and then closes it again with him in another one of his clumsy codas i have no idea what to say when turns to his family and wonders if the mens sacrifice was all worth it however i do know that this film despite its most ardent admirers should not be considered one the great war films ever made for all of its patriotism and attempts at realism for all its brutality and inyourface approach its story and characters are just not worth that amount of consideration,reality
the first half an hour of is pure cinematic brilliance bullets whoosh past soldiers search through the blood drenched sea bed for their broken limb cry for their mums as their guts squeeze out of their stomach its scarily realistic mentally scarring and utterly compelling although the rest of the film doesnt reach the dizzy heights the first 20 minutes managed to it comes damn near closetom hanks once again shows his charisma versatility and rangein the role of captmiller assuring us still that he is one of the best alist actors around the supporting cast more than match him the pick of the bunch being tom sizemore as a reliable sergeant spielbergs ambition and emotionally resonant directing makes sure that this film hits all the right footnotes from unflinching battle scenes to emotional speeches the only thing that holds this back is the scripts nack of sneaking slightly into sentiment especially in the prologue and the epilogue but that is just a minor bum note in an ultimately groundbreaking powerful war movie classic,reality
truly a war film for the ages the battles are long bloody and intense in between each scene is loaded with tension and suspense in every scene theres immaculate detail that showcases war and the battle of omaha beach specifically in the most realistic light possible its close to three hours long but at least half of it is devoted to the incredible battle sequences a combination of stylistic cameramanship and sound effects help immerse the audience in the shoes of the soldiers and it has to be seen to be experiencedthe story for this is fine and dandy and is a serviceable platform for shuffling the characters along their journey its also integral for diving into some strong themes concerning the war the human spirit and philosophy the film takes every intellectual advantage of the storys nuances and with a cast of quality characters the film does have plenty of strengthsone problem i have is the plausibility of the story no way in heck would the army risk eight men to rescue one regardless of the circumstance surely if they did this for why not everybody else suffering from losses then who would be left to fight singling out one soldier just never made sense to me incidentally it didnt make sense to the storys characters either and as they discuss and find the value in the issue the story works in its own bizarre wayadditionally the scene in the middle of the film where the soldiers charge after a target of opportunity struck me as dumb and unnecessary the main character became uncharacteristically arrogant at this point and the scene overall felt outofplace i almost suspect that it could have been removed from the film completely im also not fond of the films commemorative beginning and closing it strikes me as manipulative and overlysentimentalotherwise the film is exceptionally strong despite some herkyjerky cameramanship i do love the photography throughout there are lots of intimate closeups and interesting longshots they are all full of detail acting is really good tom hanks is the man tom sizemore is not bad edward burns is cool i loved barry peppers role matt damon is surprisingly strong and its interesting seeing vin diesel in the mix writing has a lot of interesting and bright moments production value is very strong with highlydetailed and seeminglyrealistic sets props costumes locations vehicles weapons and everything music is a little overlysentimental at times but good in other partsrecommended455 entertainment 455 story 355 film 55,reality
steven spielbergs biggest hit to date is the epic war film the film follows around eight men in world war ii saving one soldier whose three brothers were killed and is the only brother alive the film has powerful scenes of war and drama that teaches us the horror and drama of the war only steven spielberg and his brilliant cast including tom hanks edward burns  matt damon can bring an amazing motion picture that takes a deep step closer and closer until the film has its reaching point tom hanks delivers one of his best performances of his whole career edward burns was pretty impressive for his role and matt damon had the shortest scenes in the whole movie but those were good scenes steven spielberg always delivers fine directing in all of his movie but this one takes the cake everything about this movie from the incredible cinematography the intense film editing to the explosive sound was one heck of a thrill though the war scenes were long and graphic that does not stop the films power this film happens to be one of spielbergs best movies yet also the movie felt like a moving biodiary of the many soldiers losing their lives in world war ii the movie felt personal moving emotional and there are so many things to say about this movie that i dont have time to say it all this movie will always be a piece of history to me steven spielberg really knows how to make a dramatic wellacted war movie with a heart in my review emotionally powerful and completely excellent,reality
seeing this movie at home does not do it justice i remember being speechless and overcome with emotion at the end of the omaha beach landing it was such a spectacle to see on the big screen at the cinema that i went to watch it on backtoback nights spielberg does a fantastic job of putting you right in the middle of one of the most remembered and heroic days in american history those who do not have an appreciation for our fighting forces and the freedom they have provided us with will undoubtedly change their tune after the first 30 minutes of saving privateis truly one of the best movies of the past 25 years at the time i did not think tom hanks could pull off the leading role in this movie i was dead wrong hanks brings a human element to the movie which makes it work cast anyone else in the role of captain miller and i doubt the movie would have succeeded the way it didi am not one to shed a tear during movies but this one made me cry several times can you as parents imagine what it would be like to find out you lost a loved one during wartime well spielberg shows that whens mother crumbles to the ground at the sight of a priest coming to her door what about the older james francis dropping to his knees at the sight of private millers grave asking his wife if he lived up to what miller and his crew did for him this is emotional stuff and at the very core of being a good human being one who looks out and cares for othersthe ensemble cast of this movie is fantastic each brings something different to the table and it works because spielberg allows you to engage and relate with each character between battle sequences you learn a little about each character where they are from and who they are this is what film making is about and there is none better than steven spielbergi could go on and on about this movie but i wont i would suggest that everyone watch this movie and become more enlightened about the horrors of war how it affects those within it and how these warriors share a common bond ultimately making them brothers in arms,reality
is one of the best films of steven spielbergs won 5 oscar etc neighbor tells of a captain who shows loyalty to his country uphold all the duties which it worked although the task that does not make sense save the soldiers mother after the war because soldiers are all her children died in world war ii was the last child captain miller tom hank show the war is in fact not about winning but how to achieve victory with the understanding of a task to do this is war and they win it lighting is very professional hollywood quality which together with the film script the camera angel looks in a hurry and thats the point of war the amazing acting from all actors in touch with how they talk to each other,reality
is a movie that will make you cry the movie is based on a true story during the 2nd world war in the movie cpt miller and his group of brothers brave the war in a mission that requires finding private james whose brothers have died in that violent normandy beach invasion and bring him back home to his mother in order to find him the group has to go thorugh hell just to make sure that is found and sent back homethis movie may be disturbing to a lot of audiences especially the first 30mins even i was not prepared for that kind of action when i first watched it on the big screen it looked almost real and i could feel what the soilders felt when they were part of the 2nd world war there are some moments that will make you puke and there are some moments where you will cryi will give this movie a full rating because it deserves it but it should have won best picture at that years academy awards but to me it is the greatest movie of all time,reality
theres not a person in hollywood that doesnt know about steven spielberg this director has dazzled people with masterpieces such as schindlers list jaws jurassic park the indiana jones trilogy and amistad hes also known today as one of the most wealthiest filmmakers in the worldtom hanks is just an amazing actor the kind that really puts his soul towards his characterrole and plays towards perfection hes known for forrest gump cast away the green mile apollo 13 sleepless in seattle and bigis by far one of the best war films ive seen as well as one of spielbergs best it features outstanding acting terrific cinematography a powerful storyline and of course captivating directionhanks doesnt disappoint as captain john miller he plays the character with determination fear and dedication one of the best performances ive seen from him matt damon is great too in his brief yet convincing role edward burns and the rest of the soldiers are simply terrificwelldone cinematography is experienced throughout the film the camera angles are just so dashing and terrific that you simply cannot keep your eyes of this film horrific yet gripping and intensifyingstoryline makes this film what it really is its powerful in a brutal and unforgiving way i almost cried in the end but its a true story and highly realistic in a lot of ways unfortunately its sometimes painful to watch the war scenes bloody and extremely violent scenes but again worth watchingoverall this film is a mustsee and cannot be missed by any moviegoer the type of impressive direction spielberg pulls of and hanks astonishing performance are big time watching though beware again this film is outright bloody so dont go see it if you dont like these kind of films,reality
every casual movie fan knows the notorious first 20 minutes of and rightfully so this introduction is just absolutely breathtaking world war ii has never been so close and in your face however a thing thats regularly ignored is that the other 120 minutes are really just as good the characters are all pretty compelling even vin diesels performance is very convincing you really manage to get to know all these people throughout the second act and you can sympathize with all of them which in a way is kind of a bummer when they start dying on us screenwriter robert rodat puts in a whole bunch of war movie clichs the inevitable emotional highlight but lets be honest who doesnt love war movie clichs i wouldnt say this is the definitive world war ii movie because theres no such thing but it does provide some really interesting angles,reality
regarded as one of the best war films ever made it certainly qualifies the opening twenty minutes are still as breathtaking shocking and disturbing realistic as they were back in 1998 it is hard to imagine that it has now been over twelve years since broke the mold of world war ii film makingwinner of five academy awards including best director for spielberg best cinematography and sound which was astonishing even by todays standards it failed to win best picture losing out to shakespeare in love shakespeare in love dont get me wrong its a good film but easily forgettable compared to only proving yet again that if you touch upon the british monarchy you get oscarsthe film is a fictional account of four brothers all serving in the us army three of which were killed in action on or around the dday landings the fourth james played by matt damon is somewhere in europe and tom hanks with his platoon are sent to bring him home to spare his mother anymore heartachetom hanks who was also snubbed at the 1998 oscars for his perfect performance as captain miller the everyman who was losing himself in the horrors of war underplayed his role perfectly he is believable on every level emotionally physically and has a sense of subtly with makes him of hollywoods greatsthe action is visceral gritty and horrifying but never played for crass effect scenes of soldiers intestines spilling out limbs flying a sunder and brutal killing left right and centre are recreated for one purpose to truly demonstrate the horrors of war and to change our perceptions of the global conflict which had almost become a joke a setting for gung ho action films where the yanks reign supreme and singlehandedly win the warthis shows troops crying hurting and making decisions which should not be made under any moral circumstances but you understand why whether you agree or not there is no doubt that spielberg is not innocent of making an american film but it is about as evenhanded as you might expect with the exception of tora tora tora or the longest dayso the action is firstrate graphic and perfectly toned to recreate to horror of the last centurys greatest and most of destructive conflicts but thats only half the storythe other half is the talking reminiscing and the almost sepia tone is more than a little cloying the us generals monologues which seem to consist almost entirely of lincoln quotations are overly sentimental erring on the side of sloppy patriotism rather than jingoism which is hardly a bad thing but it isnt good eitherthe civilian scenes such as mrs washing a plate as she sees the car drive down to road to inform her of her sons deaths are so sentimental that they jar against the realism of the war scenes its not so much contrast as it is as extreme as black and whitethe action is obviously interspersed as all war films are with rest stops and moments of talking pondering etc but the scenes drag on too long and disrupt the tone of the film on the other hand the direction is brilliant when explaining the situations during and around the action but spielberg seemed to think that we needed these sloppy and often boring moments such as the church and the outside the cafe in ramelle to express the emotional torment of the characters but i think that these scenes are so boring and pointless that i can hardly remember them as my attention drifts off during them but i do have an understanding of the soldiers and this was achieved quite adorably without these scenesoverall this is a film of two halves if ever there was one the battle scenes and the journey through wartorn france are brilliant gritty and educational but the scenes of american sentimentality are in danger of derailing the whole film many feel that is the best war film of all time i do not agree favouring black hawk down over this but i would be remiss if i didnt acknowledge that blank hawk down owes a debt to by opening the door to the gritty war dramas of the naughties and to the style itselfthis film is on of the most important contributions to cinema ever and has done so much to finally show to true nature of wwii and war in general but even though i would rate this 1010 if it was just for the war scenes the slop just gets in the way and devalues what should have been perfection,reality
while may not be 100 accurate to the events of world war ii but we must remember it is a fictional movie that is based within real events and it isnt a documentary i believe that it is an incredible film there are so many powerful moments and brilliant performances from nearly every member of the castgiovanni ribisi is the stand out to me with a powerhouse performance as medic irwin wade and also the most underrated performance in the movie every line he uttered and every facial expression he gave during his time on screen was met with meaning and sincerity without a word you could tell what he was feeling there are several standout moments such as when the men were resting in a church wade is rewriting a letter that was covered in the blood of fallen soldier adrian caparzo brilliantly portrayed by vin diesel in which he had written to his parents wade begins talking about his mother and tears glaze his eyes later ribisi has me reaching for a tissue as his character suffers several gunshots and calls for his motheri think everyone should give this movie a chance it may not be for you but if you enjoy war movies this one is definitely a recommendation from me,reality
is without a doubt the greatest war movie of all time it beats apocalypse now by a long shot ive seen this movie dozens of times now and the opening battle scene on omaha beach never ceases to amaze me the realistic war scenes are gory and violent but thats exactly what our great ww2 heros had to go throughthe acting was great all the way around by all the actors especially by tom hanks ive seen other war movies but none have compared to this so why are there some idiots out there who say its overrated they obviously are jealous they dont have the talent to create a masterful war film like thisand by the way i still dont understand why the academy awards didnt give this best picture in 1999 the voters to me were obviously paid off by the shakespeare in love producers,reality
this has got to be one of the best movies ever made if its not my favorite then its definitely one of them from the introductory dday scene to the final battle in ramelle spielberg does a fantastic job making the viewers feel like theyre in the soldiers shoes the horror these men have to encounter throughout the films battles is something that has definitely changed the war movie genre for good as for the audiences viewing it making it a model for its genreeven though it may occasionally seem patriotic frequent when it comes to ww2 movies right portrays human beings as being fragile and not necessarily persuaded by the cause theyre fighting for captain miller tom hanks for instance only goes on with this mission that his men consider suicidal because hes fed up with this whole manslaughter and just wants to go homethe only problem id give to this movie would be that the german soldier who grimly kills private mellish adam goldberg is the same one the unit encountered and nearly executed while taking control of the radar site the fact that the same guys had to run coincidently into the same soldier again out of the 100 or so other germans in the battle was kinda dumb but that little problem was not enough to ruin the movie by a long shoti cant believe this movie didnt get the academy award for best picture but it definitely earned its 5 others for directing photography editing sound and sound effectsi strongly recommend this film for about everything in it from the acting and morality to the incredibly realistic special effects,reality
fantastic cinematography great acting beyond realistic unbelievable attention to detail gripping action scenes compelling story i truly lived this movie from beginning to end my heart pounded and i almost threw up with the young men in the lca heading for omaha beach so intense was my connection with the action on the screen intense almost too intenseit awoke feelings in me that forced me to question my own sense of right and wrong question how i would act in similar situations question the right and wrong of a war that i always had viewed as just the justification of the unconscionable the motives the hatred of the enemy whether you like or dont like war movies this is one of the best movies ever made its neither an antiwar or a prowar movie its just a movie made without compromise tom hanks is incredible his best role in my opinionthis one is on my top ten list of best movies ever,reality
is likely to remain in my top 10 favorite war movies for a long long time im taking the time to post this edited version of a review i wrote back when i first saw the film opening night 1998 not because i think anyone on this site will care or even read it but because i feel compelled to work on covering a wide variety of my favorite films on this site i watched the film again a few days ago probably at least my twentieth viewing and wanted to reflect on the differences in the initial viewing experience compared to this recent oneis a film about honor at its core and is as genuine a salute to men who have laid down their lives for their country as anyone could ask director spielberg and writer robert rodat deliver a ferocious look at the intensity of modern close combat and its effects on its participants and raise questions for which there are no confident answers if indeed there ever have been any at allthe structure of the film is symmetric opening and closing in a normandy military cemetery where an aging vet and his family visit the grave of a fallen comrade bookended between are two blisteringly enervating combat sequences and an episodic journey through horror and hard questionsi say the film is about honor and it is what else is an act of saving someone else if not an act of honor and in the process of doing so the most difficult of all choices must be madewhether to sacrifice ones own life that others might live or make the other poor dumb bastard die for his country spielbergs exploration of this dilemma follows several paths and in keeping with the general tenor of the filmterrifying numbing disorienting and possessed of a great sorrowhe never provides sophistic or glib answers he leaves us at films end still reeling from the dense insanity of a desperate bridge defense with an old man who after all the passing years still struggles with unanswerable questionswhere is the honor in war what is the relative value of a mans life on a personal level is there anything worth the risk of unimaginable pain and suffering other films have tackled these questions in the past but rarely had such visceral impact a snipers duel culminates in a blasted eye socket that makes the audience cringe a sapper is blown to jelly by a defective sticky bomb an excruciating knife fight in which the victor soothes his dying opponent almost crucifies the audience with its grim denouement critics have harped on the unrelenting violence as pandering to a jaded bloodthirsty audience but they miss the point spielberg goes so far beyond the limits of typical cinematic grand guignol that no one can mistake the overt nature of the message killing people especially ones that are trying to kill you is a brutish messy business and no one in their right mind has any desire to engage in the trade any more than they might be otherwise compelledafter an opening 25minute barrage that sets the tone spielberg and rodats story begins to unfold capt john miller tom forrest gump hanks must lead a squad of his men through a highly fluid battle zone in search of a private james francis matt good will hunting damon the sole surviving brother of four is somewhere behind enemy lines a trooper of the scattered 101st airborne division who had dropped the night before the invasion it is d3 and miller has orders from general george marshall to bring out

surrogate the fool ultimately it is he who must make the crucial moral choice of the filmis not a comfortable film experience overly sensitive filmgoers will probably be overwhelmed by it if they can make it through the omaha beach sequence theyll do okay for the rest of us its a film worthy of the accolades it has so far received personally i was a bit surprised that it didnt get the oscar for best picture over shakespeare in love especially since spielberg got the nod for best director such are the whims of the academy never mind it takes nothing away from the raw power of saving privateaddendum one noticeable difference between the theatrical and home video experience is visual the stuttery bleachedout quality of the film primarily in the battle sequences is much reduced in the transfer to small screen presentation its not a tremendous flaw but moves me to definitely recommend a theatrical viewing should it ever present itself,reality
at the beginning of us soldiers embark on the ohama beach in france of dday 1944 as the hatches of the uboats open hails of gunfire ricochets and hits the metal and soldiers many jump off the boat and into the water while the gunfire pierce through the water blood filled the ocean with dead soldiers dying loud screaming is heard as captain john h miller arrives at the hellish beach with his eyes wide open as he looks around him soldiers are seen screaming and some are holding their lives on with fear while some finds out that their arms are shot off epic pure epic is not a rollercoaster of action its triumph its a movie where you salute those who fought in normandy on dday in world war ii steven spielberg delivers us the horrors shock and amazement and triumph of worldwar ii since schindlers list i was amaze at what he brought to us the sheer horror and amazement of worldwar ii is never forgotten i have this movie on vhs the double videocassette on dreamworks that shows the feature movie and the special edition of the movie i also felt emotionally driven at the end when the older private is seen looking at john h millers cross and grave he asks his wife if he was a good man and live a good life after she answers yes the camera shows and his family family in the background with triumph he salute millers grave as the camera zooms in to shows the description of the grave the last shot shows the american flag waving the sky the film fades out that is triumph and showing that american soldiers will never be forgotten all in all is a epic war film that will never be forgotten and will be a war movie  4 stars,reality
spielberg is wellknown for his big films is his best of the bunch by a clear mile it is a statement in the genre of war movies an absolute top im an huge fan of war movies and this one is in my top 3 for sure i like that theres a great piece of an human side in this movie its quite touching it makes it powerfultom hanks was one the best actors of the 90s he capped the decade off with one the strongest performances of his career he shows here why he is spielbergs favorite actor he has lots of talent around him most notably edward burns and barry pepper a mustbe guy in war movies but others like matt damon vin diesel and tom sizemore leave the mark toowar movies are good when they seem realistic this one for sure is a classic and a mustsee in war genre a masterpiece by one the most acknowledged directors of our time watch alone or with friends does not matter you get the point,reality

i remember watching this movie when i was a little kid and what a great time i had at doing so because when youre this young you just dont care about plots or filmmaking so if you sit back and analyze this flick you wont find many oscar winning angles but that is not what this movie is trying to achieve we just may call this another typically silly tom hanks early ages movie that many have come to love at first sightsimply put this movie is all about funny situations and the comical performances of tom hanks and the dog that dog was a great actor nowadays i continue to enjoy it because the chemistry between hanks and the dog is very good,reality
is one of the best war movies ever made there are some faults to it but most of the times the movie is just breathtaking especially the beginning scenes at omaha beach since this movie historical fiction some of the aspects are not going to be real people should stop complaining about that in not only this but other historical moviesthis movie is about how the 2nd battalion led by captain miller tries to find the fourth brother to take him home because his three brothers died in warthe acting is very good here tom hanks is a staple in every movie hes in this is one of matt damons early movies this and good will hunting were the ones that brought him to considerable famethis was put forth a great effort by steven spielberg my alltime favorite director the war scenes were amazing john williams composed a great though small scoreoverall this is one of my favorite war movies there is tons of violence and gore though i rate this film 910,reality
if you love war movies should be your favorite the battle scenes at normandy are outrageously shocking and realistic and its beyond anything movie audience around the world has ever experienced before steven spielbergs genius shines once again his handheld camera style makes you feel like you are actually there on the battlefield in the middle of it all bullets whizzing by rockets exploding soldiers dying in great numbers as they are shred to pieces with all the heavy artillery raining down on them it is quite breathtaking and also saddening it is a story of a team of soldiers on a mission to save one private namely is the last son of a family who already lost 4 of their sons to war so the powers that be decide to do something nice for the mother and launches the mission rest is history this movie took the war movies to a different level strongly recommended,reality
theres not much more to say than this is an amazing movie spielberg did a wonderful job capturing the common brotherhood of soldiers in wwii he was able to tell a story about war death battles stress and fear but also being able to capture a comedic element between the soldiers which made the movie a bit more realistic this movie won many awards for a reason overall the movie blew me away no homo and will always be one of my favorite movies the war scenes in this movie where absolutely amazing and the graphic fight sequences rivaled that of the best war movies to date this movie will defiantly be a classic movieyou would be smart to watch this movie,reality
man was this good movie i cant believe i havent seen by now but now i have i love this movie the realism makes you feel like your with them in the battle the conversations they have feel real and the emotional strength it has is huge my favorite movie from steven spielberg used to be jaws but this has defeated it as for tom hanks movies this is so far my second favorite my favorite will always be gump but this is still a great film the first 24 minutes is in real time these minutes are one of the most gruesome things i have ever seen people die left and right people have their guts hanging out arms and legs are blown off it really is a powerful scene filled with realism acting performances are all great but the best as expected is from tom hanks overall this film is piece of genius4 stars out of 4,reality
ok im a girl who is not a big fan of movies with gunshots and war but i loved this movie the first 20 minutes alone earned spielberg the oscar for best director they are realistic you can see and really infiltrate the horror of d day you can feel the despair anger madness and courage of the american soldiers but what i loved the most was the fight of the principal characters for staying human and earn the right to go home after killing a lot of people bad guys but still people it keeps you at the edge of your sit wondering if they are gonna be able to find and when they do if they are gonna win the battle at ramelle the only negative thing i gotta say about this movie is that i expected that a principal character would die and surprise tom hanks diesgoing back to the beginning the first 20 minutes left my jaw on the floor im not american but my country helped the american soldiers with supplies and nursing and it makes you proud of pulling something right out of this stty messcongrats spielberg,reality
during the dday landings a squad of eight american soldiers is sent on a mission to rescue the sole survivor of four brothers who is trapped behind enemy linesthe films battle sequences particularly the omaha beach landing are among the most stunningly powerful of director steven spielbergs career but the episodic plotting is naggingly formulaic and the coda in a graveyard tips this nearly great film into unfortunate mawkishness grossed us4818 million worldwide making it the highestgrossing domestic film of the year the academy of motion picture arts and sciences nominated the film for eleven academy awards spielbergs direction won him a second academy award for best director,reality
many know steven spielberg as one of the most impressive and great film directors he was the one who brought us jaws et encounters of the third kind the indiana jones movies and schindlers list which i unfortunately havent had the pleasure of seeing yet however spielberg hasnt made such an emotionally empowering epic in all his life that is spr is about eight soldiers who are sent into german territory in world war 2 to find and return home a private whos three brothers were killed in combat everyone is great here but the one person who stands out the most is none other than tom hanks once again mrhanks plays an oscarworthy performance as a troubled american army captain who just wants to return home to his wife this film successfully captures the brutality and horror of war through up close and shaky handheld cameras you really feel like youre in the battle evading gun fire and witnessing people losing limbs and dieing horrible deaths in the end i give kudos to steven spielberg for delivering us a gripping and brutal film that has to be one of if not the best wwii movies of all time,reality
this movie was like no other the first twenty or so minutes it took you right into the heart of war like no other movie had done before the action was tense the carnage was in your face and the blood flowed freely then the movie added a rather sad excuse for a plot and the rest of the movie suffers because of this not to say it was not a good movie from the moment they get the plot on but it just feels cheapened by the whole lets rescue this one dude scenario most of the rest of the film is the troops searching from place to place with a few skirmishes here and there an interesting subplot though involves one of the american soldiers calling for the release of a nazi that the rest wanted to kill i found how that played out to be very intriguing it made for one of the tenses scenes in the movie in my eyes as the one guy was trying to drive the knife in another and you just knew the other guy was going to come in and turn the tide the cast is excellent as tom hanks is at his best here i can believe he did not get an oscar for this one and he did get one for forrest gump the only member of the cast i did not care for all that much is matt damon in the role of private he just did not have a 1940s look to him or like someone who had been in combat for a while like hanks troop still overall this is a very good picture and while i never saw shakespere in love i am still certain this film got robbed granted my score is not the best but that is my level of enjoyment for the film as a whole it most certainly merited some awards change the plot a bit though after the invasion scene and i think this one could have even been a ten to me a person who really is not all into war movies,reality
i read about how some people loved the movie and how some hated it for those who didnt like it well it is a movie it is an effort to replicate the happenings of a long time ago when neither of us was around luckily we do have a few directors who try to get real at such things  they try some succeed some make a fool of themselves and some go beyond what the people of then could understand and depict a story they feel is true complete and powerful enough to support reasonspr is a beautiful movie yes it does get a little slow and i did feel that steven did try forcing out emotions a little in some scenes but thats me  i hate any person who portrays army generals or commanders i can never understand why do they have to be the wisest of the lot id prefer a more humane leader  some whod be conflicted guilty and in the spur of the moment resolve to send in a team maybe of expendable soldiers to bring out a last sonso leaving the movie aside id comment on the technicalities sound  brilliant i was way too small when this movie hit the theatres so i saw it at home on my philips dolby surround and it hit me boom bang  centre it was piercing jarring ambient and well placed as for the music john williams couldve done better  it sounded very expected war hero symphony  so far ive not quite found a soundtrack that could outmatch james horner in apocalypto if you find onelet me knowcinematography is beautiful ive not seen a movie look like this very well set up and the reduced tones help bring out the sunlight and the serenity you can see destruction and beauty side by side the color disappears when it rain appears in the mornings the nights are darker so that distant firing can be made out in all it was very well taught ofdirection well i am not going to criticize the man who made schindlers and jaws steven is the god of film making and he knows it he has shown it he moves with the camera talks through his actors and is super fast at execution  you can feel the spontaneous takes in every scene still far from being kubrick but i doubt thered be anyone greaterps please do not make another indiana jones movie you totally are spoiling what youve earned you know that goes from me stan kyle  ericmy vote for spr  8  10,reality
i saw this when it was first released in 1998 and wrote a review which for some reason never got posted 500 films later and seeing tarantinos very idiosyncratic war movie inglourious barsterds i was reminded of this one where the story is played absolutely straight in a way to give the average american patriot goosebumps yet the rescuing of sergeant matt damon is actually a cynical effort by the high command to boost morale which puts eight brave men into jeopardy spielbergs battle scenes are really something  ten years later i still vividly recall the first 20 minutes on the normandy beach  the audience is put right in it other than that i remember a vivid fire fight in a ruined french village and the final scene 40 years later i had to be reminded that it was tom hanks who led the rescue team i do recall vin diesel in it too so the acting didnt leave much impression the actors were overpowered by all the actionperhaps comparing this blockbuster with tarantino is not fair both films entertain in there own way  spielberg who gives us splendid visuals is utterly conventional and offends very few viewers and tarantino does things his own way and doesnt care who he offends though he does not make light of atrocity has the second world war movie run its course even if the answer is yes we have not seen the end of war movies in general as long as there are wars there will be movies about them at least tells a coherent story and survival stories are usually both pretty gripping and mildly uplifting tarantino on the other hand is inclined toward nihilism but he does have fun getting there spielberg is more hard work but has to be one of his better films,reality
excellent movieit had great war scene than many other such as flags of our fathers which was a heroes films more than a war movie any movie that credits war heroes deserves praise and this one was exceptional the scenes were terrific and it tells us about the leadership qualities from the commander steven does it again in making the film one of the best  the line  earn this  earn it  will stay in my mind for ever  thats the importance of life no wonder it was selected as the bes war movie of all time thank you all the best,reality
to tell you the truth i didnt know much about ww2 other than what i read in books at school but this film really puts you there how they were able to take control of a beach wired to explode really makes you appreciate my freedom i just thought id start with thatoverall this is an excellent movie it really has a forties feel to it and its really intense from storming the beach in normandy to the final battle its was good but dont be fooled the story itself didnt actually happen it was a fictional story mixed into a real event we dont see this much titanic anybody but the story workedthe plot is about a squad of eight people trying to find the last remaining whos three brothers died so they can send him home theres a lot of good battle scenes along the way it might not be good for the faint of heart i read that they actually used real amputees for when people got their legs blown off so be warnedoverall id say this is a great film stephen spielberg directing tom hanks matt damon paul giamonti and vin diesel were in the mix if youre into action history or have a good heart i suggest watching this this film will break you down and make you feel for the people who put their lives down for your freedomi give it an 810,reality
at the beginning of the movie it starts out on the beaches of normandy and the action and battle scenarios there are very violent but gnarly at the same time the movie is very fast paced with many epic gunfights but there are also times when the actors show very passionate emotion which gives the story more feeling to go along with the constant killing the men in the platoon sent to rescue pvt are goofy fellahs themselves and joke around with each other all the time so there is also some comedyish parts in the soundtrack to this movie is epic it is well directed and the acting was muy bueno good the end of the movie was well done with the fadeout back to the present time and his face changing from young to old,reality
the film was generally very impressive i liked the accuracy of the weapons vehicles and uniforms the sets were very impressive and looked just like france did in 1944 even though things were all blown up and so on the most impressive part to me was not the main actors like tom hanks but the extras the random actors who played random soldiers whether they be dying on the beaches or fighting in the battlefield or even just laying on the ground dead i was impressed by the actors abilities to portray the soldiers fubar attitudes and then if needed portray a death with great realism the amazing scenes to me are the scenes with any speech just pictures like the images of the blood running down the beach or the dead bodies laying in the bunkers and beachhead or the scenes of the towns blown apart and in ruins,reality
i think that the movie show that how a company of rangers can risk there lives to help bring one back home after what happen to his family this ranger company went thought a lot in this journey to fine a man they lost many man how they know very well and had a good relationship with and fought in many different battles at a team and did many thins to help then find a man who they did not know at friend but as a other soldier in this war to bring peace to this man and family after what happen to his other brothers i feel that the rangers did the right thin to go bring a man back but a risk to lose one or two man i think that what happen to man was good thin because the man who lives in this journey that they now know that every man in ww2 is a brother and will do the same if it was you that lost every thin i believes that man did the right thin and will remember this for a long time and probably for ever it was really good i think it was good for the man because it made them a better person,reality
this movie was an american classic this is the first time i have seen this movie and i just want to say that it is much better than expected i have seen many war movies before like band of brothers and patton and this movie goes right up there with them the part that i really enjoyed was when they stormed the german radio bunker and they took a german prisoner the captain then made a controversial choice to let the man go free later in the final segment of the film we see the same released prisoner fighting against them i was really surprised when we saw him again because one of the terms of release was that he would turn himself over to the next american unit he saw i thought he wouldi also enjoyed that throughout the whole film the captains hand is quivering i think this is a physical manifestation of his mental breakdown i dont think he ever saw himself becoming a soldier and he is stricken with the grief of all the lives he has cost,reality
this movie is one that depicts the environment that a soldier in ww2 would live in it is a great movie the way that all of the characters acted throughout the film was in my eyes perfect each had a large dislike for what they were doing but also had an urge to do it they all have small flaws in their character for instance captain miller has a shaky hand probably caused by his life in the military and the stress put on by it also it shows how most soldiers are tough but also have a side that shows the true feelings of their character like before some of the men die they are talking to their mom or family members also most of the men are smokers and it shows that it is brought on by the war because upum claims that before he left for the army he never smoked but he says this with a cigarette in his mouthin conclusion this movie is top 5 war movies of all time and should be watched by all,reality
this is a very sad movie it makes me think about what the war was about and weather or not war is worth the cost that is always paid how would a mother feel if she had to receive a letter telling her that her son was killed in action in the letters in the movie is was said that the people who died honorably to protect the freedom of this country does that justify young men being send into battle and killed this movie does an excellent job of posing that question it does seem to make the argument that it is not worth it in the film the reason for the captain wanting to go save pvt is so he can go home to his wife the other point this movie makes about war is that all of the soldiers even the enemies are all human this is evident in the whole movie the germans are seen to be evil when they are fighting but when they surrender they seem like every other character in the movie,reality
this movie was at first not rated because of its gore and violent themes some countries refused to show it because they did not agree with the extreme graphic violence but steven spelburg did not back down and stood up for what he believed in he though that the only way to truly portray this movie was to have it include gratuitous amounts of violence and gore this was the only way to get through to the audience how horrible a conflict world war ii was and why we should do everything possible to make sure it never happens again because if it does happen again we will have to experience firsthand something none of us want to do but i digress the movie is extremely moving and we can identify with these soldiers who are thrust into conflict without necessarily wanting to they all have distinctive personalities and are very original the battle scenes really opened my eyes to how world war ii was like and the true level of the combat that took place during the war,reality
was a great representation of the events that occurred during dday some scenes were hard to watch with the realization that events shown in the movie did occur in real life i would like to have seen more in the movie about other events in the war i thought that the characters in the movie showed much development on how they felt about the mission they are on i thought that john millers role showed leadership and courage even in times of chaos private showed great courage and pride as he refused to leave the battle field when his services were no longer required i thought that upham showed fear at the end and was a disappointment as he failed to help his comrades upham didnt understand the horrors of war and therefore could not accept that he had to kill a prisoner in order to keep him from returning to the military even though it didnt seem like the right thing to do,reality
the movie had excellent detail and made me feel that i was there it didnt hold back on showing what war really was with all the gore dialog action and emotion that only thing it needed was the smell the camera angles did a great job showing what the soldiers had to do to survive the view of the aftermath showed how terrible war was the movie took time to show everything even the things we didnt want to see the only problem i had with the movie was the dialog between battles i thought that some parts just didnt work and were to long the dialog before and after the battles showed a lot of emotion but between the battles were poorly showed i lost interest during parts of the movie because of the dialog the movie was still good even with some poor dialog because it made up for it with its intense action i would recommend this movie to someone but i wouldnt call it excellent,reality
i liked the movie because it has a lot of action in it it also has some really good scenes from all over the world i also liked the acting from the actors the part i liked the most is when they had found him and are defending the bridge when they are trying to get on shore in the beginning of the movie i liked the character upum because i can see this happening to someone that has not been out on the field of the war the acting of tom hanks is i think the best because he dose the best acting in the whole movie i think that he gets into his character better than the others i also liked how they were able to get over obstacles by working together i also noticed that there was a lot of blood and shooting so i think that if you like war movies then you would like this movieyou would also like this movie if you like a movie with a lot of action so this movie is really good and i would see it,reality
this is a great movie that i would recommend to anyone who wants a good movie and has the time to watch a long movie this has everything a great movie needs with action a good plot and a care for the characters in the movie also the movie has great picture and sound making you feel like your really there along with the other troops fighting to save the world from evil another important thing the movie does is it tries to stay close to a believable battle and does not try to amp up the action by adding things that were not there before finally the movie makes great stride in allowing the viewer to connect its heros in the past to its heros of today by showing in the beginning of the movie a character that is seen in the movie later in his life with all these features working together in one great movie it is hard not to want to watch it again and again which can sometimes be hard with a movie of this length,reality
i cant believe this movie didnt get the best picture oscarits ten times better then shakespeare in lovei wont even mention that its one of the best directed movies everthe direction is simply perfecteven though i dont usually like steven spielberg because he directs a lot of science fiction movies but a got to give it to the manhe really can directi think he should hold on to the themes like this oneyou knowworld warii and soevery movie he made on world warii is a masterpiecejust look at schindlers list for exampleits a masterpiece toojust like saving privatethis movie has the most realistic war scenes everthe camera is shaky all the time and it fits great to the moviethe battles are sowowreally greata truly remarkable directing spielberg didremarkablei think you have to be a very skilled director to make an extraordinary epic movie out from a screenplay thats written in ninety present actiondont get me wrongthe screenplay is great too but the director is mostly responsible for this movie turning out to be so goodi also have to mention that the acting was very good tooi was mostly surprised by giovanni ribisihe truly acted great in this filmafcorse there was also tom hanks who is always great and so onthere is only one thing that i didnt like in the movie and thats the end of itnot the complete ending but the part when they find and when they tell him that his brothers are deadi dont knowhis reaction was just too normali mean i would be thinking about a suicide an he barely criedbut what a hellthe movie is still excellentanywaythis is a movie that i recommend to everyoneits great in every aspectjust turn it on and as soon as you see the first war scene on that beachyou will be amazedamazed1010,reality
was steven spielbergs tribute to the men who fought for freedom in the second world war the film begins with the dday landing before moving on to a mission with the express purpose of retrieving a private whose three brothers have recently fallen in combatthe story is loosely based on a similar case involving four brothers by the name of niland however robert rodats screenplay also uses to represent the unknown individuals that these soldiers risked and often lost their lives for the script is occasionally clumsy in its attempts at profundity but not enough to be a major distractionthe cast is a varied and wellassembled lot tom hanks secured the films only oscar nomination in the acting categories but the entire cast upholds a high standard of workmanship even actors whom i usually dont care for such as edward burns and vin diesel deliver performances that fit in seamlessly with their peers and their surroundings as a result i have to credit the casting director with finding the right actors for the right partsspielbergs direction won him his second oscar in that category and is everything that you would expect from him the first twenty or so minutes in particular the dday landing is riveting while spielberg continually shows himself capable of handling all situations and settings with aplomb of course this wouldnt be a spielberg film without a john williams score williams contributes a fine score here if not quite reaching the same lofty heights as his very best workall things considered is quite an achievement it boggles the mind that shakespeare in love beat this for the best picture oscar surely that is a snub to go down in history along with the likes of raging bull  apocalypse now,reality
truly amazing is one of those rarities its a war film with heart this amazing wwii film stars tom hanks as capt john miller a solider whos seen too much and who is done with war during dday him and his unit are ordered to find a single solider by the name of john francis a private in the airborne division who just recently lost all three of his brothers in combat now miller and his men have to bring back alive while out running the nazis and there conscious is a dedication to the men who died to protect there nation and there freedom they were soldiers who battled against oppression and evil they fought for what they believed was right and conquered and this film shows that one man is just as important as the rest i very highly recommend this astounding motion picture i hope my review helps  cr lopez,reality
when you think war movies now now you should only think of one this movie this movie is a true masterpiece it truly signifies war in a realistic environment there may be some cleches or wrong historical facts but that isnt whats truly important what is important is that this movie is a turning point in how everyone should judge any war movie its compelling and rich and full of emotion and drama it grips the viewer with significant empathetic features that only spielberg could pass as a youngster when i first viewed this and i still am compared to most on here i presume the first bullet to bullet packed minutes captured my mind and didnt let go its the first thing that ever made me actually think about war in another light before being young we think its all wiz bang boom youre dead after the first few minutes you can truly interpret what war really is horrifying this movie is one of my favourites the casting was perfect in every way and the directing also perfect i couldnt think of any better ways to make this movie better 1010 all the waythank you for viewing my comment,reality
when i first saw this on the big screen my senses were literally violently shaken my heart pounded with fear and adrenaline within the first 5 minutes no other war film made me feel like i was in it and feel the real horror that war is it comes sudden and when it does its relentless leaving you breathless on second viewing 10 years later on a small screen the shock element has of course slightly diminished but the impact and dare i say it adrenaline rush is still therei have since seen several war films which have used spielbergs ground breaking first person perspective war film tools such as thin red line band of brothers letters from iwa jima flags of our fathers etc in fact most of these apart from thin red line were produced by spielberg but none has bettered the astounding execution of brutal warfare as i now view it as the greatest action war movie of all time the mission to save private is a riveting one as the 8 protagonist soldiers undertake detour missions to reach their goal the soldiers are depicted as flawed sometimes confused sometimes disillusioned brave frightened cowardly rational irrationalall the elements of chaos that war brings and burdens the soldiers minds including their captains the squad comprises a typical range of characters perhaps some stereotypical in war films but all played wonderfully not over the top not caricatured but like real people that we may know hanks as ever superbly holds the film together as he leads his squad into the chaos my favourite character though is the clumsy bumbling interpreter who has limited combat skills and struggles to be brave a role wonderfully played by jeremy davies who later perfects those delightful hesitant mannerisms as daniel faraday in the lost tv series the most conflicting question being raised throughout the film and by each soldier was the worthiness of risking many lives or indeed wasting valuable resources to save one soldier who may or may not be alive this really is the main theme posing a great moral dilemmasome complain that there is absolutely no reference to other allies involvement but why is that necessary every ally had their own missions i am british yet i do not make any qualms britain has made their own war films with british only protagonists america can do the same they did fight too regardless of the fact they entered into it late but they did fight and no ally won the war by themselves the allies as a whole won the warbut i digress this movie can be classed as simply a great action packed war film but it is layered with moral conflicts incredibly brutal realism and fine performances all round a magnificent achievement that has yet to be bettered 10 years on,reality
the movie is basically about the wwii so its very violent and sad at some partssgt john h miller is ordered to set up a crew and go find another soldier named james franciswho had three more brothers who where killed in combatand the order is to take him out of normandy and return him homein the trans curse of finding this soldier two soldiers are killed  one of their murderer a nazi german soldier is set free by johnwhich showed weakness to the other soldiers on his commandat the end of the movie sgt john h miller is killed by the same german soldier who he had set freeat the end older james is standing in front of a tomb that has the name john h miller written on itin the memorial normandy cementery in francehis wife comes up to him and he asks her if he has been a good husbandthe wife answers of course yesremembering the last words that sgt john h miller said to him at the bridge earn it,reality
1993 saw the premier of schindlers list spielbergs bracing and emotionally scorching story about oskar schindler 1998 he revisits world war 2 and produces an equally powerful story about the saving of one mans life in the midst of post dday battles it is an appropriate temptation to compare his two seminal ww2 films both such very powerful dramatic stories both concern themselves with salvation with schindler on the large scale and just one man in the process of saving the many jews he did schindler was also somewhat successful in redeeming the moribund humanity within him tom hanks character in cpt john miller does not need personal redemption or salvation because he is a good man who does not shirk from the weight of difficult missions and onerous responsibilities however in the midst of what appears to be an utterly mad task by his crew we do wonder if any of them are transformed in a positive way we know from the opening moments of the film that private himself lived the remainder of his life with doubt as to whether the risk to save him and the cost to the small band of soldiers was worth the price paid carrying the survivors guilt heavily upon his shoulders greatly struggles to lift the doubts as he confronts millers grave it is a question that spielberg leaves in an ambiguous state left for the viewer to contemplateas a drama i found the script believable even if within the confines of a very important battle it stretches credibility to imagine that it could have happened i do not know if it is in whole or partially based on a true story i just had to accept that it might have happened even if far fetched spielberg has almost no peer as a story teller in film i am reminded of the moment in the film where miller thinks he has found the correct pvt proceeds to tell the hapless soldier the bad news sits and watches him take the news with a wincing pain and then finds out he has the wrong man the emotional roller coaster is incredibly wrenching to watch and think about the actors handle it superbly and to spielbergs credit once the point has been made the scene moves on with the story lurching forward to the point the finding ofthe special effects have been the subject of much praise id have to say that the opening sequence is about as shocking and gruesome a depiction of war in its ferocious misery as you can imagine it sets the tone for what is to come much close at hand battles and a lot of people dying as the great civil war union general sherman was known to have said you cannot qualify war in harsher terms than i will war is cruelty and you cannot refine it and there is many a boy here today who looks on war as all glory but boys it is all hell these sentiments overhang the entire movie and limit the usual tendency of spielberg to drift into sentimentality we are given enough of an immersion into the gore of war and all that remains is hellthe movie wants to focus on tom hanks and from some points of view it does however i think that this is the obvious reaction you watch this film a few times and you begin to notice how many fascinating and well developed characters come to life there is so much room in this film to be inclusive and generous with character development and spielberg takes full advantage even the german soldier that miller saves another soul saved at the least opportune time in the most surprising of circumstances remains much more than a cipher he returns to duty and the duty is to kill allied soldiers was miller a dreamy fool a morally rigid person why did he let the soldier go free when the battle had cost him a very valuable soldier in his unit what is spielberg saying here why save this mans life and also save pvts life it is left unexplained and even as that characters resolution comes we are left scratching our heads wondering what to make of it i think that ambiguity is appropriate for the madness of the battle when in extreme moments of great stress people often reach decisions that they would never consider if posed in a quiet moment all of this sits firmly within the overall question that hangs over the film should pvt be saved and at what cost should the german soldier not be saved and why shouldnt he have been taken prisoner to be given over to authorities later on in one his strongest and finest roles surrounded by outstanding actors who all deliver 100 given a huge landscape full of boffo special effects tom hanks carries an important film forward into a tragic but believable ending war is the great leveler and who survives and who dies is an imponderable question coming away from this emotionally draining film we do wonder a classic worthy of all its awards stick around for the credits as john williams ends the movie with a very stirring choral piece,reality
this is one of the most powerful movies i have seen depicting the moral dilemmas man struggles with during wartime i have seen this film about 10 times and it still impacts me in the same way the bonds of brotherhood run deep but seems to be squad deep the squad led by captain john h miller played by tom hanks struggles with the question of why do they have to risk their lives to save the life of one man this struggle continues to become more painful with the loss of each man killed in the line of duty millers statement i just know that every man i kill the farther away from home i feel give a glimpse into the emotional toll war has on the human mind and soul this struggle seems to overshadow the deeper struggle cpl timothy p upham has with the right the rest of the squad has with being judge jury and executioner when dealing with a lone german soldier after being taken prisoner after befriending upham he wins freedom from execution but this in turn comes back as a haunting reminder of the possible consequences of mercy in wartime i found the scenes revolving around the return of the german soldier and his disregard for the men who offered freedom instead of execution to cause me to think about how i would have reacted uphams struggle with fear was painful to watch but more painful was the realization of what his inaction had caused the transformation of the man from compassionate concerned human being to judge jury and executioner as the german soldier reminds him that they are friends and again pleads for his life upham asks him what is my name after he answers upham kills him what went through uphams mind i cant help but wonder if he would have spared his life if he had not remembered by remembering his name does the german soldier make a statement about his disregard for the gift of freedom he had received i cannot help but wonder how i would react when presented with the same dilemma to judge or not to judge the choice to take human life or not using rational means to justify one actions the struggle to maintain ones humanity during war must be one of the greatest struggles man endures so what do we do with the scripture in matthew that says do not judge or you too will be judged 2 for in the same way you judge others you will be judged and with the measure you use it will be measured to you ,reality
a great movie excellent directing by stephen spielberg this film uncovers and shows the public the horrors of war this also shows what kind of pain and suffering war veterans went throughthis film also dramatically portrays the normandy invasion specifically omaha beach also moving scenes like george marshal reading abe lincolns letter helped add to the drama of this film another excellent part of this movie was john williams dramatic and chilling soundtrack songs like hymn to the fallen left me in tears also sensational acting by tom hanks tom sizemore jeremy davies edward burns was another major factor in this films success overall an excellent anti war film that shows how war can split apart families and change the lives of ordinary people,reality
sometimes i wonder if ive changed so much my wife is even gonna recognize me whenever it is i get back to her and how ill ever be able to tell about days like today ahh i dont know anything about i dont care the man means nothing to me hes just a name but if you know if going to finding him so he can go home if that earns me the right to get back to my wife well then then thats my missioni am sure other reviewers who have reviewed spr have rated it as the best war movie ever made and i agree to think that this movie did not win best picture is a crime director steven spielberg used all of his talent and resources to give to the world the greatest war film ever madegreatest things about spr are first of all the sensational highly awarded and celebrated camera work that actually gives audience the feeling of being in the battlefield too thats what makes the film such a thrilling vivid and incredible experienceit puts the the viewer from the comfortable living room chair to out there and puts himher go through this hell and every nightmarish detail thats part of it other marvelous thing is a good story little extraordinary and different from what the usual war films normally have thats what keeps the movie interesting all the wayspr is just outstanding spielberg thrusts the viewer into the normandy campaign and you need a strong stomach to endure this the films opening scene has been billed as the best dday scene of all time and it rightly deserves that the attack on dog green sector omaha beach is arguably the most realistic movie portrayal of battle notwithstanding that breakthrough actually took over three hours also one of the things that stand out most in this film is the effectsyou experience the sound of bullet whizzesexplosionsand the eerie sound of approaching tanks on a quiet little bombed out town a brilliant innovation is the color reduction over 50 which makes you really believe it is 1944 music is used to great effect in moments of calm the brutality of battle is clearly demonstrated as is the sadness of loss of life yet the campaign is necessary to end the tyranny of hitler and nazi ideologythe storyline is a real strength and the characters  acting are superb captain miller tom hanks carries out his mission hoping to return to his wife only his shaking right hand alludes to the inner turmoil he struggles with from soldiers dying under his command he is well supported by sergeant horvath tom sizemore who maintains discipline within the squad but some cannot contain their doubts and even anger that eight lives should be risked to save one life though every man has a mother you cannot help feel that matt damon must be saved out of decency himself selflessly stays to defend his outnumbered brothers in spite of the disaster to befall his family finally steamboat willie humanizes the germans when pleading for his life befriended by upham he is released yet returns to battle his death shows that men who could otherwise be friends will kill each other in waronly a few historical inaccuracies detract from the brilliance of spr often outnumbered the germans conquered most of europe by 1942 through tactical skill in battle something missing in their clumsy attack on ramelle and tanks had bulletproof glass over vision ports so driver and radio operator could not be killed so easily a role for the british was lacking sadly a hawker typhoon could not be used to bomb the tiger tank another historical inaccuracy people have noticed is the church tower in ramelle which according to german tacticswould of have been destroyed as it would give an advantage to the enemy but i dont think it will detract from the film in fact a good knowledge of ww2 history is important in order to place this film in context overall this tactical and human story within the carnage of ww2 is a must see for anyone who watches war movies and dont miss the message in captain millers last words james earn this earn it the question this film poses is is it truly worth it to sacrifice the lives of many for one person this is the same question which private reiben asks to hanks the whole dialog go like this pvtreiben you want to explain the math of this to me i mean wheres the sense in risking the lives of the eight of us to save one guycaptmiller anyone wanna answer thatmedic wade hey reiben think about the poor basds mother pvt reiben hey wade i got a mother you got a mother the sarge has got a mother st ill bet that even the captains got a mother well maybe not the captain but the rest of us have got mothersyou have a great weekend,reality
well this movie is one of the least movies which succeeded in describing the brutality of world war ii from both sides the axis forces  the alliance forces thought hitler was really magnificent in making a real strong defence bases in normandy  in all the countries whom he enteredbut there is only something which i think it is not realistic it is the story of the movie i do not think that in this war  people are dying everywhere i  alliance forces  would risk the lives of a good party like john millers party to save one soldier behind the enemy lines  not any enemy it is the hitler forces  though there were millions who might be saved in the airborn eventit may be taken from a real story in fact i do not know but overall its an excellent movie i recommend it for anyone who wants to see the world war ii realisticthank you very much,reality
starring tom hanks and an allstar cast was one of the best war films ive ever come across its mixture of violence gore drama and brotherhood between the 8man unit was a different view of world war 2 most war films just get stuck into random violence and dont take the time to explore the lives and views of the soldiers fighting for their country and their allies with private matt damon loses his three brothers in other parts of the world millers hanks unit must track him down to bring him back homealmost immediately carpozo vin diesel is killed and the mission takes an ominous turn after a false alarm the team finally finds but not before their medic wade is killed whilst trying to capture a german machine gun batteryat the end of the film after a large battle most of the squad is annihalated and hanks is hit by two german bullets which in the end terminate his life but his mission was accomplished survived along with upham and mellisha great war film and a must see for any war filmloving fan,reality
i think that the academy was drunk when the voted shakespere in love best picture over this masterpiece this movie was my favorite movie for many reasons first of all this is a lot better than the thin red line had great acting from pretty much everyone tom hanks should have won best actor for this film his performance was excellent he plays captain john h miller he acts strong in front of his squad to set an example for them and he hides his emotions from them he makes brave and stupid decisions during war but his performance was great tom sizemore did a great job in this movie along with edward burns barry pepper adam goldberg jeremy davies matt damon and pretty much everyone else paul giamatti had a cameo in this movie cpt miller and his squad must go behind enemy lines to rescue paratrooper james whos three brothers died in combat in my opinion this is steven spielbergs greatest achievement and tom hanks best performance i give everyone my highest recommendation though the violence may scare people away no doubt my favorite movie of all time,reality
has one of the best performances by all characters while still signifying war as a bloody gruesome and meaningless battlethe movie unlike many other war movies the great raid or even pearl harbor follows a group of soldiers on a mission to save private the fighting scenes are very accurate and very gruesome is not one that drags on but one that you enjoy the entire 2 hours and 50 minutes tom hanks has done a great performance as well as all the others one of steven spielbergs greatest master pieces,reality
i have seen many world war ii films many of them very well written and acted out but few measure up to the class of the films gore language among other vulgarities are extremely well represented but it is the end that got meduring the final scenes of the movie when hanks and his men have fought a hard and difficult battle hanks character john miller has been mortally wounded and dies in the arms of one of his soldiers incidentally the man he and his squad rescued james returns to the grave of his superior officer years later salutes and the legacy of a heroic soldier remains though he has been dead for decades a film that made me weep like never before a nine out of 10 in my book,reality
possibly spielbergs seminal work i dont think that there have been any of his movies worth watching since this film was made at a time when spielberg had great ideas and knew how to utilize the camera without selling out completely to hollywood standards nevertheless is very much hollywood but that being said its a very eloquent rendition of thatif you remember anything about war movies its the antiwar ones that make a difference and are the ones remembered i firmly believe that is up with the best of that genre namely full metal jacket and platoontom hanks plays his role marvelously he is forced to act as a liaison between his crews demands with the orders given to him and it is certainly isnt an easy task this movie is probably one the most accurate vignettes of the american world war ii experience yet maderating 910 please tell me that i am a good man and that i have lived a good life  private,reality
while i think that is a great movie i really have a problem with the scene featuring the german prisoner they capture at the machine gun sitesurely soldiers in that positionalready gone thru some awful combat just getting into the country who had just lost one of their members to the enemy wouldnt be dicking around taking prisonersand although it might show us soldiers in a bad light i think that scene would have been more accurate if they had just killed him on the spotalthough i realise that would interfere with the part that german soldier plays later on in the movieother than that a terrific film and that opening scene of the landing has to be one of the greatest pieces of film making of all time,reality
this film is a heartbreaker because 53000000 men died  all over the world  to prevent that deadly stunning omaha beach battle yet came the korean war the attempted invasion of cuba the vietnamese war the gulf war the somalian war we turnedtail and ran that mess in afghanistan which has never been conquered and now the fiasco in iraq the cradle of civilization as we know it theres a tale making the rounds that our president was upset because they tried to shoot my daddy he wanted to get sadam hmmmmhow many times do you think weve tried to do that doesnt assassination go with leadershipshould have been a graphic lesson that all wars are useless bravado and hell except for those who win   because it is inhumane for one sovereign country to attempt to dictate to another an anonymous commentator wrote lets hope that this is the last war have they been living in a vacuum for a couple of generations or perhaps too young to have experienced the horror of wartime perhaps ww 2 was supposed to be the war to end all wars but that completely dismisses mans inhumanity toward man some races just dont like other races as we are seeing in iraq  and they all are from the same race  if you can read between the lines of the headlines today the next war will be over the lack of water or a specific religionor some belligerents idiot will launch an atomic weapon that will destroy life as we know it if that is going to happen please let me know when so i can get right under itno one has mentioned watching into the breach which depicts the basic trainingperiod the actors were forced to go throughjust like regular grunts one of the actors stated he would not do that again all of them hated it but all of their roles were greater for having experienced itis near perfect in all ways acting through direction through casting through cinematography through realism my opinion is that tom hanks underplayed his role to make a point that ordinary men usually get the biggest responsibility in battle its the grunts who do the fighting  the bigwigs are behind in a safe area blackhawk down serves as a perfect example sizemore was the seasoned warrior and played his role superbly barry pepper in an entirely different role than in the green mile gave us a believable soldier who took his fighting seriously but asserting the lord in my shepherd masterful matt damon was brilliant as he is in all of his roles his statement these are the only brothers i have left was a natural turning to those who had become his brothers upham made me cry because i understood his cowardice  he didnt try to hide it  it was palpable quite frankly i didnt recognize ted danson quite a star in his day in the film spielberg knew what he was doing and did itthe most specific demonstration in this movie is how different the fighters in are from modernday fighters jarhead will show you that recruiting our youngest men to become killers is criminal  except some of them have no other route to make their way in our worldwe needed this movie  to remind us that we are on the way to a collision with the rest of the world brits decried they were not part of this battle  they were up at another beach being killed just as brutally all of the countries involved made the same sacrifice our memorial day honors all of those who lost their lives for freedom if we are looking for movies to merely demonstrate what a great soundsystem we have thats pitifuluntil another ones comes along is the best warpicture weve had  everyone should see it,reality
the opening to this film provides perhaps the most gutwrenching battle scenes ever filmed the sounds of bullets whizzing through the air and screams of the wounded and dying coupled with an occasional momentary respite from the cacophonous din of battle while underwater had me trying to crawl over the back of my theater seat just trying to get away the story line is adequate but for me the real value was the historical glimpse into what my fathers generation faced during the european campaigns of wwii this movie clearly explains the message war is hell,reality
this is an excellent movie it may be a little violent for a kid under thirteen this movie should be played in every history class studying world war ii once again steven spielberg has created another astounding masterpiece with an amazing cast and crew tom hanks does an amazing job performing as a soldier each actorsoldier have their own unique personality from the beginner soldier to the veteran sniperyes one could argue that this movie has its imperfections but few movies are perfectly flawless i liked for its depiction of dday at normandy and how it ends the movie this is by far one of my favorite war films if you werent able to catch it in the theaters go watch it,reality
as well as praisethis film also received a lot of criticism at the time of its release because of its proamerican viewso what this is an american financed filmmade by americansfor american audiences with american actors and the beach landing on omagh were done by american servicemen i cant see why spr should be snubbed at because of thisit wasnt the first and wont be the last war film to be made from an american point of viewis an excellent war film and deserves its billing as one of the top 10 war movie of all timethe opening omagh beach landing scenes are horrifically realisticshowing the viewer as best a film can what it must of been like for those men on that fatal morning in june 1944 when them landing craft ramps went down all hell broke loss and the us rangers were just cannon fodder for the germans up above in their machine gun bunkers a lot as been said about the missleading of the normandy beach landing scene in the beginning of sprsome viewers of the film say that the overload operation lead by the britishcanadian and americans were not as blood thirsty as has portrayed in this film yes this trueit is a fact that only 1 out of every 7 allied soldiers actually fired a weapon on dday but omagh was as chilling as it is seen in sprafter the first 30 minutes of one of the most graphically violent battle scenes ever witnessed on screen the film moves onto it its main story8 soldiers lead by capt miller on a mission to find a private in the 101st airborne division lost somewhere in normandy so that he can return him home to his mother after the us top brass as learned that three of her sons have just been killed in combata bit of a pr mission so to say through the mission the gis tell us of their views of the war and the mission they are onwhats the point of risking eight lives to save one some are killed in combat along the way as they meet german opposition raising the pointless of the mission with anger among the mentill they eventually find pvt who as hooked up with another platoon that are defending a bridge that the germans want for their counter attackall this leads to a grand finale battle between the american gis and the battle hardened waffen ss inside a bombed out normandy villagethe battle scenes in spr are authentic enough first on omagh after a pinned down onslaught the rangers make easy pray of the german troopsthis is because the german regiments along the normandy coast were mainly made up of eastern european conscripts captured from german occupied territory in the east and forced to fight by the nazis in german divisionshitler thought the main landing zone for the allies would most likely be caliasso the front line worriment were stationed there but in the final battle scene in this film the gis faced much more resilient opposition in the form of the ss who we see give the americans a real fightthe gis are only saved from being wiped by the ss thanks to an air attack on the german line by p51sall in all is an excellent movie if you like bloody all out war battle scenesthe director steven spielberg brings the killing scenes right up close to the camerathe script is ok but can be a bit sentimentally at timestrying to reason war through the eyes of spielbergin dialogue from the characters by the waybut this isnt enough of a problem to spoil the film,reality
one of the greatest war films ever made is an intense and graphic portrayal of the closing days of wwii the film captures accurately the sounds reality colour even the smells of the warspielberg deserves praise for his charismatic contribution to this masterpiece and he received ittom hanks leads a suiting cast through the marshlands of northern france to rescue the last surviving brother after a direct request from a high ranking official risking his and his mens lives in the dangerous path to rescue jamessuperbly directed spielberg leaves the holocaust and takes on the bloody dday invasion in this beautiful war film depicting hell on earthis truly a superb example of undisputable nononsense filmmaking about the war while not sentimental it is extremely powerful undoubtedly the best picture of 98spielbergs direction is so incredible in this film that makes the film so real it is unbelievableone of the few war films that portray war as accurately as possible hell and does that it peaks in to the gates of hell brutally realisticuncomfortable psychological and ultimately one of the best films to come out of america in the last 15 years,reality
everything in this film is perfect its hard to criticise this movietom hanks is brilliant in his role of captain john miller a ranger in the american army sent behind enemy lines with a small band of soldiers each unique in their own way to retrieve a private from the 101st airborne whos 3 brothers had been killed in the previous weeksis an amazing insight into the soldiers war with heart gripping scenes such as the opening landing on omaha beach it leaves you feeling overwhelmed and humble one of the superb things about this film is that it manages to create a sort of relationship between you and the individual soldiersthis is by far one of hanks best films yet and a true masterpiece from spielburg you will not be disappointed with this the camera work is outstanding with shots seen through the eyes of a moving soldier every directorial aspect of this film draws out the horror and suffering experienced by so many young men during the warthere is none of the clich american hero bravado you tend to see too often in hollywood spr shows the young boys of america at their ultimate test it shows the darker personal side when a grown man cries and crumbles in the face of danger a must see,reality
possibly the best war movie ever both in terms of story and visuals no other war film has managed to convey the constant hell that was world war ii whilst at the same time illustrating the bonds of comradeship between soldiers quite so effectively and movingly the film manages to be realistically graphic in its depiction of war and its associated death and injuries without being gratuitous with the claret no punches are pulledthe story opens with the dday landings on omaha beach filmed with brutal realism and then moves on to the mission of eight men who go behind enemy lines to rescue one man each of the men begin to question their orders their place in the war and the cost to their humanitythe film won countless awards for its realism and its harrowing story including steven spielberg garnering the best director oscar at the same time however it never tries to present itself as historical fact rather a historical scenario with a fictional story placed on top the main mission may be fictional but the subplots such as the importance of defending the bridge are definitely based on fact tom hanks is superb as captain miller the man assigned to lead the retrieval unit sent behind enemy lines ed burns barry pepper adam goldberg giovanni ribisi and vin diesel all provide competent performances as brothersinarms and tom sizemore is unusually the rather understated sergeant the men form a strong bond a bond between men which would spielberg would explore further with his band of brothers miniseries whilst undergoing a dehumanization process with regards to their enemy matt damon has little more than a cameo as the eponymous the film is both moving and gripping and the 150minute running time is barely felt such is the intensity the subject matter is dealt with further such was the impact of the film that several scenes in particular the storming of normandy beach were almost shotforshot recreated in the computer game medal of honor allied assault the apparent waste of resources on this rescue mission a waste which is highlighted and questioned by the soldiers in the chosen unit is not only a poignant story but also serves to highlight the sheer frustration of the waste and pointlessness of war in general together with schindlers list steven spielberg has created two films which are probably the finest monument to the second world war and its atrocities of modern times and with these also cements his place as the finest director of his generation,reality
as a large fan of war movies i can easily say that this is the most realistic war movie i have ever seen the sequences of battle though gruesome convey the horrors and intensity of combat surrounding world war ii though the story is fictional the invasion of normandy was depicted accurately and powerfully in great detail mechanical and historical accuracy is evident most of the time in the movie private james is a paratrooper during world war ii during the invasion he is mislaunched and lands near a small french village he has three brothers who are also fighting in the war that have been killed in action when the commanders of the army realize this they order a rescue unit to retrieve and bring him home so that his mother does not have to receive word that all of her sons have died in combat the leader of this unit is captain john miller portrayed by tom hanks the performances by him and the rest of the people he commands is outstanding and the drama of the war is not underdone or overdone for those people who negatively criticize this move due to its gore should realize that world war ii was like that and the facts are being shown as they are they have not been tampered with which is an excellent thing spielberg combined his past experience with superb acting special effects and history to create an incredible tapestry of absolute cinematic brilliance easily the finest war movie ever created,reality
shows the horrific sacrifice of the enlisted men in world war 2 and how our freedom was won by a barbaric tactic to swarm the beach with american british and canadian troops and push the nazi army back into the european countries which they dictated long before he allies invasion 8 men risk their lives to save private james so he can carry out the family name he was the remaining son of which his 3 brothers died is a paratrooper and jumped into deep behind enemy lines where captain miller tom hanks and his men has to save private steven spielberg shows us the heartfelt story that will change the way you think about world war 2this is my favorite movie not because of the gore and blood but the story of these 8 men risking their live for one one man one out of all the troops in francein europe in the worldnags,reality
this is one of the most realistic war movies i have seen it captures the horror and drama of war through a very interesting plot the scene at dday was a scene that followed me around for awhile it showed how unfair war can be the men in the boats that were being raked by mg42s had no chance to fight back they just stood there and got killed then there was the wounded soldier that the three medics were trying to save they had managed to stop the bleeding but a chance stray bullet hit the wounded soldier in the head killing him instantly this movie was a great war movie that everyone should enjoy at some point in their lives there were some historical flukes like the reversal of the password flash followed by thunder they said thunder flash otherwise this movie was amazing,reality
not that many films have actually been realistic in showing the how utterly disturbing and horrific experience that war is we were soldiers was utter propaganda nonsense as was black hawk down which solely focused on violence windtalkers and tears of the sun werent great either they didnt try and focus on how utterly disturbing and disgusting the war was no they tried to create actionfilms to be viewed purely as popcorn entertainment and on some levels they succeeded but was a bar above the rest a disgusting realistic beautiful attempt to show how horrible the war was also showing as an entertaining movie too when its spielberg you know its businessafter a stomachchurningly horrific opening 20 minutes in which limbs are torn and guts are spread across the beach the film gets right to the point with one of my favourite actors vin diesel in the team they set off after orders to find james matt damon as per instructions given to them by an army base this disturbingly realistic film really shows what hell war is not just in the fight scenes after the first one on the beaches of normandy they are infrequent but what depths men have to go in war to complete the task given to them ie trudging on in all conditions and it realistically portrays the madness of it all only platoon and apocalypse now have had anywhere near the effecthorribly graphic and tearjerkingly beautiful steven spielberg creates another timeless masterpiece that will assure that the full 161 minutes stay in the memory for a long long timeoverall  out of  5 out of 5,reality
received accolades from the us armed forces for its realistic depiction of dday common sense dictates that they could have gone for lots more bloodystump scenarios without violating the prerequisite of realistic the fact that they made a profound statement and didnt go that route speaks well of this movie projectanyone who desires to serve their country by going into combat should watch this one the ideal of glory of battle would quickly be dispelled real warfare is gross sickening chaotic disgusting tragic it must be a last resort and ones motivation should be a very deep sense of commitment to the cause of democracy not freedom to do whatever one feels like but a concept of humanity that says everyone has intrinsic value this is what our theocentric founders had in mind when they drafted the constitution and the declaration of independencetom hanksand a fine cast,reality
all i have to says is that abc deserves awards for showing an uncut version of this superb epic on veterans day abc did this despite any possible fcc stuff coming back at them 66 affiliates got scared when you watch the movie which you cant really call a movie you dont even notice the language because it puts you in the middle of southern france in june of 1944 veterans day needs to be honored like memorial day in this country as a real holiday not some holiday like lincolns birthday people fight for our country and have died for it virtually every day for 3 years the persian gulf and of course the countless numbers from vietnam the forgotten war korea and ww2 which is beyond well represented in this film,reality
ive noticed reading the reviews that a lot of the negative comments are complaining that certain scenes arent as good as similar ones in other moviesits a great movie you cant just say that because certain parts arent as good as another movie that this one is bad ok so what if it has been a little hollywoodized is that right s arent most moviesits like some people think im not gonna like this movie before they actually watch it so all through theyre just picking any pointless little thing to bitch about,reality
is it my excess of cynicism or my tradition of dislike for anything spielberg or are they the same thing that leads me to wonder why theres so much hype about saving privatesure the battle scenes are grippingly shot but not more so than oliver stones platoon was more than a few years back and more annoyingly for all the mtv camera tricks like strobing and tacky colors out of old life magazines sure the sets and scenes are done up perfectly with lots of expert consultants on hand just as in schindlers list which seems to be the wwii partner movie to this one must be another one on the way stone had three on vietnam and sure the cast delivers up solid performances led by tom hanks who breaks as far out of his light comic mold as his very respectable talents allowbut you cant forget its spielberg the assault on normandy is the meat of the story just as the concentration camps were in schindler but again spielberg cant just tell it he make a sandwich wrapping the meat with his specialty white bread as in schindler presentday survivors  in modern color  visit the graves of the dead who so bravely gave or at least risked their lives that others might live in case your head is impervious to spielbergs hammer the deal is that the living owe it to the dead to prove they deserve the gifts of life and libertyget it we owe it bang to the greatest generation to be good people bang thats right because bang we are private bang bang bangof course spielberg being spielberg he leaves us with a reassurance rather than a challenge based on his wifes affidavit and his familys allamerican good looks our avatar turns out to be welldeservingand so are we all everyone now we can sink back into our smug torpor,reality
this was a great film however i think the message of the film was to try and relay the waste and horror of war this message was clouded by the typical hollywood ending to have a panzer division obliterated almost instantly by a couple of p51s and to have dozens of german ground troops surrendering to the nerdy translator was very unrealistic and typically american the film would have served a better purpose if hollywood had not insisted that the calvary once again saved the day had been captured at the end to become a prisoner of war would have allowed the film to maintain the oldyoung plot without all of the last minute heroics which made a very powerful film somewhat cheaper,reality
hmm steven spielberg was as phenomenal as usual with the directing of this epic milestone tom hankss performance was as intriguing as it can get all the characters had their separate uniqueness captain john miller played by hanks is a retired school teacher who struggles to accept the reality he and his men are in even though he hides his true emotions from his group he afterwards shows his feelings towards the mission sgt mike horvath tom sizemore plays one of the most important parts in this film hes the captains closest friend and companion his respect towards the captain is more than acceptable private richard reiben edward burns is the desperate soldier who shows his frustration and anger towards the mission and another guy private jackson barry pepper is the silent and confident sniper his character is to me the best in the film part of it is because of how he praises the lord while blowing the germans away it all gives the viewer a sense of belief the story characterizes the true monstrosity and utter horror that is war especially ww2 until i saw this did i realize the importance of knowing what our heroes went through every day then something to admire plot cast only minus was the apparently nonexistent allies but nevertheless great film the large content gives the viewer an overwhelming view of reality and how gruesome people can be during war time its an emotional film and definitely one to remember 1010,reality
it amazes and sickens me how people judge movies by the quality of the message or how many goofs it has or whatnot and when the movie doesnt live up to these targets they decry it as not having a single piece of valueits unrealistic so what it portrays american soldiers without giving a glance to the british canadians whatever way to go political correct soldiersi dont give a toss about any of that crap i bought the dvd to see a good movie and i got a good movie a movie with touching emotion gory battle scenes and an unrealistic tragic plot that warms the heartthats what im looking for now while im not asking you politically correct legions to change your minds about how you perceive this movie but for heavens sake how funtouchingwhatever this movie is has nothing to do with how many nonamerican soldiers are includedget off the lets hate america boat just because some loser thinks going to war for oil is fun doesnt give you licence to insult americans who did die for a good cause no bad feelings meant for those who do give the american soldiers in wwii creditand for the record im not american nor have i ever set foot on european nor american soil,reality
honestly steven spielberg is a movie making genius this along with schindlers list are the best films in my opinion ever made the photography the scripts the acting the visual effects are all 100 brilliant in both these films is about one man tom hanks  leading his troops into the depths of war to save private james  matt damon  and bring him home to his desperate mother a warning to all those people who can not handle graphic war scenes this is the most horrific and brutal war movie ever made it depicts war at its worst this film will make you think twice about supporting any war at all however spielberg directed this will be a mystery to me it looks so real tom hanks is brilliant as always along with an up and coming actor who steals the show barry pepper he is most powerfuli advise people who want to see a master at work see saving privatepaul,reality
is according to me one of the most realistic warmovies ever made in the beginning of the movie we see an old veteran visiting the graves of the people who lost their lives in an effort to save in this movie we see the madness of war and the traumas which people carry all their lives with them in this movie a group american soldiers get the mission to save because in his family already some brothers fell on the battlefield and the code wants that the last brother must be saved this movie shows actually the madness about the fact that more people have to die for saving one life the beginning of the movie is very realistic when the americans reach omaha beach and i think that in that time it was like that because thousands of soldiers did not even have the chance to reach the beach but after a long battle the german defence breaks which meant the beginning of the liberation the germans expected that the allies should cross the canal so the most troops were stationed over there which coursed weak points in the german defence at omaha beach the actors like tom hanks delivered a very realistic movie about the madness of war which some personalities create in this world even today a 9 out of 10 they deserve for sure,reality
the review by our finnish friend stated that americans for all their good intentions in world war 2 were just as loathsome as the nazisnow one certainly cant argue that americans like every nationality in history committed war crimes and its true that there was segregation and we interred the japanese but to compare america to germany which tried to invade and enslave several countries and put to death millions in death camps as well as other crueltiesand didnt show americans as perfect i recall scenes of gis shooting unarmed germans trying to surrender another scene showed a gi telling his comrades not to shoot the germans set afire by a flamethrower to put them out of their misery plus uphams cowardicewhere in spr are germans shown in a poor light steamboat willie had his life spared and rejoined the german armywas he supposed to say sorry i promised the americans i would sit out the rest of the war the sniper shot carpazzowas he not supposed to shoot an enemy and carpazzo was not holding the child at the time so its not like the sniper was trying to kill a childso tell me where germans were made to look evil and americans were made to look perfect in spr,reality
is not a mindless charade of the glory of warit goes much much deeper than probably any war film i have seen it explores the fellowship of men banding together to save one private so that they can go home to their wives and the brutal obstacles they encounter in the unpredictable situation of war we witness an unforgettable impeccable account of the most notorious siege in war history dday in such personal graphic and unflinching detail that we find ourselves aboard the ships swimming to the bloody shores in the scorn of relentless battle the direction throughout the film is superb sincere unapologetic and poignant as spielberg takes us on a historical journey through the plights of these heroic men and we witness every horror every tragedy and every act of courage which comprises the uncertain the most fatal of situations war we are compelled by these soldiers personal stories their desires to someday return home and tell of their heroism to their grandchildren to live happy complete lives after this dangerous task we are emerged into battle as the americans and germans are desperate and unrelenting in witnessing the others demise as this is the constant case of war the ruins of the towns and its horrified citizens crying for mercy cause us to shudder with graveness and sympathy as we encounter the unfortunate cost of war the music is hearty and reverent the sounds of the trumpets saluting those heroes survived and fallen and victims of war from the brutal plights of battle to the starking realization of survival being the only hope to the grim deliverance to a mother a notice that her child has fallen in war it is beautiful passionate and reinforces a theme of elegy prevalent throughout the film this is one somber reflective and honest account of the last great war and it is touching engaging and uncompromising in its infallible homage to a time of sacrifice and the men who comprise that honor the best war movie i have ever seen  out of ,reality
this is an american film about a particular incident surrounding one us soldier we all know many participated in the liberation of europe and asia but every film doesnt have to be a mix i wonder how many foreign films give the us any or much credit for the enormous contribution it did make when the sleeping giant was aroused i remember seeing the longest day in germany in 1963 in a german theater funny thing was the audience cheered at the wrong times the paratroopers landing in st mere eglise for example were cheered when they were being slaughtered and please dont tell us what a genius montgomery was that war would still be waging if all the generals were like ol monty trying to get his act together i wont even go into the brilliance of the us 3rd army manuvering in battle to relieve bastonge,reality
tom hanks tom sizemore matt damon edward burns barry pepper adam goldberg vin diesel giovanni ribisi and jeremy davies star in one of the best war films ever made hanks stars as capt john miller leader of a public relations mission to bring home the last of four brothers sean peter daniel and james who fought in the war what makes this so hard is that three brothers sean peter and daniel are casualties of war and the mother was to receive all three letters at oncethe opening sequence contains one of the most emotional scenes in the entire film only people who have seen the film before will understand the significance and its effect on the rest of the film as well as the viewing audience i have seen many times and i always go back to the opening scene when others ask what scene had the biggest impact on me it was one of those scenes that you must watch more than once to fully understand it as i didsaving private james turns out to become something more than what capt miller had bargained for tom sizemore is millers loyal right hand man sgt horwath sgt horwaths loyalty toward his boss makes me smile and the way sizemore portrays sgt horwath ranks right up with the best actors in the same situation wars are one of the worst tragedies of america and to bring it to life with such a realistic view really shocked methe way steven spielberg brought to life the 20 minute battle sequence at the beginning was an eyeopening view into the real thing at first i hated this part since it was long and drawn out but when i saw it the second time i understood why it was done spielberg wanted brought out emotions and made a statement to the audience that war is devastating and something that should never happen matt damon was superb as pvt james he continues to produce box office hits along with tom hanks and the legendary director steven spielberg is one film to watch over and over,reality
is the single best movie ever made bar none besides being an absolutely exciting realistic moving scary experience it also manages to show the sadistic evil of the nazis the american captain tom hanks is being ruined by the war and he knows it his hands shake more and more still he carries on ten americans die to save one it seems to make no sense except in that they do what they have to regardless it shows how hundreds of thousands of americans died to save us and the worldevery scene is a gem perfectly directed acted and staged from normandy beach to the encounter with the german half track and the final battle scenes they are all perfect there are a lot of great movies but this is the absolute pinnacle they should show this to all high school history students,reality
is an art form as well as one of the best movies ever made taking us on a journey from beginning to end and attaching us to the characters in such a way that we feel true grief when they meet their end their may be inaccuries but as in most films they happen and the story is told with merciless precision and brutality war is not pretty it is death and fear and despair and those who complain about the gore should not have any say on this film because that is the way it was my grandfather was actually on omaha beach and he saw his friend taken out by a mortar shell and i have never seen my grandfather cry before he saw this film the movie is great the acting is flawless even from vin diesel and despiute what some dilweed said in another comment i saw no clichs and i have been critiquing movies for years so that is that this movie is a 10 out of 10,reality
spoilers possiblenow i wasnt alive in 1944 however i had family on pretty much all sides of wwii and some were actually in the concentration camps so seeing movies like this are a big deal to mei loved the movie the first time i saw it i could spend 20 minutes on describing the opening sequences alone and have while ranting to my friends about it it was gory and desensitizing and everything a war film should beshowing so much violence that in a way it becomes an antiwar film in that it also shows the consequences of it anyone who has an interest in history and wwii should see this and also band of brothers another tom hanksstephen spielberg project and one that i found a little better then spr stars out of ,reality
what can i say about this movie that has not been said already i saw it in the theater with my father and my grandfather who was in the us armed air forces 8th during ww2 and retired a major to raise a family back in the us the army wanted him back for korea but he had already served voluntarily since pearl harbor was bombed three of his brothers also served in combat and luckily all made it out alive i loved this movie so much it had the saddest but also happiest ending and so many terrific scenes in between in the beginning we are not informed that the reason the us had so many casualties was due to errors made by those planning air drops and bombings the troops should have had more support but the armed air forces was apparently 50 miles up the coast from normandy the characters in this film are well formed and as a viewer you feel a connection to all of them there are so many heroic actions and stories that came out of ww2 will remain a great one for all generations even if it is not based entirely on true events if you havent seen it go rent it now,reality
this movie is cinematic perfection flawless down to every detail it conveys better than any film to have come before and i believe that will ever come in the future that war is hell on earth an absolute must see for anyone remotely interested in movies youll wince youll cry and at times youll barely be able to process whats transpiring on screen but youll know that youre seeing an unrivaled masterpiece it is the greatest war movie ever made by far nothing else even comes close it is also one of the best films ever made i believe it is in the top 5 it certainly rests firmly in good company in my opinion i have heard many people complain that it is heavy handed and that it uses overwhelming images to bash the audience into submission this is an absurd notion whoever heard of war being subtle,reality
this is the movie of my life maybe thats why i like the movies that includes real stories and some history and im interested in ww2 very muchscenes are very effective that when i saw spr the first time i was in a terrible shock in the first 20 min cause i had never seen scenes like that in a war film before i was always a man who kills 50 100 people himself before but i saw spr and i got the real idea about war fear and bloodi think spr opened a new path on war films lots of films made that just to be like spr after it but i think they never reached the throne is the best and always be,reality
there is nothing bad to say about this movie it has everything that a good war movie should have  emotion good scenery good action etcthis movie sets the tone for what war movies should really be like spielberg does a fabulous job of directing this movie i also have to give a lot of credit to hanks burns siezemore and all the other actors and actresses that made this movie the best that it truly could bethis movie has totally changed my opinion on war movies and i now see what a war movie should really be like what was once my favorite war movie has changed because i saw this movie that is how good this movie is,reality
i have seen this film twice in the theatre and countless times on dvd at home it never fails to incite deep emotion within methe film is riveting as you follow the actions of 8 soldiers through normandy as they try to find and retrieve privatethe opening scene on the beach although brutal and relentless is ultimately satisfying as the men eventually knock out the german positions and move inland the cost is very high but they achieved their goal and have made the beach behind them safei must admit i never truly accepted the argument of whether or not it was right for the men to risk their lives to save private they were given an order by general marshall no less and it must be carried out if they werent fighting the germans to reach they would just have been fighting and risking their necks somewhere else in francei cant think of another film that manages to bring the true horror and destruction of war right into your face from the opening twenty minutes of the film right to the final battle the audience is never given a chance to rest or catch their breathgreat performances by several actors including tom hanks it is a film that will surely be highlighted when tom hanks receives a lifetime achievement award near the end of his career he is the calm and methodical everyman caught in the maelstrom of war and conflicting loyalties amongst the men he leadsironically i cannot bring myself to watch the final battle any longer here the sacrifices dont seem to lead anywhere and the action is so real i can almost feel it myself anyway an amazing film and truly a feather in the cap of steven spielberg as well,reality
ever since i was 12 ive read hundreds of books seen dozens of movies and did almost anything that has to do with the second worldwar for me this period of time which changed the world forgood has also changed my life and my view on the world as it is today almost 4 years into my wwii obsession i heard about this project from the same director who made shindlers list then the first screenshots m1 carabines mp40s and tigertanks i couldnt wait sitting there in the pitchdark the movie starts with the absolutely great sounds from the orchestra lead by john williams seeing the old man walking towards the huge graveyard with his family on the background with obviously increasing emotions the camera hides behind one of the graves not revealing the name on it fade outwhat came next is almost indescribable a group of extremely nervous american soldiers are standing in a landingvessel bouncing on the waves a last walkthrough of the tacticsobjectives and then the words noone wanted to hear 30 seconds clear the ramps never ever had i experienced such an intense scene i seriously totally forgot i was in a cinema i felt like i was flying above the beach like a ghost absolutely uncomparable to any other scene i had ever seenif i go on like this describing all scenes i would need 225 webpages and 2 weeks to write it down since i lack the time ill give a short summary from this scene on spielberg lets us join the march of some survivors who are send by high command to find the youngest of 4 brothers 3 of which died he must and will return safely to his mother we follow these soldiers move with them and inside them encountering only some germans which after omaha itself are all waffenss which is weird since the main force of the waffenss did not join the fight until several days later as the search for continues so does the search for the answer to the question of questions why do we fight spielberg brilliantly links the search for that answer to the actual deeds of all the individual soldiers he shows better than any director before that soldiers are not blindlyordersfollowingmen but individuals who are thrown into a war and fight it their own unique way after a both sad and hilarious mistake they finally manage to find who turns out to be unwilling to return home until he completed the task he and his team were supposed to do with the few remnants of his battlegroup that task is to defend a small bridge in a small town the only remaining bridge in the area until reinforcements have arrived captain miller is forced to stay and help until this objective is reachedthe final battle that follows is again a masterpiece spielberg obviously wanted to reach the highest level of historical accuracy everything from the socks they wear up to the tanks they fight is historically correct i must note that the tigertanks are not real ones but are in fact t34 russian tanks converted to tigers only the running gear gives this away but hey there are no real tigers which move available up to today so still great job this final battle again shows the true horrors of war all but 3 or 4 diealltogether the mixture of handheld cameras and static ones the moving characters the music the brilliant storyline and the breathtaking action made this movie one worth of viewing 25 times up to today and more often to come for me even for those totally uninterested in wwii just go and see this one with theatresurround of course you most certainly will never forget it,reality
it has been said a lot of times about this film showing the truth about war yes there are splattered blood all around yes some scenes are unbearable to some yes i saw that guy cry momma and was disturbed by it but it is war here we see what soldiers undergo what they encounter before we call the heroes be it dead or alive spielberg has a keen eye on detail like the first part where the soldiers go underwater where you could hear gunfire as the soldiers head goes above the water then silence when underwater i cant see anything wrong with it the story visuals sound all are topnotch movies like this are what make directors legends just like mr spielberg,reality
well done combat movie from the maker of et i like the way the color is used in this not overdone and just grayish enough so that uniforms appear olive green hue instead of money or blade grass green the opening sequences showing the gis taking bullets are probably as accurate as any filmmaker can get nevertheless these opening sequences seem to imitate and improve upon the opening sequences in cornel wildes excellent beach red from 1967 both films exhibit harrowing and exhaustive combat openers showing beach storming american troops taking bullets in nearly every part of their bodies by showing blood and severed limbs and the like the audience is shocked into understanding the cruelties of war or beach red for that matter are not for the squeamish movie viewer they are perhaps best enjoyed by those whove been there and perhaps the most ardent war movie buffs,reality
this was a great movie ive seen it a couple times but appreciated it even more after watching the band of brothers series in fact after watching band of brothers and seeing afterwards i noticed that and his group were all part of the 101st airborne easy company they mention it a few times later in the movie especially when they first meet up with private in the field interesting link probably why tom hanks put the band of brothers series together in the first place i recommend excellent effect and camera work put you right in the battle especially at the beginning of the film not for the faint of heart,reality
is a superb war epic that will probably be remembered in the far future revising the second world war very accurately it begins with the title character james as an old man surrounded by his family whereby are visiting the grave of a very important person ins life the film then very quickly takes a new approach as we begin to learn the story of the beginning of the film and just who this person ismoving onto the famous dday landing an event that very few war films have portrayed especially in such graphic detail then moves beyond the beach and through wrecked towns and cities in france the film then progresses as the title of the film is explained and new characters are introduced and lost demonstrating the real horror of warthe film in general is about a solider who has been unlucky enough to lose three of his brothers in combat leading to a special dangerous mission captain john miller tom hanks must take his men behind enemy lines to find private james an american solider situated somewhere in france the men question their orders but continue to embark on the mission as becomes nearer the mission becomes harder and soon most of the characters are suddenly killed including captain miller the name on the grave at the opening sequence of the filmalthough very well acted and involving a gripping story line it is fair to say the story should be more realistic as this story is extremely unlikely to happen in the real world war 2,reality
a whole family of young men are killed on dday bar a front line solider private who must be pulled back from the battle field for the sake of his poor mothersteven spielberg is a director that i feel is vastly overrated while i admit he has produced both classics in artistic terms and blockbusters in commercial terms is he really that good is he really able to rise above the budget acting technology or script does he believe in anything have a grand message for the world other than it is good to be rich and famous a nice guy sure but so is my milkmancall me a hard man to please but i dont believe that spielberg has put anything really new in the cinema pot and he has dipped in and borrowed plenty hitchcock scorsese kubrick and kazan have all produced minimasterpieces from nowhere with no stars or budget to speak of spielberg hasnt although juggernaut was above average for a tv movieas has been said a thousand times before the opening takes a first hand look at dday and is quite brilliant but when it ends the movie droops it is then a bogstandard warishell product with a lot of extra emoting and mencancry to show that we have turned the page actually we havent  many european films and bs have explored war from a first hand and more downandgritty viewpoint but the mass audience havent actually seen those products so they just think they are getting something newtom hanks is a great actor he is the first and only modern star to play weak or even stupid and improve his box office standing i praise him for it no one could be better than him here really bang on the money but no one else needs to do much other than mouth words and despite being the title role is a star walkon i am glad i saw this film and i recommend it to you but i wouldnt want to see it again no matter own it money has been well spent and its heart is in the right place but at the end it wants to get you in a headlock and push emotions down your throat further proof  in my book  as to why spielberg isnt really the master of his own game just a little above average at it,reality
nothing that steven speilberg has done has been half assed but if i had to choose his best film this would be number one the only thing that annoys me is all of the films that came after it about wwii sure some were good but none were great i just wished that they would stop following in speilbergs footsteps trying to top his film because it will never be topped i am glad that this film was made when it was because pretty soon there will not be anyone left who was there or even was alive during wwii this is going to be the same in 100 years or so about september 11th but not to stray off subject this film was the most accurate depiction of dday i have ever seen i dont need to go into detail about other reasons why this was great except to say that this is a must see must own must worship movie that will remain timeless,reality
takes place during wwii in europe at the beginning an old man harrison young walks up to a grave then the movie shifts to the dday invasion on june 6 1944 as men get torn up all around captain miller tom hanks moved his men up the beach they finally breach it and take the beach after a deadly day soon after this bloody battle captain miller hanks receives orders to retrieve private james matt damon they have to find him because all his other brothers were killed in combat thus the only surviving son rule was in affect while this is happening men are questioning why one man is so much more important then them after some of them get torn up the group of men encounters battles all over the place and search for damon finally they find him and his unit in a city however damon refuses to leave the men in his unit they end up fighting for control of the citythis movie sparked the more modern war movies which show more emotion then the average actionwar flick moreover it does not show explosion after explosion with no plot to go along with it the viewer sees the human emotion involved in this movie viewers see men crying out for their mothers and see medics trying in vain to save lives the viewer does not see the faceless people of war movies past rather the viewer sees people real people with real emotions throughout the filmthe circumstances for these men werent ideal when they where at the town they had to set up the best method for attack they were low on weapons miller hanks shows the men how to make sticky bombs with their socks later damon shows miller hanks how to set off mortars by hand this shows the planning and improvising that is done in war most people would think war is just chaos however for the most part it is a well thought out process which includes chaos,reality
and this movie affected the way i view my patients these aging men and by now they are in their 70s and 80s were the ones that were there when we needed themsubsequent to the movie both hanks and spielberg helped to inaugurate the national dday museum here in new orleansthat this monumental work lost to the idiotic shakespeare in love as best picture for 1998 demonstrates the moral ineptitude of the oscar process for this reason alone i dont watch the academy awards anymorewhenever i have to get up in front of a veterans organization to give a talk i think of this movie and get a little choked up,reality
wow  tom hanks in  this was one of the most authentically made world war ii movies ever made  tom hanks did a fantastic job playing a soldier during wwii who did as he was told regardless of how he personally felt about the task at hand  my husband retired after 30 years of army service and loves to critique military movies being a military buff himself  even he was hard pressed to find a mistake in this movie  the movie takes you from the landing on the beaches to the impossible task of locating a single man private  in between the search for this man we are delighted with excellent character development of the company sent out to search for private  we are able to gain a little insight of what it might have been like for men of various backgrounds coming together and united for a single cause  their banter individual histories prewar occupations state of residence  individual thoughts made each character feel so real that by the end of the movie you felt like you knew them  they were real  movies like are wonderful for your adults to watch  kids dont appreciate history or really take in the events they are taught in school  movies such as help to generate interest in history for the young  for the older population we simply appreciate or remember the time period and feel proud of our spouse or a family member who served during wwii warning  have plenty of tissues by your chair for this movie,reality
to many the story of starts with the landings at normandy and the incredibly realistic depiction of dday june 61944however there is first the subtle and unexpected deliverance of james to the headstone of captain john miller whereby the story is told of a time past when something of what we love was lost foreverthe emotional place where this very fine movie goes is to our ability here today to talk to each other as though this was merely a motion picture and not the roll call for our honored deadthough we are through jamess eyes taken back to when captain millers company is approaching the beach head at omaha in one of those higgins boats we are drawn into perhaps one of the most incredible movie scenes ever doneit is almost to terrible to elaboratehowever thats the way it isi do not feel this was meant to be an antiwar theme however if you want to know what it was like or perhaps what it might be like this is a good film to watchthis is a noholds barred look at that actionfor the recordthis landing zone was called omahaand i believe it was the most difficult of the 5 landing zoneshowever we did establish a beach head and as the dates of history will show within 1 year we were to meet with our allies in berlinthis is a unforgettable war movie that should not be missedi will express only a reservation about some of the attempts at a protest position against warthe inability to properly put a prisoner of war permanently out of the action was not i believe worthy and when that big bad nazi did that deed to kill one of our guys and was not killed as a result was cowardice under actioni think that was pretty bad and in fact cost us because he could of engaged the enemy before the enemy even went any where near the staircasesome of the emotional purges seem very much over the top but it seems to provide a very convincing ability to convey the deadly seriousness of what we were involved inwhen a voice says to captain millerthats quite a viewand miller says yes it isthat is when we get a view of what is forever losta sacrifice which on the field at gettysburgpa abraham lincoln said that these honored dead should not have died in vain but gave there full measure so that we may increase our devotion and know a new beginning in defense of the republicthe banter is hard to predict but perhaps that was then this is nowhowever the final battle scene is hard to handle that was a very demanding challenge and boy did things heat upexcellent war time footing and you dont loose concentrationi actually thought that if i could we would want god to know that we love each other for the braveryhonorand life that we are being asked to provide so this private james might know a futureand his decendents as wellif you had paid attention jims family was there children and alla job well done captain millerthank youto you rangers of the omaha landingsmy heart,reality
a film that covers material that has been both harnessed and flauntered is a rarity  as a jarring gripping war film manages to address and touch nine of the ten human emotions without losing site of the story  the film grabs you off the screen as tom hanks plays the captain of a platoon which as noble brave and righteous as they may be are nonetheless a band of young men  capt jon miller embodies the man whom we all would want to be  a courageous leader of men who has earned the respect of his subordinates  without blurring the fact that he is a man  one with a life outside such a hideous display of humanity very rare are movies where we follow a group of people and feel like we have gotten to know each and every one by the end  at least to the degree which the excellent script permits,reality
i cant understand how people can say this film is overrated or poor or anything down them lines what other war film has the realism effects and direction has yes there are many great war films but for realism this is the greatest you can tell this is so because any sort of war filmdrama is filmed in the same way private was everyone also goes on about the opening beach landing scene yes is it great i think the end battle is much better the pace of the film slows down once when they are talking in the church but apart from that it is entertaining all the througha must see for war movie fans,reality
tom hanks tom sizemore matt damon edward burns barry pepper adam goldberg vin diesel giovanni ribisi and jeremy davies star in one of the best war films ever made hanks stars as capt john miller leader of a public relations mission to bring home the last of four brothers sean peter daniel and james who fought in the war what makes this so hard is that three brothers sean peter and daniel are casualties of war and the mother was to receive all three letters at once the opening scene is one of the most emotional scenes in the entire film only people who have seen the film before will understand the significance it has on the film and the effect it will have on people i saw many times and i always go back to the opening scene when others ask what scene had the biggest impact on me it was one of those scenes that you must watch more than once to fully understand it as i didsaving private james turns out to become something more than what capt miller had bargained for tom sizemore is millers loyal right hand man sgt horwath sgt horwaths loyalty toward his boss makes me smile and the way sizemore portrays sgt horwath ranks right up with the best actors in the same situation wars are one of the worst tragedies of america and to bring it to life with such a realistic view really shocked methe way steven spielberg brought to life the 20 minute battle sequence at the beginning was an eyeopening view into the real thing at first i hated this part since it was long and drawn out but when i saw it the second time i understood why it was done spielberg wanted brought out emotions and made a statement to the audience that war is devastating and something that should never happen matt damon was superb as pvt james he continues to produce box office hits along with tom hanks and the legendary director steven spielberg is one film to savour over and over,reality
ive read enough of the comments on this film to know that they run the gamut from praiseworthy to apocriphal to derogatory ill go for the first one i know this film isnt meant to be historically accurate or even based on an actual event the only truths are normandy the tone of the fighting the region of the fighting and the equipment and tactics there was no real pvt james francis with three brothers killed but there was a nyland family four boys three of whom were killed in wwii and one survivor who was brought home this is the basis for this movie but since nylands homecoming was less than dramatic spielberg needed a bit more punch and oh lordy did he give it to us ive seen hundreds of war films from the sterling gettysburg to the appalling pearl harbor and all in between but spr is a truly realistic film it does a splendid job of bringing the viewer into the horrible and frightening arena of modern foot combat with the sounds sights and fears experienced by the men who slugged it out in the fields towns and hedgerows of normandy in 1944 im not a veteran but a lot of my friends are and not one of them has been able to watch this movie without deep profound emotions one vietnam veteran commented to me after we walked our eyes blinking in the bright sunlight outside the theater god i never thought combat could ever be done on film the way it really was hes right god rest his soul now that hes gone to be with his buddies in valhalla the only thing missing in this film is the smell and taste of mud dirt gunpowder blood sweat and tears this movie makes you hate the cruel randomness of battle the men who youve come to like capt miller pvt jackson sgt horvath and the ones you hate cpl upham the german who went back to fight being killed in stunning moments and passing into memory like lightning flashes the impact of bullets the crump of mortars and artillery the earringing echo of nearmisses are all realistically shown in a theater i found myself ducking instinctively from whickering mauser bullets whining past my head i left the movie exhausted emotionally drained and deeply moved and with even more respect for what peter jennings called the greatest generation well done spielberg and well done gis,reality
is the greatest war movie ever made i dont think ive seen one better if there is one better i dont think i could manage to sit through it anyway though it is intense violent and bloody it is also entertainment albeit of the profoundest kind even those viewers who normally pass up opportunities to be shocked and appalled by onscreen violence should not deny themselves the chance of seeing this great film at least oncepeople discussing this picture tend to agree on one thing the omaha beach sequence that starts the story proper is the high point of the picture i concur it throws some awful imagery at the viewer making you feel like you are a part of the landing as bullets rip into the innards of men around you you almost feel like you are in mortal danger but the sequence works not because of the bloodiness but because of the pacing despite the objections of some director stephen spielberg doesnt push your face in gore unrelievedly but creates a story in this sequence that has a clear beginning middle and end spielberg makes you feel the human cost of the battle in some small way he never pretends to be capturing all of it but keeps the camera focused on characters like tom hankss cpt miller and tom sizemores sgt horvath who you feel are going to make it through at least this fight much of the carnage is shown in small flashes or in the corners of the frame at the risk of trivializing the actual conflict the result is like a rollercoaster ride a mighty daunting one that you feel some measure of achievement after you sit through it once and actually grows more powerful with repeat viewings which is not as horrible once you have seen it once and gotten a good idea who lives and diesthe rest of the film can only pale in comparison and is often unfairly dismissed for losing some of the momentum of omaha but how could any director however great sustain such momentum and who would want toinstead the film goes into a section that i think is even more affecting when we see the typing pool where female clerks rattle out pro forma letters from joes who speak in male voices about how each casualty was the finest and best soldier they ever had the privilege of serving with then one woman notices her letter is addressed to the same mother as another she just finished typing and the central plot is set in motion three brothers have been killed in action it turns out and a fourth is missing in action and must be found harve presnell as george c marshall us army chief of staff recites from memory a letter sent by abraham lincoln nearly a century ago in the process giving one of the most powerful performances in a movie full of them and then we get a sequence that visually quotes norman rockwell as mrs wordlessly gets word of the sacrifice she has laid on the altar of freedom watching her collapse on her porch as the priest emerges from the black sedan is not easily done with dry eyes because we understand by then how commonplace this sort of thing wasthere are moments of humor in too much of it from tom hanks central performance his laconic comment when a german on a loudspeaker announces the statue of liberty is kaput is priceless and even as the body count mounts there is a sense of this somehow being made endurable by the company of miller and his men hanks keeps his schtick in harness most of the time but when he does allow for some jocularity we are actually gratefulthe film slips a couple of times but not in any major way the biggest misstep for me was when miller goes off and cries after losing one man its the one episode of actorly indulgence in a film that otherwise steers clear of such theatrics though it may work for otherseven the final battle for the town of remmel though fictional is done in a realistic and committed way some of the most violent and gruesome moments occur here and they are all the more difficult to endure because we now know the soldiers fighting and dying in a way we didnt at omahathe music by john williams and the cinematography by janusz kaminski are simply brilliant neither calling your attention as they serve their scenes in an efficient manner the sound the editing all are of a high order and will no doubt inspire moviemakers for generations to comepeople who say is not war but hollywood are right but miss the point this is an example of hollywood getting it right and creating something enduring i will always be thankful i managed to sit through once because it made me want to see it again give this film the same chance and i bet you will agree,reality
is without doubt the best world war 2 movie to date the attention to detail of the sets is amazing especially the damaged german towns and the opening beach invasion none of the gore through out the movie is left out and the viewers see what it was really like this is a memorable movie based on a real eventsuperb,reality
some spoilerseveryones seen smartbombs  crash into buildings via nosetip cameras weve watched cities bombarded with missiles from stationary rooftop photographers for years now weve all seen war play out form afar courtesy of twentyfour hour cable news coverage but its steven spielbergs ww ii epic shows the brutality of war up close and personal through the soldiers eyes  starring tom hanks the movie is the story of eight united states soldiers in their quest to find through the mess of occupied france one giis by far the most gruesome grizzly war tale yet told its graphic depiction of chaos in battle throws the audience from its safe theater seats to inside a collapsing wartorn country with tracer bullets and screams of fear and pain flying by by its sheer horrific honest view of war  the film had created an audience of hardened vets who had seen the distastes of war whose heart had broke at the loss of a brother and whose rage was overwhelmingly intolerable by thecowardly acts of a comrade,reality
i realized that i was watching a masterpiece about ten minutes through when a soldier was lying on the beach holding his intestines and yelling mamanot much else to say besides my favorite movie besides that vin diesel gives a great performance only because he was killed off quickly,reality
the movie displays the some of the many horrors and consequences people experience while at war this movie is so good that it should be mandatory for people to watch this movie at least once dont like bloody war movies then too bad you still need to know what it was like for those many brave soldiers who encountered those harsh experiences delivers what should be just as close to what war is realy like youll be touched more than youve ever been touched by any other movie in your entire life1010,reality
i think this rates as one of my best top five movies absolutely brilliant when i saw it in the cinema i got out to the car before crying my eyes out the film is like a roller coaster of emotion and terror filmed up close and with the cast in every sense it was emotionally draining i have since bought the dvd and seen it many times i cannot fault it i have also been to the dday beaches read the ambrose books and visited the grave yards including the one in the film it is exactly like itit is hard to say what is my favourite scene but the sniper shooting the german in the church tower is brilliant and perfectly doneive had enough of war films that show people getting shot and falling gracefully to the ground in spr they show it how it is ugly and very cruel if you want proof see the news clip of the yanks executing the young vietnamese boys in the street spr brilliant,reality
for better or worse has got to be the greatest war movie ever filmed far from being some artsy fartsy effort this film is as hardcore as they come the 20 minute beach landing scene should show you that this film isnt for the faint hearted spielberg has really outdone himself with this moviethe battle scenes are unbelievable for accuracy blood violence and length they are unmatched as far as my experience can say the beach landing the assault on the radar site the heart pounding final battle all of them are superb portraits of both combat itself and the men involved all very intense and bloody if you love movie battles then this is the film youve been waiting for some might call this film porn for action junkies but it is more than that beautifully shot and orchestrated is ultimately a tale of the men in combat rather than the combat itself unlike a lot of war movies in you actually care about the characters and dont just look at them as bullet catchers bottom line this film should be in everyone who calls themselves a movie fans collection this movie is not to be missed and should be mandatory viewing in schools,reality
i happen to like a lot the war films and this one contains two of the very best battle scenes in the history of cinema one in the beginning and one in the end unfortunately between these two scenes the film is very simple to say the list and full of hidden propaganda very logical since the film was made with the blessings of the american army i didnt see anything against the war like i expected only that in a case of it we should be doing our duty even if it is a terrible thing and a lot of us will die a terrible death what i understand is that following the correct formula you can make very impressive films and a lot of money,reality
as i am a thirty year military professional many people have asked my opinion of the film this is it in a nutshellthe weaponsthe thing i noticed most right away was the terrible dilapidated condition of the weapons used it was beyond what could be excused as normal field wear especially noticeable were the garands very old aged wood for instance for as much money as they spent on the film they could have done betterthe sniperthe sniper weapon seemed to undergo transformations the scope and rings seemed to change as they went along and the combinations just didnt make it most odd was the manual of arms used by the sniper character shooting right and then using his left hand to operate the bolt just seemed nuts i have never seen any trained shooter operate like thisthe uniformsthe field jackets were a more faded color of od than the originals i know this is nit picking but i had one of these when i was a kid  82nd airborne too  and the color was noticeably brighter also everyone seemed to have the same crude hand stitching on their shoulder insigniathe battle scenesevery one of the eye witnesses still alive has had a comment on how real the battle scenes looked one guy did say there was not that much blood in real life the sand absorbed it some others i have pushed for comment concede that my impressions were correct in that most of the comments are more meaning that it was more realistic that any movie done so far but comparing it with the real stuff i have seen and with eyewitness accounts written at the time of the battle and photos and film done at the time one comes to the inescapable conclusion that the movie was actually much less gory than real life for me the best done casualty was when one man was hit in the small action against the machine gun nestthe scene where the wall collapsed revealing a room full of stunned and unmoving germans who were then hosed down by two gis with thompsons was over the top credibility wise gimme a break this film is still hollywood enough that the valiant american soldiers are the only ones to suffer wounding and survive the only ones to fight through suffering and adversity all of the germans die on the spot without further struggle or resistance all fall to oneshot stops and there are no heroes no gritty determination on the part of any of the germans except for the guy with the bayonet there were so many people killed and not one exhibited the characteristic bladderbowel emptying phenomenon  i guess hollywood wasnt quite ready for oops that how many movies have you seen that in one that i can recall  perhaps no more  they did so good with the sound too bad they couldnt recreate the stenchthe charactersthis is what bugged me the most i grew up in the years immediately following the war in the middle of scores of wwii combat vets my dad a disabled navy vet moved the family to one of those giant new gi housing projects surrounding one of three military bases in the area i knew these men army air corps navy marines what they thought and how they talked had not changed since the war ended vfw and dod union gatherings held many opportunities to listen to endless talk and stories about the war these men had a clear and resolutely patriotic vision of what they did and why they harbored real vehement hatreds of the recently past enemies in this regard this film did these men a great disservice it made them look weak and cloying by comparison the real men were the genuine article not fearless or supermen either but their attitude was entirely different their vocabulary was different their demeanor was different the guys in the hastily contrived unit the hanks character took into the field were all supposed to be experienced rangers these were the real meateaters of the army in wwii  the forerunners of the green berets and as such were even less likely to act in the way the film showed these groups were some real tough sobs to top it off everyones haircuts were not period if you want to see something closer to the real deal catch they were expendable to these performances add lots of very creative profanitythe ploti could not buy the actions of the men within the context of their assigned mission then the blatant disregard for orders and the open hostility toward superiors was very unrealistic more hollywood i could have done a better plot in my sleep the disobedience showed to the stated orders would not have happened in real life he would have been ordered by the cpt to get his gear and shove out and that would have been thatwhat i did likethe cinematography was superb the sound was great it was the most realistic depiction of the receiving end of gunfire i have heard on film to date still this wasnt consistent throughout the reality they did attempt with regard to battlefield casualties was better than what has probably been done to date i think it is a good idea for young people to see this and discuss it in terms of the reality of it and what violence really means and what it actually does to people real war is much worse than spielberg shows i like the fact that in spite of what spielbergs political agenda may have been people are looking at this as a more positive tribute to those who sacrificed so much so that the rest of us could be free that is its one redemption and what makes it worth seeing,reality
i found to be an extraordinary movie but only one thing kept it from getting a perfect rating  where are the minorities in this film does spielberg really think that there were no blacks or latinos in the war every soldier is white caucasian tom hanks is good but this is not his best film tom sizemore i feel is the top actor in this movie he is incredibly intense almost like he has been involved in a war in his life the war scenes are the best and most realistic ever created which explains why some veterans have trouble watching the movie this movie is so close to perfect only the exclusion of minorities keeps it from thismy rating   12 out of five,reality
not steven spielbergs best film by a long shot et or schindlers list anyone but certainly his most graphic is pretty much summed up by its tagline the mission is a man the film is simple almost to the point of frustration and possibly spielberg wanted it this way to highlight some of the themes running throughout the film war is um bad however what it amounts to is poor storytelling coming from spielberg a man who prides himself for storytelling this is a disappointmenttom hanks plays the everyman again as a reluctant schoolteacher wanting to help his country matt damon plays private the young soldier that hanks and his crew have been sent to find beginning with one of the most memorable scenes in recent cinema and ending with one of the most sickeningly sentimental scenes private is an uneven work what people like about this film is the simple message juxtaposed with what i guess brutal violence oliver stone managed this better in platoon even the brilliant opening scene in private does not compare to the scene in platoon where the soldiers burn down the vietnamese villagethat said svp still features decent performances from matt damon and tom hanks with excellent support coming from tom sizemore and a surprisingly touching performance from vin diesel in a small role as an italianamerican soldier the direction is also solid as is the script however mundanity and spielbergs safety net sentimentality frequently come into play making this a lesser entry in the war film and the spielberg cannon,reality
i cannot believe that this film didnt win the 1999 best picture oscar the film is so brilliantly made that it practically had it in its grasp but a word of warning this is a different sort of spielberg film there are no aliens no sharks and the film is not in black and white but the film is very violentok ive got that off me the film isbrilliant the film opens at the dday landings which will be for me the best opening to a film ever spielberg recreates the landings with such preciseness the way it is edited the way it is doneit is so brilliantthe rest of the film is a story to save a man behind enemy lines but really the real star is the omaha beach scenethis is spielberg at his best yet he got screwed like et damn,reality
when i first saw on dvd it made me wish i would have went to the theaters to catch one of the best movies ever made it brought a tear to my eye along with others this is one of spielbergs best yet to date with tom hanks as the main character it gave me a sense of everything was going to be all right he did an outstanding job for his part the first twenty minutes of the movie are breath taking i must say if for some reason you cant watch the movie at least watch the first twenty minutes of it outstanding job 10 out of 10,reality
ok its a war movie there are lots of war movies so whats so great about this one the abnormal amount of blood guts and carnage did that make the brutes inside people vote 10 for this movie so that it got an 83 rating i just dont get why this movie is so highly rated theres tom hanks in it but tom had much better roles eg in sleepless in seattle or apollo 13 or youve got mail or a ton of other moviesi think that a good movie makes you want to see it one again some time well didnt make me feel that way id rather save the time and watch something else instead,reality
this has to be the most realistic war film ever   everything about this movie is goodthe natural acting the realistic battles especially the sound of bullets whistling by and especially the storyline  of course there are a few flaws no movie is perfect but theyre just minor  the story here is really deep and straightfoward 8 men were sent to find one private  on the way they became skeptical and start asking themselves whether that risking their life for one man is the decent thing to do unlike black hawk down also a good war movie you have a sense of connection with the individuals in the movie the characters build up pretty well and sometime you feel for them you understand their situation and their state of mind   i really dont understand why many people complain about how steven spieldberg didnt show other ally forces in the movie  the movie is about 8 american men trying to bring another man home  thats why its call    this isnt a documentary movie about everything that happen involving every nations during wwii starting from 19391945  otherwise it be called the world at war or something like that so stop complaining,reality
if there was one thing that allowed the nazis to almost take over the world it was there revolutionary tank strategy  masses of tanks working in perfect coordination  in this film single panzer tanks just go wandering around the countryside at will till they bump in to somethingthis film is formulaic in extremis  every scene youve seen before only better  you know the scene from a hundred films where a character is in the thick of tumultuous action then ducks under water and it all goes silent repeated 34 times  well yes thats here only when the guy pops up all we get is a few popping and spluttering machine guns  the sound throughout this film is the worst ever in any war movie  even the crumbiest soap operas today  have the background hum in group scenes bars etc  not here you mostly just here the character in focus the troop of soldiers standing around are silent  the claim to reality made by some must be down to ten dollars worth of offal spread around the bodieseven dialogue is without any conviction  people did use the fword then of course but not in the repetitive way which has become the fashion now  in fact the french referred to gis as la beetch after the phrase which all gis used all day long  son of a bitch  i didnt hear that used once in the whole filmit is sad that such a ridiculously unrealistic and unbelievable film should be given so much illdeserved credit  i would recommend cross of iron the victors or the train instead,reality
as an ex soldier who has been in combat i thought at first that this film was too real at times and i was actually uncomfortable during the beach landing scenes  however that is my psychological problem and no reflection of the film  it makes me like and appreciate this film even more and i have watched it again and own on tape and dvdthis is without doubt one of the best war films ever produced and it benefits from the polarity of war as the scene and humanity as the theme  a must watch movie if only for entertainment but we all learn something from these types of movies  and as the effects in movies get more and more realistic and perhaps overrealistic then we should force our leaders to watch them  with computer simulation power we might put an end to war  nice thought but lets not forget that man is a natural born killeranyway i digress  the movie is excellent and should only be watched on big screen with 3d51 surround sound to get the full effect  if we learn something then even better,reality
i cant say it was a bad movie but i didnt fully like itfirst of all it was too patriotic for a non american and maybe for an american too too many flags i guess next the action wasnt as constant as in black hawk downit wasnt as repetitive as in thin red line but maybe the varied action scenes lead it closer to any common action movie the characters although most of them good actors it got too personal i rather see people looking alike without names or even faces to remember bhd trl the plot isnt the one of a war film i think i preffer those based on rel life battles but the dday scene was absolutely amazing and shocking and thats basically what saves the movie too bad it was kind of a short scene they couldnt do the whole movie about it710,reality
i was totally unprepared for the effect this movie would have on me after seeing it i came straight home to give my then 4 year old son a hug and a prayer in hopes that he will never have to go through the hell that those men did any war for that matter this movie brought war so close to home it is scary i always had a small idea of what a war would be like this opened my eyes wide a movie i am glad i watched but will always have a hard time ever watching again i recommend it for all to see to truly appreciate what the brave soldiers of our armed services have done and continue to do each day,reality
well according to the rating ive read on this site no in my 2 cents though i would put this film up near the top as i sit here i cant think of much wrong to write steven can really make any kind of plot shine and in my thoughts this is his best at first the idea of him casting tom hanks as the lead in this film didnt thrill me im thinking this is that guy from seattle who fell in love with meg he just didnt strike me as that much of an action hero well in this roll tom didnt have to be an action kind of person cuz this is the one of them few films ive seen that doesnt have violence just for the sake of having it there this film contained at the time of its release some of the most nasty and realistic battle scenes ive ever experienced and unlike black hawk down this film has no work up to the landings on june 6thimean you see this person visiting the cemetary were not told his name nor which site hes looking for what we the audience realize right away though is that this man was a veteran who most likely fought here in then he stops if front of one grave and in my opinion the best scene of the film french hornsring out a powerful few notes as the camera focuses on the lines and lines of crosses then the allied assault starts with all its fury at normandy well i cant say any more about thatso leading a crew of 8 men through swarms of german reinforements tom hanks must find a private who has lost all of his brothers it doesnt make any sense is the theme to the whole mission unlike in other films where the soldiers all never even think about there orders as anything but the most meaningful and heroic things on earth and of course why are 8 men being risked for one the nice thing is that steven never really answers the question but simply shows the results i wont spoil the end but i should say this dont expect hardly any of the main characters to get out alivetotally wonderful film johns score in this film is the best i love his music its always perfect the sound is very well done the camera effects are stellar and im sounding silly here but im having a hard time finding adjectives that describe what a good film this is if you dont have this film already what are waiting for im glad there are people out there who actually care to make films that are really based on history,reality
is easily the best war movie that has ever been made and quite possibly one of the best movies ever made period  it is the only movie i have ever been to that has silenced and stunned a packed theater i clearly remember that during the first silent moment in the film after the dday invasion scene that the theater was dead silent  if i hadnt taken a second to look around and seen the people it would have been impossible to tell that every seat in the theater was filledi currently own the movie on dvd and have enjoyed watching it  it is not the same experience as in the theater but much better than on vhs  many people think that the movie was far to graphic although it was very graphic that is the way war is  and since steven spielberg wanted a realistic movie that is what he had to do  the story line of saving one man among the slaughter of the invasion of france was an interesting choice for a plot but very effective  it shows that compassion can still prevail even in the worst of circumstancesdue to the graphic nature of the movie people with weak stomachs may want to avoid it or have someone cover your eyes  to everyone else watch it you will be hard pressed to find a better moviejammrock,reality
for those people who feel was nothing but an excuse to put some gratuitous violence on screen or feel that the violence was over the top i have just three words for youread your history  read stephen ambroses book on dday ambrose just happened to be the historical consultant for the film and you will learn exactly what bullets mortars grenades etc actually do to a human being youll discover that the violence that television and other movies have fed us for the last 2030 years is a bunch of cpand for those people who have been involved in war then watch this film and claim that the violence is excessive and false then obviously your experiences in wartime didnt mirror those men whos accounts were used in the book mentioned above and in and they dont mirror those memories of countless men who saw this film and left the theater visibly shaken because their story was finally told the way it should besteven spielberg was not trying to outgross braveheart  he was attempting to open our eyes  and if he was successful then maybe those truly gutwrenching scenes would serve a noble purposeif not an end to war then at least an end to the romanticism of war  which is at least a step in the right directionso shakespeare in love received the oscar  is it ever going to be referred to as  a national monument  i doubt it  is still getting coverage that refers to it in those termsso to sum up before criticizing this movie based on its level of violence try accumulating a little background before making such accusations,reality
i just saw this movie via hbo i imagined that i could not take the full effect of war on a big screen  and i think i was right however very detailed and real life war description did not give me a hollow and depressing feeling given by other war movies  most vietnam war moviesthrough the movie i was asking why war   this movie gave me a feeling that i am not an observer but a participant i give standing ovation to the whole crew as well as actors and the director this is one big well orchestrated teamworkthis movie deserved academy award and tom hanks should be given best actor award as wellthe movie has given me a chance to think about the human behaviors and extend to which our emotions and humanity could be stretched  i would never endorse any warideologically or otherwise i am very grateful for mr spielberg for making this movie men can create war and some same men can create art,reality
ive noticed that most of the people who didnt like the film are from outside the united states thats not unusual i think the movie would have more of an emotional appeal to americans but using a movie to voice your own rather bigoted attitudes toward a country is hardly becoming world war ii was a defining moment for the united states and a very emotional one as well americans can be justifiably proud of what the united states accomplished during the war just as russians and brits can be proud of what sacrifices were made on their behalf i dont like chestthumping jingoism any more than anyone else but i honestly did not see that here i saw pride not arrogance i saw american soldiers act cowardly and german soldiers show mercy mostly i saw how combat has a debilitating effect on human beings regardless of how noble the overall purpose is world war ii began in europe it did not begin with or in the united states any latent militarism or patriotism caused by the effects of two world wars on american culture ultimately owes its existence to the people responsible for starting those wars in the first place i dont believe however that this movie or tom hanks intention in making it was vapid patriotism anymore than his from the earth to the moon or ron howards apollo 13 were some patriotism is legitimate  dying to end fascism and the holocaust in my books rates as legitimate,reality
while waiting in line to see spr i struck up a conversation with an older gentlemen in his 70s  he had participated in dday  though in the 2nd wave he saw the results of the hell the 1st wave of men lived through  at the end of the movie i saw him seated unable to move crying while his wife held his shoulders  i realized i was crying too  ill never look at another person in his 70s80s the same way again and for that i thank steven spielbergi have read most of the previous reviews and have found a common thread most of the negative reviews are from europeans  the same europeans our young men spilled their guts and blood to liberate  the same europeans we saved after the war with the marshall plan  the same europeans who now complain and criticize about the patriotism of spr  the same ungrateful hypocritical europeans who so easily forget that it is americans who are buried under those countless white crosses and star of davids  the amazing thing is that we are still sending young americans overseas to save their sorry ae,reality
was a little to intense for my tastes maybe i enjoy the sugar coating a little too much  it was an excellent movie i just could not handle the harshness of it  after seeing it i was unable to sleep because i was so upset  i realize that it was very close to an accurate representation of the war but i would rather avoid exposing myself to something as disturbing as the opening scene for my own sanity  the plot was intelligent and honest though extremely disheartening,reality
hidden beneath the spectacular and involving action sequences in this film is steven spielbergs vision of just what it means to be an american for spielberg its not just the flagwaving patriotism of the armchair soldier but the true heroic notion of sacrifice for fellow man time and again during the battle scenes we see his emphasis on the anonymous dog face who has given his own life to further their cause medics die saving the wounded others die saving children and an entire mission is dedicated to save one manthe contrast is shown in the form of corporal upham the tagalong interpreter who has not yet learned this notion of sacrifice his inaction in crucial moments sets him apart from the restcaptain john miller is the ultimate embodiment of spielbergs theme he is an uncommonly common man as plain and unremarkable as his name but with a steadfast sense of purpose and humble in his brilliance his final instruction to private is a message to us allwhile touched on in many of spielbergs other films this is his most consistent rendering of that belief a magnificent film which should not be missed,reality
forgive me if i am only restating what many others have already pointed out i simply dont have time to review all of the previous posts on this moviei personally was somewhat disappointed with spr  i would agree with others that the initial 25 minutes sans the cheesy opening with old man was one of the more vivid battle scenes i have seen depicted on film  the invasion sequence definitely gave me a feel for what my grandfather the son of german immigrants to the us went through on 6644  from there the movie goes downhill imhoit seems to me that speilberg set out to incorporate segments of other well known war movies into this one  scenes in spr are  reminiscent offorest gumpcarpazzo tells the translator not to salute the captain hanks because that only makes him a target for enemy snipers  major dan admonishes gump not to salute him as enemy soldiers may be standing by to grease an officerall quiet on the western frontthe night time shelling scenes as the soldiers are making their way over the battlefield at night are similar to what is portrayed in the 1929 classicthe soldier that picks up his dismembered arm is similar to a scene in a great japanese filmthe edith piaff record that the translator analyzes is the same record that is discussed in the dirty dozenpattonthe discourse between ted danson  hanks who else thought that sam malone was out of place was right out ot george c scotts masterpiece  ie monte taking too long to take caenfull metal jacketthe translator sports a yinyang symbol on his helmet similar to private jokers peace symbol  i dont believe that yin yang became en vogue in the us until well after wwiithe metallic tank sounds as the panzers are approaching in the final batle scene are similar to the sound effects in full metal jacketwhile flying in the helicopter joker remarks in fmj do you ever kill any women  childrena especially women  childrenjoker how can you justify killing women  childrenlater at the end of the movie joker finds himself face to face with a young girl that was shooting at his company the sniper  in the end he kills her but it is no victory for him only the end of whatever innocence he has leftthe translator protests that the company should let the steamboat willie guy go no explanation is provided as to why he stayed around to be captured while the american soldiers were ministering to the fatally wounded wade  later steamboat willie walks down the stairs past the translator after killing mellish  he forgoes a perfect opportunity to kill the cowardly translator sparing him ala androcles and the lion  in the end the translator musters up the courage to confornt several german soldiers steamboat willie among them  he shoots  steamboat willie and orders the others the leave  this sequence leading to innocence lost simply is unrealistic and does not do justice to circumstance  in addition while steamboat willies initial portrayal of a soldier in ememy hands is initially realistic he soon becomes a comic book character with his star spangled bannerfk hitler routinethe final battle scene disqualified this movie from any semblance of greatness  great war movies convey the total fultility of war  this film did not end on the empty note that full metal jacket did but rather the dive bombers showed up just in time and all was well  where was sylvester stallone  the sticky bombs would have fit right in with any rambo moviei agree with others that the opening and closing sequences were annoyingly sappy what with the flag and all  however i would note one thing  i dont think that  this movie constitutes propaganda as some put it i call it commercialism   imho this is a movie made by an american director for an american audience  i feel that this movie does not set out to persuade anyone to view the war from the american perspective as much as it is meant to sell the movie to what an american audience wants to see  spr follows the same formula as counltess other movies before it  look at the predictable scene where hanks runs across the wrong private  this is about as consistent with a typical american script as a movie can get  as long as this sappy humor sells it will be a staple of the american cinema,reality
perhaps having viewed this film at the cinema a couple of weeks after its debut tainted my expectations about perhaps the immense amount of hype precluding and following its release built the movie up just a little too much whatever the reason i must admit that i found just a little tedious and pretentious dont get me wrong here theres no genre of movie that i enjoy more than the good old antiwar platoon apocalypse now full metal jacket all quiet on the western front 1918 westfront stalingrad and das boot all german productions are among my all time favorite movies i like a good harsh realistic war movie and being a product of the electronic generation i can even sit through a clockwork orange without even flinching so the realistic first 25 minutes of was just like water off a ducks back to use the clichewhat really got to me about this movie was the element of compromise that marred the introductory shot displaying that oh so wonderful stars and stripes waving in the breeze perhaps it was national pride that caused the second world war unforgivable the return of this shot at the as yet far away conclusion of the film did little to appease my growing sense of ridicule at the filmhowever on a positive note that famous first 25 minutes was a fairly fine piece of cinema fast well coordinated well coloured not that i really know what im talking about here but after such a fine beginning speilburg simply cannot stop the movie slipping downhill from here i got the impression that was two hours of relative nothing buffered by 20 minutes of proyankee violence at each end and im sad to say that is how the war came across the germans were still faceless nameless enemies nazis the german film stalingrad which i believe does the whole war thing far better than this effort gives an excellent insight into the german side of thingsso in brief far too patriotic for a modern day war film emptiness in between introduction and conclusion totaling 2 hoursstill was above average though but is by no means the greatest war film ever there are many films which do the whole war thing much more sensitively poetically chaotically brutally realistically bluntly subtly the greatest criticism i have for is that i didnt leave the cinema hating humanity for what it put all those involved in the war through and showing what humanity was capable of which other movies do it would appear that spielberg decided against this perhaps for fear of diminishing his american audience who might not have flocked to his movie in mainstream numbers if it were to put forward any message that suggested that all involved in wars are victims not just the americans,reality
is certainly one of the most if not the most emotionally shocking films i have ever seen and i have seen a lot the film successfully recreates a very dark moment in recent history spielberg uses the intense opening scenes to promote a calculated audience reaction he wants to give us as soon as the film starts a prolonged taste of what it was like for a soldier perhaps fresh from cosy us civilisation to step off a landing craft into the hell and chaos that was omaha beach spielberg achieves this with a cinematographical style drawn from contemporary documentary footage but for me it were the sound effects that added the final horrific realism to that scene and indeed the whole of the film the sound of bullets striking metal water flesh without the accompanying crack from the far away gun is particularly memorable  now i come to think of it a similar effect was used in john carpenters assault on precinct 13the most powerful scene for me one that gave me a few sleepless nights was the hand to hand fighting that took place upstairs in the bombedout house the wrestling of the two opponents all the while the other wounded soldier is writhing around in the background the wouldbe rescuer paralysed by fear the short final pleading of the loser is an absolute masterpiece of film makingthere is a lot of comment to the effect that the plot for the army to jeopardise a squad of men to retrieve an ordinary soldier is implausible yes i imagine that it would have been highly unusual but the action was to have a significant propaganda effect back home i am sure that many bizarre and costly actions have taken place this century in the pursuit of propaganda the mood of the domestic population is often crucial to the outcome of a foreign war look how it affected us operations in vietnam and you only have to read about what massive and risky operations are mounted to retrieve a single downed us pilot in former yugoslavia recently to be able to imagine that the spr plot is not totally implausiblefor all the movies real power there are in my view some faults to the film curious queries that occurred to me whilst watching that have also been picked up by others the final scene in the present day war cemetery i found to be misjudged supposedly to bring the film full circle to tie in with the very first scene i found it to be out of step with the previous twoandahalf hours  also i found matt damon to be miscast  for me he looks too 90s should have been played by an actor far less well known i suppose that in the first few days after dday as the americans spearheaded inland from one of their designated normandy landing sites the only other people the americans came across were soldiers of the german army the french population having mostly fled beforehand or in hiding and the other allied troops still pushing ahead from their own landing zones having said that as a brit  it did feel to me as if the film portrayed the yanks singlehandedly liberating france there arent many opportunities for the director to incorporate other allied nationalities into this scenario spielberg might have chosen raf tankbusters but perhaps if he had he might have felt he was making a point about the limeys showing up late and saving the day after all the hard work had been doneoverall it is an excellent movie and gets a 10 rating from me it is not perfect in every way but it is a film that every stateregistered voter should see it is a glorious tribute to all the men and women who served and fought to preserve the freedom and democracy we know and take so much for granted todaylastly i do find it galling in the extreme that amongst others 16 yearolds from illinois have the arrogance to moan whinge and complain about this fine film as the movie is r rated you presumably saw it with your mom or dad i would far rather hear their comments than yours keep your comments to babe 2 pig in the city,reality
this is a very wellmade film  certainly worth seeing more than once the combat scenes at the beginning and at the end were eyeopening  i knew what this movie was going to be about before seeing it and i knew what to expect yet the battle scenes were still shocking to see  however was in no way the best movie of 1998life is beautiful was a superior film in many ways  excelled all other 1998 films on a technical level  if you were to remove the graphic aspect of its battle scenes would be just another war movie some people consider this the greatest war movie ever made  this movie may have the most realistic battle scenes ever shown but its not a spectacular movie  in fact its plot is rather lame  is tied with shakespeare in love for being the most overrated movie of 1998 life is beautiful clearly told a story about love and triumph without the use of theatrics or of famous actorsactresses  i cant see why tom hanks was praised so highly for his performance in this film the supporting cast outshone him  also the most hideous thing that was done in was to use the united states flag at the beginning and at the end of the movie  thats something that would only be done by someone trying to win an oscar  i do commend spielberg for his directionoverall he did a really good job in demonstrating that war is hell,reality
after looking at some of the other comments i am relieved to find out that i am not the only person that does not worship this movie yes the dday invasion scenes were great and tom hanks was up to form but the middle of the movie was so schmaltzy that i really couldnt get into it frankly i resented the fact that they thought that my emotions could be manipulated by the cliched characters and sentimental dialogue that dominated the middle of the movie although my opinion appears to be in the minority it is reassuring to know that there are a fair number of people who share it final analysis 410 watch first 12 hour or so and skip the rest,reality
this movie could not have been more violent if it tried  for this reason i feel a lot of incidents were added for nothing other than the shock value such as the when the german soldier slowly stabs the american private which by the way was the sickest thing ive ever seen in a movie done to the character i liked the best  i fully understand that war is hell but i thought it was very unlikely that the german would have gone up the stairs in that way and end up killing by a knife  i feel the scene was included awkwardly for only the shock value  because of this i lost respect for the movie  the storyline was good and the recreation of the war was also very good but because of the above reasons i wouldnt consider it a great movie,reality
amid the din produced by those crowing about the authenticity and power of the opening sequence of is it worth it knowing you cannot match the volume of these shouts to even peep that what follows is for more reasons than fingers and toes a bad movie is it worth it to mention that the characters and the script seem to come straight out of a text book of movie cliches is it worth it to note how emotionally simple spielberg thinks his audience when he resorts to a long closing shot of the american flag waving in the wind and cannibalizing his own schindlers list at the end,reality
everything youve heard about the first thirty minutes of is true it is indeed genuinely disturbing realistic and unglamorous footage of war but after that youre in john wayne country kids all the standard cliche war movie elements are giddily present and accounted for right down to the apelike nazi soldiers and the we gotta take out that bridge scenario spr is indeed a good war movie but youre not going to come out of it thinking to yourself now i understand the terrible price that we as a free nation must pay for peace youll be thinking man that scene with the tank blowing up totally ruled,reality
 so you can see the thin red line afterwards and marvel at how wonderful the latter is im sure mr spielberg thought he was doing us all a favour by enlightening us on the nature of war hey everyone its bad  but necessary oh my that was shocking oh the sarcasm im being flippant let me qualify my statements i do not doubt or belittle the fact that spr was of great emotional worth and moral value to many people some of whom are far more qualified than i to judge  but hell that little demon inside just wants to be heard and it says some nasty things i came into this film wanting to see a film  as opposed to three hours of histrionics and melodrama dressed up as a serious and worthy discussion of war worthy  thats the word mr spielberg wants to be worthy he wants to teach us all about patriotism and freedom and evil and good and the american way frankly it was rather offensive not his general intent which was indeed worthy but rather the manner in which he set about it which was not worthy emotive scenes of slaughter stereotyping of good and evil characters simple resolutions a gimmick in the form of stickybombs  all rather fairyfloss fairytale elements in a supposedly hardcore realistic film from a historians point of view it spoke loudly of propagandaa review of 90s films would be incomplete without and no doubt it will continue to be hailed as the greatest war film of all time for those reasons alone see but please dont believe the hype,reality
the beginning and ending of this film are very vivid but the middle slows down to a point where it loses its intensity and therefore cant be ranked among the best war films the best ones remain intense all the way through the film does stand out for not being as patriotic as all other wwii films it actually shows the war is hell side that we only really see in vietnam war films  but it ps me off spielberg can show hanging intestines severed limbs and other atrocities that all other film makers especially horror film makers are given nc17s for yet mr infallible can get away with it because hes making a meaningful film,reality
heck this is only the third best war movie nominated for best picture in 1998 the dday invasion scene is amazing the problem i have with the movie is the whole part the tale seems trite and uninspiring i want to care about a core group of characters or at least one thats what draws me to the deer hunter 78 or this years life is beautiful there are so many war movies out there that were amazing i will grant you that is the most accurate telling of dday but heck its not up for best documentary if wins best picture it will be the second tom hanks movie of the 90s that did not deserve the award,reality
is called the greatest war movie ever and those who say that are right spielberg is a true master when it comes to making movies has anybody seen a bad movie he made ever if you havent seen see it now  its great the war scenes are realistic and bloody and when you go out of the cinema you really think about those brave men how toke on the battle fields of europe now i want to see a movie about the eastern front and maybe a movie about the english men and french men in the beginning of ww2 i think its real important that we make these movies so young people knows the horrid things that happens in war i hail all heroes of ww2 as real heroes and hope they will never be forgotten and helps us to remember,reality
the movie as a whole was excellent  it deserves several academy awards  best picture and best director should be 2 of them  im sure if you looked hard enough though you can find something wrong with just about anythingi believe its good to hear all perspectives positivie and negative whatever your position is there are some undeniable facts 1 america was the biggest difference in ww2 2 america is the only true superpower left 3 hollywood is in ca which is a state in the usa  i only bring this up because i think it is the underlying source of a lot of resentment people feel about the display of american patriotism in the filmwhatever your feelings are about the movie you know that most of europe would be a part of germany by now if it werent for so many us soldiers fighting and dying for your freedomrespect the fact that this was a brilliant story told of the horrors of a war and the ultimate sacrifices ordinary people had to make many of them americans in a land from homesure there were some gratuitous patriotic moments nitpick at them if you must  but dont you think the young american soldiers some of them literly still kids dying in defense of your freedom paid for itps  i believe the us provided billions of dollars in aid for postwar economic and social reconstruction to the countries that needed it  i dont think these were ever paid back,reality
regardless of the quality of the movie a few points about some comments made by previous reviewers1  i dont know why you consider this a typical american movie  gee could it be because it was only about americans that was the pointit wasnt supposed to satisfy people from holland or england or anywhere elseit was meant to show what americans went through on dday were there any other countries at omaha beachno and if you ask any american vet who was there he will say the only thing that was missing for them when they saw it was the real bullets  by the way my grandfather was there  so to this extent and for these reasons yeh it was very nationalistic as well it should have been2 how could the americans beat the germans in the last battlewell first of all they didntonly the mustangs saved them and dday to the end of the war in general secondly it is possible that it could happen with well placed positions and a plan if you know military tactics and anywayits just a movie3  thirdly  they werent marines portrayedthey were army rangerslearn your historythe marines were in the south pacificall in all this was a brilliant moviei suppose you have to be american to get it,reality
once again the egotistic stupidity of my fellow man has not failed to amaze me i contiuously read in these comments about how people from other countries are offended by the stars and stripes flying in the bookends of spr or how proamerican the movies istoo badwe americans have every right to feel proud the american army took omaha beach not the british not the canadians and not the french yes every nation i just mentioned sacrificed its young men in the fight against nazi germany they all had casualties on dday we all know that but wake up people get a clue this is a movie about american soldiers it is not about dday see the longest day for that it is not about saving the world or answering the meaning of life what it is is a fictional story about a small american group of soldiers fighting to survivewhen i watch das boot i dont sit and whine about the fact that i dont see any americans or there are only british warships shown i take it for what it is supposed to be a story about men under extreme circumstances trying to serve their country do their job and stay alive  i suggest you all you know who you are grow up a little come back down to earth and look at spr for what is supposed to be entertainment very simply it is a movie a tribute from mr spielberg to his father who was a wwii vet nothing moreif you still dont get it if youre still offended if youre still whining because american soldiers stood tall on a tough day 50 years ago tough kiss my red white and blue a,reality
too much american patriotism  with all due respect too bad  its an american film and i see no reason to be apologetic about pride in ones country  the fact is that the united states was the primary reason why everyone in europe isnt speaking german and saluting a flag with a swastika on it  as much as that might tick you off its the truth  sure the characters couldve been canadian or british but again its an american filmtoo boring after the initial war scene  uh can you say story and character development  this was not necessarily meant to be an action drama so if thats what you were looking for then i can see how youd be a bit disappointed  however each boring scene did have a purpose  the deaths of wade and caparzo were important to the underlying needs of the many outweight the needs of the few theme  otherwise the end point would have less impact  i can see how one might feel it seemed slow after the omaha beach scene but its up to the viewer to switch gears at that point and get down to the business of watching a story unfold  if you want more explosions and blood watch platoon or full metal jacket or hamburger hillbest movie ever  pretty close to it imo  i think spielberg couldve spent a little time adding a human face to the german army as malick did for the japanese in thin red line rather than treating them all like monsters  but after seeing schindlers list i understand his reluctance to do so,reality
well i saw this movie when it first came out  i really didnt know what to expect but i must say that i was impressed  i have never seen camera direction quite like that  everything about this movie was very well donei have spoken with a lot of vets and historians who said that was a pretty close to how things were on the front  the only thing was that there was smoke on the beach which they couldnt put in the movie because we need to see whats going onim a pretty young guy young enough to be drafted and that movie allowed me to know that i never have to go to combat  steven did a great job of almost putting me in the warthe sound is absolutely amazing  i felt myself wanting to duck as the bullets whizzed by my headi must confess that the fist time i saw spr i was so caught up in the violence and intensity of the film the plot was somewhat muddled  i was compelled to go back and watch it again though  the second time around it made a lot more sense and as a result became a better movie to me  it is now one of my top 5 films of all time,reality
spielberg tries to make up for weak characterization and plot by use of extremely graphic imagery  why should i care about i know nothing about him except for the part of all his brothers being dead  should i care about him just because he decided to stay with his platoon rather than return home please give me something  and hanks hes had better parts and his performance is way overrated i like him as much as anyone but even his performance in big is better  in summary spr is a movie that looks great sounds great but lacks a solid plot and character development very much like the overhyped titanic,reality
some films make you laugh or cry or they shock you into thinkingor whatever this just makes you go urrgh  graphic violence to no particular end other than this freak out the audience factor nevertheless its well made well acted and is moving but for some bizarre reason spielberg is overcome by a massive need for a disgracefully cheesy ending which quite frankly does make you look at the rest of the film in a different light,reality
devastating film the landing on omaha beach was as realistic as it gets the sound and the camera angles were superb scenes like the inflated dead animals provided a view of war previously unexplored however i dont know how realistic was the freedom given to the german soldier who comes back to haunt the squad and slowly kills mellish with the knife that scene was shocking considering that the other american soldier was slowly drowning in his own blood next to them two involved in the loudest silence ive ever experienceddespite a weak plot i think spr is an excellent movie a solid work and a horrible reminder of the cruelty of war for those out there who love to wear military outfits as a fashion statement and would probably quit three minutes into the battlefor those who mentioned too much americanism in the film sorry thats life as far as i know this part of the war was an all american effort and theres nothing wrong in saluting once again the flag and the spirit of those who died protecting the freedom americans enjoy and of which i personally benefited while i lived in the usa it seems some folks take freedom for granted i wish you had lived here in nicaragua during the 80s you would understand that spirit much better if you havent experienced lack of freedom and im truly happy for you   try to refrain from making that type of judgementall and all spr is one the best attempts ever made to portray the horrors of war as sincerely as possible,reality
im sure that the first scene is one of the most important of the entire cinema history but the movie is too long and its full of all the classical american stereotypes the evil german the importance of the family and of course the last scene in the graveyard spielberg is the best director but i dont understand why he still continues on this triviality my vote is  6 thanks lillo,reality
this is a powerful and important film first because it is about salvation or redemption in this world rather than in heaven  on the physical level private gets saved and captain millers squad gets wiped out  on the figurative level captain millers squad and everyone in it is redeemedsaved saved because in spite of the obstaclesincluding the squads own internal dissensionit accomplishes its mission  but saved most importantly because it has identified a mission that was worth sacrificing for  at first the squad does not accept the mission as worthwhile  it comes as a result of a military command from top brass in distant washington dc they dont know private and besides they have mothers too  gradually and mostly because of the quiet insistence of captain miller they come to accept the mission as their own personal redemption  they are not going to do it because washington ordered it they are going to do it because it is meaningful in their own livesit is their ticket home they along with will have earned the right to go home they will have done their duty  this personal sense of mission is what the squad finds worthwhile sacrificing for  it is what keeps the squad together  it is why they accomplish the mission  andfor the world is pitilessit is why all but two die for the missionthis sense of personal redemption of having a personal goal or mission in life worth sacrificing for is the most american theme in the movie  it is probably why most americans respond instinctively to the moviebut is also about art  it defines art and embodies its definition  specifically the movie defines art as meaningful communication  meaningful communication is communication that is meaningful to both sender and receiver and that occurs in an effective medium  within the films story the most meaningful communications are the soldiers letters home  they are literally from the heart as they are stained with the soldiers blood  examples of miscommunication or bad communication abound in the movie  foreign languages yelling at a deaf soldier telling the wrong private that his brothers are dead not telling a glider pilot that his glider has been armored and is therefore heavier than usual letters from a national government telling mothers that their sons are dead even the order coming from washington  meaningful communication can be noisy but it can also be silent  the silent cemetery the unfurled flag captain millers silences  captain miller is the films expert communicatorhe teaches english composition in civilian life a pointed fact in the movie  to the spectator outside the film the most meaningful communication is the believability of the fact of warits din gore horror  and more than anything else the fact of the sacrifices that soldiers made in that war which brings me to the third and final point  this movie is powerful and important because it portrays the utter desolation of war  no other movie has affected me the way three scenes in this movie did  caparzos lifeblood streaming out and away from him in the pouring rain wade a medic begging for more morphine and mellish in a lifeanddeath struggle with a german soldier while an airborne ranger shot in the throat is in his own death throes  nothing is worse than being a combat soldier  no one else faces hopelessness and despair like thisa word to the nonamerican viewers of this film some of whom appear to resent its americanness  americans are entitled to portray american experience in their films and other arts  ibsen wrote plays about norwegian experience patrick white wrote about australia  that is not to be resented that is to be respected  viewpoints differ  what else is new,reality
this is a nice movie but theres something that makes this movie a nice movie instead of a bad movie the war scenes the first 30 minutes of the movie might be the best 30 minutes of the year and one of the best 30 minutes of the film history  its incredible those images are an inspiration for moviemakers those minutes are a filmmaking lesson those bloody disgusting violent scenes make everybody get shoked i mean youre in the world war ii  you feel youre there its an incredible masterpiece but thats it its over one of the greatest films ever stops just there thirty minutes after the film starts the rest of the movie does not fit with those 30 minutes or im afraid that i should say those 30 minutes are the ones that dont fit the movie its like as if spielberg had made that scene just for saying hey see how violent and disgusting i can be the rest of the movie might be made for the people who were  born in usa and since i was born in uruguay i didnt like it at all because the americans are always the good guys the only ones who have feelings why didnt steven spielberg take a look at the germans werent they afraid too and what about the last shot of the movie that american flag hey i like american people i really do but this movie just make them  say hey im proud to be an american my country is the best country of the world that might be true but theres something called modesty,reality
i saw 4 times  the first time on opening day i entered the darkened theatre with about 12 other people most of them my dads agewwii vets i went in with no preconceived notions i read no advance reviews i began to cry a couple minutes into it beginning with that sweeping view of the cemetary all those row upon row of white crosses i was completely blown away by the battle scenes that followed the praying terrified boys in the boats the machinegun slaughter and the sound of those gunshots the blood washing up on shore my hands had gouges in the palms where my fingernails dug in i left the theatre that day completely drained useless i went back a few days later so i might view the movie with a little more detachment and pick up some finer details while the opening scenes were still jarring i was a bit more composed to appreciate the other fine qualities and moments in this film the charactersperfect in their lightly sketched state  especially the characters of jackson the sniper and wade the medic the camera workastonishing especially in the battle sequences the memorable little speeches wade in the church talking about his mom the pilot of the downed plane reliving the crash reiben pensively discussing his customers breast size the death sceneswade getting killed and the desperate attempt of his companions to save him tom hanks losing it after that point his hold on sanity slipping mellish stabbed thru the heart begging for mercy months later these things are all very distinct in my mind as is the eerie screeching whine of that tank lumbering into the rubblestrewn town at the beginning of the final battle while this was not a perfect film it came close i embrace the reaction of four different film audiences as my own never in my life have i been to a movie once twice or even four times and had entire audiences go deadly silent in spr noone moved noone spoke a great many boys girls men and women wept after the movie ended people stayed in their seats stunned  i have never felt such a universal bonding of emotion that i did during that film  and that is why is so special  in this hopeless age where life is so cheap and the world has become cynical and hardened to death and disaster it is a relief to know we can still react to atrocities such as spielberg showed in this film  like human beingsthanks,reality
while spielberg manages to show the cruelty of war this film in my opinion is nevertheless dangerous as it in a subtle way promotes war rather than despising it spielberg wants us to make believe that under certain conditions war is a necessity and legitimate way of solving conflicts in my point of view this is at least debatable i dont like this movie although it is very well done from a technical point of view i dont like because it tries to make war presentable again rather than trying to show how to avoid it sorry but this time i cannot agree to the underlying message of this movie regardless how masterly skilled this message has been transformed into pictures,reality
this is in response to tims complaint about only seeing americans and germans depicted in sprthe whole premise of this film is to depict the horrors that captain miller and his men had to endure before during and after  they located  private leading to the fundamental question at the end of the film something about earn this  you remember dont youthe dday scene opens with a caption june 6 1944  omaha beach dog green sector  although an allied invasion site  according to my history books omaha was an american objective that resulted in over 2500 casualtiessecondly the mission was to locate an american private  i doubt that england canada austrailia or  fill in the blanks with country of your choice  would commit troops to locate a lost american  as far as russia is concerned most of them were busy on the eastern front  while the americans were traipsing through the countryside they were heading toward areas where they knew americans may be ie  101st airborne rallying points while at the same time trying to avoid armed conflict with the enemyim sorry if you were insulted by the lack of representation of other allied troops but again this film was based on a real  american soldier  who was actually  tracked down by an army chaplain not a british canadian or australian,reality
phew where do you start a film that shows at last what bullets and bombs do to the human body a film that shows that war is not about glory and seeing off a few of the enemy before getting home for tea it makes me wonder how those men stayed sane when they got home if they got home i found the film compelling and very very disturbing all too many american blockbuster films show people blazing away and the nasty men meeting their fatebut this one i believe is as close as a film has got to getting anywhere near the truth if the vets accounts are anything to go by and if it is then im bloody glad i wasnt 18 in 1944the most moving part of the film for me was when the troop attacked some kind of radar installation on the way to finding private after the attack one chap lies there with bullet holes in his chest whilst his mates try and help him slowly he starts slipping away and cries out for his mother and his home its a scene thats still with me weeks after seeing the movie another splendid side of the film for me was that there wasnt a clean cut gung  ho invincible hero to be seenjust normal ordinary and very scared menany flaws well for me personally the very end was a little too sentimental but thats the directors trade mark i suppose all in all a terrific pulsating horrific and terrifying film from my point of view i dont think ill ever look at an old man in quite the same way again,reality
there is very much to be said about this film but ill cut it short this is a very powerful film i may be a sensitive person but let me tell you that when watching titanic i merely felt embarrassed by the sobs around me but while watching private ryean i actually had to fight back the tears especially during those 30 first minutes of slaughter it felt so real and i started to imagine how i would have reacted in the same situation probably break down totallythis film should be watched by anybody unless youre too weak hearted that is,reality
as i have read the many reviews of ive noticed particularly from the more serious publications that serious critics insist on separating the bulk of the film from its bookend scenes of at the normandy cemetery  those scenes ive read several times are false hamhanded or manipulative  they could not be more wrongthese scenes which begin and end with an american flag shining in the sun illustrate the gap between the generation of men who crossed through hell on earth so that the sun would continue to shine on this country and its liberties and the succeeding generations who perhaps have failed to fully appreciate the debt they owe and the honor due those men who defeated nazi germany and fascist japanin the opening we see an old veteran walking alone his wife trailing him and trailing her the children and grandchildren  we see the son acting more like a tourist whose emotional distance from his father is shown by the intrusive clicking and winding of his camera  yet we also see the entire family rushing to his side as he collapses in grief wanting desperately to comfort him in some wayat the end we realize that the old man is which is perhaps the only flaw in this otherwise magnificent film  for this conflicts with the implication from the beginning when the camera zooms toward the old mans eyes to what seem to be his memories of omaha beach  if dropped behind german lines with the 101st airborne division how could he remember what happened on the beach  after some thought i figured that rieben the one survivor of omaha beach in captain millers squad might well have told as they made their way back to hq all that those men who found went throughsome critics have been particularly critical of the last scene with imploring his wife to reassure him that has indeed earned what millers squad did for him  i think the scene has far more depth than its critics have given it credit for particularly in light of an earlier scenerecall the lull between the americans defense preparations in roumel and the final street battle with ss troops when miller tom hanks and matt damon come to know each other a little better in a conversation that cannot help but be disconcerting to millerremarking on millers teaching occupation jokes that he could never be a teacher himself having driven his teachers crazy  youre just like a thousand kids ive seen miller says probably remembering when he said to sgt horvath this had better cure cancer or invent a longer lasting light bulbthat doesnt seem particularly special is only reinforced when the only clear memory can dredge from his brain about his brothers is a prank which embarrassed the oldest brother humiliated a halfnaked girl nearly destroyed the family barn and shows too clearly that for all his incipient nobility in refusing to abandon his brothers in arms is still a male adolescent for whom the line between humor and cruelty is rather blurred  this makes millers tight grin and diplomatic chuckle all the more poignantas the years passed i would imagine that would remember that conversation and as he matured realized how superficial he must have seemed to the older miller who died that might live  we can only guess how heavy it would have weighed on that he could not show miller the life he had lived since then and could not finally know whether he had earned millers gift  i fail to see anything resembling a false note hereto the rest of us the cross with millers name followed by old glory in the bright sun speaks to us in two ways  it illustrates at what a price our freedom and wellbeing have been bought  and with the colors absorbed by the sunlight thus giving the flag a faded look it places at our feet millers charge to that he earn this with equal urgency  whether we have earned or squandered this legacy is the question that every person watching should take to heartfinally a personal note in 1994 my wife my son and i had the pleasure of meeting a veteran of the 82nd airborne div  when he left for france to participate in the paratrooper reenactment we shook hands and i told him how honored i was to have met him  youre a good man and you have a beautiful family he replied  given the source i cannot remember ever receiving a higher compliment  a false note of course not  and neither is the ending of saving private,reality
this is the only war movie i have ever seen which is able to really show the true fear of the soldiers no exaggerated heroes just men however i have seen something that wasnt right im not sure if it is a goof or that a small part of the movie is missing i have seen it in the netherlands and noticed that tom hanks only tells his soldiers his past when they finally find and decide to stay there is a small scene in which tells tom hanks about his brothers starts this conversation with a question about tom hanks wife and her rosegarden i believe its a rosegarden but it could as well simply be roses tom hanks does not answer and says that hes going to keep that story to himself however does not know anything about his wifeeven though this continues to raise questions for me as to if its a goof or simply due to a cut i love the movie steven spielberg out did himself again,reality
this is a movie extremely well done with a lot of money and great historical background but cmon this movie doesnt deserve all the fuzz its been getting the plot is silly and the characters are flat just like all spielberg movies they are completely good or completely evil think about tom hanks character he simply doesnt exist now compare all spielbergs movies with scorceses movies wow now you see the difference deniro could never play the captain because he wouldnt have a character although i think tom hanks is really great this movie is just like amistad the good and the evil  and the emptiness,reality
well now  what is that there seem to be hundreds of comments in here that label this movie best film everwhat i saw was a thin story once again good heroic americans  who did the right thing well  occasionally accidentally shot an enemy who already had his hands up  but that can be blamed on the adrenaline flow it seems faceless soldiers on the other side which made it easy for the viewer to concentrate solely on the good guys no this was not a good war movie this was once again a hollywood product designed to feed the american myth of having died for the right cause the final salute to the captain at the cemetery fit nicely into this picture  i almost seemed to hear the starspangled bannerat the most this was a movie asking the question why several people had to go rescue one other man but an antiwar movie no way schindlers list was a movie with many different aspects to think about still distinguishes between americans and others as if the soldiers on the other side didnt die just as horrible ah  but i forgot you save a german hell be back later to kill you so you better execute him the first time is that what can be learned here,reality
after all the hype it is fair to say that the first 25 minutes are the finest most brutal depiction of warfare the screen has seen yet it is also clear that after years of having the ridiculous notion of war as cool thrust down our throats such a horrifying depiction in a genuinely mainstream picture was needed however after such a dazzlingly brilliant start when the story kicks in we find spielberg merely trotting out the old clichs weve seen so many times before again were told how glorious noble and almost desirable it is to die for our country how the germans were little more than cartoon villains and most sickeningly through the character of the young interpreter how the correct response to the horrors of war is to lose your innocent disbelief that this could happen and join in what makes this so sad is the fact that in the accurate depiction of the battles spielberg has already shown how hollow these notions are death in war is as empty and disgusting as any other painful violent death at the level of the ordinary soldier the allies were as scared and selfish as the germans and surely the reaction of the interpreter as he lay sobbing on the battlefield out of his mind with fear is the most honest and sane reaction to mass slaughter one could have,reality
i saw this film with my best friend jo we went into the cinema in happy good moods we walked out in floods of tears the two of us sat through almost the entire film gripping onto each others hands a film has never done this to me before and i thought titanic was bad the acting was superb and the special affects were amazing it really made you feel as if you were there even though in real life so im told the lives of eight men would not have been risked for saving just one i feel that the rest of the film was as real as it good be spielberg deserves a medal for this one,reality
savin private is just a great movie  tom hanks shows why he is one of the best actors ever with his performance and spielberg shows why he is the best director of all time  the battle scenes are great and very realistic and the music is wonderful  the scene where hanks character looks at the view is great  see this movie,reality
this a hard film to get into because of the long extensive battle scenes while war films arent necessarily my favorite genre and its not the greatest story i ever heard its certainly a masterfully put together film there are great moments in this that are spielbergs trademarks but the handheld camera and the selective omission of sound are truly great at getting you into the insanity and making it a realistic experience home video subtracts from the experience and you must find a larger screen if at all possible 810,reality
i really dont understand what is wrong with some people  they claim to hate this movie only for the reason in my honest opinion of trying to be some sort of nonconformer  like im this socially different guygirl so im not gonna like this movie and recommend some  other movie that nobodies heard of in order to try and be mr originality when in actuality their movie probably sucks  to these people please grow upanyway back to the actual movie this was one of spielbergs many great movies  this film was an excellent war movie  it served its purpose immensely to show the viewers the inhumanity and pointlessness of war  im really disappointed it didnt win best picture and that shakespeare in love crap didmany people watch this movie and say wow the first 30 minutes showed me what war was really like while this was true these people ignore many of the other small aspects of the film that help to bring out this theme of wars destructiveness and dehumanizationsome of these aspects are 1pvt jackson saying a prayer every time he is about to shoot someone2caparzos letter that has to keep getting rewritten because it kept getting blood on it first caparzos then wades and then captain millers3the squad laughing away as they dig through a mountain of dog tags not realizing that the dead airborne soldiers buddies are staring them down4capt millers tendency to keep zoning out in the midst of battle he keeps going deaf for a time and in these scenes he sees all the death going on around him and how pointless it is5capt millers shaking hand showing how scared he is and how he wants his gardening gloves in his hand not a gun6capt miller saying how he doesnt give a damn about and then changing his mind once he actually meets the young man and trades stories with him about home7copl upham starts out as a dorky nerdish kid strict on the socalled rules and then at the end works up his courage and executes steamboat willie realizing that this is what war is really like and not relying on an emerson quote to try and get him through thingsthere is a lot more examples of this but i think you can get the message this movie really shows the viewer about what war is really like and how bad it is  not just by showing an army storming a beach and getting blown to bits but also by concentrating on a few individual soldiers and showing how the war is affecting them  it was truly one of the best movies ever made and really accomplished its purpose well,reality
this review has spoilers in it  if you want to avoid them skip this review this is one of my favorite real war film along whith the secodbest film of the 90s 1 of the 90s is the matrix  all the acting is flawless except for the scene where the general says we have got to get someone to get that boy the hell out of there the film begins with the most intense battle sequence ive ever seen in a film at omaha beach june 6 1944  during the invasion a boy is killed who is the brother of private james who also lost two other brothers since james is the only one left a squad of eight soldiers is sent deep into enemy territory lead by capitian john miller tom hanks  once they find he refuses to leave his squad which is holding one of only two bridges that brach into poland  by the end only and two of millers platoon is left alive  as i said before all the acting in this film is exelent but the best preformance is edward burns preformance as rieband  i wont go into the directing because spielberg won best director at the oscars so  i give 9510,reality
im an action movie lover but typically war movies turn me off theres just too much awfulness going around  if stuff is blowing up i want it to be cartoony so i can enjoy it rather than be traumatizedand frankly most of the war movies ive seen have mostly commented on the horror of war ok i get it war is hell and id like to spend my life avoiding hell whenever possible its certainly not entertainmentdoes have its painfully realistic moments but there is a message and it is worth hearing it wont spoil the story for me to write it here those who died in war made a sacrifice that obligates us the survivors and beneficiaries of their sacrifice to live life to the fullest and make their sacrifice worthythis and many other themes are handled well in a superbly acted story whose visual effects are used to show the aspects of war rather than immerse us in 3d graphics chaos from which we learn nothing as in black hawk downwho should see this film war movie buffs action movie buffs even if you dont normally go for war films unless the deep thinking and arty aspects are a turnoff drama  arty types who dont easily get nightmaresill give an 8 out of 10,reality
i was told it was worth it to see this movie for the opening battle scenes alone and that turned out to be an accurate statement in no other war movie is there anything like the realism and aura in picturing soldiers being peppered and sometimes hit by machine gun fire  from pillboxes on dday no less with the tensions of an amphibious landing  the scenes of the wounded throughout this film are also something else serving as the archetype and forerunner of black hawk down  some points in the battle scenes beginning and later might be described as real and surreal at the same time a la kubrickthe rest of the movie as well lived up to the good things i had heard about it  tom hanks does extremely well as captain miller the leader of the pack in saving a private behind enemy lines because all of his brothers fighting elsewhere in wwii have been killed  hanks is very natural and convincing in this role leadership qualities and personableness forcefulness and bravery  the human element works and we are moved during the films progress and conclusion  see this one,reality
steven spielberg has made a hymn this movie pays hommage to millions of lives lost in all wars by the eyes of soldiers that could be just any soldier the synopsis isnt important james the last of four brothers will be bailed out of war so that he can return home before he dies a division is assigned the mission of finding him and bringing him back but it wont be that easy its just that simple without spoilers the real juice in this movie is first of all a masterful depiction of war as it was a stupid carnage that took thousands of lives and the opening sequence proves what im talking about those must be the most haunting 30 minutes of 90s cinema the movies also a great study of how man reacts when everything has cessed to make sense around him this movie is not an easy experience its a thrill ride but im not talking popcorn everyone should see it for his own sake this movie opens our eyes and well never look at war the same way again one of the best movies of the last decade and one of the biggest errors in the oscars,reality
i watched this film on dvd in 1999  i loved how spielberg was accurate and my favourite part of the movie was the introductory battle scene at the beginning of the movie because the graphic violent scenes were very realistic and intense due to the fact that many soldiers died by getting shot by or blown up with gruesome results i like the concept about eight soldiers risking their lives to find private james who is the only survivor on the invasion of dday in 1944  some find this movie violent but the grisly scenes in this film really happened,reality
if were honest the film is a good one but nothing special  the pace of the first half hour cannot be kept up and the rest of the film seems dull after such a breath taking opening  apart from the violence and oh my god look how real this is of the beach landings we have just another average how america won the war flick  spielberg should hold his hands up and admit how much of this picture he stole from a bridge too far the whole of the final battle is basedstolen from that film  not a bad film but far from a great one,reality
the first time i saw i was in a good theaterwith a superior sound system  no big deal no trauma but i did getemotional memory flashes of the rocket and mortar attacks that ifrequently experienced when serving on danang air base between 1969 and1970  we used to feel the mortars coming and going as they werewalked over the base by the nva in the hills raising and lowering themortar barrels    in addition to the obvious technical superiority of the film ithink does capture the essence of guys in a warzone  most of the film is brutally beautiful  although i was invietnam during the war and although i did come close to being blownup over there  i was not a combat soldier but with an air forceintelligence unit that was located just across the dirt road from theus marines   we had been selected because of our high paper testiqs and given relatively extensive training at specialty tech schoolsbefore getting to vietnam  in other words we were all corporaluphams   causes me a lot of soul searchingbecause i loathe the corporal upham character and i know if i hadsomehow been assigned to a us marine combat squad i probably wouldhave acted like upham the jerk   heres to the vietnam combat vets you guys really were something special,reality
this was a really brilliant movie the whole cast was great every body who was in the movie was brilliant steven spielberg directed this movie greatly the movie was very realistic also this movie tells you really what war is like this was a very sad movie also and tells great history this is the best war movie ever i give a 100 out of 10 ,reality
if this movie is known for one thing its the opening dday landing scene on the small screen this loses a lot of its power in the theatre there was no escaping the horrific sounds and images whereas at home you can turn the sound down and perhaps be thankful the screen doesnt fill your vision that this opening twenty minutes is the most harrowing and realistic depiction of the dday landings yet seen shouldnt be in doubt although hopefully ill never be in a position where i can make such a judgement based on personal experiencethis film says a lot with comparatively few words the actions of the men speak for themselves and its to the credit of the cast  including hanks whose acting ability im usually amongst the first to question  that their honest and understated performances are pretty much perfectits said that spielberg overrelies on playing with the emotions of his audience but when a movie succeeds in making you feel humble you know youve been experiencing a master filmmaker at the top of his game,reality
brutal reality of war to the full especially the first 2030 minutes when it shows the landing at omaha beachi think that british and canadians should stop complaining about them not being in it because it is about an american unit and an american landing after all so i wouldnt expect to see any british soldiers in itone thing that annoyed me though was the little remark that was the british armies only mention if you dont want to mention us then fine but why the insult about monty that guys overrated thanks for that one speilberg and whoever wrote it lets get some things straight shall we monty was an exellent general and was respected by german generalsgeneral rommel himself said that monty was the best allied general of the war does this not mean anything to americans who is better equiped to judge monty one of the best generals of the war rommel or speilberg and some american reviewers other than that i thought that this was one of the best ww2 films made in the 90s,reality
is one of the finest movies every made  the richly wrought characterizations were very deftly done  these were real men who had genuine fear of being hurt or killed  the acting was flawless on the part of the principals and the many supporting roles as well  a friend of mine saw the film ten times in the theater  i went out to buy the laser disc as soon as it came out  that was when laser disc cost 40 for a new movie  now one can purchase a dvd movie for about half that price in the discount storesis the classic war movie of all time,reality
big grand breathtaking wwii drama from director steven spielberg the focus of the story is on us army officer hanks and his loyal but reluctant group of rangers who are ordered to go behind enemy lines find a soldier whose three older brothers have been tragically killed in battle and give him a ticket home the performances of the actors are beyond superb and provide the films emotional stability as were drawn into each of their minds as they begin to justifiably question the significance of the task at hand however its the eyepopping realism and overpowering intensity of the battle scenes that really packs a wallop in this one of a kind historical drama spielberg has done it yet again in this heartfelt masterpiece ,reality
there really is no need to discuss what goes on in this film since all of the world has seen it 10 times over  tom hanks is possibly the greatest actor of my generation i being 26 when the film was released  thomas sizemore is one of my favorite actors despite always being a supporting actor  no question that this is the greatest war movie ever created and it will take something very special to steal that crown away  as far as im concerned it was the best movie that ive ever seen to date  obviously i gave it a 10,reality
there is perhaps something a slightly wrong with seeing realistic war movies for entertainment  it is also perhaps slightly off topic to opionate on whether this is the greatest movie or one of the greatest movies of all time or not mr spielberg thanks for helping me to understandtheres more i could say but i dont feel like talking right now,reality
i never finished watching this movie and i dont really care to i wasnt unsettled or bothered by the opening sequence merely bored it wasnt compelling merely gory and heavyhanded it was a reverse tactic to try and get the audience involved in the story and frankly it didnt work for me and as the movie progressed i cared less and less about the story boring and overrated 110,reality
five years after schindlers list director steven spielberg delivered another powerful motion picture drama this movie set during wwii tells the story of a group of soldiers led by army captain tom hanks who go into france to find a private whos three brothers were killed in action and send him home the opening 30 minute dday sequence is one of the most harrowing movie scenes ever filmed the story is exceptional the directing is brilliant and the acting is excellent tom hanks is terrific as usual and is supported by an outstanding cast which includes matt damon good will hunting tom sizemore black hawk down edward burns shes the one vin diesel the fast and the furious adam goldberg a beautiful mind jeremy davies twister barry pepper 61 giovanni ribisi suburbia and hurst remember the titans some of these actors have gone on to bigger things since this movie but theyre all good here popular tv star ted danson tvs cheers and becker and veteran character actor dennis farina midnight run and get shorty even turn up in cameos should have won the best picture oscar for 1998 because its a war movie thats harrowing and powerful it did go on to win 5 oscars including spielbergs best director win its one of the best war movies ever made out of four,reality
for the few people who voted under at least a 6 rating i believe you dont see the importance of the movie  it was probably the best or at least most realistic war movie ive ever seen and ive seen a lot of war movies it truly depicts what the average combat soldier went through on an daily basis and what men had to go through to save the country we live in today  i once heard stephen ambrose one of the most wellknown and respected historians of the us say was exactly what all the people ive been interviewing about this war told me it was like  steven spielberg and tom hanks both received the highest civilian medals possible from the navy for making this film  it inspired me and if it didnt inspire you you should watch it again and think about what was did to preserve our beloved united states  and you should realize that this is as close to ww2 that were going to get  it sets the standards for any war movie to come and probably will as long as were still making movies,reality
directed by steven spielberg and starring tom hanks is set in the second world war the story begins with the american soldiers storming omaha beach and hundreds of casualties result within the first halfanhour there is much blood shed and violence in order to capture the authenticity of the actual dday invasion its obvious spielberg went to great lengths to capture this accuracy with a sense of documentarylike filming and incredible special effects capt john miller hanks leads his men into the horrendous battle of omaha beach and loses many of his men after many advances up the beach and penetrating the german base they take their prisoners and whats left of their patrol and return to headquarters this is where miller receives his orders to retrieve private matt damon dropped somewhere in normandy and bring him home to safety has been chosen to come home due to his three older brothers all dying in the war sparings mother of the grief of losing all four of her sons general marshall has ordered a mission to save private miller gathers whats left of his platoon nine soldiers and heads out to normandy to find their trek in search of is no easy task to quote capt miller its like trying to find a needle in a stack of needles usually plot driven films evolve around 1 dimensional characters however these characters are far from that the characters are deep and emotional many of them reminiscing of their past home lives families and fallen comrades in the war helping to deepen the plot in return many of them insult each other humorously and help deal with their situation by complaining about it once in a while they reveal their emotions to each other but mostly bottle it up until they are alone their journey is hard and deadly they first arrive to a decimated french town and lose private caparzo vin diesel who attempts to help a young french girl the message here is if you open your heart to someone in war you will only get hurt in war there is only room for killing and death further along they come along a german bunker armed to intercept american patrols despite the disagreement of his soldiers miller orders an assault and we lose medic wade giovanni ribisi with one german survivor the men want to execute him but miller decides to let him go to settle his men miller reveals his background that hes an english teacher and that he doesnt want to kill men he doesnt have to every man i kill the farther i get from seeing my wife finally miller and his men find private by accident they tell him their mission and despite the grief of his lost brothers decides to stay with his platoon and continue guarding a bridge miller eventually decides to helps platoon guard the bridge but afterward hes taking homes entire platoon is killed and 4 of millers men as well by the end of the battle miller is shot lying next to a fallen comrade he pulls down to him and whispers the most important message of the film earn this the end scene is older now in present day visiting the american graves in normandy he stands above millers grave with his family showing him that hes a good man and that hes tried to earn his gift everyday of his life the plot contains a melodrama 8 men searching half a country for 1 plus all the obstacles they must confront and losing 7 lives in the process many of the characters appeal to every emotion possible sadness despair fear happiness courage and grief there is plenty of extravagant action and the special effects are outrageous the moral of the story is that war is hell its stupid and violent and leads only to death yet men who are willing to stand by each other help each other in the face of death and give it their all will survive and live on this is one of the greatest films ever made and even semibased on a true story but it was one chaplin who was sent to find the soldier,reality
it is particularly depressing that folks cant watch this movie and enjoy its technical achievement without bashing its americanism  give us all a break  the soldiers are very flawed and the us is shown to make blunder after blunder  the germans are portrayed as an external menace but so what  isnt that what war is about  so one of them is a coward  big deal most of them are shown as very determined soldiers unlike the rangers who are all over the mapas for americans being proud of helping defeat nazi germany  what is wrong with that  by the time the us entered the war 34 of the western war effort had been shouldered by that country not to mention the colossal undertaking in the eastas far as serious war movies americans make of themselves i can only say that recently americans almost always portray themselves in a negative fashion  the hollywood that folks love to bash is notoriously antiamerican these last 30 years  dont believe me  watch platoon apocalypse now born on the forth of july hamburger hill the thin red line etc  if you think there is much flag waving in those films youre very much mistaken  some of them were very good however  it is charming to listen to foreigners equate hollywood with americaif prejudice against americans precludes you from enjoying american films then dont watch them  if you do however i suggest you review the movie not its country of origin,reality
i guess i am one of the few who do not sing praises about this film i am a great admirer of steven spielbergs early worksespecially his small great film duel the later works of spielberg have relied on emotions of audiences not cinema as a creative medium or as a vehicle to present intelligent perspectives it is sad that terrence mallicks intelligent film the thin red line on the same war lost out to this melodramatic ordinary effort from a man who has done better films when he had less success and money a few shots of the old spielberg did surface briefly when the film captured the first rain drops and the boots of soldiers getting wethollywood has made better war films than this one the little known castle keep was one such film spielberg knows what appeals to the average american mind and makes movies that will be lapped up without giving the average moviegoer any reason to reflect or think he has begun to play on emotions and is no longer reaching out to thinking viewers he is aware that this will not make the boxoffice jingle most people do go to movies to relax not to be wiser mallick on the other hand makes movies the way he wants them made forcing his viewers to think mallick will slowly be recognized as a master filmmaker in the us by adults as time goes by while spielberg will continue to appeal to the juvenile minds of adults who love action and emote easily the difference was evident when the berlin international film festival recognized mallicks film with top honor and the academy awards bestowed its top honors on spielberg in the same year viva la difference,reality
i admit i havent seen the thin red line that others rave about personally i thought this was the best war film ive seen but thats comparing it to mostly old ww2 movies starring john wayne and the like  i wont go into details of how this is good because so many people say it so much better  the realism of battle the pain the desperation of men who know they are dying the suddenness of death   all of that was just fantastichowever this is not a perfect movie  the characters are undeveloped and two dimensional giovanni ribisi came the closest to giving his character more dimension in his one tiny little moment in a bombed out church though that didnt bother me  the emphasis was really on the battle scenes  tom sizemore although we know next to nothing about his character also gave a performance of some depth  tom hanks character who was supposed to be so secretive was the only one we learn about and that wasnt that interesting  however i dont think it was necessary to know the background of each character in this moviethe worst character in the movie is matt damons private  he was so blahhhhhh  the worst part of the movie is the beginning and end which begins with an old private having a flashback of things he didnt actually witness how does that happen  and ends witha  typical speilberg like speechlesson  yawn,reality
my favorite film should be remembered for decades to come as one of the greatest war films ever made  director steven spielberg and screenwriter robert rodat captured the brutality and realism of war with a certain passion  i still cant believe shakespeare in love won the best picture oscar over this film after twenty minutes of the graphic recount of the dday landing on omaha beach we find out that a private james who is behind enemy lines has to go home after his three brothers have been killed in combat  captain john miller tom hanks leads a squad of soldiers to find with some of the most graphic battle scenes this is a film that will haunt you  it will make you realize of the horrors the soldiers had to face spielberg and private does world war ii like oliver stone andplatoon did for vietnam  this is a film not to be missed,reality
quite simply is extremely overrated oh the movie isnt a total wash in fact about 12 is fantastic but theres also 12 total crap the battle scene that begins the film is fantanstic especially since it goes on and on for a full 20 minutes without a doubt the highlight of the movie in addition the mens journey to find private is usually quite engaging and the performances particularly those of tom hanks giovanni ribisi and tom sizemore are excellent however all that good stuff is surrounded by weak sentiment and logic that rings completely false for starters the scenes of the old that bookend the film are spielberg at his most cloying theres nothing more annoying than a director pulling every trick possible to get tears out of his audience besides that the film is extremely manipulative and is derailed by some ridiculous logic at the end despite all this is still a sometimes engaging film and is worth seeing but 26 all time please the thin red line which was released with much less hype the same year is much better in fact after you see this movie track down the hbo film when trumpets fade an extremely underrated war film from the same time with much less phony emotion,reality
steven has done it again a superb film about world war 2 this is a movie that i have watched several times and i still get so mad at upham this is a movie worth to be owned on dvd and i strongly recommend it for all of you that havent already seen it,reality
contains spoilers it may be fashionable to trash popular films but i try to make it a habit only to trash truly bad ones such is the case of one of the worst best picture nominees in recent yearsalongside gladiator which won the award what makes it so bad how do i count the ways the twitching finger of jeremy davies the incredibly bad soliloquy delivered by privatematt damon the stupid decision possible spoilers of tom hanks and co to let private have  his way and stay and fight off the germans in spite of all the crap the team went to in trying to locate him the german who threatens the life of hanks and co and then when they decide to let him live he comes back to haunt them again what are the chances of having problems with the same psychotic german twice when there are so many other enemies lurking about what about the ending of the film which makes no sensethink about itprivate couldnt be remembering everything that happens in the entire film he wasnt even there during dday at least we didnt see him spielberg continues his sad slide after the lost world and amistad hopefully ai was better,reality
i saw this film one saturday early in the day i was never a huge war movie fan but i gave it a shot anyway all i can say is i was shocked at how great of a movie it was and how good a war film can actually be i give it  out of  amazing film,reality
trenchant world war ii drama about an army captain tom hanks assigned to take his squad of seven men into france locate a private whose three brothers have been killed in combat and let him go home conventional elements in the script are balanced by a genuinely complex examination of heroism in the field and over powered by the most realistic relentlessy harrowing battle footage ever committed to a fiction film,reality
still ranks as one of the great oscar upsets of all times  its really unfortunate that the tom hanks  steven speilberg backlash caught this movie and shut it out of the place in history it deserves shakespeare in love please an accurate creation with a undercurrent of pride mixed with duty that should make every gen x  yer think,reality
a script that begins with a credible concept of wartime legal necessity then winds up at the dead end of a private baldly disobeying a superior officer  and staying in the war  is almost unworthy of comment  more believable scenarios with laughtrack came out of hogans heroesmaybe theres a pacifist motivation in having the guy disobey his superior then having the superior meaninglessly die  war  what is it good for but the other half of that 50 chance is that the writer or writers just didnt know what else to do with this thing  after all they clearly didnt intend to write midway or patton,reality
no doubt about it the landing on omaha beach is great stylistic filmmaking succeeds in conveying the violence and randomness of war  after that 25 minutes however the film quickly falls into an episode of combat alas without vic morrow  tom hanks dead serious expressions bring more to the material than is there  then for the final hunk as they attempt to hold a bridge john williams score even changes to be vaguely reminiscent of an indiana jones action sequence  sorry to say it but in my book this isnt close to spielbergs world war ii masterpiece schindlers list  its three films tacked together and then marketed as if it were our solemn duty to the memories of those who served in the armed forces to watch it  well ive watched it and feel it does their memories a disservicetheres far superior war films  patton battleground the longest day twelve oclock high the bridge on the river kwai to name a few  to turn to for emotionally gripping accountsalso if you get the chance watch the pilot episode of combat saunders morrow first survives landing on omaha beach then needs to take his squad to secure a bridge and encounters a german tiger tank  dont watch because the tv show is an accurate portrayal of history  it isnt  watch to see the similarities to the action plot points in,reality
the greatest war movie sure the plot is really simple 8 soilders trying to save one but mrspeilberg knows the material of this movie tom hanks does a brillant and wonderful performance everybody in this movie does a great performance even ted dansen and the guy who played upham yeah i know he was a coward but he did a great performance on being a coward i guarentee this movie to anyone,reality
spielberg set out to create a war movie unlike anything ever seen and he succeeded brilliantly  the visual style puts you right there on omaha beach  the handheld cameras take away the clean rehearsed feel that can hurt movies that need to rely on realism  i could go on all day about the films first half hour the dday invasion but everything the needs to be said about it has already been said  suffice to say that it will leave you gasping for air the story is fairly simple but it works  mostly it exists for the purpose of developing each character further  each character gets at least one moment to reveal himself and to say something about the nature of men at war  it can seem a bit preachy at times but it fits with the pull no punches unapolagetic nature of the film the acting is absolutely brilliant  a great ensemble with no weak individual performances except possibly edward burnsplaying the same wiseass city boy he does in every movie  my personal favorite performance is that of giavonni ribisi  he brings very convincing honesty to every line he delivers anyway this is one of those movies that everyone needs to see sometime it sheds new light on one of the most important events in history while telling a good story at the same time,reality
this is definitely the best war movie ever made sure it wasnt one of those movies where every second of the movie is action like the planet of the apes 2001 a lot of these comments i totally disagree with because there was plenty of action,reality
this is the best damned war movie ever made madebar none as a freelance writer i have had the priviledge to interview veterans from ww 1  2 korea vietnam and the persian gulf my grandfathers were in ww2 as wellmy dad was in the 82nd airborne and he had sergeants that were in the dday drop they have told me how this is the closest thing and best depiction of what it was like who am i to argue they were there we werent they praised the accuracy of the weapons the characters their actions and the combat plus it was a damn good story the next most commented on item was how the army after the sullivans tragedy was damned if it did and damned if it didnt rescue privatelike schindler list this movie should be shown in high school history classes as part of their lessons on ww2 veterans told me they would include the longest day and tora tora tora in that category as well too many people knock it because of its big budget i dont understand that the movie works in every way i first saw spr up in alpena michigan where it was filled with mostly older ww2 generation people some were veterans they had their wives with them when we left there wasnt a sound made nobody said a word exiting the theatre spr touched the crowd that much i had a vietnam vet who i work with say that after he saw the movie he was saddepressed for about three days afterward he said platoon didnt even affect him that way isnt that the sign of a great movie of this type one that reaches out and makes you feel things you never felt or experienced beforeone that actually moves you very deeply i witnessed that personally as people left the theatre i can only hope that spielberg makes another war movie hopefully maybe one on the battle of the bulgei can hardly wait for band of brothers on hbo this fall this was the greatest war movie ever made definitely a must seeas far as the top five war movies go i would rate them this way 1 2 cross of iron 3 the longest day 4 the thin red line 5tie all quiet on the western front and platoon honorable mention should go to the best years of our lives go for broke battleground tora tora tora patton  a bridge too far,reality
being of a generation predating the war i dont really have an understanding of what these men went through  this movie is the closest i have come to feeling the genuine fear and bravery these men dealt with every day of the war  in my opinion this is more than just a movie unlike so many other war films  the drama portrayed in touches me in a way that only being there can surpass,reality
i find some of the comments that is another gungho patriotic john waynetype propaganda movie just a little bit laughable this is not a john waynetype mycountryrightorwrong tract and director steven spielberg has seen to that  true spielberg never fired a shot in angerbut then neither did the dukethe whole idea is that war is hell  this is true the moment the characters played by tom hanks edward burns tom sizemore and others set foot on omaha beach on june 6 1944 and encounter massive german resistance in one of the most graphic and violent sequences ever captured on film one that lasts a good twentyfive minutes  the film then proceeds on as hanks and his platoon are assigned to find a private james matt damon who has lost three brothers in other theaters of world war ii and who is believed to have parachuted down behind enemy lines before the dday invasionwhat spielberg has done is very much in the tradition of oliver stones platoon and stanley kubricks full metal jacket though in an obviously less iconoclastic fashion  he has shown how war can bring out the best and the worst in the men who have to fight it  granted spielbergs setting is world war ii while stones and kubricks were vietnam but the feeling is the same  was welldeserving of the oscars it received and like its two vietnam counterparts gave me a greater appreciation for what men who must fight these horrible wars regardless of nationality go through  1010 rating,reality
so far this has to be my favorite movie of al time i mean int he begining those 20 minutes of beach warefare actually made it seem as if you were there yourself after those 20 minutes the only good thing about the movie was how realistic it waslast battle in the movie even besides that overall the movie deserves 10 stars it really simulated war during ww2,reality
okay the film is directed by the amazing steven spielberg and it stars the just as amazing tom hanks you obviously have a winner on your hands and of course you do is a truly brilliant film with great performances from everyone including tom hanks tom sizemore adam goldberg vin diesel and giovanni ribisi the film definitely deserved all the oscars it received is a mustsee and i give it a well deserving 1010,reality
this gory pseudo patriotic movie is just not that good behind the emotionalism is the real danger of blind faith in anything the acting is not that greataverage at best and the only real exceptional factor of the film is the special effects which serve only to make it for a  more unpleasant experience for a group of outnumbered green soldiers to take on a tank column without proper weaponery is not only stupid on their part but very unrealitstic anybody would have run the real attraction for people seems to be the greatest generation myth which has popped up recently this view that the folks living during that time were somehow superior morally or otherwiseremember this is the same generation that tolerated segregation and japanese internment gives us a flawed view of history these people just did the things they did because they had to,reality
contains spoilersanyone who has not already seen the film might prefer to watch it before reading this review as in order to make my point i must discuss the endingalthough the film contains one of the most powerful scenes i have ever seen the ultimate message and overall impact of the movie were drowned in a sacharine sea of contrived sentimentality and bathos the one scene that was of itself worth the price of admission was the mesmerizing sequence in which one soldier bayonets another in a way that superbly contrasts the intimacy and immediacy of hand to hand combat with the indiscriminate and impersonal butchery of the normandy landings portrayed in the opening scenes i was fascinated appalled and riveted to the screen i shall never forget itunfortunately by comparison the rest of the film was a copout i had recently watched the movie saviour and found it a far more powerful statement about war and its impact on those caught up in it spielbergs movie could have been even better he could have created a film that would haunt audiences for generations consider this simple twist dies and captain miller lives now how do we feel abouts decision to remain with his comrades was he being noble or foolhardy what would be the difference was the captain noble to disobey orders or criminally negligent if miller is not conveniently taken care of by fate will the army punish him will he ultimately believe he did the right thing or will he wrestle forever with guilt would it somehow have been worse for to have escaped unscathed while his mates died did have the right to dictate his own actions does any soldier should they was the army hypocritical to place greater value upon the life of one individual within its ranks what about parents with only one child to lose would their burden somehow be less to who or to what does a man owe his greatest loyalty are there even answers to these questions maybe war just is hellmaybe but youd never know it by spielberg,reality
was the movie done well  yes beautifully was it any good  no not at allwhat was the allure it was long unentertaining and i really found no point  maybe that was the point but the pointlessness of war could have been made fasterthis movie turned me off of war movies for years  i always wanted to see a thin red line but im still too warred out years later,reality
after reading the plethora of reviews on this movie im amazed at how many people think they are experts on warlets keep in mind that mr spielberg directed the movie  he didnt write it  he no more claims to be an authority on war than my kids do he is a magnificent director and he does his job well which is bringing realism and emotion to the forefront of an otherwise brutal look at war the people who put the film together are some of the most knowledgeable and experienced veterans and historians in the world today so lets give them a little credit for those of you who have never been there dont comment on credibility or realism unless youve actually seen it or done it and have something to compare it to  is undoubtedly the closest most people will ever come to being in the war thank godthe story is based on the hypothetical scenario of seven us army rangers along with a cowardly army corporaltranslator from the 29th infantry division who are given the outrageous task of finding a paratrooper pvt who was dropped behind enemy lines in normandy france during operation overlord in wwii  as the sole surviving son of a midwestern family the brass decides it would be noble to find him and send him home when they realize that all three of his brothers have been killed in the line of duty within 24 hours of each other and his mother will be receiving all three telegrams at the same time  the real story lies in the frustration of the soldiers themselves at trying to cope with risking their lives foolishly for the life of one man who is just another soldier to them the orders seem ridiculous to the rangers but as tom hanks character capt john miller keeps reminding them they are soldiers and its their duty to follow orders  period  it is a good portrayal of a scenario that couldve very easily happened during the war  other things far more ridiculous than that did happen  trust methe movie is well done and very entertaining if you dont look to find an action movie underneath the story  its compelling moving and the omaha beach scenes are downright shocking at times  while the movie makes all efforts to be as historically accurate as possible please remember that this is not a history lesson or a documentary  tom hanks plays the part of the unknown soldier a captain of the rangers second battalion who were the first american units on the beach at omaha  the 2d rangers were also the unit that despite insurmountable odds penetrated the german defenses and secured the beachheads for the rest of the allied units arriving at omaha on dday  the fact that they played the parts of us rangers of the second battalion is a true depiction of some of the greatest heroism this country has ever known alone in itself  it is a movie about war and true heroism and it is historically accuratefor those of you who think there was too much flag waving and blatant patriotism what is wrong with that  and those of you who think that the germans were portrayed as being too evil  this movie is about eight soldiers following orders and doing their jobs above and beyond the call of duty  it has nothing to do with who was the good guy and who was the bad guy  if you want to see a movie that portrays war from a german soldiers point of view watch all quiet on the western front or better yet read the booki highly recommend this movie to anyone who has any interest in war movies it is very accurate historically right down to unit numbers and troop disposition as well as the general attitude of the soldiers themselves at least mr spielberg has the common sense to hire some of the best people qualified to make the storyline authoritative such as steven ambrose  he doesnt take it upon himself to try to recreate history itself  the effects are astounding and the acting is good  if you dont like tom hanks being portrayed as a patriotic war hero than you definitely wont like this movie  while hes not john wayne mr hanks is definitely americas archetypical hero actor of today  dont make the mistake of comparing private to vietnam war flicks its a totally different genre that has never been captured so intensely on filmnot a good movie for the kiddies to watch lots of violence and graphic scenes,reality
many just dont get it  this is an antiwar movie the plot concerns a group of men sent to do something kind of pointless and futile in one of the most necessary and important wars of the last 2000 years  this plot is based partially on a true story however the true story happened during the civil war not during world war iifor a wide variety of critics of this movie a copy of t2 and matrix would be all they need to keep them cinematically happy for the rest of their lives  do not i repeat do not go to see this movie for some actionadventure  go rent raiders of the lost ark or some other wornout mindnumbing eyecandy moviethis movie is really different  it is arguably that only war movie in history that is 100 realistic all the way down to the pacing of the war itself  war consists of periods of ferocious fighting and abject terror bookending long periods of introspection and fear  the closest thing to this movie is all quiet on the western frontthe musical theme for this movie is also superb  it can be compared to the outstanding theme for patton  however the tone and emphasis of the movie and the music are the polar opposite of that of patton i ended up buying this movie and watching it about 10 times  i like the theme so much that i just put it into the dvd and play the music in an infinite loop on the stereo  this is the first dvd that ive used so much that i lost it and im going to have to buy another copy,reality
come on for all people who say this movie is boring non entertaining and finding stupid flaws with it give me a break this is easily the best war movie ever to say that you were not moved by it in any way means you have some sort of mental ailment or you are lying i cannot understand how people say such movies like the matrix are better the matrix may be a good filma great film but to say it was better than this movie should be a sin most definately the mtv generation making such statements as this anyone who agrees with me can email me all others read a few books about ww2 open up your mind and watch it againemail me with your comments,reality
spielberg makes some great films schindlers list being one of my all time favourites but just doesnt do anything for me  the dday beach scene was very well done but the rest of the film is just dreary  spielberg should have read spike milligans war memoirs before making this film,reality
if youre going to the video store tonight to pick out a war film go a little further to the right in the aisle and pick out the thin red line which is a thoughtful representation of war for intelligent people  is not  spr is little more than a usa flagwaver with a powerful dose of americas other national anthem brutal bloody violence in the name of god and countrythin red line is a much much much much much better film and any intelligence you have will not be insulted by it,reality
spielberg has a talent for showing not telling  he doesnt tell you war is stupid pointless and takes young men away from their mothers  he doesnt have to  mrs seeing the war dept car pulling up to her house and knowing that at least one of her sons is dead unsteadily falls to the ground a young man crying for his mother as he lays dying another boy getting his arm blown off staggers for a minute then retrieves his arm and scurries off  and this is just the first twenty minutes  these images show you what war is like  it doesnt preach  it just shows the reality and allows the viewer to make his own decisionsome people complained germans were depicted negatively in this film  what do you expect  american soldiers whove just seen their buddies blown to bits make friends with the enemy  one of the great strengths of this film is that its viewed through the eyes of these young men  when the nervous little translator laughs and talks with the soldiers german captive that actually felt realistic but not negative  the german was a young man too and you almost felt sorry for him when the other soldiers consider shooting him  the film simealtaneously shows both sides and the viewer realizes the truth when fighting a war youre killing not just some faceless shadow youre fighting 17year olds who have families and blood and dreams  if everyone in the world was forced to watch this movie we wouldnt be having problems in the middle east or ireland or anywhere else,reality
quite a strange film this one  i would have to say that the opening sequence is impressive but then the film has something to live up to unfortunately in my opinion it fails and seems to plod on from scene to scene until the big finale when action takes over againi admire the fact that it is trying to bring to life an event that so many of us can not imagine  i for one can not realise what the men who fought for their country any country gave and hopefully never will have to but this film tries to address the issue  successfully too  that is where the film succeedsunfortunately i dont identify with any of the characters within tom hanks team  to me it seems they are just a large group thrown together so they all can be killed one by one as a kind of sacrificial lamb  a kind of oh its another battle scene which one shall we kill off this time  in between the conversations between the characters seems a filler to try and give the individual some personality so you feel for them when if they eventually die  for me personally i was losing interest and was actually wondering which one would be next an average film overall but does show that not all aspects of war are about glorya once in a lifetime experience  ie i would only recommend you watch it once  not the type of film to watch again and againto the people writing about only americans being shown in the war  an american group of soldiers landing with an american infantry sent on a mission by their leader an american obviously to rescue an american soldier from a place where only americans are based  it doesnt seem that strange to me   if i was the leader i know i wouldnt go to a group of british or french soldiers asking the whereabouts of an american soldier surely you would go where americans are based,reality
this movie was realistic but thats about all it had going for it  basic plot basic characters  quentin tarintino on his worst day could produce a more compelling cast of characters to feel for  i can name off the top of my head a lot of better war movies than private  full metal jacket platoon apocalypse now etc,reality
everyone tells me how good this movie is i was so excited when i went to watch it hmm it was so sub par i mean everyone says oh my god that beach battle scene is so good its so realistic first of all how do you know its realistic oh thats right everyone has been to war and since when do you judge a movie in accordance with its special effects does that mean matrix is the best movie ever i love the matrix i am just making a point in actuality this movie was very boring also the way in which the beach scene was shot was no clever it was stupid and annoying if theyre going to show the scene i dont care to be in the shoes of the soldier if im not going to be able to see what was going on if the camera needs to be in 1st person keep it there to change around was so unprofessional that scene was a little entertaining when it wasnt annoying the gore was cool but i am a gore enthusiast so it doesnt make sense the rest of the movie was anti climatic and boring,reality
although this movie cost millions and millions of dollars steven spielberg went for cheap ideas yes this movie is just a heap of tricks and cliches that can appeal to a great bulk of the population as it evidently didsequences made of shots of guts being spilled heads blown up intersected with sounds of war and then complete silence can be thought to be a very artistic and intelligent way to construct a movie but in this film it certainly is not the case the film lacks ideological background it just plays and replays on the already used reused and recycled horrors of war yes we know war is horrible yes we know war is inhumane what is portraying that is new it just plays on emotions that the public readily agrees to have this movie hardly makes anybody think its just restating what countless others have already said the film is not innovative at all it uses a formula which will guarantee positive public reaction big bucks an academy award nomination and hopefully an award as it sadly didthe film on its formal standpoint is just another postclassical hollywood movie a lot of people big names on screen special effects nothing out of the ordinary do we see innovative or powerful use in its lighting no editing no camera movements no they do look spectacular i must agree with that but nothing else they have no concept to fall back onthis is just one of the hundreds of movies that play on cliches and dont dare to go beyond they do not dare think,reality
after the over edited overhyper opening sequence this movie settled down to some of the worst bad acting school exercises ive ever seen  some very good actors were reduced to cliched dialog obviously written to sound improvisational  every 1940s war movie ploy was on display and even surpassed by the hokey ending with the music poured on like syrup,reality
i gave this movie a six because of the first 23 minutes after that the movie falls flat if spielberg had remade the longest day with the battle scenes like the beginning of this movie there would have had to have been psychiatrists at every screening to deal with the cases of post traumatic stress disorder what people fail to realize is that spielbergs movies look so good because of his cinematographer janusz kaminski so stop heaping all the praise on spielberg remember everyone talks about that first twenty minutes not the rest,reality
this is just yet another movie about war i guess it was very reak for them to hold that bridge but for me personally i think the plot was very flawed the use of a lot of carnage was meant well i guess but ended up looking like army of darkness for the first hour then switched to being a walk in a bombed out land i dont think that tom hanks was worth it in this movie hate to say it but this is just not his type of movie he is too neat for it,reality
i was dismayed when this film was hailed as the greatest war film ever made apart from the first scenes on the beaches it was just another serving up of american tripe  for real gritty realism see das boot or the cruel sea  steven spielberg wasted an excellent opportunity and the film loses its way after the first 30 minutes  the ending is quite honestly rubbish   910 for the first 30 minutes 210 for the rest,reality
this might contain spoilerscall me crazy but as a movie spr is not more realistic than say the poetic thin red line especially during the final scenes it has the feeling of an old john wayne flick when our brave heros fight against an evil much superior but dumb enemy and in the last moment when everything seems lost the cavalry arrives and saves the day and beside that who destroyed the french village where this final battle takes place apparently not the americans of course but when paris fell after a six week campaign in 1940 the war in france was over and there was no need for the germans to destroy villages in the far west in terms of realism movies like das boot or hope and glory and i am sure many other films that i have not seen yet are superior to spr you might refer to it as the most realistic depiction of the day on omaha beach thats allbut the first 20 minutes are truly devastating utterly brilliant in its choreography it is not possible to recreate omaha beach on the screen but spielberg did his or anyones best to give the audience a hindsight what happened to those brave men in that battle after this first act the movie goes pretty straight downhill i didnt care for the characters the members of the sprsquad are a bunch of stereotypes representing the most average and archetypical group of american wwii soldiers you can imagine i believe this is done by purpose and a bad idea because without interesting characters a movie cannot be that good therefore it has a story not character driven plot that drags unfortunately heavily in the middle hour of the movie some are irritated by the patriotism and complaining where are the british the french the australians etc but hey this was made by americans for americans about americans and thats ok in fact after this and the korean war the usboys might never have been the entirely good ones again in summary without the brillant first battle spr would be only a mediocre war flick 6510,reality
as a diehard steven spielberg fan i find it difficult to give such a tremendously powerful film like anything less than a 10 but there were a couple of things in the film that caused huge problems for me mainly because they could have been avoided so easily for example whose brilliant idea was it to cast a teenage heartthrob like matt damon and yes i realize that he is not a teen himself but he is extremely popular among junior high school girls in the role of a private in a world war ii film tom hanks was perfect but only because he is one of the best actors working right now and he can do a great job in virtually any role furthermore ted danson literally stops the film in its trackshowever despite these superficial problems is a truly timeless film and is an extremely powerful depiction of the brutality of world war ii besides being hugely entertaining a lot can be learned from this film it is a landmark in filmmaking history and should not be missed,reality
this has been one of the most controversial films i have seen in 1998 most people agreed that this has been a great movie but i dont see it that way they left behind a valid motive to save in a war that is unfair there is no point on saving a single man and risking the life of others that are as same as that have the right to leave a war that is not theirs i have to agree that the movie has one of the best realistic scenes ever has impressive shots on dday but there is no valid argument no deep thoughts of what every individual is having like thin red line but is unfair and not appropriate to compare both of them somehow they forget about that everyone is important and not just one special guy this becomes a selfish way of thinking,reality
with all of hollywood at his disposal spielberg has no excuse for his own mediocrity as a film maker  this simulation fails for the same reason that it is possible  viewers leave the theaters believing that they understand war what it was like to be there and that they have seen a realistic portrait of war  makes war comfortable and knowable even in its supposed gritty action  if anything spielbergs method suggests a realistic portrayal of what it was like to fantasize about the war while remaining on the homefront thus in his footage of the landing scene spielberg consciously imitates newsreel footage which was viewed back home rather than as it was seen on the beaches  it is a style of film making which believes that the truth is in the details but the end result is a lifeless mannequin with no soul or inner truth  is much like the photographic snapshot which however more realistic never conveys the deeper meaning and realism of a painting  although perhaps a deserving pat on the back for a generation which faced something truly awful in the end i believe speilberg has done veterans a disservice by flattering millions into believing they understand what it was like to be there or how else could so many nonveterans talk of the realism,reality
der soldat james german title has in my eyes one of the most realistic openings in the history of movies in this genre it shows that human beings are nothing more than beasts when it comes to war but the plot of the rest of the film is nothing but absolute nonsense thats where the dramatic part takes in i simply dont believe that such a story really could have happened,reality

features one of the most corrupt moral structures in the history of film over the last quarter century only one movie also radically overrated is even more pernicious forrest gump what do we make of the fact that tom hanks is the protagonist in boththat imdb members rate it so highly reflects poorly on the judgment of the population of serious film viewers given the extraordinary array of wonderful films made over the last centurythe film has one sensational feature the opening sequence that is enough to make the film memorable but it does not make it good platoon also has a terrifying jungle version of a battle sequence if not so extensive but that is integrated into a much better moviethe first and essential problem the plot is completely fallacious which is worse than being simply made up the allied venture in wwii was far too serious an enterprise for a whole platoon to be sent out on an improbable indeed fools errand across country to save one person while risking them all in an nonessential enterprise particularly when modern communications obviated the necessity for any such an actionsecond though it follows standard practice in representing the american population with a mix of backgrounds for the platoon other than the sainted captain miller played by hanks only one person is identified as having an educated point of view though his role back home is apparently clerical namely corporal upham the translator and he is painted from the beginning as the cowardthis fact is made abundantly clear during the utterly unnecessary indeed unwise assault on the machine gun installation which puts the lie to the value of their venture when they ignore it to engage in an action that could undo it altogether upham seized with fear cowers behind as his buddies take the nest he joins them in time for the debate over the fate of the surviving german pictured as a nasty customer he invokes abstract moral principle arguing that the german should not be summarily shot germans being murdered in cold blood are actually shown in the background in scenes of the mopup just after the beaches have been secured and thus they decide to let him go since they cannot take him with themjump to the final series of sequences private is found the good captain miller is shot and killed by whom by the nasty german soldier they let go earlier thats who about this time that miserable wretch upham is further demonstrating his utter lack of character by cringing on the staircase of a building while a fight to the death is being going on between another of his buddies and another evil german who kills the gi with his knife after an agonizing struggle soon he has visually abased himself further by cowering in a ditch moments later he is confronted by the evil german who has killed miller and another german soldier they have been taken prisoner at least as i remember it the moment the german recognizes him upham shoots him point blank as if to silence a truth and commit the murder he had forestalled near the beginning of the story we are left to make sense of that but no interpretation could be a positive onethe only real lesson of the movie rules  morality more generally  do not apply to war if someone is in the way take care of him kill or be killed if you dont you will pay the good side is good regardless of what it does also in this stupid plot regardless of how senseless it isfinally is the surest realization of the achilles heel that has dogged spielberg all of his career his impulse to the maudlin or safe accept that here he is dishonest the moment the plot kicks in and continues to be right to the end he would have been a truly great director but for this fault which tainted such memorable films as schindlers list and the endings of minority report and ai,reality
note contains spoiler this is the most overrated movie ever it is not the worst just most overrated movie ever the ending was especially stupid and bad even spielberg can do bad i guess lived his whole life afraid of not being worthy of being saved and even at the end he was not sure he had lived a life worthy what a guilt trip with no relief he livedto watch a good wwii movie watch the scarlett and the black starring christopher plummer and gregory peck,reality
steven spielberg never fails to create incredible war moviestv shows this is no exception the casting cinematography soundtrack screenplay all incredible although the story itself is a work a fiction the emotions and scenes of war are very real ive seen this movie so many times its one of my all time favourites to be honest you should watch the movie if only for giovanni ribisis role what an amazing actor every line he spoke every second he was on screen was emotional and captivating the same could be said for the rest of the cast though a real story of brotherhood and love in a time of terror a tragedy that deserves to never be forgotten you wont be disappointed,reality
this is a throwback to old war movies make no mistake we have an identifiable group of men eight of them who go on a mission this one is to risk their lives to save one man its based upon the story of the sullivans a group of brothers who all died and the department of defense decided it was time to act so that not all of a family would perish in war the sullivans served together on the same ship the indianaplois and perished of course if they had lived they probably would have just moved to the east coast had their own ship go hunting for a giant shark and made fun of college kids then get eaten by a shark any way so these eight soldiers look for private the last of his family and are to make him return home along the way they suffer casualties there isnt a lot of new material here a lot has been made of the gore but even the old films had gore to equal or outdo this old world war two films didnt hesitate to have men lose their legs when tanks would run over and amputate them or to be horribly disfigured so there is nothing new the action comes in bits and pieces until a big fight in the end some of it looks a little too contrived to be honest as though the director was aiming at some conclusion with all the little conclusions coming first true to old time movies minor characters die first and also true to old time movies men from new york and cigarette smokers get a free pass and cannot be killed so you know some who will survive just a little too trite and hollywood to be recommended but not a bad movie,reality
i personally think this film is not as good as its hyped up to me yes it might be realistic but as a film ive seen better with deeper meanings and understandings i hear people say this is the best war film ever made in comparison to films such as apocalypse now full metal jacket paths of glory even platoon there is no contest in my opinion this film is about the soldiers and what they had to put up with which any person will feel for however the films i have mentioned above have more depth and discuss more important issues with greater subtleties in some cases and take into account the grand scheme of things comparing this film with full metal jacket also is an example of the difference between a hollywood director like spielberg who directed et indiana jones jaws and kubrick who directed a clockwork orange 2001 and dr strangelove dont get me wrong i loved indiana jones et and jaws but when i compare these films with the kubrick ones i see a major differencewith the exception of shindlers list however good these films are they are simple stories whereas kubrick tackled bigger issues is not a simple story but it asks for sympathy and rightly so but that is all it does for me what i would like to say is that the opening battle scenes are remarkable i am someone who believes in being only one or two if that really good films a year i did not think this was one of them,reality
a great disappointment this film did nothing but rub our collective nose in the violence and cruelty of war  this we already know thank you spielberg  older and more sophisticated films used to contextualise war giving us an insight into more important and valuable realities  friendship and loyalty for instancea great opportunity to explore the richness and complexity of war by one of our most entertaining and clever film directors has been sadly lost,reality
im a big fan of spielberg generally but this film was garbage as some other reviewers have said the war sequence at the start was very powerful and well filmed but the rest of the film was nonsense the story beyond the opening was particularly weak the characters were largely clichd and not particularly interesting the soldiers seemingly took turns at pointless hollywood monologues in a blatant to give the film more selfimportance than the script was failing to deliver alonenot impressed at all and the ending was not too bad but not incredibly satisfying either,reality
the movie opens with an elderly man and his family visiting the allied cemetery in normandy france he approaches the grave of captain miller and becomes very emotional we do not know who this elderly man is he then looks out toward the sea and then begins the flashback of the dday invasion the next 29 minutes or so is a superb factual brutal and graphic account of the american landing on beach code named omaha the loss of life on bloody omaha was enormous and unimaginable after the break through we see a soldier collecting some soil in a metal container here is where the first mistake occurs we see that this soldier has other containers with soil samples as well on one of the containers the word italy is written well my friends there is no way that this soldier could have been in italy and then called upon to take part in the normandy invasionat the end of the movie we learn that the elderly man is none other than private here comes the other big mistake in the story private was parachuted behind enemy lines he was not part of the seaborne dday invasion how could he possibly envision the invasion when he was not there at all any flashback involves the person being physically present in any given situationwell there you have it my friends as much as i love steven spielberg and tom hanks an awful blunder was made right from the beginning private was not there and therefore he couldnt possibly have visualized what happened there,reality
now im doing something forbidden im comparing this movie with the other antiwar movie released same year the thin red line although its two movies which are so much different because theyre hardly in the same genre i happened to see the thin red line first in the theatre which was a tremendeous experience to me after that i saw and i thought it was a huge step down from the terrence mallick masterpiece about guadalcanal which im afraid was released the worst time possible i definitely believe that the succes of spr has something to do with the oscar winning director steven spielberg whos a certain winner every time but i look at spr as a way too classical movie with the classic white vs black scenario not much more than an easily digestive action film which has great effects and great action but nothing that gets to me like the thin red line did it sorry spielberg,reality
steven spielbergs 1998 exercise in oscarmongering is a compilation of effects and impressions from all the war movies hes ever seen decked out with precise instructions about what to think in robert rodats script and how to feel in john williamss hokey music theres something here for everybodywar is hell sam fuller war is father figures oliver stone war is absurd david lean stanley kubrick war is necessary john ford war is surreal francis coppola war is exciting robert aldrich war is upsetting all of the preceding and lewis milestone war is uplifting dittoand nothing that suggests an independent vision unless you count seeing more limbs blown off than usual the visceral opening sequence showing omaha beach on june 6 1944 or someone getting graphically shot underwater the story is about a squad trying to find and send home a private whose three older brothers have already been killed in world war ii its a mission ordered by general george c marshall backed by the authority of abraham lincoln whos backed in turn by spielberg and executed by tom hanks a captain named john instead of joe it has a few pretty good action moments including a climax straight out of the indiana jones trilogy a lot of spilled guts a few moments of drama that dont seem phony or hollow some fairly strained period ambiance and a bit of sentimental morphing that reminds me of forrest gump it also lasts the better part of three hours with tom sizemore matt damon edward burns jeremy davies vin diesel adam goldberg and barry pepper,reality
i just saw and i can say that it was a very good and realistic movie but i didnt feel iti was shocked from the violent scenes ok and the directing was marvelous from spielberg and all technical details were excellent but it hadnt emotioni believe titanic was much much better my opinion thanx,reality
at first i didnt know what to expect from this film but at the end of it i was overwhelmed beyond any wordsfirst of all the movie is just beautiful yet terrifying the first 25 minutes were absolutely amazing and we all felt like we were sucked into the movie and found ourselves fighting alongside the soldiers it was the most realistic and graphic portrayal of war till date the whole film is filled with action and it keeps us all on the edge of our seats the sound mixing and the picture itself is amazingthe acting was just brilliant the crew is just amazing every actor plays his role almost flawlessly and tom hanks was the icing on the cake i must say that this is his one of his most phenomenal roles ever the direction was once again outstanding spielberg really went out of this world in this movie the way he took the movie is just breathtaking the final fight in ramelle might have been dry if not for spielbergs directionsynopsis an elderly man and his family visit the normandy american cemetery and memorial the man walks around the cemetery and upon seeing a particular grave he falls to his kneeswe are then thrown into omaha beach on june 6 1944 along side american soldiers who are to fight the germans led by capt john hmiller they suffer heavily from their struggle against german infantry machine gun nests and artillery fire they eventually win the battle but not after losing many men after the battle the body of a dead soldier lying face down on the beach with the name s on the back of his pack is shownthen we are taken to washington dc where general george marshall is informed that three of the four brothers of the family were kia and that their mother is to receive all three telegrams on the same day he learns that the fourth son pfc james francis is a paratrooper and is mia somewhere in normandy marshall after reading abraham lincolns bixby letter orders that must be found and sent home immediatelythree days after dday miller receives orders to find and bring him back from the front he assembles six men from his company a paratrooper in millers squad dies after being shot by a snipereventually they locate a private james but soon learn that he is not their man they find a member ofs regiment who informs them that his drop zone was at vierville and that his ands companies had the same rally point once they reach it miller meets a friend ofs who reveals that is defending a strategically important bridge over the merderet river in the fictional town of ramelle on the way to ramelle miller decides to neutralise a german machine gun position despite the misgivings of his men a medic from millers squad dies miller at a cartographers urging declines to execute a surviving german nicknamed steamboat willie and sets him free on condition that he give himself up as a prisoner of war to the first allied unit he encounters a paratrooper declares his intention to desert the squad and the mission prompting a confrontation with his sergeant the argument heats up until miller defuses the situation by disclosing his background in civilian life about which the squad had earlier set up a betting pool the paratrooper then reluctantly decides to stayupon arrival at ramelle miller and the squad come upon a small group of paratroopers one of whom is is told of his brothers deaths the mission to bring him home and that two men had been lost in the quest to find him he is distressed at the loss of his brothers but does not consider it fair to go home asking miller to tell his mother that he intends to stay with the only brothers he has left miller decides to take command and defend the bridge with what little manpower and resources are available using his own men and the accompanying paratroopers miller forms ambush positions throughout the ruined townthe enemy arrives although miller and his squad inflict heavy casualties on the germans most of the paratroopers are killed while attempting to blow the bridge miller is shot and mortally wounded by steamboat willie who has rejoined the germans just before a tiger tank reaches the bridge an american p51 mustang flies overhead and destroys the tank followed by american armoured units which rout the remaining germans the cartographer surprises a group of german soldiers as they attempt to retreat steamboat willie raises his hands in surrender believing that the cartographer will accept because of their earlier encounter having witnessed captain miller being shot by steamboat willie the cartographer shoots him and lets the other surviving germans flee miller dies due to the woundsit is revealed that the man in the normandy memorial is and the grave he is standing at is millers the elderly asks his wife to confirm that he has led a good life and worthy of the sacrifice of miller and the others his wife confirms it then stands at attention and delivers a salute toward millers gravenote i have heavily borrowed some parts of the plot from various other sourcesand finally there are a few flaws in this movie however i will point out the major one this movie was purely an american one one must know that the allied soldiers also consisted of the british and russian soldiers however the movie ignores them completelythis is the best war movie till date and its a mustwatch for movie buffs,reality
it is hard to show the past especially if someone wasnt there to see it no matter how many books are made and stories are told you will never get the accurate story now a days kids will go to see their grandpa who has stories to tell them about world war 2 these stories are properly exaggerated and never tell the true story accomplishes in 30 minutes what grandpa couldnt tell in his entire life it is a film that shows what the war was actually like and shows film viewers the true dday thats not the only thing good about the film it manages to keep its plot as interesting as anything else i watch and with its extremely well developed characters make this one of the best films i have ever seen saving private takes place during world war 2 around the dday invasion obviously we start off meeting captain miller as he commands his squad as they are about the storm the front lines during the dday invasion in the most realistic depiction of this event ever to be written or filmed the first 30 minutes is pretty much exactly what happened during the invasion and is the best part about the film as you could see the film is called so you are wondering who is private after the invasion captain miller and his squad are ordered to go off and find a private and bring him home after that the squad is left to each other each actor flushes out their character to the point that you can understand everything they are feeling although the film is lead by the big names like tom hanks edward burns and tom sizemore less known actors like adam goldberg and barry pepper find their moments in a film full of greats the dialogue is also a huge part of the really helps with flushing out all of the characters emotions i was afraid that the dialogue would just be cheesy and have stuff like people just screaming grenade and get down but there is so much more that makes everyone in the squad feels like a family matt damon who plays private is not in the film for that long but is so well developed especially in his conversations with tom hanks that i thought he was in the film for the whole time the score by the way is as superb as i thought it would be it really drives home how depressing everything wasalthough the dialogue acting plot and score are all very well suited for a world war 2 film the sound and editing are different beasts entirely every time there is a gunshot or a tank fire off you feel it like you were standing next to it during the time that it happened i have never heard a more realistic war world 2 film ever the sound is a huge part of this film and does a lot to make this movie feel like a world war 2 movie another thing that succeeded in was cinematography if there was a movie that i would think was the blueprint of great cinematography this is it it has everything that makes a movie great amazing shots great editing and fantastic screenplay i could talk more about the film but the 11 oscar nominations including for set decoration and makeup make this film what some call a masterpieceall in all is the type of film that inspires young filmmakers like me to dream big and believe that anything possible i have never been so driven to make and study films and although it seems like i am just praising an overrated world war 2 movie i am actually praising one of the great masterpieces of film and giving it justice since it didnt win best motion picture fuck shakespeare in love overall if want to witness master cinematography direction acting editing and especially sound then this should be the first movie you watch,reality
there is not much to say about this movie except its awesome and one of a kind it has good beginning and even better ending and not to mention emotional ending because the beginning starts little bit confusing but when you reach the end then i dont think that there is a person that didnt have at least little bit of tearing in his eyes if you hadnt watch the movie i strongly recommend to watch it because youll not regret it especially if you love actionwardrama,reality
it is quite rare that a movie comes along that has the ability to connect to its audiences on such a human level for even the most advanced film fanatics the moviewatching experience is usually tethered to the moment you watch the movie either like it or dont and then it slowly fades away as life intercedes in the case of though steven spielberg changed an entires nations attitudes and actions towards a single historical event ww2for a basic plot summary this film drops viewers quite literally into dday with a prolonged battle scene that depicts the assault on normandy after the company led by captain miller tom hanks comes out on the other side they are given a special mission from upper management a mother back in the us has just been informed that three of her sons were killed in action a fourth private james matt damon is still active in the fight millers goal get out of the war and back to his mother is all this effort worth it for one man will anyone make it out of the war alive those are the questions that and his men grapple with on the road to findwhen premiered in the summer of 1998 many veterans were so moved by the opening dday sequence that they had to leave the theater and compose themselves it was that much of an emotional experience for them yet spielberg treats it with such respect that it never seems like emotional sabotage or anything like that it was just the first time that audiences had ever been treated to such a graphic truetoform visage of battle no disrespect to any of the war flicks that preceded it but didnt pull any puncheslike i said this is a movie that changed perceptions after viewing this visceral film many children and grandchildren of ww2 vets began asking their parentsgrandparents about the war experience while an uncomfortable topic to be sure it was a dialogue that needed to be opened in order to better understand the members of the greatest generation for so many years ww2 vets had lived in silence so to speak about their war experiences only relating to their war companions as they were the only people who could relate what spielberg did though was bring the topic to the forefront of conscious allowing ww2 vets an avenue for relating their experiences to the current cultureif i were to start a list of the most important movies ever made from a cultural standpoint would perhaps top that list not only does it have great actionplotcharacters from a filmmaking standpoint but it is an experience that can stick with a person forever and change lives,reality
if you need an action filled movie based off of something that really did happen in history is your best bet actors such as tom hanks and matt damon are casted in the movie tom hanks playing captain miller and matt damon playing private even though the story may not be based on a totally true story its battle scenes action make it seem real in the steven spielberg movie shows scenes from dday that no other movie can compare toits opening scene with dday is gruesome disturbing but awesome it gives the audience an idea of what the battle was actually like spielbergs ability to bring us from different locations in the battle was amazing we started off with the men on top of the boats then we see the men struggling to get up the beach people dying everywhere we see the explosions of bombs and the sounds of machine guns tearing up the beach when all seemed lost and impossible they make their way up the beach leaving most of their dead comrades on the beach captain miller played by tom hanks takes control and leads his men up the beach blood dyes the ocean the opening scene of dday on the beach costed 12 million dollars shot on the beach of ireland this scene proved to be a hook in the beginning of the movie in addition to this vivid opening scene there are also many small battles that reenact the battle scenes that took place in open fields and in the rubble of the street of germany the constant action keeps us thrilled wondering what happens next the feeling of a sniper waiting to pull the trigger leaves all of us viewers at the edge of our seat often waiting cringing if he is going to shoot we can also feel the internal struggles and pain that the soldiers are facing some examples are losing a comrade or deciding whether to advance or not knowing that enemies lay ahead their personal value is questioned later on when 12 men are ordered to save one soldier who is supposed to be withdrawn from war the plot and the action is so vivid and realisticthe movie was said to be extremely realistic rumor had it the department of veteran affairs had to set up a hot line for veterans with post dramatic stress because the movie reminded them of the traumatic experience they went throughso if you want a movie with great scenes spielbergs is for you even if you dont like action it is based on a partially true story with realistic scenes from world war ii can get emotional and will make you realize how sad it is for the veterans this movie surfaces the struggles that the veterans in world war ii had to face and what it takes to overcome a dark time in history,reality

despite me giving this movie a 1010which i totally think it deserves by the way and it being in my opinion one of the best war movies in recent times if not of all time i couldnt take tom hanks that seriously i mean his acting was great one of his best movies he has ever acted in i couldnt take him seriously because he is the voice of woody from toy story i kept picturing woody in the situations tom hanks were talking through which slightly annoyed me this is more of a nitpick as a person who has only seen all 3 toy story movies before but i couldnt let that ruin the whole movie and i appreciated its very indulging yet graphic scenes and it really gave me an idea of what it was really like to be in wwii and what it was like to be a survivor of this immensely devastating war,reality
so this movie is only 250 out of 250 once again i have to wake myself up and realize that tastes are subjective and very very dated i can come to terms with that reality but i just dont understand why some really useless garbage gets rated higher than this flick is this a prowar movie well yes if you are an idiot are there historical flaws in this production really you are upset about that i guess you dont know where the library is now i know that there are many of my fellow reviewers who just dont give out tensor even nineslike me i am a ratings trampi admit it i hand out tens and nines like candy why because i can and if you still see yourself as some kind of movie snob good work just dont tell mei can only laugh so many times in a day also try not to stick your silly little pinky out in my presence i might just snap it off at the knuckle phew no worriesi am over it all kidding aside i will admit with regret i guess i am not one for smothering myself in selflove justbecauseicansit and watch a stupid movie and then voice an opinion a turnip can do thatomg and not being a turnip or any other kind of vegetable i have made myself my own perfect segway to voice my view first this movie is just a movie  not history second although vaguely based on fact is a product of hollyweirdland starring hollyweirdos directed by a hollyweirdo note to reader these folks often discard history and spin stories to their liking increasing boxoffice cashflow three one of the best movies made and this is from a whiner now it just so happens the person directing this movie seven spielberg is probably one of the best out there i like most of his stuff and some i do notbut anything he doesit is always top quality the camera work and acting are all pretty spectacular as well the most talked about part of the movie is the harrowing display of carnage experienced by those just before hitting the beach to think of the courage it took for a person to step around and over the mangled bodies of friends you were just talking to and at the same time dodge ricocheting bullets accurate or not fear and dread is brilliantly captured on film to think of what each of these men were thinking anticipating the worst and still they carried on that is unquestioned bravery and then i see a review questioning the absence of british accents really and they mark the movie down for that ok to each his own but i suggest you open a book son and see where the brits landed and where the us landed in normandy better yet take a trip to new orleans and visit the world war two national museum in new orleans there you can talk to some actual survivorsnot actors if you wish getting your history first hand make the trip these people are getting old and please remember we were trying to win a war  a pretty serious one at that there was no time for tinkledances of spineless multiculturalism ok i am recovered this movie is oneofakind i think what mr spielberg did is a great thing saving also has a cast that is beyond reproach i really like tom hanks the guy is an oscar magnet if a producer is craving success put mr hanks in a scene full of blowup dolls  nomination for sure i guess matt damon tom sizemore ted danson and vin diesel are included in the castbut who are they i kid this is by far one of the best movies i have seen i have watched movies once and through they were stupendous but never bothered to watch them again  this one  i can watch many times over,reality
is an absolutely brutal portrayal of the second world war it is hardhitting unrelenting but extremely powerful right from the start it grabs the viewer by the throat the first half hour of the film is a chaotic confusing portrayal of the dday landings which i think is an accurate representation of what the landings must have been like you wouldnt have known who was shooting at your or what was going on it would have been hell on earthi also loved the camaraderie and loyalty that these soldiers showed towards each other it is obvious that these men would fight to the death to protect themselves and their friendsread my full review here httpgooglrs2itz,reality
i dont believe why did not get a oscar as a best movie in 1998 instead shakespeare in love got the oscar for best movie is one of the greatest movie of all time  but shakespeare in love is a waste of time to movie just look at the imdb rating of its 86  and the dumb shakespeare in loves rating is only 72  i gave it 3  although shakespeare in love deserve only one oscar  as the best actress in a leading role gwyneth paltrow  there is a very ridiculous moment in the movie when the queen judi dench was in the theater to watch the act no one notice the queen in the theater i mean how did the queen enter the theater without being notice by any one  she is the queen thats totally ridiculous and a dumb act of the movie  thats all,reality
throughout film history theres been a constant fascination with war as new documentaries on the two great world wars appear every year so do films on similar events from all quiet on the western front 1930 to the recently released fury 2014 hollywoods interest in depicting war shows no signs of slowing down spielbergs 1998 epic fits in a long line of war epics attempting to depict the horrors of war in a realistic manner spr does this exceptionally wellfor the duration of roughly 20 minutesthe film starts with an old man visiting the normandy american cemetery and memorial with his family he stops at a specific gravestone and collapses in tears the camera focuses on his eyes and the film flashes back to dday with a depiction of the omaha beach landing that has to be seen to be believed this prolonged sequence is the films and spielbergs crowning achievement after the allied forces break through the film cuts back to events on american soil at the war department of the united states it becomes apparent that three of four sons of the family have been killed the mother is about to receive this tragic news in the form of three letters being sent simultaneously a general has this brought to his attention and  remembering how abraham lincoln offered his heartfelt condolences to a mother in similar circumstances  orders his officers to find the remaining son matt damon whos somewhere in normandy and bring him home enter captain miller tom hanks who having just survived the beach landing is given the mission gathers a small group of soldiers and  with some reservations about the importance of the mission when juxtaposed with the big picture  they all head further into normandy in search of a single soldierthe extensive omaha beach sequence is the single reason why anyones still talking about this film the amount of planning required for this scene must have been incredible and yet the entire scene still feels unplanned and appropriately chaotic it wouldnt be a stretch to name this sequence the reason the films been showered with academy awards other aspects like acting and especially the cinematography and production design are also praiseworthy but thats pretty much where it ends for mei find the rest of the film to be something of a mixed bag it chronicles miller and cos search for private and all the hardships they endure along the way the main problem i have with the rest of the film is that it feels contrived the omaha beach sequence is at once the films saving grace and the reason the rest of the film pales by comparison not that the rest of the film has nothing to offer dramatically it does but it all feels too calculated too contrived and convenient as opposed to the radical and chaotic opening scene for instance you expect the soldiers to bond over the course of their journey before some of them die and how this is all supposed to elicit our sympathy you see this coming long before it happens and its thus not as impactful as it should be and what about the ohso dramatic pause right before the sniper in the tower is shot by a tanks cannon designed so that we can symbolically say goodbye millers clichd reference to his wife gardening with his gloves all thats missing are the images of whitepicket fencess twominute monologue  supposed to elicit our sympathy  which comes across as incredibly awkward the fact that miller is shot by the same german whom he showed mercy to several scenes ago and that its the bookish upham of all people who earns his stripes by conveniently killing him old saluting millers grave while trumpets hum patriotically in the background the fact that the filmmakers did the ohso for lack of a better word american thing by bookending the film with shots of the american flag softly lit by the afternoon sun etc etc all these scenes and more reveal a script purposefully crafted to the point of dramatic perfectionand thats not a compliment why does the omaha beach sequence still amaze after all these years because it represents the horrors of war in purely visual terms there is no dramatic logic only chaos bodies and limbs flying everywhere soldiers whimpering and screaming there are no allied soldiers and nazis just people trying to survive the rest of the film with all its carefully calculated drama doesnt come within a country mile of effectively conveying the same sense of horror,reality
you may be thinking oh damn just another over patriotic american being wellpatriotic but no thats not why im hereconcerning over patriotismif youre not from america then yes i see where youre coming from if you say the movie is too american well it is an american war movie so expect patriotism as i go through the list of reviews for this movie almost all of the reviews from people who say theyre from the us boast about how great they think the movie is on the other hand people from other countries mainly european boast that its too american for example the movie starts with the waving american flag and ends with it it also only shows american soldiers totally excluding british and canadian soldiers well the story is about american soldiers looking for well an american soldier so you can expect to see mainly us army menand yes i do also understand manly other allied countries played important roles in wwii of course the us could not have fought this war alone at the same time you should allow the movie to be patriotic sorry if europeans are offended but i have to say it if it werent for the united states europe would have had a much different fate so in a sense you could say that america saved europe so please let it be patriotic the us gave a lot for this war even in a continent it wasnt in europe wasnt even where a majority of american soldiers fought and died it was the pacific against japanconcerning the movie itselfwell now that ive got that done i may as well talk about the movie quality itself let me just tell you i thought it was great the first moments on dday at omaha beach were gritty realistic and tensethe rest of the movie wasnt as great just soldiers looking forthe ending i thought was good and very emotional 810,reality
i have to laugh at all the cool kids who hate on this movie because of their issues with spielberg or their need to instantly dislike anything successful i read through the various 1 star reviews and i have to laugh at the inaccuracies in the reviews as they try to point out inaccuracies or clich in the movie i know it is hip and cool to think you are a film snob and all of that but lets get a few things straightone reviewer mentioned the omaha beach scene was unrealistic because at the rate the characters were getting killed the 1st and 29 divisions would have been wiped out and unable to continue the war well first of all the entire 1st and 29th didnt participate in the first wave the 16 regimental combat team of the 1st and the 116th rct of the 29th did and they were both combat ineffective after the first 10 minutes of the landingother complaints mention the entire landing was depicted in 20 minutes when it took several hours to break out from the beach um it is a movie you know not a realtime depictionthe movie only shows americans because americans were the only soldiers landing at omaha beach the british and canadians were miles away i never understand this criticism the movie is an american movie about an american unit that landed on a beach assigned to americans sorry we cant include every other nation in the allies this movie isnt about that as far as i know americans made up the 2nd rangers and 101st airborneto those that complain the germans were portrayed as bumbling idiots the germans made a lot of mistakes in normandy they failed to commit their armored reserves in time they staffed the atlantic wall with inexperienced conscripts that were either older or younger than they should have been hitler wasnt even made aware of the invasion right away even after the breakout the germans were still convinced the real invasion would be a calaisanother reviewer complained that the american army would have simply contacteds unit and ordered the co to send him home that would have been impossible for weeks as the airborne were scattered all over normandy with no real communication with each other much less an organized chain of command mixed units roaming the countryside was the norm for several days after the landingothers complain that a squadsized group could wander around occupied france without being discovered how is that implausible remember the airborne were misdropped all over the region small squads moving around undetected was the normradar wasnt a secret in wwiithe p51 did provide close airsupport even though calling it a tank buster is a stretch the p47 is more fitting for that role but hey they dont look as cool its a movie after all but to the reviewer below that says p51s were never used for ground support  you are completely wronga lot of people claim the movie demonizes the germans i am not sure i see that the germans fight hard for their country i dont see where in this film they do anything remotely evil they kill the americans when they get the chance wasnt that their job werent they defending their country it doesnt even really mention nazis at all can someone please point out how the movie shows the germans as evil the movie is from an american perspective of course the american soldiers are going to think the germans are evili also have to laugh at the people who say the dialog wasnt real because people didnt curse then right soldiers in wwii didnt say the f word um okpick on the dialog all you want but seriously most of you are reaching at straws the movie is about as realistic as you can get and still remain a movie,reality
easily one of the best movies of the last 100 years hand down this classic contains the best opening 1020 minutes you will ever see in movie history the ending of this movie is fairly intense as well right through out this movie there are graphic war violence on a scale not ever seen in movies and probably not ever again in history for this i praise mr spielberg for bring to life what it may have been like for the solders of ww2 this movie with out a doubt should not be watched by children or people who can not stand blood or graphic violence but still should be seen by everyone at one stage of there life or another this must be watched by everybody,reality

according to many people steven spielbergs is one of the best war films ever made they are absolutely correct this film won several oscars and it deserved themis a perfect example of a film that accurately captures the horrors of warthe film opens with an impressive recreation of the battle on omaha beach the scene wastes no time in showing us just how horrifying and chaotic the battle really wasthe rest of the plot focuses on the search for private james francis matt damon a young paratrooper who landed somewhere behind enemy lines he has three brothers who were all killed in action and the military decides he should get sent home captain john h miller tom hanks is chosen to lead the search for the young private the film is simply brilliant the actings excellentthe story is well written and it manages to brilliantly depict how horrifying and tragic war can be,reality
after discovering that three of his brothers have been killed in battle the war department orders a group of soldiers to save private and send him home to his mother this act creates a fair amount of conflict and from there the story really picks upsteven spielberg while a fine director often becomes sentimental and smarmy this is no exception but for the most part the battles are fierce the wounds are bloody and the death toll is high considered by many to be the greatest of all war films it easily ranks up there in my bookwhat i loved most about this film the casting of nathan fillion and jeremy davies oh my i can never get enough of those two gentlemen beyond that the realism and the brutality shines through i appreciate that the americans executed surrendering germans and on one occasion czechs rather than took them prisoner is it right no but its realistic,reality
there is probably an exciting 90minute movie lurking inside this never ending war epic about the search for a soldier however in an attempt to make a war movie to end all war movies spielberg did not leave anything on the cutting room floor releasing the film with a running time of 17 hours or so the muchadmired battle scene depicting the normandy landing is well done but whats the point of having it go on for 20 minutes with gratuitous shots of severed limbs and guts literally spilling out ok war is hell but many other films have made this point far more eloquently and succinctly the acting is pretty good although the characters are all war movie stereotypes,reality
is everything you expect it to be and more i left the cinema totally numb after this experience not knowing how i really felt about the movie all i was thinking was why do we really need a another movie about the atrocities of war perhaps i just dont want to know the truth or see the reality of this horror that mankind seems determined to continually perpetuate the heart of man is evil continually even more frightening than this is the fact that the powers of the world who have set their minds to war and murder to maintain control would not even think twice after viewing this filmfor spielberg this film was evidently a lot more than just a revelation of world war ii this was a message from son to father a call for approval from a boy to his dad the fact that arnold spielberg was overcome with emotion may indicate that his boy did good this time steven is as masterfully in control of this film as he was with schindlers list i still feel the earlier film is his dramatic best yet it is difficult to fault private in its execution it is only its concept that i am still battling withtom hanks plays yet another all american this time the captain who is ordered to take a small band of men to find his performance was strong yet i was not truly blown away as i expected to be perhaps i have come to expect too much of the great mr hanks the support cast are also intense and include giovanni ribisi vin diesel adam goldberg and barry pepper special mention goes to tom sizemore as sargeant horvath jeremy davies as the timid corporal upham and matt damon credible as the last of the brothers ted danson and dennis farina drop in as senior officersspielberg has again teamed with schindlers cinematographer janusz kaminski and the results are astounding the opening sequence is particularly breathtaking john williams is of course the only choice for original score in this impacting picture i barely noticed his composition that probably indicates how good it was art direction and set decoration are both awesomethe enormity of the film cannot be denied neither i suppose can its importance with all my reservations it is one of the first  if not the first  movies not to gloss over world war ii it is for this reason i must recommend all those who can handle it go and see it and it is also why i find it so hard to mark this film downsunday december 13 1998  bairnsdale cinemasthere are two ways to look at technicallly and philosophically let me address both brieflytechnically the film has few faults certainly cinematography sound effects and sets are all astounding you cannot be anything but blown away by the opening sequence spielberg shows again he is a master craftsman able to bring any vision from within his imagination to the silver screen he takes this simple story of an unusual rescue mission in the middle of world war ii and turns it into an unforgettable movie experience tom hanks is amazing as captain miller playing with perfect understatement the weary commanding officer who must lead his band of eight men in search of private in impressive support is tom sizemore fantastic as the tough sarge who backs miller all the way an excellent support cast back these two compellinglyphilosophically i have argued before that this film was brilliant yet unnecessary that we have seen enough graphic antiwar films and that this was one too many on second viewing it is very hard to keep this argument up even if we have seen a dozen films such as this is still a very important film why it shows us the horror that war is the waste the destruction and the total futility of the whole thing why do we keep destroying each other like this what is wrong with us i still argue that schindlers list was a more important film and perhaps a better one this film rates right up there thoughsaturday january 8 2000  video,reality
with its cast  story  visual effects  production and direction is an excellent experience to watch the film starts in present united states than enters in its main plot of 1944 france at the occasion of dday here tom hanks along with his juniors including tom sizemore edward burns berry pepper  vin diesel  and giovnanni ribsi are assigned to a task seek out pfc james francis and relieve him off the duty to send him home the reason here is that he is only surviving son of widow who already lost her older sons in this war as a gesture of humanity and sympathy  chief of army staff general georgecmarshall himself ordered the search and transfer of private back to homeland when tom hanks and his fellow comrades begin their search for their objective they had to go through hell on some places  in it they lost some of their own few men the most compelling scene was the death of giovanni ribsi  the way he acted in that scene was so much disturbing but also showed his remarkable skill to portray the dying man after a hectic long tense journey into the heart of france they spotted pfc played here by matt damon told him the gruesome news of his bros death but he refuses to leave  he believes that his fellow officers are also sons of other people they are also his brothers in arms why he is only one to be left out of here then the team decided to stay but inside capt miller tom hanks had made a pledge not to let pfcdamon to be harmed and left alone in harms way being a war movie lover i am very impressed by this film if you are  you ll also be moved  its 3 hr long but very very good in the making and contains a strong plot one of the best war movie of all time perhaps that s why it finished with 5 oscars although thin red line was also competing against it with a huge inventory of cast  crew,reality
is easily the best war movie that i have ever seen and believe me i have seen a lot while it is very good i will say one thing it is very bloody i really dont think you should should show it to your kids but if you are an adult then this is a mustsee it is pure awesome and in my opinion better than platoon or even apocalypse now everything about this movie is pretty much perfect it has action drama and really good acting and directing this was way better than shakespeare in love and should have won best picture and best actingplease for your own sake go see it1010,reality
surely this movie presents some of the most believable most graphic and most gruesome scenes of war ever shown on film the opening depiction of the storming of omaha beach on dday and the closing battle as american soldiers desperately try to hold a strategically key bridge against a german attack are brilliantly and soberingly portrayed and if there was nothing else in this movie worth watching those battle scenes in and of themselves are a powerful lesson about the horrors of warthe battle scenes serve as an envelope around the main story  the search for private james as the movie begins we learn thats three brothers have all been killed in battle and hes the only one of his mothers sons left gen george marshall quoting from an eloquent letter written by abraham lincoln to a mother who lost 5 sons in the civil war orders found so that he could be returned home before being killed himself and a squad under capt mitchell tom hanks is assigned to the task believability is a bit of an issue here i doubt that in the middle of a great war soldiers would be taken away from battle and assigned to this task having said that the very lack of believability gives the search for its meaning and serves as the movies moral or philosophical purpose the constant question before the viewer is how many lives are we willing to sacrifice to save one theres no answer to that question but it remains front and centre as even the soldiers assigned to find increasingly resent the assignment and question its value the constant challenge i found myself faced with was how i would have felt if i were assigned to find a soldier in such circumstances so that he could be sent home while i stayed to fight a war  and possibly die thoughtprovokingstill i didnt think this reached the heights of greatness that some have given it thoughtprovoking it may have been but between the great battle scenes there were also long stretches with little happening and overall the movie was too long at more than an hour and a half its a movie thats certainly worth watching  but only once i wouldnt want to see it again 710,reality
from the opening notes of john williams somber and tearjerking music score followed by an old man wandering sadly through a world war ii cemetery and then to the deservedly infamous twentyminute recreation of the invasion of normandy on dday and straight through to the end of the picture its adamantly clear that steven spielbergs epic masterpiece is not just another war film on the shelves in the history of cinema coupled with oliver stones platoon this is perhaps the single greatest cinematic take on the nature of war ever madebased on a true story stars tom hanks as a world war ii squad captain who is given the treacherous assignment to take seven other soldiers and go behind enemy lines in search of a missing paratrooper named whose brothers have been killed in action and as noble as a mission as that sounds the reaction from the soldiers is exactly what it would be in real life well obey our orders but is one man worth risking the lives of eight thats the spirit of and thats the spirit of war itself gone are the days where war was portrayed as like some kind of an endofseason tournament and when soldiers were portrayed as being like a rowdy and pretentious baseball team on their great skirmish instead of glamorizing violence and giving us allamerican heroes depicts war as what it is a harrowing traumatizing unforgettably bad soulcorrupting experience the effect war and violence has on people is personified perfectly in a line given by hanks about halfway through the film for every man i kill the farther away from home i feel the movie opens up with a twentyminute battle sequence of which the likes have never been on the screen we dont just see people being shot to death we see explosions that send mutilated bodies flinging through the air we see soldiers lying on the ground mortally wounded spending their last breaths crying for their mothers and wanting to go home and the atlantic shoreline becomes red with blood there is nothing glamorous or exciting about a scene like this rather the reaction the audience gives is hung jaws wide eyes and a new appreciation for what our soldiers did in the call of duty and how lucky any of them were to live to see home againanother strength of the movie is that it does not only depict war as being horrifying but it also makes neither heroes out of its protagonists or personifications of evil out of the enemy as i mentioned earlier the soldiers led by tom hanks are not cheerful jokethrowing boys they are cynical rundown exhausted and pessimistic who spend a great deal of their time not charging out into enemy fire and dying in the blaze of glory but cowering behind rubble and thats the exact same of the german soldiers portrayed in the film after all they were drafted into a war as well if it were not for the war these men killing each other may have otherwise been best friends in a way the movie is not about the mission to rescue private who is neither seen nor heard until well into the movies running time but about the very experience of trying to survive just one day through a waris not only a technical triumph but an intellectual one as well apart from showing us what war is really like and the effect it really has one people and nations the movie creates threedimensional human beings out of its characters the story is very wellconstructed the dialogue by screenwriter robert rodat is firstclass and the acting of course topnotch the combination of these elements gives us a representation of war that we can believe now when people think of war they think of men lying on the ground dying and not grinning heroes dodging bullets as if life or death is merely a video game and they can try again if they fail the first timethis is one of steven spielbergs very best films it ranks up with films such as jaws schindlers list close encounters of the third kind and et the extra terrestrial as some of the greatest and most important films ever made now may be too gritty and vulgar for the tastes of some people but i think it should be required viewing for anybody going into the service or even thinking of the like because war is not a baseball game and its not something anybody wants to experience more than once if at all,reality
i have never understood hollywoods love affair with tom hanks hes no more than ordinary both in appearance and as an actor perhaps thats what they like the stamp of the common man well for me hes a turnoff him costner and cage i cant help taking points away when any of em show upall that said this movie opens pretty quickly into the most spellbindingly visceral battle sequence ever shown on film it really is a tourdeforce the withering german machinegun fire wiping out man after man before theyve even set foot ashore is terrible and shocking to behold truly those weapons made flesh all but obsolete in battle i am not a spielberg fan either his delight in maudlin sentimentality  or schamltz as its called  knows no boundaries neither does his childish irony but when it comes to large setpiece special effects he has no master the few minutes of beach landing are alone worth the price of the dvd its as close as you can get to the real thing and still leave the cinema alive im told that a group of vets got to see this movie at a private showing and gave this sequence a standing ovation you cant say fairer than thatafterwards the story moves on with hanks and his remaining squad looking to find private who is the only surviving son in a family stricken by war and here mr spielberg falls into his usual routine of hokey irony theres a suddenly collapsing wall that reveals germans on the other side theres a german humanely allowed by hanks to simply wander free only to reemerge as his assassin theres a case of mistaken identity thats milked for every silly little nuance imaginable and theres a lot more like i said its often childishthere are other interesting and engaging conflicts though they pale in comparison with that fullon intro there are excellent setpieces authentic gunfire and believable slaughter editing lighting and all of the other technical issues are right up to the standard you expect from big stevie yet most of the second 2 hours fail to answer that hellishly vivid beach landing its a measure of how strong the one is and how weak the other we are left with a slow flagging and largely forgettable odysseyhighly recommended for that opening assault thats where my 9 stars have gone the rest is simply in at the price with spielbergs juvenility and hankss irritating voice for good measurei would like to see a movie about ww1 treated with the same ruthless candour the casualties of omaha and the somme scarcely withstand comparison,reality
never in my life have i ever seen a more beautifully written film ive watched this film 20 times over and it still touches my heart i always look for violence in a movie because i believe it shows reality and this movie does just that with its gut wrenching brutality i tell people who havent seen that they need to watch it asap not just because of the violence im not like that but by the completely accurate point of view of the soldiers during and even after the wari am one of those people that is impossible to make cry and folks this movie made me bawl my eyes out the ending tom hanks scene is so stunning and heartwrenchingly sad that i couldnt bear it yet i still watched the ending that scene is also surprising considering that the beginning threw me of guard with the old man in the opening scene i thought he was tom hanks sorry for the spoilers also giovanni ribisi must be credited for his characters emotional role especially in the church seen when he talks about his mothernow to the violence people i was 13 when i saw this film do your self a favor if you are a parent if your child is under 13 do not let them watch it there are even worse violent movies such as the thing but the difference in this movie is that what happens to the soldiers more than likely really happened to them mostly the beginning on omaha beach i personally think the violence was completely necessary because we needed to show what our soldiers fought for and what they gave in order for us to live on as the ruling country of the world godbless america and its menthe language in the film is quite foul but hey what would you be saying if you were being shot at by 20cals i also think the swears were necessary why well i believe that swears bring out emotion and how you feel about situations you are in i mean dont get me wrong if your child swears by all means put soap in his mouth or whatever you do but in movies swears give us an understanding about the standpoint of the characters its also pretty funny to boot the jokes in this are hilariousanyway if you are looking for the greatest movie ever made watch this because i dont think ill ever find a movie close to being as good as this thanks to spielberg tom hanks and thanks mostly to those who gave their lives to keep us standing strong with the freedom we have rightfully earned you will not be forgotten ever,reality

simply put this is a flawless war movie spielberg created a set that looks like the actual french battlefield of world war ii the beginning of the movie shows the allied invasion of normandy beach on dday and it is very hard to watch men die and are reduced to gory heaps in the first seconds of battle people who are expecting a chuck norris war movie with a few us soldiers killing hundreds of comical nazis are going to be surprised the film has a fantastic ensemble cast  up there with films such as heat and tombstone all supporting actors are given believable characters no one appears to utter a oneliner and is never seen again movie buffs will find themselves saying hey i know that guy but it never detracts from the immersion this is a heavily proamerican film it makes little effort to characterize the german soldiers but none is needed overall this is my favorite film from 1998 and one of my favorite war movies,reality
visually this film was brilliant especially the first scenes on dday it was probably the most graphic and visually impressive war movie ive seen but a great war movie isnt made by how good or in a way not so good it looks the acting in this film was pretty mediocre and i was only interested when people were shooting each other the script was terrible with cheesy characters and back stories that really wasnt very interesting the plot was poor as well it may have been based on a true mission in world war 2 but it wasnt as good as it couldve been if they had just simply based it on a famous battle in normandy this couldve of been a brilliant film but it fell on some very important hurdles,reality
is an inspirational film filled with dyanamic battlescenes drama and action during the opening scene into the storyline there is a fantastic 20minute depiction of one bloodiest battles of wwii fought at omaha beach not only is it gruesome in its depiction of the thoughts of these soldiers who fought during this war but it also has an subplot filled with the notion of brotherhood tom hanks performance was phenomenal as well as the rest of the cast which includes such notable names as edward burns tom seizmore etc their performances work simultenously to make you believe in this mission saving one man the storyline is simple captain john miller tom hanks has been assigned a mission from the general george c marshall the missions objective finding private james francis from iowa whose 3 other brothers have been kia killed in action conflict private is somewhere in normandy where no one exactly knows like captain miller says its like finding a needle in a stack of needles yet as they embark on this mission they are met with some obstacles along the way losing men as they go many start to question the value of their mission and if saving one man is worth the lives of many others it comes to a culminating end one that might leave you with a tear or two if you love war movies drama or like the period itself i highly recommend you go out and watch this movie,reality
is a movie that is truly epic in scale and stars a huge array of big names some of whom became even bigger after the film eg vin diesel the film opens with the harrowing dday landings following captain miller and his men the unit is given the mission of finding and getting private james out of the war his 3 brothers have all been killed and it has been decided that 3 or 4 sons is enough sacrifice for one mother to make a lot of the depth of the movie comes with the relationships between miller and those around him there are some truly light hearted moments such as the pool that is running to find out what miller did before the war however a lot is very deep and touches on some issues that other movies seem to gloss over one is a conversation in which miller mentions that over 90 men have died under his command and the way in which he copes with that personally the movie does not glorify war but shows it in its hideous randomness and brutality though there a more violent films out there such as we were soldiers widescreen edition definitely does not gloss over anything this is a profoundly moving movie and one that i have seen more than once every viewing is moving it is simply a great story wellacted welldirected and engrossing,reality
in every aspect of this film from the writing by robert rodat to the production of every scene there is mastery has multiple wwii scenes that although not all historically correct all outstanding i watched this movie with my fianc and we both were extremely impressed with the whole movie the opening 27 min omaha beach scene proved well awarded the best opening scene as well as the whole movie with the 5 oscars 50 something other awards won and another 50 something nominations for various awards the story line of a mission to save a fellow comrade is one that hits so close to home for many families these days and it really gives them hope that if there loved one is still over in iraq they might too be saved from the actors like tom hanks and sexy matt damon to the small details in every scene or big like the 40000 gallons of fake blood for the opening scene it was just a mind blowing movie that really makes you appreciate everyone fighting for our freedom,reality
steven spielberg goes back to wwii with this film which is about a group of soldiers who risk their lives in action to save one private james francis the scenery in the invasion sequences are so horrific that its shocking to think that this stuff actually happens which it does i couldnt watch it without flinching crying and being afraid of things like thati pray that there wont be a wwiii because all war is hell i dont even support the war in iraq i want our troops out of there they dont deserve to have their insides blown out regardless of what the war is about its also why i dont play war video games i dont think that war is a thing to be glorified in games i think that its a horrible thing that should have never existedso to finish i would like to thank steven spielberg for opening my eyes to war and how war should not be glorified it should be looked down upon,reality
my grandpa actually landed on normandy and told me all about it he landed on fox red sector he told me the true face of war until i literally saw it flash before my eyes the opening dday scene is horrific but detailed in a great manner of graphic violence and gore unless you are not one of them as i can who can handle such strong intensity this movie is not for you it is a great movie and shows that there is nothing that should be glorified about war shows how 8 men will risk their lives for 1 after private jamess brothers peter sean and daniel have been killed in action and captain john h miller from the 2nd rangers battalion and his squad is sent to find james and send him home before he is kia along with the rest of his brothers i give it a 10 out of 10 for a great story line and it even loosely is based on the true story of the niland brothers it has won over 5 academy awards and on over 150 10 best lists this movie is great for a wwii movie collection,reality
this is by far best wwii movie i have ever seen and in general on of the best movies it is thrilling emotional funny and shows all the folly and tragedy of war within the first 5 minutes of the movie there are scenes of intense realistic combat this movie is truly a work of art everything about it is real the bloodshed the style of guns the talkthe gore absolutely everything except for the storyline which i wont go into everything about this movie is 100 realistic and accurate not once in the movie did i say to myself that wouldnt happen in real life the action scenes are incredible youll see classic wwii weapons being used like the bar m1 garand classic bayonets etc the violence is so real and that often you will wonder whether or not the actors are actually dead this movie shows all forms of combat guns flamethrowers sniping tanks planes and of course several sequences of up close and personalbloodythe scenery may very well be the best in annyyy movie ive seen not just war movies while watching i was shocked to think how much time was devoted to this crumbling buildings destroyed tanks dead cows cratered land everything every step of the movie you will be thinking that they went back in time to those areas because it will be so hard to believe that most of it was filmed in a studiothis movie won a deserving oscar for cinematography and for good reason i can only surmise how many cameras were used in making this film because of professional cinematography the action doubles everything is done so well explosions are shown from several angles at such a fast pace that youll once again think that this must actually be happeningthe acting is great in this movie most of the soldiers act like typical grunts who enjoy seeing a german killed while show true sympathy and sorrow ifwhen any of their comrades die or during a breakdown when all the fighting gets to themto cut this review short because there are about a dozen other topics to touch upon this incredible movie this is a true classic great drama terrific directing and keeps you involved and not bored during this 2hour and 35 minute movie,reality
to see a masterpiece likes this lets me know that there really are great movies out there not just a movie thats spat out millions of dollars wasted on a movie that has no purposethis movie has a great purpose war is hell it should be prevented not just that but many more that can be seen throughout watching this thrilling movie if only i got to see it with surround sound and hd i watched it at home on my bad television but i want to let everybody know the special effects in this movie surpass many movies from present day sound is top notch acting is brilliant the camaraderie seen between the men makes it seem like a real battle field everything about this movie is so real its as if you were on the battlefield yourself this movie is not like any other war movie where the story starts off with the troop at home then getting deployed then mindless scenes of battle followed by a predictable finishthis movie started powerful to the deployment of the troops on omaha beach all the way to the end this movie had great action internal conflicts a plot to find private a story going on back in the united states everything connects in this great piece this movie is just breathtaking i keep repeating it but when the movie was over i was sad it was over and i would definitely see it ten more times to witness the sheer brilliance of steven spielberg and everybody else who contributed to this movie,reality
awesome awesome awesome the greatest movie i have ever seen the scene when cptmiller was shot i thought seriously that the rest of the americans were doomed but then reinforcements arrived like out of nowhere but when my favorite guy the american sniper pvtdaniel jackson was killed in the church tower i was stunned because he was extremely good and the americans really needed his help and that since he was so good i thought he was going to survive through the whole movie through all and all the movie was really good well planned good acting and one of the greatest movie visual effects and graphics i have ever seen for all you people that liked it good choice but for all you people that didnt like it welltry to make a better choice warningthis movie is not for weak stomachs,reality
is not just the best war film ever put to movie screens it is also one of the best movies of all time the movie begins with an almost documentary type invasion of normandy on dday this is so realistic and so well done you would almost think spielberg and company had a time machine and filmed it the day it happen the action is so intense and so amazing you would think the movie would falter after this but then again it doesnt this movie real story is about captain john miller leading a platoon of men to go save private he must save private because he is the only remaining son of a woman stateside this seems ironic because all these men must risk their lives for one mothers only living son and as the squad is led through some dangerous turf they dont know how much they will have to eventually risk to save one man a wonderful told epic that just shows how much one life can really be worth,reality
i guess with the age of video games and virtual reality upon us it was only a matter of time for someone to capture the most realistic war scenes that have ever been depicted in film the landing and ground fighting shown in the normandy invasion literally makes the viewer feel like they were transported in time and are actually experiencing the real thing tom hanks is brilliant as a shellshocked veteran who is asked to perform a special service that is to go through enemy territory and bring back the last surviving son of the clan his other brothers having all recently perished in combat leaving him the only remaining sonthe movie grips you from the start and there are some well scripted scenes with a lot of surprises in hanks search for the last you go through the movie hoping that hanks will find him soon and be able to leave the hell of war before his nerves are totally shotwhat made this movie even more dramatic is that it is based on a true story one of my favorite alltime war movies,reality
in terms of verisimilitude to an actual battlefield is without a peer in the history of film i go back to the 1910s birth of a nation which had some panoramic battle scenes and to platoon which had some credible scenes to full metal jacket apocalypse now which is the closest challenger for realism black hawk down the big parade wonderfully realistic early silent film of ww one and many others none of those takes so much effort and genius in recreating a probable past in terms of recreating the war torn battlefieldsvillages in the most minute detail the first 20 minutes of this film are a landmark by which all other war films will eventually be measuredtom hanks is the emotional anchor for this film giving us a portrayal that is sensitive yet firm hes not of the blood and guts john wayne tradition his character is a thoughtful man who finds himself in a position to in his view do some good in the world by managing this apocalypse on earth in such a way that it actually saves livesspielbergs consistent attention to visual detail and style is what sets spr apart the images are grainy and rely on blues greens grays and browns with scarcely any red or yellow he creates battlefield scenery with precision accuracy and depth of field wonderful workmeanwhile set against this is a dialogue which can be passively entertaining at times the urgent conversations in the battlefield are most effective however some of the more heavy conversations which take place during the lulls are so poorly thought out i can scarcely believe any professional screenwriter could have been associated with them this is a recurrent problemfinally i guess it couldnt be avoided that a film like this would attempt to advance allied propaganda genreally the film tries to stay away from that and i give it credit but at other times the propaganda asserts itself in a subtle way which detracts from the overall effect most americans and western europeans are numb to this but i notice it and it disappoints me although i will reckon that this film does not lose itself in propaganda its just an overtone,reality
has been out for damn near seven years and i just saw it for the first time yesterday and i must say it is pretty damn great the combat scenes are the best i have seen in any world war ii movie especially the amazing opening scene on the beaches of normandy they are full of exciting and grisly action and speed along the threehour runtime is also packed with a great cast who all give excellent performances especially tom sizemore edward burns and jeremy davies heck even vin diesel was good yes i said vin diesel maybe he just gets bad scripts latelythe only things keeping this from being the best war movie ever is its sappy storyline and onesidedness nobody is saying the nazis are saints but their foot soldiers were there for the exact same reasons the american foot soldiers were their stupid leaders sent them thereis still one of the best war movies of all time its explosive action and great acting keeps it interesting throughout its runtime and it proves that steven spielberg can make a darn entertaining flick 810,reality
i still remember seeing this movie for the first time the opening scene where the allies land on the beach really grasped my attention it also scared me just seeing that scene will show anyone what sort of sacrifices all sorts of people made and why war really should be the last resort the action sequences are unlike any other war movies that i have seen and the only thing i have seen that is similar is taegukgi this movie is highly recommended for anyoneexcept for young children this is one of those movies that you will remember for your whole life and will be able to view it many times with out ever getting bored in the process,reality
when first came out i saw it in the movie theater 3 times this movie has an excellent cast and it is a great movie to watch it was directed so well and the cast of the film is just amazing if you are big into wwii every scene makes you feel like you are right there with them i hope all who watch it love it because it is an incredible film i would totally recommend this movie to someone please watch it even just once because i know that you will probably like it if you are into war movies even if you arent into war movies this is still a great movie to see because it lets you see what people are willing to do for their country and their own people,reality
i still dont understand today why this film got such excellent reviewswas one of the worst war films i have ever seen in my life this film had no proper storyline and plot as it was a load of hollywood hype that tried to come across as deep and dramatic but in actual fact was shallow and disappointing what was the point of all those soldiers dying in combat only to findsave one soldier and that when they found him he didnt want to come back home with them yes this film had its dramatic scenes like at the beginning of the film when old private was crying at his friends gravestone but even the way that scene was portrayed i found it was corny and melodramatic overall this film completely draggedon as it had bad editing a pathetic dialogue and had a terrible conclusion,reality
after the first nineteen minutes and the scene where hanks tells them he was a teacher this movie is awful hanks himself is good but the rest of the cast doesnt come off too well but that could have to do with the horrendous script edward burns however cannot act unless smary is a good character choice in every one of his movies i wish people would stop deluding themselves into thinking this is a great movie but i suppose if millions can tell themselves that the passion of the christ was great instead of the sadistic nonsense that it was then there is little hope for this trite tripe to get the proper four star rating it deserves,reality
until i saw private i thought the best film about world war ii was john ford and robert montgomerys they were expendable now i can say that private is to the european war what expendable was to the pacific war they both convey a common message that sometimes war must be fought that we not shrink from what needs to be done that we never forget the sacrifice and most importantly that we make ourselves worthy of that sacrificeworld war ii wasnt just something that happened it was armageddon in which the future of the world was at stake and thats no exaggeration those who died in the endeavor gave us the right outcome are to me true martyrs not to religion or patriotism but to humanity itself i think this is what both expendable and private are reminding us by dramatizing the message not preaching itdespite the advances in filmmaking technology that make a more intense experience than they were expendable both are magnificent films which compliment each other both have been given splendid dvd transfers and it is fascinating to watch them backtoback to compare how similar events are portrayed in the idioms of two different eras spielberg has the advantage of being in an era without the constraints both technical and political suffered by ford unlike ford spielberg is free to add and lest we forget  to bring home the meaning of sacrifice  heres an unvarnished look at what really happened to those who didnt come back,reality
since i spent three years of my life doing military service during the vietnam period im not going to excuse myself for criticizing for being cheap mystification in the pursuit of easy money 1pulling cash from the pockets of persons from generation of the war nearing the end of their lives in a world they dont identify with very easily and a long way away from their early memories or 2 doping the younger generations with the illusion that one can passively flip around in time and space or onto the normandy beaches like a minor god by way of images and popcorn for under 10  but wheres the beef it feels good dont read any further if thats what comes to mindthe generations born after 1945 need to start thinking themselves past world war ii into the world where they actually live and stop trying to zap through virtual reality with  magic to a sweet past of handsome heroes who woo virgins at sodashop counters  the film the longest day was the war generation imagining what they had lived for better or for worse but there was actual experience linked to what was put up in the images ironically enough the screen heroes people like ronald reagan  did their war in hollywood where the only real danger was perhaps falling off a bar stool  the war generation itself however was capable of a more critical look at their own times for example norman mailers the naked and the dead or joseph hellers catch 22 or leon uriss battle cry or irwin shaws the young lions to name some of the most widely read and seen material  in comparison is a big step backward because it feeds completely upon a too apparent manichaean conflict between the forces of good and the forces of evil for a mostly postwar born audience whos closest contact with the war was in an army surplus store or in family stories second or third hand  in short doesnt make the world around us any clearer it feeds on our worst fears and illusions  it would be helpful to know what experience of war say during the vietnam war period steven spielberg depended upon to empathize with a soldier facing actual battlei admit that as a soldier i didnt face real battle myself but i did go through some very tough military training and i had a near fatal accident working as professional deepsea diver  thinking of people i know who did face battle from my fathers generation including my father and of people i knew who fought in vietnam i think it is only respectful to say that its simply not possible to imagine your way into what a soldier goes through in battle as regards the raw fear at the threat to ones survival or the controlled madness one feels toward an enemy  most soldiers i know who fought have told me that going into battle they experienced themselves as another personality who listens to nothing else sees nothing else except what could matter for survival  they were surprised to find such a self inside their own skinsprimitive brain memories we confront when our survival is in question are short lived happily enough and well trained soldiers are taught when and when not to allow themselves to slip into this instinctive set of gears which are the ones we normally learn to repress in order to live in society some men are haunted for the rest of their lives with horrible dreams or memories they never manage to put behind them  most war tried soldiers return to civilian life and reintegrate society without apparent difficulties but what is most striking about such men i find including my father is that they usually refuse to talk about themselves in actual battle situations and i think its because they have made a deal with themselves for their own mental health to keep to themselves experiences that are so subjective and buried in their nerves that they cannot be transmitted in words to anyone who has not experienced a similar heart of darkness  likewise real soldiers in battle know too that should they die it will very probably be alone and hours before anyone even notices and that there will be no long camera shots zooming in over the violin music to pick up their immortal last gasping wordsto viewers who marveled at the omaha beach landing scenes at the beginning of the film theyve been robbed if they really think they can get up that sandy ramp in a padded seat in a darkened movie theater   to get some realism into the experience people would need to stay awake for three or four days in a rolling ship smelling fear and vomit have their minds wiped clear about how the story ends experience the awful smell of black powder mixed with perspiration have no idea where theyre really going or whats awaiting them and last but not least experience what hellish noise bombs and shells and machine guns really make as cold seawater runs into their boots  there are certainly some important films yet to make about world war ii for us who were born after films about a postwar world thats not a pure catastrophe for example but just isnt one of them  however mr spielberg may have some very deep personal experience with soldiering we need to hear more about  im all ears,reality
there must be a certain element a certain unspoken magic when a particular film gets heaped with such a volume of praise and emotion from its teary eyed and awestruck audiences has over the years been one of those films the peculiar thing is that it doesnt deserve much praise or much of an investment of emotionyes the famous omaha beach sequence is impressive limbs are blown off and men hold in their innards while crying for their mothers etc guess what kiddies has war ever suggested to be otherwise is this one scene enough to pass off the rest of the 2 and a half hours of the film the answer is no just because one scene is technically brilliant does not mean that somehow the entire film has justifiably earned the right to be called one of the greatest war films of all time but again and again whenever i hear this film being discussed the only scene that comes up is the first 25 minute invasion sequencethe rest of this film was personally to me a total wasted opportunity for one thing how was it possible for hanks and his 1950s ww2 cliched troupe to casually stroll through a french field this early into dday  the bocage areas around france were still full of threatening german units long from being reduced makes no sensethe biggest failure of this film was predictably its childish portrayal of german troops again and again i cringed at how pathetically inept they acted that last battle scene was something straight out of a sgt rock comic wave after wave of germans just run into fire not taking defensive positions until about 23 of them are lying dead in the normandy sun somehow hanks and his buddies always seemingly dance their way out of oncoming bullets the machine gunner in the tiger was seemingly to high on hashish to fire at the americans there is also no way in hell a sticky bomb would take the treads off of a tiger and why the hell did all the german troops have shaved heads not from the photos ive seenbut i did love the moral message of the film and perhaps this is why the american public who loved this film so willingly gave spielberg their hearts it doesnt matter that this film consisted of a script so simplistic that it could have been written by a high school sophomore working on a ww2 final essay makes no difference the message we all wanna hear is america is good everyone else is bad we dont do bad things noooo sirry we only get into wars to stop tyranny well there are some of us who would contest thatpeace,reality
there is no doubt that spielberg is a superb director of actors and action the opening section of this film left me breathless and disturbed the scene with the collapsing wall and the german soldiers with the ensuing mexican stand off is nail biting similarly the final battle sequence is deftly choreographed some fine character scenes linger in the mind as when the soldiers listen to edith piaf while waiting for the germans however if this is war as hellabsurdconfusing it is also war as boys own adventure where are the politics historical context are we really expected to believe that in a huge theatre of war a group of soldiers would be allowed to wander around in search of one man compare to the thin red line you want to consider what malick might have to say about war with his use of rich images that linger in the mind long after the end of the film with spielberg i was left largely with the memory of the opening and closing scenes,reality
i must admit the first twenty minutes discounting the first scene in the cemetary were mindblowing  the handheld visuals gave a sense of realism and was true honest filmaking spielberg should have stopped there after the normandy scene we are introduced to the characters that will guide the audience on its long trip to nowhere  i hesitate to call them characters as they are cardboard cutouts designed to fool the audience into believing there was any depth to them  they didnt fool me  they are a bunch of stereotypes thrown together in a group and sent on a quest unfortunately robert rodat lacked the storytelling skills to make the film anything more than a failure with astounding visualsit seemed as though he threw random scenes together and decided to call it a script ive heard this film be referred to interestingly enough as both a prowar film and an antiwar film  the reason there is such confusion is because neither robert rodat nor steven spielberg could make up their minds  the first twenty minutes seem to say one thing where as the last twenty say another  in between everything is just drivel because of the conflict in ideas and for numerous other reasons the film lacked focus  it had no sense of itself and was not wellrealized at all it was put in all directions and no directions at onceapart from being a failure was also an insult to my intelligence  it was so sugarcoated it made me sick  a movie like this should go down hard and leave a bitter taste in your mouth afterwards however spielberg for some reason felt the need to apologize for the films graphic depictments of battle with an ending that tried to hard to explain itself  spielberg may as well have run up in front of the screen at the end of the movie and said in case you didnt understand the other twoandahalf hours of this film allow to me to explain what just happened,reality
i must say that this movie is highly overrated by the critics the story is as same as for example dday and various other usa patriotic movies okay the movie is realistic and strong but what about the story shouldnt it be better i can say that im not moved a bit sorry next,reality
the first half hour of this movie blew me away  i couldnt comprehend how a movie could put so much realismit wasnt until the conflict of that i became a little disappointed because at this point we move out of europe to a little town called tinstletownthe problem i have with this movie is that people accept this movie as a documentation  is this a true war story  i think its more of a true patriotic idealistic propaganda  so heres the lay out hundred and thousands of men go to war to save their country this part is good  yet out of a midst of war would the government really save a soldier for the spite of the mother  3 of her sons die but its supposed to be ok because they laid their lives down for their country at least this is supposed to be the theme of the movie  so whats wrong with the forth son hes doing the same  it contradicts the theme  secondly what about every other soldier they all have mothers families  pregnant wives too  it just doesnt happen that way  thirdly one woman wouldnt recognize that 3 brothers died out of thousands of deaths shes writing up and she wouldnt ask a man to save the 4th son with him executing it  welcome to hollywoodthe movie as a movie is good  it is excellent  but its nothing more or nothing truer than what actually did happen to these soldiers in war  ive noticed many people ive discussed this movie to take this movie so literally that it makes me agitated  sometimes the only way we like to deal with war is to believe some of the things we see that it was good to save by killing the enemy that war means so much patriotism  but this is just one aspect it isnt the embodiment of war  there are too many other things that war has to tell  oliver stone made a trilogy based on 3 different sidesaspects about wari know some men who fought in war  they watched the movie shocked by the first half hour they were literally sweating  the next moment they were thinking and remembering their time in war  they all thought the storyline was a bit dreamy  and the response i got was this i dont recall anyone who was like tom hanks  we were all matt damons who didnt know between right from wrongi mean at the end of the movie when old private goes was it worth it the camera starts showing his loving wife his children and grand children by the way    what was up with the big chested triplets and of course the audience is going to be all teary eyed yes it was worth it  come on 10 other individuals could have been alive if it werent for him but i forgot we need patriotism in these movies id suggest anyone to read books on war by people whove been there like tim obrien because those books actually make you thinkas a hollywood movie i give this movie 910 but as a true war movie i give this 610 the first half hour 1010,reality
sorry but i dont like being manipulated and constantly being told what to feel and spielberg always does this in his serious films  he should stick to lighthearted adventure stories at which he is very goodthe opening and closing cemetery scenes were heavyhanded  the subject matter doesnt need flagwaving steven we get the point without you rubbing our faces in itthe opening battle scene is very well done except its voyeuristic and even pornographic  i saw the reaction of the kids in the front row and they were getting off on the blood and gore just like in a video game  i think malicks filming of the battle scenes in the thin red line was much more effective  it puts you in the midst of the grass fire smoke concussive explosions and total chaos and is quite unnerving  shouldve gotten the best cinematography oscari cringed at hanks line earn this  again spielberg seems to think we cant get such insights on our own without them being crammed down our throats  its insulting  to have hanks speak that line implies an insult to damons character toothe linetell me i was a good man is just awful scriptwriting groanlets see how can i put this without giving away the plot and therefore having this review banned  okay i thought it was really sophomoric to have the german pow that x a main american character who shall remain unnamed turned loose be the one to kill x in the end  the odds against such a turn of events actually happening were quite overwhelming  to put that in the script was an in your face attempt at irony right out of a bad film school projecti was mostly disappointed with what could have been a fine film if the director had not done what he always does  practice overkill and leave nothing to the imagination underestimating his audience and propagandizingi also think its offensive to make a good yanks bad krauts film  my uncles who fought against the german army knew better  this war contrary to those who want to rewrite history to make it pretty was about property not saving the jews nor stopping fascism except when fascism threatened other peoples property  nazism was tolerated and even approved of in britain france and the u s before hitler invaded france and britain and the u s turned away jewish refugees from hitlerism even after the start of the war  the americans didnt enter the war to stop hitler they made huge profits from it till 1941 and only entered it when the japanese made it impossible for them to stay out of it  this films ideology pretends otherwisemalicks film is much more accurate and therefore much less popular based faithfully on the novel by james jones who fought in guadalcanal it doesnt use war as a way to make people feel good it tells the truth about war and those who fight in it not disparagingly but realistically  i care about its characters because they are believable not caricatures like those in private  the thin red line is all the more uplifting because of its realism and more enduringfor those by the way who keep writing that we who prefer the thin red line are pseudointellectual i think they really mean that they themselves are antiintellectual a popular stance in the u s these daysfrom a friend in canada where unlike most of you in the states we take ourselves and our mythologies with a healthy grain of salt,reality
the only thing worth watching here is the first 45 minutes or so  after that it gets boring and unoriginal  as with schindlers list we dont need spielberg to tell us about what happened in wwii  we all know already and as for it making war seem realistic i dont think spielberg deserves any extra attention because of it  it should be every film makers job to make their movie as realistic as possible,reality
this movie is such typical hollywood crapola and tom hanks and matt damon are unbearable the opening sequence is excellent giving the viewer a real sense of what wwii and normandydday must have been like tom sizemore is also outstanding and of course the cinematography is beautifulbut this movie really cheapens the concept of war and heroism imohaving personally walked the beaches of normandy and having a father whom is a wwii veteran i can say that this film is a glorified and poorly told fiction of what these boys really experienced thin red line is far more watchable despite nick noltes presence for a wwii pictorial dont bother with this one,reality
spielbergs ww2 epic has often been hailed as the greatest war movie ever made but unfortunately an awful script hampered the brilliant performances superb direction and the most realistic battle scenes ever filmed a scripted was riddled with clichs and american jingoism from the start that completely marred the film and did not move me at all it was also the most blatant attempt at oscar begging in the history of cinema so much so that it would have been far subtler for the entire cast and crew to spend the entire running time on their knees and plead with the academy to give them the awards hanks i dont know anything about speech had best actor nomination clip written all over it damons im trying to picture my brothers talk was his bid to make up for last years disappointment for good will hunting the jerky photography which was little more than a strain on the eyes wrapped up best cinematography oscar the fact that the film lost out on the big night to shakespeare in love itself ludicrously over awarded gave speilberg his comeuppance the characters to were stereotyped and cardboard and spoke utterly contrived dialogue theres always a religious one jew an italian and a new yorker a tough sergeant and a rookie even hanks who really should think of going back to comedy films played himself as the nice paternal figure the film also gave out the message that the americans won the war there was not a single other allied soldier in the film not a problem on its own as omaha was an all american landing spot but what was unforgivable was that general montgomery was slammed as overrated that was totally uncalled for and completely out of place in the situation spr was merely speilberg exercising his greatest flaw that of recycling the same concept over and over again spr was in the same vain as amistad and schlindlers list that of showing the world the pain and suffering that a particular group of people went through and getting acclaim for it the concept is wearing rather thin now steven,reality
i was one of the millions of people who went to watch the best war film all over the times and as i was expected i disappointed once more from stevenok he is one of the best directors are still alive and a great movie for people who like this kind of films but i were hurt from my steveni loved him he were making my dreams true my older brother grew me up and made me to believe in dreams and try to make them truei am sorry i liked et more than all stevens film i also like indiana jones and all film he were shooting till  90 with a couple of films after it  schindlers list  and jurrasic park  mostly with the first one took back what he had gave mehe make me trust to him my heart and then asked now i want my money and my prizes back  and he forced me to give him a couple of oscars and some billions of dollarsok steven i paid i had thought after jurrasic park but steven answered with the lost world and and moreover starting to sell me yes i feel like being sold watching the soldiers in the middle of the night with a full moon in the sky with such silence around them before twenty years in front of the same full moon a young boy were flying with his bicycle through to his dreams but nowwhat a pity steven when i grow up i saw that my older brother were someone like all the othersand the only thing i am asking from you mr spielberg is to give my dreams back ,reality
i was expecting to see one of the best movies of all time i was quite disappointed the plot was predictable and the characters were stereotyped we know war is hell this movie did nothing to reinforce this image that dozens of other movies havent already done,reality
would someone explain to me why there must be strings welling in the background when any two people engage in conversation wait dont tell me john williams might be hiding in the bushes with a violin are we expected to believe that the government cares about one soldier when did the government ever have a heart despite all of the forced dialogue spielbergs direction is pretty impressive,reality
that so many retaliatory comments have flown along the lines of whats wrong with being patriotic and kiss my red and white striped  it seems perhaps the whole point of war films has been missedtruly great war films transcend such heroic staunch patriotism to deliver the message that war sucks  this film has been praised for its true portrayal of war yet from veterans ive had contact with their sentiments were that war was a nightmare for everyone  that they were all just menboys in hell  despite whom they had sworn any allegiance toand so many young people ive spoken to left this film with the thoughts thank god we were fighting alongside america and that germans were demonized  at the same time people are claiming that this film should be shown to all school children  yet what message does the film send exactly true  the first half hour is a brilliantly harrowing piece of cinema which managed to brutally show the ugliness of war better than any film beforehand  yet i feel a great war film should ignore patriotism and concentrate on how war debases humans of all nationalities and indeed that war transcends these other superficial divisionsa good film  yes the greatest war film  not on my top 5  im inclined to lean towards das boot  truetohistory graphic brutality isnt everything,reality
this is a typical spielberg movie  the basis is formed by a layer of american chauvinism on which lies cheap californian intellectualism and the top is formed by multimillion dollars of special effects  the movie is pretentious and hollow and commercial in the way that it pushes a couple of the buttons of turnofthecentury american obsessions family values fear of the chaos of life and violence  its quite understanding therefore that so many americans regard it as a good movie as it strengthens emotions already there instead of disrupting the mind as any art should in my opinion as a war movie its mediocre  the agony of war is captured much better in films like full metal jacket stalingrad and das boot the sad thing is that it is the nationalism that is promoted in this movie the whole movie is framed by a waving flag that is so often the cause of wars,reality
in lots of movies and documentaries war is being depicted as something glorious as a time and a place where mostly goodlooking young men can prove how brave they are spr would be different so i expected in this movie spielberg really would show his audience that war is horrific not heroicthe first half hour of the movie really was shattering people who still believe war is an exciting event for young wouldbe heroes think tom cruise in top gun should be obligated to watch the omaha beach landingscenes because it really makes you experience that war is hell a sickening horrible hellof course you cant fill a three hour movie solely with scenes like that of the omaha beach landing to make a good movie you need more like good actors a capable crew convincing special effects and the most important an interesting story well no one will dispute the fact that spr technically is a masterpiece the camerawork the special effects the sound they are all overwhelmingly goodin spite of all these plusses i really was disappointed by at least two hours of spr because it missed the most important thing a movie needs an interesting story the characters werent convincing i dont blame the actors for that they all did a good job it was the script that i blame i never forgot i was watching a movie with madeup characters when a movie is really good i tend to get so absorbed by the characters that they become real to me that i start to symphatize deeply with them this never happened while i was watching spr i never felt anything more for captain miller and his men then i felt for all the other anonymous soldiers you see in this movie and the story the search for private even bored me sometimes there were just a few scenes like the one in which the men were reading the nametags of the fallen soldiers that were really compellingthree things about spr i really disliked first there is the way the german soldier known as steamboat willie was portrayed why is the only german we got to know a little bit such an awkward silly guy im pretty sure lots of german soldiers were ordinary men who didnt want this war any more then anyone else did they must have been just as afraid as the american soldiers they must have felt the same pain and horror but thats not the way if feels like in spr the overall feeling you get is americans are good and germans are bad second there is the fight for the bridge this kind of stuff the brave heroes who against all odds succeed in defeating the enemy well this has been done so many times before this kind of cliche was exactly what i expected spr to avoid third there is the point of view you are made to believe that the omaha beachscenes are seen as the memories of the old man on the graveyard then in the last scene you learn that this man never set foot on omaha beach i felt manipulated in a negative wayit was very hard for me to grade spr technically its an absolute 10 the omaha beachscene was extremely good and i think its a real homage to the veterans who were there but there were too many things i did not like i decided to give this movie a 7 out of 10,reality
i think it is absurd that this movie receives such high praise i admit that the 20 min scene of the battle at omaha beach is a technical tour de force however the rest of the movie suffers from mushy appeals to our sense of national pride and does not effectively construct thorough character studies  i believe it pales in comparison to the thin red line a movie which i believe has not received its due respect  i think it is unfortunate for malick that the timing of this movie forces such absurd comparison to saving private,reality
a number of reviewers and people i have spoken to have described this film as the greatest war film ever  it is far from this  whilst i will concede that this film contains some of the most brutal and compelling war scenes i have witnessed in any film it is underpinned by a weak storyline and laughable scriptspielbergs camera direction is stunning and once again proves that he is a master of whiteknuckle tense action sequences but as is all too often the case with his flawed genius he feels the need to drown us in corny unbelievable sentimentthe sheer graphic horror of warfare is captured with thrilling camera work and editing and seemed to send many stomachs churning amongst fellow cinema goers  however inbetween the brutal and gory warfare we were expected to swallow sentiment of a level that upset my stomach far morethe scene where hanks opens up to the troops had me retching uncontrollablyworse still was the nationalistic theme of the film  spielberg had his isnt the usa great hat on and he was wearing it proudin summary this film though touched by genius was too long too sicklysentimental too usa glorifying and on the whole too poorly written to ever be a film worthy of the superlatives that so many have bestowed upon itworth a look though,reality
january 15 1999  stephen spielbergs seems the stuff of greatness  it elevates cinematic realism to new heights is a catalyst for passionate discourse on world war ii emboldens new respect for our veterans and gives spielberg an early lock on all things oscar conversely terrance malicks the thin red line garners equal parts praise equal parts derision and is called the product of an expatriate flowerchild whos clearly lost his mind  four days after seeing malicks film i am haunted not by horrible images of war but something far deeper and beguiling  seeking truth i see again feeling diplomatic and ready to accept each film as two sides of the same coin   is the id flesh machination mission answer and nostalgic history to the thin red lines conscience spirit garden journey question and utopian visionright out the gate spielberg is onto something big when he stages the battle of omaha beach  consider that he arrives on location with only five pages of script for the entire invasion of normandy then gets busy in his sandbox reshooting and finetuning the gore until an immaculate vision of carnage is rendered  mostly thanks to janusz kaminski stripped lenses and newsreel cinematography  reading the us armys technocratic account of dday one is spirited to learn there is a reallife rifle company that lands at dog green amidst slaughter and confusion blows a gap in a minefield fights its way to the top of a bluff and cleans out a machinegun nest  this incursion actually takes several grueling hours not twenty minutes  that this should be surprising is testament to the power of  spielbergs false realismthat spielberg didnt just tell the whole story of dday is a bit of a shame  i suppose he didnt want to remake the longest day 1962 with its hamandcheese heroics  i kind of wish he had  instead he opts for something more sentimental and personal in scope but sadly his vision suffers for it  the very moment tom hanks captain miller looks back at a beach littered with corpses body parts curiously absent the film loses its wellcrafted objectivity that the eviscerating horrors of the battle still weigh on the mind is no excuse for the parade of stock characters inappropriate comic relief and desperate pastiche that followis no ripoff of the thin red line more so an inversion red lines single gripping battle scene is bordered by metaphysical yearning while bookends its uneasy spirituality with two scenes of sensational combat red line features the hypnotic and ferocious presence of a green jungle wheres palate is leached of all color save mud gunmetal and brick red line poses unanswerable queries into the nature of human existence while asks the rhetorical question am i a good manall attempts at anticipating malicks opus would be denied for up to the second of his films release he still worked on it  here is a man who will never play by hollywoods rules  consider that malick spends twenty years in hiding is begged out of retirement by a pair of iconoclastic producers robert michael geisler and john roberdeau spends many more years adapting james jones novel in secrecy fires his producers arrives on location in the wildernesses of australia and the solomon islands with a small army ditches his script shoots 1000000 feet of 70mm film over a sixmonth period  most exclusively in evening and early morning light  cuts the film at eight hours and lastly writes a haunting poetic narration to bind the final threehour cutthose not hypnotized by malicks vision are finding this film infuriating though  a common complaint is that the film lacks a central hero to rally behind but such is the films belief that there exists a collective unconscious shared by all and all men are somehow the same  the physical similarities between privates witt jim cazeviel and bell ben chaplin emphasize this point  both men carry with them memories of a great love be it sensual wife or primal paradise both pass through war never to return to this love  in you hear about a soldiers mental island where one must go in battle to remain sane but in the thin red line you experience this and you mourn its passingin the end the thin red line is about world war ii as much as  is about death the dark senseless way one is mutilated through war  the thin red line is about life light and its fragile presence in all living thingsin conclusion i must address which film and which director will carry home more oscars  the academy faced a similar conundrum in 1978 when considering coming home vs the deer hunter for best picture this was the same year malick made days of heaven then disappeared the war in vietnam long a taboo subject was then recognized in mainstream cinema but who had the supreme vision hal ashby or michael cimino  the question is superfluous for neither film is about the war so much as the disintegration of the american psyche  ultimately the academy chose the deer hunter with its deeply layered character studies over the cloying pc sentimentality of coming home  i am hoping that todays voters are of a similar sensibility therefore i most humbly suggest to the esteemed members of the academy of motion picture arts and sciences for your consideration for best picture the thin red line  not because it is the better representation of war because it is the greater realization of life,reality
smug liberal spielberg toggles back and forth between documentary style violence and sentimental reflections between soldiers the captain is revealed to be an english lit teacher in civilian life who can instruct the novice writer character and others with idealised rhetoric about both the unique contribution each can make to the mission as well as their ability to choose at will a visionmemory of the good life back home worth fighting for this emphasis upon individual freedom detracts from shared debate among the men about both the worthiness of the mission to save one guy and the larger reasons for american involvement in the war this deflates any anti war sentiment in the film significantly is the sole survivor who must alone in the cemetery predictably his accompanying family are as silent as his fallen comrades decidehope he was a good man worthy of their sacrifice in this emotional lynchpin of the movie spielberg suggestively cuts to old glory flapping in the wind the link drawn between liberal pluralismindividual choice and the symbol of america remains an insidious and powerful ideological moment equalled only by the title character in schindlers list who had the power to choose who would live or die consistently in his historical revisionist pieces spielberg suggests this is the only kind of freedom worth fighting for with no awareness of how it merely compounds the tragedy,reality
despite all the hype this is one of the most thinly plotted movies ever made  yeslike everyone else on the planet i agree that the battle scenes wereare extremely well done and truly bring home the horror of war but thats all there is to this movie this movie does not deserve acclaim as a great movie simply because without the battle scenes this movie would not even be average in terms of what we are used to seeing  ask yourself other than the battle scenes is there one scene in this movie worthy of acclaim  you know the answer,reality
aside from an utterly brilliant opening sequence the landing on omaha beach this movie is basically old wine in a new bottlespielberg flirts with the idea of realism yes kiddies war isnt fun after all and the pointlessness of war but at the end weve got the same old small number of outgunned americans save the day with ridiculously obvious tactics theme havent these germans heard of scoutsalso irritating is the fact that spielberg sets us up for the mission to save private to be a ambiguous even pointless affair risking the lives of several men to save one then suddenly loses the courage of his convictions all of a sudden were fighting germans in a strategically important battle how convenient just a dash of catch22 if you pleasespeaking as an australian i suspect that this film might come as more of a revelation to me if i too had been raised to think of war in terms of john wayne and rambo and the rest newsflash for the clueless war wasnt fun even before vietnam,reality
 i cant imagine that anyone who has seen this film will still think  cool guys about some characters like in other war movies eg platoon every human being will realize that war is one of the most awful things on earth but i dont like that mr spielberg wants to manipulate our thoughts the one who kisses his cross before he enters the battle does survive does religion protect oneself the german soldier who is saved by tom hanks  because the american soldiers killed only when they had to   kills him at the end of the film is it that easybest moment of the film the children and grandchildren of the old man the saved look at him with blank looks at the war monument understanding nothing at all of his feelings,reality
yes patriotic tripesands of iwo jima had a similar line about duty and less screen time than devoted to the stars and stripes full metal jacket had more harrowing and intellectually honest depiction of the minds slip into insanity as well as containing many of the models for spielbergs shots in the final shootemup das boot achieved an existentialist dimension all quiet on the western front1930 seared into memory the ignorance and naivete of the scared youth on both sides of the battle lines hearts and minds had realistic footage jurassic park used the distant roar of the approaching enemy betterface it the friend of bill has created a monstrous emotional rollercoaster which is wrapped in moms apple pie and american boys mission to deliver freedom to the world as historys agents  at this juncture in history1998such jingoism bespeaks an america desperately searching for a jusification for its increasingly adventurist amoral selfserving and selfproclaimed role as world leaderand leading debtorcumtyrantthis is the greatest war film ever made in the second quarter of 1998 and nothing more  except a potful of patriotic historically inaccurate hopelessly implausible racist sadistic and finally just maudlinwell tripe  it rates a 3 from me because it is so effortless  and shameless a pastiche of warmovies clicheswhat a sad state the movies are in when this empty a film is lauded with such superlatives,reality
is billed as an antiwar epic  nothing could be further from the truth  every character is devoted to fighting the war  tom hankss captain miller sends his men into battle even when it is possible and preferential to their mission  to avoid  the green interpreter turns out to be gasp a coward and is only redeemed by killing a certain german  this is not an anti war movie,reality
this movie is a technically perfect one but thats all the story is unbelievable only pictures and sound show the cruelness of war the actors and the script fail to convince you of the pointlessness of it sorry but this movie is a complete failure what the hell have spielberg done here,reality
i just saw this film and all i can say is wow this film has to be one of the most intense movies ive ever seen from the opening scene of the troops landing at normandy to the scene at the bridge my heart was racing others have commented on the content of this film so i wont bother here tom hanks was great showing the humanside of total hell and absurdity this has to be one of my favorite war movies of all time get it on dvd and buckle your seatbelts for a hell of a ride,reality
the thrill of spr was not in the story line but in the gore  it made news not because of what it said but because of its first 15 minutes  why great cast wasted on this horror show drafted out of a biology 101 class i am a viet nam usaf vet and no priss but i had to leave this  it was totally unnecessary to get the point across,reality
i give to this movie a 6 because i think its a well done movie theres a really good making up of a lot of very thrilling and sometimes dramatic scenes theres a lot of action suspence deaths explosions and all on the contrary the plot is quite anonymous theres not a great psychological introspection of most characters too much patriotism madeinusa i think the author tries to cover the structural weakness of the plot with many hard scenes you know what i mean compared to another warmovie produced more or less in the same period i think the name in english should be the sharp red line but with considerably less money this movie in one word can be distinguished for its mediocrity typical of most great hollywoods productions,reality
not concerning on art dignities of the  film it would be desirable to talk about its plot  oriented on oscar award the film was made occupied territory with one native family others is necessary to think have left into america  great selfsacrifice and tragical endingas the citizen of the state what lost in war more then  20 millions of peoples i to saw an eyeful of films about war and heroism in childhood given sorrowful fairy tale is intended for consumption extremely inside countries on which territory be not ordered military actions tom hanks tries from all forces to build of itself the experienced killer that previously was a teacher however in his eyes we see  the reflection of a movie crew camera and dollars in general probably spielberg  has remained large stage set after jurassic park  and he has decided to use it into massacre  scene in the first 15 minutes a plot with the artful fascist by fast run made a circle around of heroic group and join to german army on another side of the bridge probably he knew shorter way and having crossed the river has changed clothes has shaved and again pitch in fight for furer it is simple matchlesssimply remains bitterness for good director sunk in own pathos,reality
with all the hype and glitz surrounding this movie after viewing it there were so many technical errors that i wonder how the director could allow his produce to be shown the first 15 minutes were awesome but again the technicals errors were too numerous to attempt to overlookthe ending was scripted just as hollywood would have you believematt damon description of his brothers with the story of a girl made it sound like they were guns n roses ,reality
is probably the war movie that received too much hype in the media to be still seen without prejudices from my perspective however it was neither a good movie nor a particularly intelligent new look on wwii but part of my resentment against the film results from my different cultural background in which such an open nationalistic display of national images the american flag waving fullscreen for opening and closing is found disturbingits surprising that so many people think that this film sheds a new surprising light on dday or wwii if someone needed the bloody and gory opening sequence about dday to realize that war is hell then this person has never thought about war in the first place of course war is a horrible experience but its amazing how many people needed mr spielberg to tell them and spielberg does not solely concentrate on the horrors of war like so many other american war films be it wwii or vietnam the heroic suffering is always endured by the brave innocent american side the fact that the opposing side might also not have enjoyed the fighting is always overlookedthe much praised historical accuracy for me does not rate this movie above othersif i want to know facts about wwii ill look them up in a history book and not buy a movie ticketwhat additionally annoyed me was the bad directing the lame attempt at a bit of comic relief with the wrong private james was totally out of place in a serious war film tom hanks got another chance to play the perfect american mainstream man and spielberg did not bother to properly develop his character into a threedimensional person with highs and lows further the overly patriotic ending destroyed all attempts to make it an antiwar moviedespite of all the glorifying reviews in the newspapers and magazines its just another war movie nothing new or different from anything already seen,reality
ok i sat down to watch this movie and i was quite pleased with that battle scene i mean great special effects original camera work lots of gore but thats it after that the movie got soooo boring not to mention cheesy typical of the director mr speilberg if that is your real name please give us another goonies and do what you did the first time and dont direct it so so so boring all this movie needed was to be shot in black and white hang on a minute,reality
this is a shockingly simplistic movie told in a complicated andtechnically superb way  ive waited a long time to write a commentto see if i changed my mind but my opinion has gotten even lowernot betterit seems as if some writers and certainly spielberg have adoptedthe dumbingdown motif of modern america  this film is blatantlymanipulative  i feel almost dirty for having seen it and knowing ofits success  the brilliance of its technical depictions of combatcant erase the tawdriness of so many of its plot elementswith sincere apologies to the many fine actors who enriched thisfilm with great performances i still say in a word yuck,reality
this movie is typical spielbergian crap  it is even replete with the token death of a main character  once again special effects are more prominent than plot  all in all i would rather be clubbed with a sack full of rotten potatoes than see this industry job again,reality
okay i might not be the right person to speak in this question since i hate war films and heroic tales about brave men yet i just have to comment on this film after noticing it on the 250top list i watched this very long and very loud film with six of my friends and i can say that no one liked it and no one ever found the energy to sit upright while we saw it it was surprisingly boring and so very uninteresting that i wanted to cry i mean what wheres the action this is a film that should have had some of it right and honestly isnt the whole story incredibly unrealistic not the war scenes but the fact that all these men are risking their lives just to save one soldier that would never ever happenso im not going to recommend this to anyone and i surely wont see it again ever,reality
yet another movie from hollywood drenched in selfregarding sentimentality the americans are wonderful the germans cowardly or brutal imagine seeing this if you were german in fact the germans were excellent soldiers and the americans had a reputation for incompetence other nations are absent as only america won the war a movie crippled by its own ideological premises,reality
prior to seeing this film i had heard only positive feedback  i went into it expecting great things  and i guess yes it was a good film  the action sequences are awesomevery realistic  the fighting scenes are incredibly moving and as far as i can tell i wasnt there authentic but geez what was with the beginning and the end  it would have been a great film without those shmaltzy sequences  do we really need the director to show us just how much of an impact captain john had on private cant anything be left to the imaginationthis film reminds me of forrest gump in its blatant manipulation of the viewing public  my plea to directors is let us watch and judge the merits of the characters dont tell us hes everyman so then we will melt cry and react emotionally  we are smarter than you think  really  we will get it without the affectations and overt pulls at the heartstrings  what ever happened to subtlety in film  i am sorry for those of you who think this is the best film youve ever seen  watch a few more movies before you make such comments  or maybe just learn to watch what you do watch more critically  dont let yourselves be manipulated,reality
among all spielbergs movies that i saw at the festival this is the only one when i felt nothing leaving out except being disappointed and angry worst i felt like this as soon as the first scene seeing this old man walking alone with his wife and family trotting behind was like a slap at my face at this old age and having survived the war it was extremely selfish for him to act like this having watched buddies killed and thus never experienced their family life it was like he havent learn anything of this trauma for him or for themnext we are thrown at dday its the more interesting part of the movie the value of any single soldiers life is dramatically visualized those poor guys who got killed as soon as they opened the door of their boats are the true noble and courageous ones they were sent to slaughter but they stick to their orders for that matter during wwi a relative of my grand mother died the same way in spite of being terribly myopic he was among the first to be sent at the front and as its above all rabbles he lost his glasses and was killed immediately personally i would never have behaved like them because i would have gone awol as much to not be killed as to not kill at this moment spielbergs takes you in the guts and he may be the first director to show how bloody and stupid the war is but as his trademark and sensibility lead him to find hope in this complete darkness the story becomes a rescue mission it could have been moving but the characters of this platoon is rather a band of capricious and lunatic soldiers one wants to hang on with a child the other left a german alive the one that killed them later and finally we met again with mr ego who doesnt want to leave because he has a bridge to defend sure as they stay there they got all killed well it was too much for me i dont understand how spielberg wanted the audience to relate with such stupidity  a life later this private remains totally shameful as he rejects his family and i really wonder if he should have been left behind insteadpairing 1941 a good laugh at wwii but not for the same reasons,reality
anyone else have dreams about omaha beach after watching this movie while i say the movie is too real i do have one comment on the authenticity if tom hanks character was in the first wave onto omaha he and the rest of the cast probably wouldve been killed too gosh hows that for an entertaining thought i remember feeling like i got hit by an 88 after the first 20 minutes and then you get to see lingering individual death scenes after almost every sequence the slow knife death in the house fight was senseless i am a history major but i dont like accurate history movies a lot of history is depressing ill read about it so i guess i am not the target audience for this movie i do like some war movies big red one blackhawk down platoon ill give steven spielberg credit for honoring the memory of world war ii vets in demonstrating the horror and frustration they went through but i can only watch that once when you watch someone die in the longest day you think oh no there goes sal mineo with you know that was a real person who just flopped out of his landing craft and drowned im sure that is what war is really like i just dont want to eat popcorn in front of it,reality
some scenes in this film are technically well made but the overall story merits a maximum rate of 4 miller has specific orders to bring pvt back yet he charges a radar station participates in village fighting and sets up a trap for german troops and tanks did he forget his objective to bring back alive the story is so incredibly dumb miller should have been court martialledthere are so many errors in the movie that anyone with some knowledge of the subject just gets annoyed watching this turkey i have no problem with the american touch to it it is an american film after all,reality

what a piece of work i remember when it came out all the hype about the realism of the battle scenes well for once you can believe the hype  absolutely gutwrenching stuff but its far from being just a boys own action movie  indeed anything but far from a derring do tale of nobility and victory thru moral superiority its an enormously ambitious triumphantly realised and utterly believable portrayal of men in all their variety and complexity struggling above all for survival but motivated also both by the immense power of comradeship and a genuine if barely understood or articulated belief in the righteousness of a cause a truly majestic piece of work an immense example of film doing what only film can do and a worthy salute to the everyday heroes it depicts if doesnt deserve 1010 i really dont know what does,reality
sorry for my englishmaybe i am a bit laid but i would like to give you my review about this moviethe movie was a big surprise for me first because of the nice and different camera movements at the beach and second because of the characterssteven spielberg made an awesome movie about war and it was always hes dream to make a war movie like that he picked the right actors and locations and that made this movie just greatawesome music and sound effects humor and enough action for a second world war movieif you love world war movies this is a must watch,reality
is the world war ii story of a group of american soldiers who just after the invasion of omaha beach france are sent to find private james matt damon and escort him home after all three of jamess brothers are all killed in action leaving him as the familys only living son the movie opens with an older james visiting the normandy american cemetery and memorial where he falls to his knees when he arrives at the headstone of captain john miller tom hanks as he is overtaken by the grief of remembering what captain miller and his fellow soldiers did for him as the camera focuses on the grief in jamess eyes we are taken back in time to the story of captain miller and his fellow soldiers actions in the opening shot establishment shot of the movie shows the omaha beaches with captain miller and his crew inside a higgins boat just off the shore ready to make their landing as the door to the higgins boat opens we are taken on a twentyfiveminute ride through the horrors of war as seen through the eyes of captain miller other soldiers and even through the eyes of machine gun operating german soldiers in this scene our visual and aural senses are shocked with the horrific sights and sounds of war in what is surely the most graphic gory and violent war scene i have ever witnessed viewers are exposed to the sounds of bullets whistling past our heads as hunks of flesh are being blown off our soldiers bodies being ripped in half by machine gun rounds which we can hear bouncing off the ground and limbs being blown off and bodies being vaporized as bombs explode on the beach this barrage continues until the landing zone is secure at which time we are presented with the remnants of the battle which includes hundreds of dead bodies washed up on the beach and many more strewn about the sand which is now soaked with blood to maximize the effect of the horror of this scene and others throughout the movie the filmmaker steven spielberg uses a mix of visual techniques to intensify battle scenes such as the use of hand held cameras to create volatile movements he also effectively uses sound effects transitions and leitmotifs to enhance the emotional elements of the film in the opening scene at the cemetery while an older james is on his knees and the camera is tightly focused on his agonizing eyes spielberg transitions to the establishment shot by dissolving this facial shot this transition technique sets the tone for the rest of the movie and is used anytime there is deep reflection and strong emotional situations occur another technique he employs to evoke an emotional response is the use of leitmotif during the film there are several instances when soldiers are about to succumb to their injuries and they produce a written note they request be sent to their families this passing of the note is extremely powerful in that is shows each soldier was aware of their vulnerability and potential death throughout the movie this passing of the note is repeated multiple times as members of captain millers group are killed in various battles as they race to find private this is repeated all the way to the end of the movie when captain miller is killed in the final battle scene and his note is taken by one of the members of his group now as the movie ends the viewer is transitioned back to the cemetery where is on his knees and staring at the cross of miller as the words of his letter are being read aloud by a narrator this circling back to the cemetery brings about a sense of finality to the movie and draws a strong emotional response from the audience lastly in addition to the sound effects used in the war scenes like the sound of bullets hitting flesh spielberg uses other sound effects that have a profound effect on the movie these include the use of typewriter keys being struck by the secretaries of the army who were writing death notices to the families of the fallen soldiers the sound of the keys striking the paper are very loud and are done using a quick pace to emphasize the number of dead soldiers in another scene when captain millers group are looking for they came across a bag of dog tags that had been removed from dead soldiers after looking at each tag the group would drop them onto a makeshift table which caused an extremely loud clanging both sound effects are well placed and add dimension to the film in the end is a movie that not only expresses the horrors and the human cost of war it also is details the journey of a group of soldiers whose mission it is to save the last living son of the family to that end spielberg beautifully ties together with sight and sound the very graphic nature of war and the nature of man who is willing to risk his own life to save that of another a movie well done indeed,reality
this is one of my favorite movies tom hanks delivers a phenomenal performance of course tom sizemore matt damon vin diesel barry pepper and edward burns give great support to hanks the story is good and the war scenes are believable and well shot the majority of action movies are completely unrealistic the protagonist is invincible and cannot miss hisher target while their enemies die like flies and cant hit their target if it were standing still saving prvt is much more realistic and most of the good guys die unfortunately the ones i liked were the ones that died this is more of a drama and adventure movie rather than action as the team has to find behind enemy lines other than dday and the final fighting scene this is more of an action film than most war moviessome say that this movie is not historically accurate i dont think that is such a big deal in determining whether or not a movie is good or not is a great movie for its action acting and story i still cant believe that it did not receive an academy award for best picture 10 stars easy,reality
in the present day an elderly world war ii veteran and his family visit the normandy american cemetery and memorial in normandy france the veteran walks around the cemetery and upon seeing one specific gravestone collapses to his knees overwhelmed by emotionthe film flashes back to the morning of june 6 1944 the beginning of the normandy invasion as american soldiers prepare to land on omaha beach they suffer heavily from their struggle against german infantry machine gun nests and artillery fire captain john h miller a company commander of the 2nd ranger battalion survives the initial landing and assembles a group of his rangers to penetrate the german defenses leading to a breakout from the beach after the battle the body of a dead soldier lying face down on the beach with s inscribed on the back of his uniform is shownmeanwhile in washington dc at the us war department general george marshall is informed that three of the four brothers of the family were killed in action and that their mother is to receive all three telegrams in the same day he learns that the fourth son private first class james francis is a paratrooper and is missing in action somewhere in normandy marshall after reading abraham lincolns bixby letter orders that must be found and sent home immediatelythree days after dday miller receives orders to find and bring him back from the front he assembles six men from his company tsgt mike horvath private first class richard reiben privates stanley mellish adrian caparzo danny jackson medic irwin wadeand t5 timothy upham a cartographer who speaks french and german loaned from the 29th infantry division miller and his men move out to neuville there they meet a squad from the 101st airborne division,reality
first off the acting in the movie was absolutely amazing i loved how i could feel the emotions pouring out of each of the characters in addition to that the dday scene was one of the most memorable and realistic scenes i have ever seen in a movie depicting war in my opinion steven spielberg and tom hanks need to start making movies about both the vietnam war as well as the iraq and afghanistan wars this would be helpful to both veterans and civilians wanting to have a better understanding of the wars when pvt jackson got blown up in the tower i felt so demoralized because millers men were dying left and right making it harder for pvt to be safely extracted from the battle this movie will always be one of my favorites and it would be amazing to sit behind the scenes and watch as this kind of movie is made i definitely hope to meet both tom hanks and steven spielberg one day in order to gain better insight as to what enables them to make such spectacular movies,reality
this movie was really really good i loved all the war crimes that were committed during the 169 minutes of hardcore action i love the way they stormed omaha beach it was like skyrim but with water it was honestly really good i love how they screamed as they stormed the beach in normandy that hot june 6th day in 1944 the movie really got me into the mood to commit numerous war crimes in a period of 169 minutes it truly amazed me that they could save and his privates in this short amount of time and still have time to commit numerous war crimes but the down side is they used way to much water kinda ruined the mood like how is one going to storm a beach if there is that much water killed the realism 1010  ign like skyrim but with war crimes,reality
is perhaps the best war film of all time  the scene in normandy is spectacular  the script is good  the direction of spielberg is excellent  the films art direction is impeccable the makeup is very well made  it is very realistic the mangled bodies  the cast is good the acting is good  tom hanks is great as always the battle scenes are excellent and realistic  has good dialogue  the pacing is excellent  the film is longer is not tiring  the soundtrack is very good has some cool characters  plus other irritants in my opinion is the best film of oscar nominees 1999 was wronged is an excellent movie  with scenes very realistic battles with a great direction good performances and a very good soundtrack note 10,reality
this movie is indeed in honor of those who served in world war 2 who made sacrifice in order to save our world from tyranny every soldier of america makes an honorable sacrifice and we always remember their sacrifice throughout this movie we see tom hanks play as a captain as he leads these other soldiers through europe against the dreaded nazi army tom hanks character makes a sacrifice and matt damons character respects that and in the end the war is won thanks to the allies this is definitely a great film directed by the great steven spielberg and it deserves him an oscar for best director this film is also the 1998 oscar winner for best picture a great film to watch on memorial day and in honor of those that served our country,reality
you could watch the first scene of this film and think this is a great scene but why is this necessary but really this scene lays out the foundation for the rest of the film the scene shows how fragile life is in war how a man could die right next to you within a matter of seconds and you may not even notice it also shows how all hope seems to be crushed by war showing a man nearly being hit by a bullet and checking his helmet but only getting shot in the head seconds later it also shows men trying to revive a man on the ground and just as they stop the bleeding the man is shot in the head the film shows this later in a scene involving vin deasel attempting to save a child from a building in the middle of a war zone only to be shot by a sniper and have that child go back to his parents it shows how there are no clear good guys and bad guys and how the americans arent necessarily any better than the other guys by showing men killing unarmed troops from the other side for well no reason it shows this later in a scene in which the once naive timothy is spared by a german soldier and then kills an unarmed soldier who he spared earlier in the film only to have him be put back into circulation and kill more men showing also how drastically it changes men it even shows how captain miller must find hope in the face of all the horrible things happening around him by muting all the sound and using slow motion both techniques that are used in a similar situation towards the end of the film as a call back after this fantastic scene however the men of captain millers squad are called on a mission to save the final son of a mother who has lost her three other sons to this war only recently the men are obviously confused by why they would need to risk all of their lives to save one man and the film teeters back and forth on whether this mission is worth it or not at many points it seems futile especially after a second soldier is killed off in an incredibly heart wrenching scene in which miller asks the dying medic what they can do to help him to which he responds with simply some morphine would help but in many places they seem to find possible hope a high ranking officer tells miller i have a brother you get that boy home and when they accidentally find the wrong private and inform him that his brothers are dead even after he is told that he is not the guy the were looking for just the idea of his brothers being dead tears him apart showing the importance of a single person then also when they are loudly searching through dog tags to find a private only to realize that a squadron full of people that fought with those men are walking by this shows that to them what is a meaningless name could have incredible significance to others when they do end up getting to it turns out he doesnt want to be saved if he dies he says to tell his mom that he died with the only brothers that he had left but miller decides that if they save private it might be the only decent thing that theyve done in this horrible situation and then they could truly earn their right to go home but the victory is a long shot and many people die in the process including miller but private survives and in millers dying breaths he tells to earn this ends up living the rest of his life trying to live up to captain millers command and earn this opportunity to live that many died to give him so was it even worth itwell its not black and white but the film argues yes to some extent many men may have died and many may have been permanently damaged both emotionally and physically and they may not know the good that they have done for the world but as private talks to millers grave in his old age his wife and kids and grand kids lurk behind him showing that if it werent for people like miller many people today wouldnt exist for every one man that is saved many more get the chance to live,reality
alright so i probably saw when i was a little too young i believe i was 11 years old when i saw it not in theaters i begged and begged my parents to finally rent it so i could see it i remember i saw bits and parts of it when my sister and dad were watching it once and for some reason i even as a kid was fascinated by wwii anyway they finally caved and went against there better judgment to get me to shut the heck up and we rented it one weekend now the incredible intensity and realism of the violence in this movie is so well done it left me shocked for a few days afterwards i wasnt sure how i felt about it once that shock wore off i realized what a powerful movie it was and even at a young age the amount of respect i developed for the heroes of wwii was deep i believe everyone should at least see this movie and band of brothers to appreciate the sacrifice that military members past and present give to their countrys people the masses watch tv show after tv show of gratuitous violence with glee because it portrays it as a whimsical thing that has little impact on those around it which is of course ridiculous does not glorify war or violence but leaves it for what it is a devastation to humanity however once this is realized the respect for the heroes who go through it goes beyond words which is captured beautifully in the films soundtrack we need not forget the heroes of the past anyway on a technical standpoint the film will never be outdone the sets the practical effects the cinematography everything is perfect to capture the intensity of combat the acting and script while some have claimed it used a lot of stereotypes i disagree to an extent but that is another argument is all fantastic and spielberg is at his absolute best this is one of those films that transcends entertainment and media and everything commercial about movies and becomes something a lot more it is a tribute and a powerful one at that aside from the violence and intensity there are also a few very heartwarming scenes when they find where is from the deafened paratrooper and when tells the captain about his brothers to just name a couple if you didnt believe me tom hanks is at his best as well i feel his acting was on a different multitasking level in this movie he is fully consumed by his character anyway perfect and powerful film,reality
directed by steven spielberg is an action drama film that outlines a historical event in a realistic way the emotion violence and realism that this film displays will make you feel as if you are there the encompassing feelings of loss grief and sacrifice are real and this will show you a perspective into the trail events that follow war this film is about so many things but the focus is really on the courage and selflessness of the american soldier the film opens up with an action packed scene detailing the battle of normandy tom hanks plays as captain miller whom leads his men members of the 2nd ranger battalion through battle in order to secure the landing during this battle many soldiers are lost among these soldiers are two brothers general george marshall chief of staff of the united states army becomes aware that these two brothers along with a third whom was in new guinea had all been killed in action he realizes that their mother would be receiving notice that three of her sons would not be coming home therefore when it is found that there is a forth brother enlisted private played by matt damon the decision was made that he would be found and returned home to his mother immediatelythis prompts captain miller under the orders of the general to assemble a team of eight soldiers from the 2nd ranger battalion to set out on a mission to establish contact with privates unit an element of the 101st airborne division throughout their mission they come face to face with battle sadness bitterness and challenges to fight for what they believe in captain miller struggles through emotions and pain but fights on keeping the moral and determination of the team moving forward with the ultimate goal of going home himselfonce private is finally located he refuses to leave his men to go home despite the news he just received of his late brothers he explains that the men by his side are the only brothers he has left and that he will not leave them this infuriates miller and his team but also inspires them they fight together in an epic battle until reinforcements arrive unfortunately not everyone makes it homethe emotion in this film is undeniable sounds are a constant motif in this film from the beginning to the end during big moments such as battle there are many sounds and details around and we are in that moment the latter is that when there are close ups on characters captain miller for example we are seeing things in his perspective and hearing his thoughts as though he loses focus a more recent film that has a similar theme is david ayers world war ii flick fury where an army sergeant leads a team of five men to battle in hopes of accomplishing heroic ventures against the odds the symbolism of the flag shown at the beginning and end of are very relevant to the fact that freedom is not free and that without the men and women who devote themselves with courage and selflessness we could not be where we are today,reality
first off i liked this movie spielberg went the distance to create the real pain and terror of war with this panorama of death and bloodshed the twenty minutes of normandy footage is the most realistic i have ever seen they cast real people with lost limbs to show how battles are carnage not pretty scenery also without making it obvious they showed how the invasion was completely thrown off track with airborne drops way off the intended marks simply put the detail is authentic for every minute throughout the moviecertainly was never intended to be a documentary the individual plot is of course total fiction yet the plot is and never was the focus of the movie the focus rather is the individual honor that comes from deep within the human psyche the fear and anger that was prevalent through the ranks this is a movie about us in a way,reality
wwii has been an astoundingly ubiquitous and efficacious event in the movies ever since 1939 not a year goes by that at least one film concerns itself with the war its belligerents its soldiers its politics or its innocents there are many reasons for this including the death toll the availability of film technology the timing and the nazis themselves being perfect villains by the power of their twisted ideology yet even a superficial look at history will reveal evil taking many shapes causing comparable turmoil in its wake across the millenniums why then are modern audiences the vast majority of which are generations removed from the conflict so viscerally affected by wwii specificallythe events of are intended by military brass to be a moving piece of army propaganda the titular private damon is the youngest of four american farmboy brothers all of which were killed in the line of duty following the invasion of normandy captain john miller hanks and his small company are tasked with going behind enemy lines to retrieve private and bring him back before his mother at home collects yet another army telegram along for the ride is the gruff sgt harvath sizemore the headstrong private reiben burns sniper private jackson pepper medic irwin wade ribisi and three additional privates caparzo diesel fish goldberg and upham daviesthe films ensemble allmale cast does an outstanding job allaround each having the acting chops and dexterity to expand on their characters in a way that forms naturally from the story and the situations these men though dutybound and ultimately courageous are not the quaint cardboard cutouts weve seen in subpar gi joe bmovies theyre human frail and afraid though still have the gumption and intelligence and moral fortitude to see things through at the center of the motley crew is tom hanks whose unsure captain miller does his best given an escalating mess of obstacles from both the defending nazis and the confusion of the us army grouping and regrouping after every decisive battleyet doesnt fall into the wry cynicism of the americanization of emily 1964 or the bitter fatalism of the big red one 1980 it doesnt choose to be quite as reductive as simply saying war is absurdity behind the grime the rubble and the turmoil stands director steven spielbergs patented virtuous humanism elevating the material to powerful heights with a delicate but commanding hand spielberg fills the screen with moments of hope and nobility largely taking advantage of old fashioned storytelling and tom hanks benevolent credibility every moment of affecting drama hits its mark reaching a satisfying crescendo that is guaranteed not to leave a dry eye in the theaterof course no war drama as poignant as it might be can be complete without highoctane action which im glad to say delivers big time to enhance the realism of the various gunbattles and thunderous army advances spielberg doesnt shy away from blood or gore showing the inhumanity of war in all its awful shameful glory the first battle a shocking and adrenalinepumping depiction of dday at omaha beach is quite frankly one of the best war scenes ever committed to filmwhile telling a real complex and harrowing human story at the center of an inhumane war cuts through all the propaganda that made wwii the standalone cinematic force it was and arguably still is unlike the nationalistic onereels of frank capra or the sinister celluloid works of joseph goebbels and company is a hardnosed look at war from the perspective of those in the fray its exciting bittersweet scary saddening and redemptive all in equal measure thus making one of the best war films ever made,reality
steven spielbergs is a film that is illustrated with such magnificent detail that it helps grasp your attention right from the beginning and doesnt let go until the credits start to roll the hard work and dedication put in by the director cinematographer and actors in this film will make you leave the theater completely enthralled with tearstained cheeks and puffy eyes this film is set during world war ii particularly the invasion of normandy as four brothers of the family enter the war their mother receives the news that three of them have died right at the start devastated at her loss she sends orders to have them find her fourth son this leads into the whole mission of the movie which is to find private first class james francis matt damon and bring him home tom hanks is known for his work in dramas so it was no surprise that he was the perfect fit to play the leading role as captain john h miller he takes it above and beyond when he allows his voice to tremble and even get this glassy look in his eye as if he was experiencing war first hand he plays the leader that everyone looks to when they are in desperate need for direction but he also portrays the man whose hands tremble due to the effect of war which makes him that much more fascinating to watch another character that catches your eye is that of private richard reiben played by edward burns burns portrays a new new demeanor never seen by him before as he is not known for his acting in epic war dramas but comedies throughout the film he is seen yelling into mens faces and giving off facial expressions that makes him look arrogant but then becomes soft as he realizes he cant do anything else to save captain miller seeing burns play such a new role gives him that much more credibility and respect for his acting career the credit of this film should go not solely to the actors but to director steven spielberg and cinematographer janusz kamiski who display so many different perspectives and angles that pull the film together for example when they show the death of captain miller they use an angle that shows who shoots him and him getting shot pulling together the commotion of war and show his men avenging his death they also took real footage from what actually happened during wwii and copied almost exactly how they saw it by knowing that you just witnessed what actually happened in history makes the film that much more alluring than it already is considering the film starts off with a very graphic 27minute battle scene at omaha beach it sets the expectation that the rest of the movie would not be a waste of ones time the reality of the film is one that needs to be rewarded due to the accuracy of the little details some of these details are the boats that replicated the ones used during wwii the blood they used to completely engulf the water and the scene which shows soldiers trying to find their severed limbs spielberg did not sugarcoat the harsh realities of war but instead used it to capture the audiences attention spielberg has definitely outdone himself in this film it teaches one about american history but also one about honor and sacrifice through the agony and the loss it is a film that will be shown to people for centuries to come,reality
let me start off by saying that everything you would ever see in 10 other war movies is shown in this movie in just the first 30 minutes the amount of realism portrayed is unmatched starting with the seasickness youd experience after traveling through the english channel while sitting in a tightly compact boat the tone immediately shifts to the desperation of survival in the battlefield and the unlikeliness of making it out alive with the body count stretching over 100 before this scene was over complete with the pain anguish horror and loss of limbs and sanity all while showing the most accurate representation of a world war ii era invasion ever put on film then it moves on to a deep character study of the individual squad trying to accomplish a single and very simple mission despite all wearing the same clothing these characters are distinguished and relatable with each character having their own mindset and opinions some even talking about their past histories these are human beings that you come to care about you feel like youre part of the squad you laugh when theyre having fun and you feel the same stress that they feel when somethings about to go wrong by the time the movies over you really felt like you went through a war from the visceral landings that introduced you to what the battlefield is like to traveling with your fellow soldiers through the french countryside always on your feet expecting to run into the enemy at any moment to desperately attempting to complete your mission and win if there was any war movie that anyone should see its this one,reality
there arent many film directors as influential and recognizable as steven spielberg he is mostly known for his fun films for almost all ages yet one of his most acclaimed works to date is called one of the most violent most realistic and grittiest depictions of war in cinema history this is one of spielbergs greatest moviesthe film is set in the normandy during world war ii three of the four brothers named have fallen in battle the military decides it is the best to escort the last brother james played by matt damon back home so that his family wouldnt lose all of their sons captain miller played by tom hanks is told to guide a group of soldiers including actors such as vin diesel barry pepper and jeremy davis among others to findthe acting in is very amazing tom hanks is as always the master of his doings but we have seen better roles by tom hanks a few times although he functions more like a mcguffin than an actual character and has not so much screen time matt damon has one of his best performances ever the supporting actors barry pepper and jeremy davis do their job very well toothe cinematography in this films is among the best i have ever seen in some scenes like the famous omaha beach scene at the beginning of the movie the camera is very shaky but you can still see what is going on this adds to the tension of the scene the visual style is very realistically brutal as claimed by many historians and survivors of the dday battleis one of the best if not the best war movies ever made cinematography is flawless acting is amazing and it is one of these films that truly show how terrible war actually is this is a very depressing movie but it also has some uplifting and even funny moments like when corporal upham trips over the typewriter to sum it up this is about how far you can get from a movie being fubar 1010,reality
recently i decided to watch again with an intention to describe its general sense within couple paragraphs as a small review but as soon as ive done it i realized that my review cannot be as small as i intentionally plannedi would start with the main statement this is the most massive movie about war ive ever seen notwithstanding it is a little bit too american in my opinion the movie impresses with its uncovered realism steven spielberg thrashing over his battle scenes tried to make them be more like a newsreel from a battlefront the closeups full of dynamics a scenery detailed elaboration a meticulous filling scenes with sound and colour all these not just impress but stun and literally injure viewers mindthe key episode of the first half of the movie is a landing attack on a beach of normandy in a first moment as hatches of troop carrying vessels are open first rows of soldiers are sweeping away by stormly fire of largecalibre rifles others with the imaginary camera man start to jump over from both boards of the boat several time we are drawn down and up again as water cover us all sounds are being so muttered and meaningless and we feel ourselves almost safe but then bullets starts to stitch the water body over and over and the water turns red oh i shouldnt try to retell what has been already geniusly filmed these couple of minutes leave viewer completely breathless and you believe in what you see from start to finishand then the battle begins no im wrong not the battle but slaughtery it is shocking the death is shown with all of its uncovered might when i meet somewhere in a text or in tv a phrase like he went through hell at that war even its not about ww2 but i remain this battle scene from this movie to help my mind understand the phrase betterstephen spielberg said about battle scenes of the movie that he wanted to represent them in a way to diminish tendency of violence embellishmentthe cast is good very good tom hanks is a great actor and this is his greatest role in my opinion yes he is playing again his mr good guy clich but it doesnt matter sincerely speaking i do not much like american mentality which shows most vividly in american stories about war about american soldiers and thats why i like tom hanks here he made an image of cpt james miller very close too my idea of what an officer should be he could play a soviet officer for that story as well there wouldnt be any dissonance at all i like image he made very muchonce again set design is amazing you never doubt that this is a war in front of you not for a moment the war is every small detail in every stone in every building in everywherebut the storyline is not complicated at all its not bad because it is so marvelously represented even typical american messages in the beginning and in the end are not worsen my general feeling about the movie i think these messages are even controversial to all other parts of the moviemy rate 1010,reality
saving pvt is a war movie taken place during world war ii most notably during dday tom hanks and edward burns star in this gritty and war movie warning this movie isnt for the faint of heart and those who have ptsd this movie isnt recommended for you non stop action war violence and brief but strong language like all movies it has its problems but not bad enough that it affects the movie badly its one heck of a movie and it was a pleasure seeing it cons barley any lot of lens flares that are kinda distracting but thats all pros good war movie gory a must for all of you gorehounds out there tug at your heart strings and itll make you realize why war is hell,reality
date 9 june 2012 first time watch this was my first time watching and it may be my last for a good reason the story is extremely sad but what makes it very sad is because its true most of the things that occurred in the movie actually happened in world war two as a person interested in world war two i found this movie did an extremely good job depicting life after dday the ending is extremely sad and it actually took my by surprise i didnt expect that to happen i expected some of it but not all of it in my opinion this is one of steven spielbergs best films along with schindlers list very moving and touching810,reality
this depicts the second world war as no other film had before the first twenty five minutes really drives home the futility and brutality of war as well as the incompetence of the bomber commanders in not clearing the beach a little morefor me the sign of a good movie is that it seems shorter than its running time this movie is nearly tree hours but seems nowhere near that longthe performances are all very good with fine memorable characters and the only jarring note for me was at the end when the captain tells to earn this maybe i just didnt get it but i felt that it put an awful burden on who would have been haunted by the fact that all these soldiers had died to save him especially when he didnt want to be savedother than that it is an excellent way to spend a few hours,reality
i read the review on the title page that recommended watching this film with a surround sound system to make watching this film an astounding experience i took the advice of this reviewer and i thank him the sound quality was mindblowing and captivated me for the 162 minute running time however this brutally realistic depiction of combat is an astounding experience regardless of surround systemsthe film follows a group of soldiers of the 2nd ranger batallion who valiantly agree to tackle a brutal mission where the subject is a young trooper by the name of james francis who unknowingly as lost his 3 brothers in combat after his mother receives the news the chief of staff of the us army orders the generals to inform captain miller tom hanks that he is to locate private and release from his duties in combat in order for him to return safely to his grieving motherthe film follows the group of soldiers as they go to extraordinary lengths in order to save private which involves the death of two soldiers the medic irwin wade giovanni ribisi and private adrian caparzo vin diesel along with the massacre of a number of german and french troops after the soldiers locate their subject they break the news to him and despite understandably being crippled with grief private displays extreme reluctance to lead his camp which provokes mixed emotions towards him firstly its easy to appreciate his nobility and his loyalty towards his duties but this is juxtaposed with a feeling of disdain simply because he initially doesnt appreciate the lengths that the soldiers have went to in order to fin him whilst abandoning their original duties in the armyspelbergs direction is aweinspired and flawless he masterfully captures the brutality of combat in the 22minute opening scene where there is blood guts and gunfire in abundance does blood and guts make for a great depiction of war combat definitely not but its spielbergs direction which involves extreme closeups of casualties and of course the blood and rain onto the camera lens is an effective technique spielberg is very impressive as he makes the viewer realise the pain and suffering the desperation and sometimes futility of hardfought combat contrary to these portrayals he is equally effective in engaging the audience into positive emotions such as a feeling of triumph when the soldiers under the command of captain miller penetrate the german infantry on omaha beach when it looked clear that the soldiers where in a desperate struggle against the germans the acting in this movie is not fantastic its not supposed to be the movie unlike so many others in the modernday film industry does not depend on the acting of the main protagonists in order for it to achieve on a number of levels the acting however is impressive and believable believable being the operative word hanks and co are very believable in terms of struggling to overcome adversity in its extremist form and battling the almost overwhelmingly brutal elements of combat the film is particularly recognised for its intense opening scene set on the beach of omaha normandy but in my opinion the movie is entertaining intense and captivating throughout the duration it has no spells of boredom there are no dull and listless sequences of dialogue the dialogue sustains credibility humour and puritythis film won 5 academy awards it should have won more it received accolades for direction obviously and also won for cinematography and sound editing whilst the best picture went shakespeare in love sighoverall this is a masterpiece an intense and brutal depiction of the elements of war it does to an extent glorify american soldiers considering that a number of soldiers abandoned their respective duties in order to retrieve an unknown private but it does it in an engrossing manner the script is solid which is all it needs to be the same goes with the acting but the cinematography editing and effects are astonishing truly breathtaking this is the best spielberg film i have ever watched i havent seen schindlers list 1010 pure cinematic mastery,reality
was incredible from the get go the violence emotion and the acting was perfect there was funny bits like when the big guy chucks his helmet at a nazi then shoots him with a pistol and when you watch this film youll notice the same stuff was used in most war games but why hasnt a vietnam war film like platoon or apocalypse now not as good as this  the reason is that as i am australian and i notice when propaganda films are made and made the nazis look like vicious horrible humans thats not far from what they really where but in a vietnam war film thats made by americans platoonapoco now they make it look like war is bad because the vicious disgusting americans start stupid wars over nothing but in world war 2 the americans where the good guys and thats easy to portrait now the americans once again are fighting a war over nothing in iraq and afghanistan but the vietnamies didnt have access to nukes but the middle east might so what im trying to say is americans can make a person be proud of there country or cry for what has happened but they cant dismiss the past for what actually took place in vietnam btw charlie cheen acted badly in platoon which didnt help and i saw tropic thunder before platoon which buggered it up for me,reality
this is a steven speilburg masterpiece that will teach future generations what wwii was like war is pure hell and this is the strong message in this well deserved r rating even with the language filtered which was my only disappointment this movie is on the verge of the nc17 nobody wanted to see what war was like but steven speilburg made them anyway when i saw this movie my view of war changed i had no idea of all the deaths and pain our soldiers went through to make the us a better country to live in body parts flying everywhere a man that had his face blown off blood spraying in all directions men trying finding their missing limbs and men lying in their own intestines and thats just the first 30 minutes in the omaha beach scene like i said this is a strong and moving film that is not for the weak stomach or for people that dont want to know what war was really like i dare you to watch this movie and not be moved by the strong story and captivating effects that is saving private,reality
i saw the film when if first came out and i really liked it upon revisiting it ive come to find the film to be very cheesy the beginning and the ending were trite and contrived my grandpa is a wwii vet so please dont think im being overly negative here  i like what the film has to say but i just think that it was executed way too onthenose it should have been subtler i think that the second act is beautifully done and exciting storywise i was very into it the sound design throughout is unbelievable i really felt like i was there with those soldiers i also think that the cinematography was beautiful there are moments of great work in this film powerful work in fact but the tacky ending nearly ruined the whole experience for me spielberg has done better and worse,reality
this is a very good movie one of the best war movie ever made not because it has lots of intense action but because it captures the more emotional human side of war it is not covered in sugar but gives it to you as it is lots of blood and gore as real war is one of the best made defiantly lets you feel connected to the characters upham kinda sucks but he is human so you cant blame him i look like upham spoilergermans losei look like upham spoilergermans losei look like upham spoilergermans lose i look like upham spoilergermans losei look like upham spoilergermans lose i look like upham spoilergermans lose i look like upham spoilergermans lose,reality
this is definitely the best war movie ever made it starts out like every movie should on the shores of normandy beach with blood spraying and body parts flying and explosions and gunfire and everythingthen the dust settles and out of it emerge the soldiers that will become almost your buddies if not your companions throughout the moviethat is why it is shocking after all these characters reveal themselves and you know them so well when almost all of them dieill be honest i shed some tears at the end of this movie you have got to be a robot with no tear ducts not to crythis movie touched me like very few if none have despite the fact im not even americanborn great great movie,reality
this movie defined the modern definition of the war movie it was told through the eyes of if not the greatest director in our historyspielberg it is played out perfectly by tom hanks who i was not a big fan of till i seen this movie everything seems so real and is as if you are there with the soldiers fighting for your country this is by far the greatest war movie ever played out everyone played there spot to perfection and acted the best they could i think the story is very precise  the first 10 minutes of the movie are shocking yet a cinematic masterpiece every minute is breathtaking and shows you the horrors of war and friendship an how one name determined them to save him it is a story of teamwork and what they did to help each other out i give this movie an 11 out of 10,reality
is one of the best war movies ever not one of the best films but the best war movies ever the only bad part of the film is the lost of the war of the men that fought for the war however the script is wonderfully made the effects and the sound is excellent steven spielbergs direction is incredible on this project one part of the film is when theres a family where the father gave away his daughter that became suspenseful because the emotion on the kids face is too emotional to watch however the girl goes back to her father however in that scene a solider gets killed from a sniper the most bloodiest part of the film is the end which is a must see snipers gun shots bombs a man the kills a solider with a knife too bloody however a must see movie no kids are allowed to see this unless with accompanied adult if you allow you kid to watch it they will have nightmares,reality
i am a big fan of wwii movies and was looking forward to this movie i had heard so many great things about it i was very disappointed the actual photography and special effects were great the actions of the people involved to make little sense the opening at normandy was well done but i didnt understand mixing the humor with the gore but it was good at showing the brutality now the men at the center of the action were experienced soldiers we see them using their wits in using mirrors to look around corners not exposing them selves to enemy fire etc everything is fine then comes the set up trying to find the one private in the sea of humanity okay so they look and finally find him now the logic seems to completely desert the men and they act so stupid which is a complete 180 from how they acted at the start of the movie if they had no combat experience that is one thing but to start the movie showing how smart they are then wind up the way they did just was too much for meokay i accept the decision to stay and fight for no real good reason because things like that happen but then they start running out in front of tanks stand still while tanks point their guns at them sit on their butts when they run out of ammo and to not even try to find out where the bridge was in relation to the army as it turns out if they had not lured the germans into their trap their fighters and the whole column would have been up to deal with them without any pointless fighting okay well that could have been a stupid decision but to have the men act they didnt have a clue about war they didnt just go through the brutality of the invasion was just so contrived it was too much for the suspension of believe normally called fori really dont understand why so many people liked it it seems like the fact that spielberg directed it gives in an extra 4 points obviously i am in the minority here maybe i watched too many episodes of combat growing up and my expectation were too high,reality
although portrays excellent cinematography and probably a pretty accurate sense of being in a battle in the second world war the film failed to do anything more this film was probably made for its battle scenes which i cannot fault at all and for which this movie does earn some credit for however in terms of story and characters the film fails along with the story the film has too many slow movements overall it is too long and tends to drag on if they had spent as much time on the story as much as they spent on the cinematography then we would have had a much better film watch it for the battle scenes and history if you watch it at all,reality
this movie is a great historical film and depicts accurately what life in the war was like and how people coped with the ideology of war yet despite its many positive qualities it doe have some negative ones that in some aspects out weight the good one this movie gets you emotionally attached to the characters and then the directors systematically kills them off almost to spite the audience and laugh in their faces i understand that war is brutal and there are lots of fatalities and what not but kill off any soldiers that people immediately grew attached to was just dumb on the directors part this is why i personally will never watch this movie again because not even one decent solider was left living at the end that you cared for,reality
is a good movie so far as action scenes and depicting the horror of war is concerned so far as plot and historical accuracy goes  well as it was once said very few things happen at the right time and the rest do not happen at all the conscientious historian will correct these defects this is a feature that doesnt seem to bother too many people howeverthe whole movie is based on a laughable premise when privates three siblings are killed in the war captain miller is given an assignment to take a squad of men and go find private is of course behind enemy lines and the mission is highly dangerous suicidal actually and here we find our very distant relationship to reality the plot was inspired in part by the true story of fritz niland one of four brothers from new york state who saw action during the war two niland brothers were killed on dday while another was missing in action in burma and was presumed dead although he actually survived fritz was located in normandy by an army chaplain reverend francis sampson and taken out of the combat zone so where a priest managed to do the job singlehandedly in real life it now takes a squad of battlehardened soldiers oh and a perpetually cringing typist  that was a good idea to be sent to their doom by the loving united states government the soldiers are of course acutely aware of this fact and they spend no shortage of time dwelling on it for the viewers pleasure before they finally end up getting killed spielberg appears to have a bone to pick with the us government and there were to be sure bones to be picked but it would be nice if this one were at least grounded in reality  and if he werent quite so preachy for viewers somewhat versed in history and who require a believable plot to enjoy a movie feels like summer stock in an iron lung couple this with spielbergs typical cheeseball antics flashbacks flashforwards women swooning men swooning anything to create an emotional effect with the least possible effort and youve got yourself some academy awardwinning eye candy that will forever serve as the gold standard in wwii moviesjust as an aside tom hanks apparently recognized the irony behind since he went on to produce a welldone 10hour hbo miniseries on the 101st airborne entitled band of brothers which in contrast is actually believable which might have something to do with the fact that it employs some amount of historical accuracy youd be better off watching band of brothers unless you enjoy the feeling of being brainwashed,reality
this film is brilliant because it trys to get as close to realism as is possible and we need films like this every now and then to show us what went on in a different time  for me its the ending not the start that makes it although that start is unforgettable and brilliant but also devastatingly terrible but the one thing that i marvel at is that men did that i cannot imagine where guys found the bravery to run up a beach and return fire in the face of that devastating machine gun fire the one message that i think the whole movie conveys is one of ordinary men going to war and changing history the way they did for me the whole movie is summed up by tom hanks admission that he is a school teacher to put this in perspective think back to your old school teachers can you think of one of them who you would think capable of doing what his character did during this film or what the others did are any of us capable that is questions that this movie asks of us all while at the same time giving us the answers about a small part of war everybody should watch this movie as it is seminal and it does bring home some very stark realities if you dont like it then maybe you should continue to watch old john wayne movies where the bullets bounced off of people and soldiers on the allied side ran through enfilading fire without any of them getting hitone day i hope speilburg and hanks collaborate on either a story on okinawa  iwojima american stories or maybe kohima a british and indian story all 3 of these particular battles were all murderous in their own way and also it would bring to light a forgotten war because wwii did not just happen in europe,reality
i simply love this movie its a masterpiece steven spielberg has proved yet again that he is a genius tom hanks performs an outstanding role in this movie hes my favourite actor among the few who won 2 consecutive oscars this movie enhances every sensation felt by those brave little soldiers its so realisticim just amazed hanks didnt win an oscar 4 his performance i mean he was just breathtaking with each man i kill the farther from home i feel  this quote leaves me speechless its so meaningful i like this movie because its atypical the main character dies in the end unlike in most war movies i think this adds flavour to it,reality
ok i can understand the story can grab your attention butcmon do you really want me to believe that the life of that one kid is worth a whole team of dead soldiers and that the president of america himself took care of it what kind of useless rhetoric in the worst american bmovie tradition that is not what i expect from a steven spielbergs movie and what about when after all this absurdity they meet pvt at last and he refuses to come back because of bla bla bla if i wore tom hanks character i would have shot him at once on the other hand we must admit that the famous opening scene of normandy attack is one of the best of the whole movie history scaring rhythmic impressive realistic this is spielberg so as an overall i would rate 10 for the opening scene but 0 for the rest it would be 3 if it wasnt spielberg we can not let him waste his talent like that so as an average i just give 5one last suggestion for everybody rent the dvd watch the opening scene maybe even twice or more and then bring it back to the shop,reality
this is a masterpiece i love war movies but this one beats them all handsdown not just for its graphic realistic depiction of being in the middle of battle but also for the incredible characters that are developed and the quiet intimate moments where a soldiers sadness loneliness depression and fear all start to kick in if youve seen platoon full metal jacket the thin red line casualties of war hamburger hill we were soldiers or any other war film you need to see it is the war movie by which all others will be judged for a very long time maybe even forever there are no words that can do it justice this is the only movie i can give a 10 rating to because in my mind it literally is the perfect war movie in every sense you will not be disappointed,reality
i could have made a lot of money from this movie while watching it with a friend i kept saying he is going to die now and guess whathe did now if only i had made a bet of 10 each time that happened i would have had made enough to cover my movie ticket the price of the popcorn and drink plus i would have been able go out to a caf afterwardsthe plot is interesting a group of american soilders must cross the scattered dday lines to find a soldier whose brothers have all been killed so he can be sent home because the president of the us of a promised that he couldthe them of this movie is obvious people made sacrifices to keep the world safe during world war ii do we as a generation live up to those sacrifices my view is nope you bastards took vietnam away from a proamerican ho chi min and gave it to the french then ho chi min got angry and kicked your american butts as you deserve you rounded up the communists in greece at the end of wwii and had them shot so of course they had a communist uprising laterthis is a sad pathetic and obvious movie that tries to justify america to americansthe only thing that makes up for that is the honesty of the war scenes and truth in the characters other than private who turns out to by some sort of uber american symbol so we can feel good about him being savedwatch it with friends so you can play the drinking game it works like this people call out the names of characters they think are going to die if they do die within 5 minutes everyone drinks if they dont the person who called out drinks,reality
apart from the first part i was very disappointed by the rest the morale dont let an enemy go because he will return and kill you strange haircut ss soldiers more resembling us marines than german waffen ss soldiers even speaking english  germans storming a town running around to be shot  it just irritates me all was more decently done in band of brothers only the action of the german flakcrew and spgun was done well keep in mind that in reality the waffen ss was a frightening fighting force with unparalleled commanders but didnt enter the battle in cotentin so soon rob veenenberg,reality
made in 1998 spielberg broke all conventions of war films and a gripping emotional epic was born it unveils the true horror of what happened on dday although if you look under it all where is britain canada poland etc mentioned once as far as im concerned this film is totally biased the war wasnt won singlehandedly but by nations bonding i am insulted that this film didnt include anyone else but the americans they have taken all the credit fair play it was made in america by americans but many american films have actors from other nationalitys so why is this an exception dont get me wrong its a good filmin places but a bit more thought needs to be put into it next time to avoid upset i loved the opening sequence though,reality
i didnt like this one people seem to fall for spielbergs direction which is very good with the exception of some big mistakes see below but the story is so badmajor spoilers aheadfirst of all how can the old man at the beach remember things he never saw i mean he did not participate in the landing how on earth he can remember it so vividlysecond question in the end the bridge is set with explosives a tank is hit by a bomb from a fighter plane and a man is on that bridge directly in front of the tank what happens to him according to spielberg  rodat nothing the tank is destroyed the bridge is not and there is not shrapnel at all  and the man is still in one piece come on you people you call this realisticthird montybashing is okay imo see marketgarden but how come that hanks who is just a captain is more aware of the general situation than higher ranking officers with all the information they are getting from other troops planes etc i am referring to the scene on the beach when hanks is telling us about the importance of this particulare bridge which turns out to be very small nothing pioneers could not build over night its not like crossing the rhine but hanks claims that this bridge is not only vital for the success of dday but the entire war this is crap beyond imagination thank you mr rodat you made us all believe that every soldier in every thick of a fight can judge better than a generalfour the change of hanks he is trying to come out alive he even tries to save his mens lifes wandering around in france he happens to hit a lonely german outpost with a machine gun question what is the right decision correct you run directly into the line of fire well he could have said men do you want to walk around it could be say a mile to avoid it soldier no my script says i have to die here so lets run into it hanks ah you are right and there will be also a german soldier who has to beg for his life and i have to have mercy on him so he will be able to run and fight us again later hmm that shows pretty well the evilness of the germans okay so lets runfive the change of hanks so he has lost a man now hes going for it lets call this bridge the alamo this is were we will fall back to soldier hmm i dont remember exactly what happened to the defenders of that place in mexico uh texas hanks uh any other questionssix the final battle well though the ss was being an elite troop at the beginning of the war it was watered down by 1944 but they were fanatics andor thugskillerslowlifesscum  you get the idea  from about 16 countries at this time there were even french norwegian swedish ukrainian soldiers  you name it  in the german army at this time all in all we can consider them to be very dangerous maybe this particulare troop had some veterans from the eastern front this is an armored infantry bringing along tanks and now enter hanks an co they decide to shoot it out and  guess by yourself what happensseven the characters dont get me started on thatdear mr spielberg you are great but you have to have more patience looking for good scripts you did cinema history with the opening sequence but the rest just sucks  due to the scriptdear mr rodat maybe the original script was better than this mess maybe i am doing you wrong but on the other hand your next script was the patriot the one with gibson not seagalwell youll keep trying huhthe movie was in the top 10 if i remember right and now its down on 58 but the users of imdb comment on it enthusiastically i guess the the ones who did not like it did not commentbad bad writing good directing good hanks 410 macaulay j connor,reality
i was told by a taiwanese friend i shouldnt watch because he thought it might offend me because it was unfair towards germans but after years ive decided to watch it after all and i didnt find it so unfair though they completely failed to show the german side of the storyvery brutal movie very ugly scenes one guy lost his arm in the war and searched for it hoping they could help him with his arm again then he walked around with his arm in his handtoo much shooting but what do i expect from a war movie ive always disliked movies about war you should just watch them to be informed about how stories are told or to make things more visual for yourselfi must admit i fastforwarded this movie because i dont need to watch hours of shooting and bleeding the message of the movie should be clear after half an hour,reality
the opening scene was really outstanding afterwards however the plot disintegrated into good guys verses bad guys and the ending of how about 10 guys held off all the germans using tactics from magyver was sacchrinsweet the story ended up displaying how our superior moral ground as americans led to triumph against the evil fascists,reality
this film is a typical example of the wrong conception that the big money and a serious theme make a great art no matter how important and serious is the problem of the film nothing will save it if it is made without taste spielberg goes on making dull pretentious unbearably politically correct films for adults with a teenage level of intellect well there is nothing bad in making naive picture but naivety of spielberg films is of a special kind it seems that the director wants to make something more important than et or indiana jones but actually these are his best films because they are what they are  nice entertaining films for kids when spielberg aspires for something higher he inevitably finishes with a huge monumental soapunlike shindlers list that i consider a good educational film for youth private has something that i citizen of a postcommunist posttotalitarian country cannot accept america used to be for us a symbol of democracy and it is strange that now when there is no soviet danger anymore american cinema is becoming more and more conservative and hurrahpatriotic of course there is nothing bad in being a patriot of your nation but the latest tendency is obviously aimed at propagating the armed forces militarism etc from this point of view there is not much difference between the private rayan and the independence day spielbergs films doesnt seem to show that much of senselessness of war as it was advertised but propagates the bravery of the american soldiers and the wisdom of the american regime and does this as straightforward and primitive as it can be the story of the film seems pathetic even if it is true and the acting is corresponding good photography and excellent sound effects cannot save the film i think it is time for some filmmakers to realize that no matter how important and serious is the problem of film nothing will save it if it is made without taste,reality
with so many true stories from wwii out there this feeble concoction seems a pithy excuse to show the horrors of the landing on dday  while the opening sequence is harrowing the rest of the movie seems to drown in its wake  also tom hanks was terribly miscast he should stick to light romantic comedy,reality
the whole movie is the quest for one particular soldier and the mission to bring him home safely  the invasion at normandy begins the movie  the opening is very hard to watch not only because of the very graphic violence and mutilation of war but also the memory of all those who gave up their lives once you get past that scenesetting episode the rest of the movie is much more pleasant to watch  tom hanks as always if fine in his role as are all the supporting roles  but who was the last person to see a poorlydone spielberg film you owe it to yourself to see private if for no other reason but to remember the ugliness of war,reality
after a realistic opening scene this degenerates quickly into standard cliched hollywood nonsense  stirring music at moments of emotion usual collection of stereotyped characters trite sentiment  earn this hanks is totally miscast other actors forgettable also from this film one might think that the us won the war singlehanded no mention of the british canadian french or polish forces who were actually more involved in dday than the americans,reality
what if this film had been made exactly as it is seen today by someone other than steven spielberg  what would the critics be saying  i have a feeling they would be telling the screenwriter to go back to college and learn about dialogue story thrust plausibility and characterization  four things that this awful exploitive drivel singularly lacked  i feel they would also be telling the director that if you open a film with 40 minutes of sickening violence that you had better be prepared to justify it later on the most disheartening thing about all of this is that spielberg no longer seems to care what his films are saying only that they make a big enough noise to be important  following the unwatchable opening we get extremely trite symbolism poor dialogue and wooden acting in service of a badly presented story all leading up to another unwatchable sequence followed by a coda which suggests that all of this unnecessary carnage is a great noble and patriotic thing  in doing this spielberg aligns himself with the nazis that his own schindlers list abhorredremember the nazis were the kings of patriotism and nationalism  the most offensive aspect of this film then is its utter pretentiousness  at least exploitation movies dont pretend to be anything but what they are  this one sadly has delusions of grandeur and although this criticism cant be levelled at the film itself spielbergs utterly arrogant acceptance of his oscar for best director confirms all of my worst suspicions  compare it to his humble tearful acceptance of the welldeserved oscars for schindlers list  since no one around mr spielberg seems to have the courage necessary to tell him when the emperor has no clothes on the responsibility falls to the critics and audiences  let him know youre tired of his version of reality,reality
i couldnt wait to see this movieupon its releasewhen i sat there watching it i was surprised at the brutality of itthat was howeverthe best part of the movieother the honesty of the way the battle scenes were shotthe story was lamei had a hard time believing that the life of one soldier was so importantso important in factthat the lives a a few soldiers are risked in saving himand when they do find him its just more of the same brutal fight sceneslooks good but as a whole movie was bitterly disappointing,reality
nice battle scenes but the plot is actually unrealistic  just ask a veteran  during the largest invasion in the history of the human race no commanders were worried about individual men  no squads sauntered through enemy territory talking loudly and generally acting like big targets  if the dialogue and the acting were better i could overlook the flaws but matt damon in particular is rank  for a real true to life war movie watch a bridge too far no hollywoodization there,reality
when this first came out everyone jumped up and danced around about how good it was  critics said it was incredibly powerful and it redefinned the war movie  they claimed it was nothing like those patriotic films right after world war two  nor was it like the many excellent films made during the 70s and 80s on vietnam  it was so different and so much better  i completely disagree  if anything it is a throwback to all those gungho films like the sands of iwo jima  it really makes one want to join the fight and help save europe  and it is quite funny  not only is there humour when they are marching around looking for private which is acceptable but you also laugh when people are dying  that shouldnt happen in a quality war movie it can in an action movie on the other hand another thing the ending is absolutely ridiculous like that would happen i must commend spielberg for his excellent direction of the landings and the action sequences were staged well but this is no great film,reality
one of the great things about seeing a film twice is that it allows you to go back and see the flaws that flew right on past you the first time you saw it when i first viewed i enjoyed the film but at the time i didnt really think about why i walked out of the screening not really thinking about the film at all first bad sign later on at home i began to think about the impact that had on me i started to feel as though the film had no impact on me what so ever second bad sign how could this be how could a film acclaimed by so many as one of the best war films ever made have no effect on me so in a couple of days i went and watched it again and then everything became clear is steven spielberg through and through when i first saw the film i had thought that spielberg had risen above the many poor works of his past but i was dead wrongsteven spielberg is a master at pulling the wool over the eyes over his momentous audience he made many of us feel that we really needed another epic wwii film such as what he has created he has done the same thing with other films such as schindlers list and amistad while i admire schindlers list for its historical merits and its importance of topic i hardly regard it as the high form of cinematic art that so many have claimed it to be my opinion of does not change too much from thisthe film does nothing to add to the war genre much of it is a regeneration of older and much better war films not only this blatantly contradicts itself the film is obviously meant to be perceived as an antiwar film i suspect that spielberg would not have filmed the opening battle scene in the manner he did if it wasnt no doubt most people will see this as an antiwar film but is it really i think not if a film is to be truly antwar then there can be no redeeming qualities of war this means that war can not be seen as heroic or patriotic how many times was there a flash of the american flag over the entirety to the screen i can not remember but if it was five then it was five too many there is an overwhelming question in the film was it really worth it to go to the trouble of matt damon of course in light of the fact that the majority of the hollywood audience is intolerant of ambiguity they answer this question john miller tom hanks is to be seen as an american hero for the mission that he and his squad accomplished this does not sound like antiwar to me in great war films like paths of glory and full metal jacket there are no heroes that transpire from battle at the end there are no redeeming qualities illustrated at all in these films war is depicted as ugly inhumane alienating and just plain wrongthe opening battle sequence which lasts for about 30 minutes is wonderful in its brutal realism and its leads us into thinking that we are about to experience a truly harrowing war picture in fact this is one of the best sequences that i have seen on film and the movie is worth seeing just for the one scene we the audience really feel as if we are in the midst of this highly violent and bloody battle at normandy  the sound quality and the visuals are immaculate the camera seems to take on a role of its own it seems to be ducking behind objects to avoid being hit by bullets just as the rest of the soldiers are the entire scene is shot with the hand held camera with jerky and often disorienting movements adding to the chaos of the battleunfortunately the rest of isnt as well made as this first scene the battle scene near the end of the film feels like something out of an action movie it has the same effect as an action sequence from one of the die hard movies in that it thrills us with its fastpaced shootouts and numerous explosions i found myself not caring who was killed and who wasnt it felt like cartoon violence i enjoyed watching the sequence for this reason it came no where close to having the same impact as the opening battlewhile i recommend seeing for the technical merit of the opening battle problems continuously present themselves throughout the rest of the film it contradicts its antiwar presence the ending is summed up to nicely leaving the end more ambiguous would have been effective at least in terms of provoking thought my strongest objection to the film is its sinking to the level of an action picture at the climax this is not something that i wanted in a film of this scale leaps to a great start but ends up not having the endurance to make it to the finish line as a winner  out of ,reality
i highly recommend seeing this movie at the theatresthen seeing another movie after the first thirty minutes is over  the first thirty minutes was all of the balls that this movie had  after the grisly scene spielberg castrates this movie  the movie was too long for its own goodfirst the 20second intro and finale  these were the most emotional scenes of the whole movie  they brought tears to my eyes seeing all of the soldiers that died in the wars for this country  that is what the crosses were and it was in a national cemetary probably arlington  these were two of the three most sad moments of the moviesecond the thirtyminute dday battle  this was the other emotional moment of the movie  this is the only time that i disagree in that i thought that the movie was very realistic  i was depressed by it and saddened  especially when one soldier picks up his arm  the use of sound visuals and effects were outstanding for this portion of the movie  it depressed methird the rest of the movie  it sucked  i was bored to tears that is why it is depressing  i sat there and sat there and sat there waiting for something intellectual to come up and at least slap me  no i do not think that the dilemma of trying to rescue one soldier is intellectual i think it is stupid  it did not show any realities and i did not want to go along and it just was pure crap  this is very superficial and i felt that i should have probably cared about the people but i did not    this ruined the end of the movie because i was so bored that i did not notice the violence all that much in the last scene and was only a little moved by the crosses reappearingi give this movie a four because it did not try  it is just as fluffy as shakespeare in love which also did not deserve to win  i must highly recommend the thin red line because it makes you think for yourselves instead of trying to force you to think there  this is bad  cry  be happy  feel this  my response to these movies is im not stupid dont insult me  let me make my own judgement  if you want oscarcalibur movies go see elizabeth or the thin red line  also life is beautiful is really good,reality
when the other characters started talking about how tom hanks was an obscure guy and how insensitive he was i felt like they were explaining something the movie itself couldnt dothe first scene and the last are perfectly done technically really impressive not much more than that in the rest of the movie,reality
remember the heartrending scene in titanic where the mother is telling a story to her two doomed children in bed as the ship is going down if spielberg had made titanic we would have been treated to the sight of the mother and children sucking in salt water and slowly drowning and moviegoers would be saying well thats the way it really was why pull punches so in were subjected to people exploding and being decapitated as a substitute for real dramaspielberg personifies the philosophy if you can show it you must show it show it he does  the violence that is but if you really want to get an idea of why these men were able to rise to heroic levels or if you want to return to that time in our nations history and meet those people get to know and understand those people this just aint the moviebut if you want an incredible amount of action did any one soldier ever see so much action then this is the movie for you great special effects almost all of which were put to use showing how bullets penetrate bodies and rip limbs offrecommendation go rent the big red one made in 1980 it communicates the horror of war by humanizing the participants the closing scene showing the soldiers clearing out the remnants of a concentration camp is a miniature masterpiece and not one persons head has to explode to get us to understand the violence perpetrated by men against men,reality
with all the hype that this movie has gotten along with the critics raving that it is the greatest war movie ever made i simply had to add my twocentsoutside of the first 15 minutes which truly are incredible the movie is unoriginal and unconvincing i never felt that the really was a good reason for going after private bleachedteeththe tank battle towards the end was pretty good but for real wartime horror check out the german stalingradand as far as incredible wwii films go you simply cant live without having seen das boot,reality
honestly the most over rated movie  i waited and waited for a moment that justified the hype around this movie but it never came,reality
i love this movie but the first half hour disturbs me it has a dday recreation witharms and legs blown offa man holding onto his intestinespeople shot repeatedlyheads decapitated by missilesetcthis greatly shows the real horrors of war but its too much to take in it repeatedly gave vetrans ptsd they originally forgonemy first viewing of this was in 10th grade we were required to watch this in us history in the beginning of the year we had to sign a permission allowing us to see this and schindlers list it was depressing to see the d day sectioni asked my grandma why we have war in the 1st place to keep it short she said when countries attack us we cant just stand back and let it happen its sad but true and worth exposingi think its an important scene but it dint need to go on for 24 minutes other than that this is a great movie,reality
is a great war movie it is an intense drama that shows the honor bravery and horror of war it is a great story about a heroic journey drawing upon many different characters steven spielberg did a great job directing so beautifully shot and so much detail it has a incredible cast with great performances by tom hanks matt damon tom seizemore jeremy davis giovanni ribis vin disel and many others is a film that really got me interested in movies i still remember watching it in the theater when i was 15 it is one of the best war movies it also ties with schindlers list as steven spielberg best movies it is a great movie,reality
from the starting to the end its a movie you can not skip a moment of itbest and exemplary hand held shotnow days cinematographers should learn how and when to use the hand jerkwatching it makes me feel the whole story and scene and time not only the characters i watched it like more than 20 times and never got bored of it,reality
it has been some time since i have seen this and it certainly got the best of me stellar acting story direction set casting production etc the 10 stars is well deservedtom hanks is very believable and the cast is so large and filled with high quality people,reality

i first watched this movie years ago on german television and later in english on dvd and my perception of it changed quite a bid when i first watched it i was in a phase of looking for moral and bright heroes in movies this movie has none and it utterly disgusted me when i watched it again i saw something completely different i give this movie a rating which is far off from the majority but there are quite a few reasons for it 1 this is a war movie which wants to show the brutality and maybe senselessness of war in an authentic way the beginning scene is pretty good at that and is rightfully one of the most famous movie scenes of all times after that the movie completely falls apart the germans just become puppets which cant harm the heroes neither from perfect positions nor with 101 odds its absurd and worse than any 50s war movie i have ever seen even john rambo would laugh about this i would call it racism but then again spielberg made schindler so i guess despite him hating nazis and rightfully so he doesnt hate all germans 2 it really feels dated to me because of 1 since then band of brothers and letters from iwojima came out which are much better depictions of www and would deserve the rating this movie has things like the bullet going through the sniper vision are also extreme 90s cheese 3 on the other hand the acting is still great from many of the actors tom hanks just delivers he is the clich of the good man in a bad war being forced to do what he does but he really nails it as cringeworthy as this clich is i would say hanks does it best very good dialogue is good and characters act believable in the boundaries of the movie 4 action is also pretty decent if you like stuff blowing up its as good as it gets 5 my main problem i had watching it the first time still holds up the movie has insane moral values the german prisoner they dont shoot is betraying his promise later on and gets killed for that wtf its awful but whatever he is only one of quite a few germans they didnt have to kill but did the enemy in this movie are really not treated like humans this really is a weakness of the movie but i think most movie viewers dont even recognize that and that is a problem letters from iwojima is so much better final thoughts it really is the fury of the 1990s but much better acted with better dialogue and embarrassinglyfor fury better effects i still miss more modern stuff like portraying the enemy as humans and the vulnerability of everyone in the war only has that in the beach scene although the germans have no face their either,reality
i saw in a theatre in its first release and still watch it five or six times a year for all sorts of reasons eleven years later im starting to know more clearly what id like to say about this important filmfirst the mastery of cinematic technique shown by steven spielberg and his entire production crew is still exciting and moving to me a viewers sense of being on the normandy beach panicstricken in the thick of the chaotic energy has not been dissipated by ten years of other films computer effects and threesecond jump cuts the randomness of events on the beach and after is a kind of nightmare in a ruined pastoral landscape and clarifies each soldiers need to withdraw to a sense of what to do right now to stay alive  right up to the moment when the impulse to take care of a friend or a child overrules common sense and the discipline of selfpreservation second though im more saddened every year by the myopic focus on american mythmaking which mr spielberg embraced hes made a wholly selfcentred film about dday and a generation of moviegoers will never know from this movie that the british canadian australian and other allied troops were landing up and down the french coast at the same moment the canadians in fact advanced considerably farther inland than the americans that day under equally heavy fire tom hanks character mentions british field marshall bernard montgomery leading his troops toward germany ted dansons character says that guys overrated and hankss character says no argument from me thats the total mention of the allied participation in the invasion and montgomerys stature in defeating the germans in north africa a year earlier is erased for a whole generation of film goers even though his excellent leadership in north africa earned him command of the british troops on june 6th the omissions and flip judgments reflect badly on the scriptwriter and on mr spielberg third the halo of sanctity which this film bestows on the members of the special mission has become cloying the soldiers of this film seem to me to justify an american myth of charming immaturity and dodges completely the documented ways in which american soldiers unpreparedness during and after the invasion was an acknowledged problem during the last year of the war especially in the battle of the bulge when american troops collapsed in the face of the german attacks im realising that for me clashes seriously with the historical record and that in this sense its a meretricious fantasy however grippingly filmed ill still watch it and feel the adrenaline flow on the beach below the machinegun nest and in front of the bridge but i wont subscribe to the myths,reality
i do not see a whole lot of war movies but is definitely an exception this film simply has a fascinating plot and great dialogue between the soldiers the film tells the story of a group of soldiers who must find private james matt damon and send him home to his mother as she realizes that her three other sons were killed in battle the rest of the film deals with issues such as deciding whether saving a mans life is worth losing several lives of your own soldiers and to what extent one must be loyal to their given orders tom hanks could have and probably should have won an oscar for his role as he pulls off each scene amazingly well as usual the interactions between him and the soldiers especially private are perfectly done proof of spielbergs excellent directing what prevents the film from being entirely perfect is the overall lack of scenes with dialogue so much of the film at least 60 is made up of battle scenes although the depictions of war are very realistic and well done they tend to drag on too long its the dialogue scenes and the decisions the characters must make that make the film as great as it is but more of those scenes are needed to keep the audience engaged nevertheless an excellent depiction of war great direction and great acting make this a very monumental and interesting film definitely worthwhile and important to see12 out of ,reality
this movie starts and ends with the american flag this could be a sufficient analysis of the movie really its a quiteby hollywood well preserved myth that the dday has got any real historical meaning the thousenths americans and british that died on the shores of normandy should of course be remembered but historical facts should as well be remembered spielberg wants to show us how usa fought for freedom against fascist germany failing to even mention the victories of the sovietunion on the easter front in stalingrad a victory that by the way cost about 20 million russian deaths since they were fighting the majority of the german troops a movie about the history is never about the history its about the present day during the making of this film american airplanes where bombing civilians in jugoslavia of course they appointed milosevic to be the new hitler before it all started a little propaganda is never wrong take a good look on the movies about the world wars since the 40s there is a very distinguished change from time to time very much depending on what roll usa wishes to take in the world notice as well that there are no black people in the picture this is because it was forbidden for blacks and whites to be in the same plutoneexcuse my spelling until the 60swhen they needed black cannon fodder in vietnam thats a could way to fight fascism,reality
i guess you must have to be an american to really get and love this movie because its about american soldiers acting typically superheroic and everythingthe entire movie is based on a platoon of guys who get sent into the deep and dangerous territory behind enemy lines to save the private of the title of the filmapparently all his brothers have all been killed in the war so the government doesnt want their mother to lose her last son because it would be a huge public relations catastrophe so they send in a group of guys and risk a bunch of lives just to try to get this one specific soldier outi liked some of the combat scenes but mostly i was just bored and thought they were too obviously and deliberately trying to pull at heart strings and wave the us flag around,reality

compared to other wwii movies ive seen this one stands out the opening battle of omaha beach was intense it made me feel like id been there the closing battle was also frighteningly realistic the scene where the platoons respite is interrupted by the rumbling of tanks was whiteknuckle scary it wasnt entirely free from clichs the scene wheres mother is told about the news of her sons deaths was sad buta farm in the heartland it would have been more powerful if she lived on a city block in new york or san francisco i didnt like the scene where matt damons character is clutching his ankles and rocking while crying in the midst of battle i dont think many gis would do that it was also farfetched and inexplicable why the nazi soldier would descend a staircase and pass a cowering gi with nine yards of machine gun bullets draped over his shoulder without killing him in he midst of a desperate battle still the movie was a triumph,reality
i saw this movie yesterday and thought it was a poorly made movie there were few parts here and there which were truly touching and realistic but otherwise i did not enjoy the movie spielberg said he made this movie as a tribute to the soldiers who lost their lives he failed to deliver on that tribute for the great sacrifice we made for the freedom this was a halfhearted tribute tom hanks fails to deliver as a captain he is tom hanks all through the movie not capt john miller tom siezemore and edward burns steal the show matt damon had very small role i dont understand why would he worship just john miller and not others  does not make senseexcept dir wanted to add some emotion that was not build up i mean the two hardly knew each other just like the other soldiersalso it was insulting to see soldiers hang out like a bunch of highschool drop outs calling each other morons and so on did that sort of thing happen back in 1944  i dont know for sure but it surely does not fit into the scheme of thingsmay be i had too high an expectation from the movie in any case i would give it  out of  no oscar for spielberg supporting actor oscar for tom siezemore or edward burns or even the frightened kid would be good nominations,reality
i dont normally speak in superlatives but i honestly have never been more affected by a film than i was with i was near tears 5 minutes into the movieas the ramps on the landers dropped and wave after wave of allied troops were immediately cut down by german machinegunners i sat in horrified silence a single tear rolled down my cheek that tear was followed by a dozen others and as the terror continued in front of my unblinking eyes those dozen were joined by two dozen more i now understood  or at least had a better understanding of  why i never want to be involved in a warspielbergs reenactment of dday at omaha beach stands as one of the singlemost brilliant pieces of film ever shot it also shows cinematographer janusz kaminski and editor michael kahn to be two of the most inventive minds in their respective fields kaminskis shaky newsreelstyle handheld photography and pointofview shots and his willingness to use varying quality film stocks over and underexpose shots and play with film speeds provide the opening battle with a total lack of visual continuity which fits in perfectly with the confusion spielberg wanted to create and kahns editing progressed the film through that confusion making a story out of a mess of body parts and beautifully showing the push from the water to the ridge his brilliant work on captain millers tom hanks temporary deafness moments alone must have taken days if not weeksfor proof of the normandy scenes authenticity ask the veterans many sent spielberg kudos check the trivia link for this movie and many are known to have suffered horrible flashbacks after seeing this film thats proof enough for meoh yeahthe rest of the movie was pretty damn good as well i still wonder how this film ever lost the best picture oscar to shakespeare in love which will be forgotten in 2 years if it hasnt been forgotten alreadyone final note all those who complained about the mistaken identity of the old man in the opening scene you were not being tricked into thinking he was captain miller tom hanks if you were being tricked spielberg wouldve had a shot of captain millers eyes immediately following the extreme closeup of the old mans eyes instead we see the beach then a couple of shots of the landing craft making their way toward said beach wake up peoplethis was not meant to fool you you fooled yourselves95 out of 10 the half mark lost for the lack of representation of other allied nations uk and canada especially on dday and for ted danson,reality

this is the worst movie i have seen of tom hanks it was intolerably stupid and a pain to watchits a slow paced movie duration is longboringgggg scriptdont know why get 5 oscarsjust like everybody else i was amazed by the realism of the first 5 minutes once you get past the battle scenes theres not much to work with im glad people as manifest in the growing number of low reviews here are starting to realize thisthe dialogue sounds like it is cut out of newspaper articles which editorialize the mission its as though spielberg thought his audience was so stupid that the moral dilemma of the film had to be spelled out for them in detail,reality
i saw a very cheap dvd of the film going for sale so a friend persuaded me to buy it i have avoided since it came out i now know that i was totally right to avoid the film it is badly written badly directed but worst of all utterly boring previous knowledgeable posts have stated how inaccurate in almost all ways the film is this is a constant spielberg trait he never cares for accuracy or logic even within his own film universe he will do scenes just for the sake mainly of his great shots the times he has the men framed against a setting sun in silhouette just got tedious for years spielberg has been hailed by critics and public as this master film maker and story teller but in reality he probably has made only a couple of decent films his recent lincoln was an utter borewar horse just about got by one of his other traits is the constant intrusion of john williams music as in his other films the music is pretty incessant there were scenes of quiet dialogue where music comes in that was utterly over the top,reality

tells an interesting story the rescue of a young american soldier because his other brothers have died during the second world warbut this film seems too hudge  2 hours and 49 minutes for telling the story a great description of these first days of the allied troops in normandy and then the long research of the privatesteven spielberg could have made a shorter film about performances great names with good acting tom hanks matt damon tom sizemoreedward burns barry pepper gionani ribisi ted danson finally this film seems me quite overrated maybe because of the presence of these famous actors maybe for some dramatic sequences showing the difficulties of the disembarkation,reality

i remember watching this movie in theaters with my older brothers i was just 16 years old i was shocked scared and traumatized of the strong opening scene spielberg captures the harsh reality of war from begging to end with the strong sense of patriotism but with characters that show us that even war can brake the strongest men will when seeing those brothers of arms that we developed closed relationship can be gone in a matter of seconds the story takes place in the european theater of war a squad is tasked to recover pvt because the death of his brothers was reported to the same mother in which the army took notice and realize that her last baby boy is whats left of her lineage the sole survivor policy describes a set of regulations in the military of the united states that are designed to protect members of a family from the draft or from combat duty if they have already lost family members in military service wikipedia rod powers,reality

the disembark of normandy is a historic event feat that have been shown so many times by films that one would think nothing new could be said about it and indeed tales of horror brutality and merciless constitute the bulk of so many recent pictures dunkirk hacksaw ridge the pianisthowever it belongs to save private the honor of giving us the best 15 minutes of action that cinema as an art has ever produced we get to see american soldiers being torn apart by german fire a beach at normandy turned into hellunlike many other films of this type in which the plot is just something to get rid off because it bogs action down here theres a great story to be told its the story of private an american soldier who lost his brothers in war all of them which in the eyes of us hq gives him the right to win a ticket back home back to american whether thats fair or not is of course up to us to decide but what cannot be argue whats beyond dispute is the quality of this spielbergs all time classic and yes the american director as he often does slipped into sentiment at the end of the film but thats a sin im more than ready to forgive,reality
incredibly harrowing and unrelenting look at the horrors of war filmed with hand held cameras and using film stock and lenses that give it both a documentary and historical feel in an attempt to give the audience some sort of visceral impression of what it might have been like to be there on the beaches of normandy the audience is dragged right into the film and with only a few slow scenes you soon discover that three somewhat grueling hours have passedsome of the characters are somewhat cliched in that they are stereotypical for war movies which i think may be intentional on the part of spielberg to give more impact to his vision by making the characters familiar to the audience further it is also somewhat reminiscent of other recent war movies like platoon in it depictions of the horrors of war but i though it went even a step further in that it never tries to make the combat in any way poetic the music isnt used in the same way or does it rely on voice overs or any other cinematic tools to make the combat scenes any less horrifyingi found this to be perhaps tom hanks best performance and although he would nominated for an oscar he would not win perhaps his two fairly recent oscars had some effect the rest of the cast is uniformly strong and effective there are some great cameos and the film served to accelerate the careers of relative newcomers vin diesel barry pepper and edward burns as well as some of the other more experienced cast memberswhile i dont believe this was spielbergs best close encounters of the third kind schindlers list and he does use a few unnecessary directorial tricks this is still a really great film that should have won the oscar for best picture its not a film for the faint of heart but it is a very powerful film that effectively delivers the directors vision the film would secure spielberg an oscar for best director among its 5 wins and 11 nominations,reality

i would like to thank the spielberg to give us this masterpiece before 11 yearsfirst impression i get from this movie is the reality of how the war contains such a violent way from the first moments of the movie you can feel the blast of the war in your mind background events are always so much detailed as much as the movie you can think this a theater its the players are freeze but background decors are so much alive after i got stuck at that characters who are so special in their attributes amazed me however war is a such horrible idea joy the movie makes touched me at this moment never made you forgot the war is the wrong way to communicate if i dont say that i would be rude the 98s shoot style of film made it more unique i do not assume that you are able to record that movie in present daysthanks to the cinema,reality
is a nearly perfect war film about a group of soldiers trying to find another soldier who has orders to return home the story and the action are totally realistic and believablethe only drawback is the phony sentimentality that seems to be present in every spielberg film so this is no exception but here it is particularly wellhidden among all the action and chaos and great acting and even despite that one drawback everything else about the film more than makes up for it highly recommend,reality
considering the historical and true story nature of this film the hard hitting war combat scenes are a bit painful to bare essentially a slaughter beyond the tootrue scenes this is a fine movie,reality
after playing so many video games about ww2 it is incredible how the games capture only a piece of how ww2 was in comparison to this film which is incredibly accurate of how the soldiers had to deal with both the pain and torture of the war and mentally how it affected them as well there is a reason why this film is classed as a rated r filmthe plot follows a group of soldiers which are ordered to locate a private and return him home over the course of the film you see this band of soldiers form a bond between them to the point where you could class them as a band of brothers that help each other through the horrors they seesteven spielbergs directing of this film shows why he is a master in filmmaking if he didnt win that oscar for best director for this film it would be an absolute crime in my opinion i would class this film in the top 10s of imbd top 250 films not 27 to say that tom hanks who plays the lead role in the film did a brilliant role in portraying his character is a sheer understatement the emotion his character has during the film is easily seen and it hits you hardthe battles that the film shows is not shown as winning one town after another and moving on they are a much more accurate portrayal of the war by showing it as the soldiers winning it street by street with each one being as hard fought to gain as the last the way the towns are shown in this film being bombed and turned into just a pile of rubble is a great way of showing what the towns during ww2 were actually like the cinematography in this film is brilliant and the sound editing perfectly captures the fear that was felt in ww2to class this film as just a film about ww2 is incredibly wrong it is the closest depiction as to ww2 was actually like and the closest to the terror the soldiers had to face it is a masterpiece of a film,reality
well written and incredibly well shot one of the best war movies ive ever seen,reality
ww2 veterans were leaving the theater because it was so real,reality
one of the best war film ever made i had no idea this film was going to be so graphic but i still loved it,reality
my rate is between 7 and 8 but i decided to be 7 because of two reasons 1 personal  it was too long for me and 2  at the end it looks like american propaganda but the movie was good realistic brutal and honest i even felt sorry for some of the characters that were dead and i cried at the end,reality
great movie cannot say more just watch this one,reality
you will watch a real war movie violence at its peak and the actors are excellent,reality
good but not great ww2 film where the focus initially is the gore fest that was this sad true event if you want to see a better film check out schindlers list or the pianist,reality
the first landing battle was a realistic one the final battle was so magical that it even ended with a sense of the mist,reality
was a heartfelt explosive gritty and violent war film that just knew what exactly happened on the events of wwii for the american allies this movie was so forward so riveting and so disturbing that it really made me look at my own military career and see how far weve come hundreds of years later i cannot say that this film is inaccurate in anyway possible because it is just too accurate with the american men and women of the war i was pleasantly impressed by how realistic the soldiers were and how each one had this unique story behind their enlistment and prior life before deployment the story revolves around saving just one man but anyone can see the true reason behind that the movie was a huge success and i believe that reason was merely because of the fact that it truly acknowledges what happened to our soldiers and what they experienced overseas as a soldier this film speaks volumes and reaches miles to my heart it is truly the greatest war film you can ever indulge yourself in because of how immersive and honest it is even if its a violent gory film thats something people have to see to know just a percentage of what happens in combat and how it can change a man single handedly,reality
not only the best ww2 film just the best filmfantastic,reality
this movie despicts war in its purest form no one matters at war until it is over on this movie on the other hand we create affection towards some characters and every single death had a really powerful impact on mef the warf the people who support the war,reality
is a fictional film but has many aspects that are historically correct the most impactful moments of this movie is the composition scenery acting and direction is not only a good war movie its the best war movie created due to the composition scenery acting and direction steven spielbergs direction in this film is mind blowing as he uses many different aspects of point of view to change how the viewer feels during the moviethroughout the movie 2 brothers are killed on the beach another one killed somewhere else in the world the mother of these boys is to receive all three telegrams the same day captain john miller is to take a squadron and save the last brother and return him to his mother back in the us the fact they travel for town to town looking for him and always encountering a problem is what war is about you cant plan for everything they get caught off guard many times and experience losses the story is set to give a feeling of no rest during the film you can never relax it is always set to make you feel nervous and worried this film does an excellent job of showing the true harshness of war and it doesnt hold back on any aspect of just how brutal and terrifying war can bethe soldiers in this squadron showed great courage and bravery at many points in the film ranging from the beach to the towns occupied by germans many small things in the film mean a lot more once you finish the film understanding certain scenes takes a lot more effort to really see what its about for example the scene where the soldiers are counting dog tags in front of another group of soldiers walking by first seeing this scene might not make you think about much but as soon as wade says what the hell are you doing the whole god damn airborne is watching here you can clearly see how wade notices all these soldiers walking by are seeing the squadron counting dog tags of dead men there is at least hundreds of dog tags in the pile as well which shows how much this impacted the soldiers as they walked by several scenes can impact the viewer in many ways such as when they land on the beach and lots of men are slaughtered as soon as the doors open its a very tragic sight to see but it alters everyone who sees the movie also seeing how buildings have been destroyed in the small towns kind of gives you a perspective on how brutal war can be and how innocent lives are impacted by bombs gunfire and tanks buildings are decimated to the ground and are nothing but rubble in some of the townsmoving onto some of the acting tom hanks is a fantastic actor in this film and he has done many movies before with similar roles in this film he is a captain of his squadron and plays it off very well in this film he seems nervous at many points and does an excellent job of showing this he has had to act this way before in the movie captain phillips as he was captured in that film he had to act scared worried and shocked at many points in this movie he is able to accomplish the same task there are several other famous actors in this film who perform very well such as adam goldberg vin diesel matt damon edward burns and giovanni ribisi they all have very important roles in the film and do a fantastic job with it their roles range from soldiers to a medic to privatethe only minor flaw i can seem to find in this film is how the viewers can never relax during the film it always an ambush or a battle or a rescue mission the whole time when the fighting starts it doesnt seem to end this could be viewed as a good or bad thing in certain viewers eyes some people might love the action while others want to have some more back story before a battle commencesa big theme we see in this movie is sacrifice many things are sacrificed to save private ranging from soldiers lives to the extremely dangerous task the soldiers undertake of doing and to the soldiers who are going deep into german territory these men sacrifice a regular war to them going behind enemy lines to recover a man they have never met beforefinally this film is one of the greatest war movies of all time due to the composition scenery acting and direction everything about this film is perfect which is why the ratings speak for themselves i find very few people who dislike this movie for those who think spielberg had messed up on this film is nowhere close to what the rest of the world thinks the ratings are extremely high for critic and audience reviews and there is a reason for that,reality
great performances and gripping action sequences have maintained this film as one of the genredefining second world war films but as important as it was more modern films and series have eclipsed it in entertainment value as well as historical significance,reality
its an amazing war movie i watched in 1998 lots of good scene of action and drama too,reality
one of the best movie ive ever watch you feel the fear of movie,reality
this movie is a must watch for everyone the opening sequence is one of the best in cinema history and the end of the movie is dramatic and almost draws a tear to your eye characters are developed and as days pass you become more and more attached to these characters the large set pieces suspend belief by semiaccurately representing the visuals of the setting of actual wwii the filmography is great with amazing camera angles and techniques and graphic special effects is almost hyper realistic this movie is masterpiece filled with a great cast and spielberg gets everything he needed to make this movie great,reality
bravery courage and determination are some key terms that involve around this powerful look on the events during and after the normandy landings as to having a more complex plot is a story about the mission being a man if the soldiers think that going through terrible trouble is worth it then audiences will experience probably the most immersive look on the subject of war steven spielberg directs with the amount of direction a director needs to pull off a story about true horrific events before starting my first review i really want to put out on how powerful this movie was i was shocked surprised and interested all at the same time i give thanks to all of our soldiers who have fought to protect our country during the world wars the rest of the 20th century wars and even wars today without them protection wouldnt be seen throughout in our countryinvolves around captain john h miller tom hanks and his team of rangers during the normandy landings his team consisted of sergeant horvath tom sizemore private mellish adam goldberg private reiben edward burns private jackson barry pepper private caparzo vin diesel t4 medic wade giovanni ribisi and corporal upham jeremy davies they suddenly get into a task with the mission being only one man as to his three brothers being killed in action private matt damon is sentenced to return home however the war still isnt over while these group of rangers track down after the normandy landings danger still heads their way during the warcritically acclaimed is truly if not my favorite war movie of all time so far the scenery is real and spielbergs direction makes the movie even more powerful also this movie probably has got the most realistic representation of dday in 1944 the first 20 minutes of the movie is definitely not fun dont get me wrong that the rest of the movie is extremely intense and violent as well as to watching this movie i also found some form of messages soldiers even important characters throughout the film change in many ways it can come from whats really important through the eyes of an american soldier these soldiers stick together throughout the war but going behind enemy lines is different i give credit to the cast and crew for their amazing performances and work on this historically accurate world war ii picture i also give credit to janusz kaminski for his absolutely outstanding movie cinematography and to spielberg for his leading directioni give a 1010 for spielbergs outstanding direction the great performances from the cast and the stunning cinematography from kaminski the score including hymn to the fallen is also outstanding from john williams himself the whole war experience of dday was outstanding and accurate and again to the soldiers thank you so much for your servicewas nominated for 11 oscars including best picture best actor hanks best director spielberg best screenplay written directly for the screen best cinematography kaminski best art direction best sound best film editing best sound effects editing best makeup and for best original score it won for best director spielberg best cinematography kaminski best sound best film editing and for best sound effects editing,reality
the 90s is arguably the greatest decade for master filmmaker steven spielberg with possibly his three greatest films emerging from this era is one of these three films and once more shows spielbergs versatility as a directorconsists mostly of a constant use of steadicam shots which is these days often confused with shakycam when comparing saving privates camera movements to those of the modern action movies of today what stands out is that it is seemingly only used to heighten the immersion of the scene  unlike shakycam  for example if there is an explosion the camera will often move with the tremor of this and the same is true for heavy gunfire all of this makes the audience seemingly present in the inhuman war setting that is displayed and the result is that spr is undeniably one of the most realistic and immersive war films ever created this is why even though the camera is shaking a lot the situation is still clear and the audience doesnt miss a whole lot in the overview of the battles spr utilizes a lot of long takes that frequently differ from being a complete wideshot to a medium or a closeup which creates a great variety in shot compositions and the long takes ofcourse significantly increase the immersion as every little detail and every piece of movement is there in a single shot while not having to adjust to the new image of an edityet spr is not just a constant stream of chaos as there are also many reflecting scenes between the lines many of these calm moments between battle sequences such as the conversations at night in the church the discussions right before the final battle tom hankss speech after the bunker attack about his prior job result in a lot of fantastic characterization all of these conversations will significantly enhance the audiences connection with these characters as every one of the main characters in the spr squad is fleshed out and developed with all of them having defining traits such as millers shaking hands or jacksons kissing of the cross thus a lot of reason is given to care for the fates of these characters which ofcourse heightens the emotional core of this film to a high degreetom hanks is as usual once again brilliant as captain miller from the slow motion reflection scenes during battles to his conversations between them his acting is top notch and once again proves his versatility as an actor since he has played roles varying from a very low iq individual a loner on an island  a mobster with a lot of conviction be it tom sizemore barry pepper matt damon or edward burns there is not a single unconvincing acting performance in the film the dialogue is ofcourse also a fantastic addition  particularly the lincoln quote  to a good script john williamss score is superb and is one of the most american sounding scores ever created for a film which makes you wonder if any other movie score could ever be more fitting to the subject in questionwith all its technical marvels in the use of the camerawork there is also a fantastic use of sound and the battle sequences always feature bombastic sound effects which are usually pitched higher than conversations to truly make the audience hear the terror of wwii the sound of bombs or gunfire is as terrifying as possibly in spr which truly makes the audience feel as if they were there with the characters even after all this mayhem the film still feels as if you are going through hell which is ofcourse an extraordinary feat for a film so heavily reliant on extended battle sequencesis a rare example of an action filled antiwar statement and spielbergs impeccable direction allows the audience to live and breathe the experience of it all the while there is also a lot of characterization going on that makes the audience care significantly about what happens to the main characters,reality
fantastic story  great screen play  beautiful direction and commendable work by the actors  the movie really take us to the war,reality
unfortunately a little too many historic inaccuracies to swallow and the all too tiresome portrayal of the germans as idiotic and ineffective waffen ss and wehrmacht soldiers almost never wore skinhead haircut tank attacks were not performed as portrayed in the bridge scene weaponry of late waffen ss units were almost certainly different from those portrayed in the movie wehrmacht and warren ss units rarely mixed most likely the airborne soldiers should have encountered hitler jugend units aged 1721 that were exceptionally disciplined albeit very willing to sacrifice their livessad that hollywood always has to obfuscate reality fake history,reality
the film is unbelievably good with lots of action and amazing plot would recommend to all viewers,reality
is a solid war film with a quality story and a good lead in hanksone thing you could always count on in spielberg films is quality characters but that isnt the case here hanks carries the film and while ribisi sizemore and damons characters are good many others are not in particular jeremy daviess character corporal upham is downright awful not only that but action sequences are lost to this characters perspective hindering the film the action sequences not containing upham are of quality and the opening and ending moments of elderly are heartfelt faltering in the inbetween moments but hanks carries it through the scene with the three medics including ribisi surrounding a wounded soldier is just hilarious the idea of three men attending to one man who is wounded and not fighting is ludicrous but then for the wounded guy to get shot more while theyre attending to him cracks me up medic wade just give us a fn chance you son of a b,reality
perhaps saving privates greatest compliment comes from the extraordinary individuals who were actually there on d day many documentaries and articles since the films release tell of the veterans who praise the film for its realism the praise may not be always positive if that is possible the film brought back memories for those of the hell that they carry around with them everydayone conclusion can be made is that spielberg crafted a war movie the likes the world had never seen before the opening thirty minutes of this film are probably the most effective that i have ever witnessed as a college student at the time of this movies release i wasnt prepared for the audiovisual onslaught that i was about to experience naively i believed that i was off to see another gungho war movie like the ones stallone and arnie regularly churned out boy did i get educated that day i went into the screening with an immature view on the world and left with a deep appreciation for the men and women who gave their lives so i can enjoy the freedoms i take for granted i honestly can say i wanted to hug the nearest veteran and thank them thank them for the world we are able to enjoy todaytells the story of a group of men soldiers who risk their collective lives to save just one private james played by matt damon a young man who has just lost his brothers to the war that surrounds him the mission is simple get him home no mother should have to lose three sons the story reminds us of the importance of a single life and our duty to do something with it while we have the chance spielbergs film is wonderfully crafted if it looks impressive it sounds even more so the immersive experience was new at the time of release never had surround sound been so effective every bullet every grain of dirt could be heard and almost felt if the films production values are stellar then the performances by the cast outshines every single performance is oscar worthy especially lead actor tom hanks who has never been better the range he displayed here was exceptional both physically and emotionally hanks pours everything into the role of captain miller hes no war machine hes not built for war like the fictional characters of rambo and arnies commando hes an ordinary man a man molded by war adapted by it so he can survive and return home to his wife one of the movies intriguing plot points is the fact that millers brothers in arms have no clue to his occupation back in the world before war a reminder to us all that the world was made a better place by real people not superheroes or fictional one man war machines saving may be a piece of fiction but it is founded on true events events that changed the way our world turns no number of school lectures could have educated me more on the reality of war than the first thirty minutes of this film,reality
it gives a million reason why no one should go to war and one very powerful reason to go to war it is a soul numbing realistic depiction of what our grandfathers fathers uncles brothers and sons have faced in humanities darkest moments not just in wwii but in any war no one can see this movies without being altered in some way no one should miss it with the exception of those war veterans that have already been there the surround sound puts the audience in the middle of the battle steven spielberg has out done himself and effectively held up a mirror to civilization for events to which we should all be ashamed of rather than appalled at the movie for its real life depictions i suggest that this movie be made standard view for congress as well as the president each and every time the question of war comes up this movie would not stop future wars but i would hope the objectives would be much more clearly defined i say this as a us marine,reality
the opening beach assault sequences were the most violent realistic and upsetting filming ive ever seen looked as though the thing was actual combat footage the shushing noises of rounds cutting through the air was the most chilling part of all perfect portrayal of the insane stupidity of war and the anguish of all who enter this most foolish of enterprises a must see,reality
schindlers list is one of the most critically acclaimed films in the 1990s this steven spielberg historical movie based on the life of oskar schindler an ethnic german businessman who saved the lives of more than a thousand mostly polishjewish refugees during the holocaust by employing them in his factories for stern a job in a warrelated plant could mean survival for himself and the other jews working yidioo my name and site,reality
this movie possibly has the best opening war scene anyone has ever seen and i dont mean in the gloried type of way it to me brings the reality of war and gut wrenching anxiety of being truly in the face of life and death raising questions of why are we even going to war at least i picked up on some of this i like the subtle touches such as the czech soldiers on omaha beach that seemed liked germans are actually saying we are not german and get shot anyway this moment encapsulates the chaos and revenge of war i cant understand how these men in real life got through this experience i truly dontif i had to give an negative aspects to the review id say it has a sense of dragging on around the end of the middle before the last act but i dont mind it because it also gives you the sense of the never ending insanity that is war beautiful movie in my eyes,reality
the battles inside normandy were small actions town to town street to street house to house small actions like taking the radar station happened small actions like a handful of men defending a river bridge against odds happened small squads of men formed out of the misdrops banded together ad hoc to fight there were all enlisted groups and all officer groups a general did die in the glider assault fubar aptly described much of what happened that dayand there were only americans in the movie because the brits and canadians were many klicks away in a different area this was omaha beach the story was an american one and monty did bog down the advance and everyone knew it and as for american stereotypes well those pretty much define america my college roomie was a wiseass new york jew my best friend was a second generation east coast sicilian my college girlfriend was a third generation german my first wife was french and english im irish my boss is norwegian and i work with a navaho you get the pointso much for it being bad history it was in fact an excellent way to let a jaded and somewhat ignorantoftheirpast generation feel something of what their grandparents living grandparents went through it is perhaps less important that the details be exact as the feel be right even now the details are not fully known or knowable about that campaign it was too big too complex and too chaotic to be knowable there is not even an accurate casualty count of d day itselfnow as to the depth of characters what i saw there was the extraordinary circumstances into which ordinary people were thrown and what happened to them i saw the things that would mark a generation i have heard in my elderly male patients sentiments similar to what cpt miller was expressing when he announced his ordinariness i saw the dehumanization that occurs with war and its mitigation moment to moment man to man cpt miller didnt know anything about and he didnt care until revealed his humanity to him with his story of his brothers pvt reiban was ready to walk out of the situation until he discoverd his captains ordinariness and his humanity then he began to look to him almost as a father pvt mellish rightfully delights in his revenge for all the times hes had to take it because he was jewish by telling german captives hes juden nerdish cpl upham can stand alongside his bigger stronger braver ranger compatriots and describe the poetry and melancholy of edith piafs song then face his cowardice turn around and stand up in the face of danger and finally demonstrate the dehumanization of the enterprise he was enmeshed in by executing steamboat willie even though willie had no more choice about being there than upham did and in other circumstances would have made a friend,reality
there is a lot of war movies but this one can deeply touch your soul great actor like tom hank and matt damon which is my favorite totally nailed it i hope hollywood can make more movies like this one however thanks to the director steven spielberg who is everyone knows one of the greatest director of all time,reality
is a movie about the wwii three soldiers called three brothers died during the normandie landing or after in new guine the last brother is missing so one company of soldiers leaves to look for him we find that this film is beautiful and sensitive the opening scene is very emotional and the viewver is touched by the odl man and its partly based on the true storywe think that its very patriotic its sometimes flagwaving with the mother for example,reality

when most people talk about this movie they usually refer to the violence the extent of the violence portrayed at the beginning of the movie was enough to attract an r rating though this was lowered to an ma rating because of the purpose of the violence when i spoke to people about it they seem to dwell upon this point and even talked about the images that went through their minds when they went to sleep and woke up the image that went through my mind was that of the soldiers under water getting struck by the bulletsthe movie opens with the landing at normandy and graphically shows the horror of this beachhead this part of the movie i thought was the best part because it really draws out the horror futility and waste of war people were getting healed only to be shot and the bloodbath was intense the impact of this scene was even greater when three brothers in three different locations are killed and their mother is due to receive notice of their death on the same day thus the decision is made that they must travel into france and rescue private joe a paratrooper who was misdroppedthe major theme in this movie is the horror of war and this is picked up at the beginning and the whole goal mother is devastated because three of her sons are dead and thus the us army chooses to rescue the forth son because the war has had a great impact on her already and they decide that they need to comfort her by returning to her her only sonyet there is a purpose behind this war and even though we look at the immense waste especially in the beginning we are reminded through the rest of the movie that the cause they are fighting for is just they are fighting an oppressive power that intends to enslave the world and as such they are fighting for a noble cause even though the cause may be noble we are reminded that this war brought about an immense waste of lifethe violence was graphic at the beginning but as the movie draws near to the end the violence becomes more glorified the scene that comes to mind is when the soldiers on the tank are shot to pieces with the chaingun this scene though graphic and probably realistic is still to me glorifiedpurpose is another theme in this movie the purpose of the mission is to rescue one young man and throughout the mission they are complaining that they are not helping the war progress tom hanks talks about how when he loses a man he thinks of the thousands of lives that he has saved but there is an ominous feeling that there is no point to this mission but to save a pathetic little kid thus it is ironic that when they do find private he refuses to leave his post because they hold one of the only two bridges that rommel can bring his tanks across to repel the allied landingssalvation is another theme that runs through this movie unfortunately it is salvation by works when is saved hanks says to him earn it suggesting that he must now pay back in good deeds for what hanks has done for him then fifty years later he asks his wife in front of a large family if he has been good to which his wife replies yes this i feel is quite irritating because it suggests that we can earn our salvation which is not possible paying back bad deeds with good is like paying off a loan with a credit card it simply gets you nowhere our sin is so bad and twisted that there is no way we can earn our way into gods good books instead we must rely upon what he has done for us and that is punished his son jesus instead of us and by trusting this we will be forgiven for what we have donei think has a lot of potential but unfortunately it falls down in a number of places i found that the end was very disappointing especially when it seemed to be building up to some very thought provoking ends steven spielburg has the potential to make to earth shattering movies but he seems to always fall back onto hollywood sensationalismthe low rating was on the principle that it won too many oscars taking them away from movies that really deserved them,reality
yes this is a great war film and as i have already said before again and again there will be a before and after speaking of visual grammar hard boiled and realistic at the most battle sequences any movie made after this feature any movie around the world russian korean british any movie was inspired by this one but besides this side private remains very classical in the meaning you find here the good us soldiers vs the ugly german ones ok us troopers saved us the french but in war there is not good soldiers and evil ones the scheme is more complex i prefer the tv show made several years after private band of brothers more accurate in the meaning where we watch for instance gis shooting german soldiers who surrender in private we dont see this as far as i remember even just after the meat chopper utah beach landing when only one percent of us troopers reached the beach hotel i dont remember a sequence where those same soldiers shoot german ones who surrender and this actually happened anyone who survived the omaha beach hell would have done the same and me firstalthoug some days after in the middle of the woodland fights in the deep normandy countryside the same scene would not have been less understandable in resume private remains a great film but i prefer the victors a very different movie yes but thats the way it is,reality
is a film best appreciated by the action scene enthusiast flawless detail and fantastic direction particularly in the notorious opening scene combine to reach a superb portrayal of world war 2s normandy landing normally i wouldnt enthuse with action scenes but in this film they are as simultaneously delicate and brutal as an audience could wish forother than that the film is one dimensional there is no real storyline it would not be a spoiler to summarise the plot as boys brothers die men go to find him because that the entire progression of a 3 hour film without the acting of tom hanks who just about propels the plot into something worthwhile but even after mr hanks you are left at the end with the feeling that you have missed a none existent development in a film that could do with onenot the film of a motion picture aficionado yet a film not to be missed despite its limitations,reality
its hard to criticize good intentions to make a war movie about d day but the violence was horrible and it was too close up in the end it didnt give a good picture of the landings just too much close up carnage with the bullets and the blood the german killing the soldier slowly at the end is just too muchthe story to find private is kind of irritating and its just such a waste of effort  so many for 1 personthe acting is alright although tom hanks looks like hed rather be elsewhere and matt damon is a bit too perkygive me a war movie from the 50s to 80s instead over this any day this one leaves you with a sick feeling,reality
the production of this movie is epic its hard to believe that it was made on 70 million dollars but that was 15 years ago the story is unusual in that us military goes out of its way to extricate a certain private from the battle field at any cost because his family has lost 3 brothers to war already it sends in a squad of infantry men into normandy to find and save private while the intent is noble the wisdom doesnt make much sense if dies thats only one man but the entire squadron is under danger of losing their lives in the attemptthis movie could have been 30  60 minutes shorter and would have been better focused some of the battle ground scenes are the most realistic ever caught on filmthe movie leaves you feeling somewhat empty because of the foolish nature of the war and a human drama that at its core doesnt make much sense like in lifeguard course we learn that if the rescue is too dangerous its ok to abandon rescue because one dead person is better than a two dead people the militarys decision in this movie totally goes against this wisdomyou be the judge of the outcome,reality
i had never seen this film until about 3 months ago ive been recently going through a list of movies that everyone seems to rave about and this was number one before i tell you my number one and only problem with this film i must say the acting and the story line along with the special effects are excellent a very well cast crew really now my number one problem was the amount of gore im fairly strong stomached when it come to violence in movies but this was confronting to say the least i think that if the movie had what we australians call m15 it would have been a much better movie the storyline and characters where so strong that the violence for me cheapens the movie more a kin to a b grade horror movie prehaps im just soft but i would prefer not to see this movie again which is a shame,reality
opening sequence sets the bar high for the rest of the movie but the standard of historical accuracy and sometimes brutal realism is well maintained throughout while battle and war scenes are woven between short albeit relieving breaks involving the less gruesome aspects of the conflict such as music from the time and stories of home and backgrounds which add to the feasibility of the plot and make the characters more dynamic though some might find the extensive and intense gore too prevalent to me it exhibits the true cost and effect of war that is generally left out of lesser filmsethan hinch is wrong steamboat willie german and the german who kills mellish are differentlinkhttpwwwsproecomssteamboatcomparisonhtml,reality

this film dont talk of massacre of americans in the world shame hiroshima and nagasaki scream beautiful film as to the usual one the usual negative comments which sure heros that this film had to have a judgment in this site in fact reviewers good part has put a high vote to the previous episodes because this contrast i know the reason since assumptive reviewers good part favorably sees the past and as the past is better than the present they have given several credit to the preceding episodes being still the last episode more explosive and spectacular at this point should reject also the old episodes but there are here two weights and two measurein fact also cinema masterpieces have been criticized and denigrated good part some reviewers of this site belong to the very bad reviewers better think separately with its head,reality
where i wont deny that it is a overall well made movie i cant give it the acclaim it seems to have gotten from antiwar people gushing over its so called message to me it was way too in your face about its antiwar message its like it was shoved down your throat and most of the movie leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth the violence however realistic is gratuitous and for me personally takes away from the message of the movie the premise and execution is also to me nothing special its everyones vision of an american war tragedy it brings nothing special or eloquent to the table for me either i feel that hollywood only seems to know how to communicate messages by going way over the top its like they dont seem to appreciate the value of subtly or think people cant comprehend the message unless you have a 20 minute scene of soldiers being blown to bits you dont have to hit someone with a sledgehammer to get their attention and if thats the audience you are going for then it doesnt speak well of the intellectual value of the movie in the first place i feel like the masses that will go on and on about how great this movie is are the people who only frequent the usual blockbusters and dont have especially high expectations in the first place to me it lacked a lot of valuable things that would have made it a truly great story but i will say it will most likely not disappoint your average viewer,reality
i found this movie highly disappointing i was expecting something different well if you like special effects then you will definitely enjoy it but if not and that is my case i have to admit you will most likely find it boring and too long the first thirty minutes of the movie are just a huge display of special effects showing the development of one of the most important battles during the ii ww yes it is very wellmade but this half an hour doesnt add anything at all to the movie i am still wondering what is the goal of so much time devoted to that battle i think the best answer is an excuse for displaying all the special effects once those minutes had finished i hoped the rest of the movie would be something different and it looked like that was going to happen but not for a lot of time when something interesting was finally going on and there were some interesting dialogs once again the same more shooting more noise and more deaths anyway my vote was a 7 apart from all those long unnecessary scenes the movie is quite good some interesting dialogs as i said an interesting plot and above all some great performances especially from tom hanks,reality
i think the movie was good i did but the problem came at the very end where you see standing at the graveyard and then the stars and stripes in the background i think it was to much it is too patriotic and it was saying war is horrible we know but you do it for your country and we will remember you the problem is you wont and that is why i think if he had kept the style about war being a bad thing it would help us realize that we must seek peace instead of warfare so that you will not end up crying on a battlefield with your best friend in your armssren iversen 16 yo denmark,reality
after years of avoiding i finally got around to viewing spr considering the hypei was expecting greatnessi gota 3 hr rehashing of schindlers list masquerading as an actionflickthough not the worst film or the worst wwii movie it certainly is among the most overrated the dday landing sequence is horrific riveting and emotionally numbing a true landmark in filmmaking realisticwouldnt knowwasnt theremy uncle was and from certain things he spoke ofseems fairly accurate then theres the rest of the moviethere are plenty of reviews pointing out historical tactical writing acting and directing flaws thats all minor stuff hardly worth mentioningi can overlook a lot of warts when im in love i couldnt even build up a mild affection for this film after numerous sacrifices by much worthier individuals the only people who survive are the most undeserving selfabsorbed venal and craven of the characters in the film then after living an apparently good lifesurrounded as he is by loving family members not even the title character can justify those sacrifices on his behalf as for the typistis everyone insane or just daft he shoots the german to cover up his cowardice not because he finds his inner rambodeep maybe for a mud puddle according to spr the great generation was so because of the sacrifices of their betters and their own need to live up to the implied expectations of those sacrifices how droll if you want a great war movie there are manya bridge too far gallipoli the big red one tora tora tora all quiet on the western front das boot bridge over the river kwaithese are all way better movies and none of them could be classified as drollgo watch one or all you wont be sorry,reality
okay i think there might be something wrong with me because im the only one who seems not to like this movie but i have my reasonsfirst of all this movie seems a bit contradictory in its message is it supposed to be antiwar or are we supposed to be cheering at the gore speaking of gore they wasted it all in the first battle of the film which is also the first scene after the prologue scene no good storyteller does that since the most graphic images were at the beginning most everything else seemed tame in comparisonsecondly this really isnt spielbergs best film at all it moves very slowly and is full of scenes that try to build characterization but somehow manage to seem sappy ill give him and the screenwriter credit for trying howeveralso this is possibly john williams worst movie score ever the music is the kind you can find in any war movieits sort of cheesy and not at all amazing like many of his other workslastly this movie simply does not move maybe it was just me but it didnt evoke much of an emotional reaction out of me and im normally quite an emotional moviegoertom hanks did a very good acting job and the others did okay but too many of the lines were whispered or at too low a volumemaybe its just me but this movie didnt move510,reality
i love but i just dont know how rewatchable it is i am a total wwii movie nut and this is one of the best but i truly hate the ending i feel it is left ambiguous and it truly puts matt damons character in lose lose situation i dont want to give anything away but i feel what hanks character said was not positive or constructive even if it was meant to be other than that this movie kicks butt it has some of the best war scenes i have ever seen its depiction of normandy and hellish persona taken on by the invading american troops is both moving and humbling the character development is something to truly watch as well the way we are slowly informed of each characters past and the timeliness or untimeliness of each death that occurs just sinks into you and helps to tell a true tale of heroism and mortality very well written very well filmed very well acted,reality
how lovely a us platoon must risk itself in order to find pvt his brothers all died in the war all within days he is the only one left so the us army decides to save him problem is in all the confusion after the invasion on 6 june 1944 they dont really know where he is so a platoon is assembled under tom hanks and off they go the special effects are great the siting of the german machine guns was not historical in reality they were off to the sides of the beaches and their fire hit the pbi poor bloody infantry from the side as they advanced also it took more than a wad of bubble gum on the end of a bayonet to breach the defences in actual fact some destroyers almost beached themselves to fire point blank into the defences anyway another bug is that the waffen ss 2nd division is depicted as the attacking enemy in the films climax in reality they didnt arrive in normandy for quite some time with all the historical flaws one can be forgiven after all this is a movie if you want an historical film on d day see the longest day if you want a more believable war film in general see the thin red line cross of iron or stalingrad,reality
will certainly be a film wellremembered for generations to come but why perhaps because it took place during a crucial stretch of such an important conflict perhaps because it was so gory perhaps because tom hanks was in it who really knowsi like this film quite a bit i sure as hell have never been in combat but im sure this film paints a fairly realistic picture of it if that opening footage of the normandy invasion doesnt stick with you nothing will talk about balls charging onto that beach when i see these old timers that took part in this war i always think of that scene and wonder if that person was there or not but overall this film works best as an action film it really does i didnt connect on a personal level with any of these major characters maybe i wasnt supposed to maybe these characters were supposed to be just a metaphor for average joes from all over the usa you have the jewish guy the hick who prays before he shoots the toughtalking guy from brooklyn and the ambiguously ethnic guy vin diesel to name but a few i just didnt get choked up when any of them died except maybe that poor little medic who died about halfway through that was truly a sad scenewhat i liked the most were the gun fights they were truly exciting at times i expected ahnold or someone to join in the fray this action was compelling but i think it robbed from the dramatic angle somewhat the battle to take that bridge at the end was outstandingthis is a very good film to be sure and it pays a fine tribute to the americans who died in wwii if nothing else its a hell of a lot better than the thin red line that film is awful it is an insult to those like my grandfather who served in the pacific way too artsy to be taken seriouslygets a solid 9 of 10 starsso sayeth the hound,reality
i am tempted to trash this movie because of all the pathetic ratings claiming this to be the best war movie of all time it is actually pretty good typical spielberg massmarket melodrama and yes with an appallingly onesided perspectivebut you have seen it already right before getting all emotional think about the farfetched premise of the movie and dont say it was based on a real story the sullivan brothers story is different after the first line the silly fight between the previously released diabolical german and the jewish us soldier etcthen go see some other good war films gallipoli and das boot are among my favorites if you are objective and over 18 my guess is you will agree that spr will not stand the test of time,reality
the only good thing about this film is the realistic depiction of the landing even that though comes off as patchy and episodic you arent really left with a good sense of what happened when you consider corneliuss book about dday this is the polar opposite there are no details one minute you see people being blown up and floating in the water then people getting their guts blown out on the beach then the tanks are moving inlandactually to me this film continues to have a core strength that is very interesting very far into the film when i saw it i was realizing that the ending was coming and i didnt hate it yet and was frankly amazed but then all the cheese i expected of the spielberghanks combo came out with a vengeance in the finale steven spielberg is a hackneyed stooge hes lucky that he came up at the same time that the movies were turning into titilation machines hed have starved in the 40s five minutes of orson welles worst film make his career look like a joke,reality
this movie drags and drags and drags and drags it is too much about the war and the people and does not have enough action in it i almost fell asleep in behind enemy lines owen wilsons character is funny and he shoots stuff and the special effects are outstanding this movie is sort of dark at times on the screen and its hard to see sometimes the beginning part was too bloody and i dont think that the is appropriate for some people because it grossed me out tom hanks isnt very good in this movie he seems like he doesnt even care about the movie i would of cast owen wilson in the lead role and if not i would of tried to get dennis quaid this movie was dissapointing and boring see behind enemy lines instead,reality
does anyone remember seeing for the first time  when it opened in summer 1998  before all those good reviews and history teachers guilted you into watching it  before it lost best picture to shakespeare in lovemost people i think dont  so much praise was heaped on this film on its initial release and so much outrage was expressed when it was passed over in favor of shakespeare in love its hard to enter this movie clean and with a fresh mind  it always surprises me when a fellow movie buff calls overrated and i cant help but think that theyre judging this movie on its reputation rather than its qualityyet watch without the critical baggage this is truly a great film  the muchdiscussed stunning opening and it is stunning is followed by a war narrative thats every bit as good as schindlers list anyone with a soul should have a powerful response to this movie and positive or negative there is little denying it is a testament to the profundity of cinema,reality
how some people can be ignorant i have no problemwell i admit i have some problem with people who dislike great films because the films did nothing for them i have an incredible lack of patience with people who dislike something and believe their lousy opinion actually means something i love film and i watch great films and i have at least as much love for real movies as anyone here or anywhere else and when i watch something that affects me like this then its a real movie i saw this film twice in theaters and each time i missed the first 510 minutes i missed the man in the beginning and i missed the beginning of the best war footage ever shotby far the scenes in platoon and the helicopter scene in apocalypse now cannot even live up to this and those are among the greatest of all films this film is an absolute masterpiece i rented the film when it came out and ive owned for a few yearsvery few films have ever had the effect on me that this it is one of the very best films ever made it devastates me every time and i have to say i have an incredible incredible dislike for people who think they know about films these arthouse freaks get to meand i can be an arthouse guy myself when they not only dislike a film but when they try but without knowing it fail to take away from the meaning of the film for the people who were impacted by it this isnt some dumb sellout movie this is not the linkin park of movies sorry to burst your bubbles wannabe film buffs but spielberg is along with scorsese as good as it getsbottom lineif you dont feel the same way about his work then i apologize because you are really missing out spielberg may be the most popular and most amount grossing interesting use of words of alltime but he is a genius and the other geniusesscorsese kubrick coppola fellini leone eastwood stone lee etc etc feel the same way about him so all you fools who not only dislike stevens work but label it as popular nonsense go tell the directors you admire that one of their great heroes of the cinema is nothing but a joke i always wonder how people will respond to that someone is gonna tell me they dont care what anyone else thinks its their opinionopinions are stupid,reality

i dare you to find a better war film than this it is the most historically accurate war movie there has been the cast is top notch with some of the biggest names taking all the parts providing the best mix of people becoming a new family on the battle field the plot is as real to life as any the reactions potrayed by each actor to the near pointless mission they are sent on shows the contrast between the people sent to war yet they all pull together and march to the beat of the drummerto sum up watch this film if there was a list of film that had to be watched before you die this would be number 1 on my list,reality
devastation  there are many things that can and will devastate a person in his or her life akin to the devastation of this movie going experience in a darkened theatre is the devastation of its lack of power its lack of damaging its lack of emotionally caving power to destroy me on home video releasein a darkened theatre my heart wept for every living man who had to fight in any war of any year in the existence of this world the horror and the hollowvacuum that my heart was drenched and sucked into during the first quarter of this film was unlike anything that had ever become of me the experience was in fact so upsetting and demanding of my soul that i repeated it  once again on my own and once more with a friend and the beginning that beginning beatmy heart faster as it crept into the cut to the past to the horror the second viewing and once again the third viewing at this point this movie was the only movie and it stuck with me and moved me so much that it was at this point the most amazing thing i had ever witnessedso why is it no longer even close to meaning as much to mein a darkened living room as it crept into the cut my heart barely beat a beat faster  at home in comfort perhaps this movie did nothing  and becamenothing more than a spielberg movie with tom hanks trying to save mattdamon all i could think was how how could this be released onto video into thecomfort of homes the comfort of bedrooms releasing this on video hasdestroyed the movie i only pray that one day i will own enough equipment to bring the heart out of the magnetic tape out of the glossy dvd bring the pain beyond tom hanks face beyond john williams music  and once again watchthe ghost of a battle that terrified and took so many lives as it once destroyed me in that darkened theatre,reality
i didnt see tom hanks as being able to carry this role well so i chose not to see this film until it was released on video  i wish now i had seen it on the big screen the atmospherics and realism i guess of the battle scenes omaha beach was mesmorising and not equalled by other recent war films and surprisingly for me i felt that hanks carried the role well  with another fine performance by tom sizemore,reality
tom hanks is the best what a great movie this was a truly emotional and breathtaking movie i really enjoyed this the music blended in greatly with the movie which made it even more enjoyable this is probably the best war movie ever made and no other war movie which will be made in the future can surpass this highly recommended movie,reality
this truly is the greatest war movie ever i wish i could vote higher than 10 for this one the first 20 minutes of this movie is so intense it almost has to be viewed on the big screen to fully appreciate it awesome,reality

no doubt about it im a big fan of  in my humble opinion those who dont appreciate this movie are a bit too nitpicky some say it is an antiwar movie  others call it flag waving bllsht in truth i dont think the film was trying to be either although you could feel the respect spielberg has towards military veterans  also just because the movie doesnt portray everything exactly like it happened doesnt mean it lacks realism  i believe most people who saw the movie could relate to the characters and their displays of emotion  you could feel the fear in the battle scenes the grief whens mother fell to the porch after seeing the chaplain get out of the car  you could relate to the homesickness of the troops who had gone months if not years away from home fighting a war on foreign soil  i have never seen another movie that had as large of an emotional impact on me as this one did  the thin red line doesnt even come close,reality
im stuck in norway at the moment these people just cant stop being ironic and ignorant and poppin my chops over the gulf war luckily there was an article the other day about fine t3 model chick kristanna loken and how she has a couple norwegian roots this was able to steal the wars attentionanyway the question is after all the american war movies that have been coming out how can you blame em for this antiamerica world cop crapsome are just action movies in disguise searching for reason and realism others are more serious and want to show us that war sucks right heard of that beforeso were at war fighting people all over the world something that often isnt clear enough is why are we fighting the characters are heroic but robotic they sloughter with no questions askeddoes ask these questions the characters want to follow the system and obey their orders but they cant help but question and doubt it the military isnt a machine which is oiled and fueled soldiers are not robots this is are army and it isnt perfect but were doing what we can and were proud americansbesides this is wwii the one war where we had support of most of these big european countries so we dont need to explain to them what were fighting for some of the other sides involved in this war even complained that we were hogging to much of the credit in this movie thats when you know youre doing something rightso we need more war movies like because it gives you the naked thruth about the military a relief it will make you a man not a robot so war movies should be walking in the footsteps of this masterpiece or well be coming up short on manpowerbut the machines are taking over anyway right just look at arnie back down in calimy mission is to protect you,reality

at what point in the movie are germans portrayed as back stabbing sobs and why do people think that this film would have been better if we had seen the story from the german viewpoint as well do the people stating such things have any idea about filmmaking or plots would alien have been better if we had seen the film from the aliens view the horror of war is that we dont know the enemy they are faceless foes in gettysburg it made sense to show both sides since the entire battle was the point in other films like das boot the british are never shown close up the crew of the uboat only hear the sonar and feel the concussion of depth charges,reality

i really dont understand some of the issues raised by people after viewing this movie they seem to bring their own agendassome people ask why no brits were portrayedwhy should there be okay there were brits and canadians etc invading francebut what do they have to do with the efforts of an american squad ordered by american superiors  to locate an american paratrooper who was with other american troops so he can be sent back to his american mother who had lost 3 other of her american sons if the movie were about brits fighting on sword or juno and some tommy was lost inland and the brits needed to find him to send him home to liverpool or dymchurchi wouldnt moan about the film not showing omaha beach and americans not being shownnow yesthere were hispanic and black soldiers there many blacks steered the landing craft spielberg couldve added a black landing craft driver and a hispanic soldier blown to bitsbut arent we all a little tired of tokenism i know i find the inclusion of a white character in black movies like drumline kind of cheap and pandering would the inclusion of a hispanic soldier in the squad made it a better movie would the sight of a hispanic soldier dying on the beach made it a better movieand again would someone please explain the comments about germans being portrayed as stupid andor evil during the film we see american soldiersgleefully laugh as they shoot germans attempting to surrender at normandya soldier so frozen with fear that he neglects his fellow soldiers in their time of needa soldier threatens to desert the squad and disobey his officersand what do the germans do thats evil they shoot americans no brits and they stab them and germans manning tanks fire at americansthats not evilthats warthen people say that after the first half hourthat the movie becomes routine well i dont get that they are on a quest just like in lord of the rings we did get to know each soldier not as much as the soldiers in a miniseries like band of brothers but then did we really know more about them than the guys in sprif the entire movie were like the first half hour some of you would be complaining that there wasnt enough quiet character developmentand how could anyone say tom hanks is a bad actor,reality
no  that is all in the opinion of the viewer  the afi can hail citizen kane the best movie of all time but then cast a blind eye towards aliens in their 100 thrillers  moral no one is infallibleto be blunt there are good war movies das boot apocalypse now and there are bad ones almost anything with john wayne fits here  is a good war movie even great at some points but once again spielberg falls into the sentimental showman trap that frequents his films  whether in empire of the sun schindlers list or indiana jones 3 he starts trying to evoke an emotional response by trying too hard  as they say the harder you try the dumber you lookas far as general film quality goes this movie is superb  kaminskis tight camera angles coupled with the color desaturation gives private an almost blackandwhite archaic look reminiscent of a wwii documentary  the characters look gaunt and pale enhancing the sickening look of the movieis this better than shakespeare in love  certainly but not as good as life is beautiful  unfortunately the thin red line does not match up because malick winds up making just an art film  should hanks have gotten the oscar  yes compared to forrest gump he is far above that level here  seen one war movie seen them all  thats what you should understand before watching this  there is no difference between platoon full metal jacket and all quiet on the western front compared to this  they all have the same characters the same morals the same conclusions bummerjohn williams someone give the guy a complementary oscar  i have yet to hear a bad composition on his part other than midway  in addition the makeup and production design are far superior to the shakespeare in lovemost compliments go towards the opening 25 minutes of the movieand it deserves it  i feel that the final battle should seriously get more credit than it has  michael kahns editing and the super sound work enhance the fight in an almost wild bunch fashion  overall very good example of spielberg in his serious mode despite many flaws in both plot character and continuity  45 out of 5 it still isnt the best war movie ever made,reality
heres something i never quite get people say that the german are made to look evil in ww ii filmsand ill grant you that in some of the older ones they do but where in are the germans made to look evilsure they look formidable and that uniform makes them look scary but they are hardly portrayed as babyeating snarling subhumans they kill americans but that is what war is about i dont see any scenes of torture or laughing germans as they gleefully kill our guysalso the plot was based on a real event there was a brother pulled out because his brothers were lost it might not have happened exactly as the movie depicts it but hey thats what movies dothere is also some confusion as to people thinking that the german who is allowed to leave by tom hanks called steamboat willie in the credits is the same guy who plunges the knife into the gis chestits not spielberg regretted not making them look different after he heard that there was the confusionthe whole point of the movie to me is that we are privatethat is we are the ones that so many gave their lives forwe the generations of americans then and now who are free today because of their sacrifices so like james we must ask ourselves each day what did you do with this freedomdid we do something to earn itlead a productive life when so many in the world cant what will we do with what has been given us we are private each of us,reality
i watched this film for the first time  initially seeing the headlines and the trailers i expected a typical wartime drama  plenty of blood guts heroics and swearing  well naturally that was included  spielberg brought the reality of war to the screen  remember ladies and gentlemen it may be a movie but this is something that real boys went through something our troops today are going through right now in different nations across the worldi felt that the film asked us all a question  is our life and the way we live our life worth the sacrifices that past generations of veterans fought for and gave their lives for  are we worth their sacrifice  it is a reminder that our freedom the freedoms we take for granted even forget came with a very heavy price  a price we will continue to pay until the entire world can agree to respect the freedom of each and every soul on this earththe film was wonderful and it left an impact on me as was its intention it had a powerful storyline and was amazingly well directed  even the look and style of the cinematography was superb  i rented it but i will be looking into buying it  its a story that we should all be reminded of every once awhile  even if you do not prefer war dramas at least remember the story and remember the brave men and women who strive every day to keep us free,reality
this is an unbelievably intense movie and i imagine the most realistic battle scenes ever captured on film  everyone should see it not only because it is a high quality story with high quality special effects but also because it will definately cause an increased appreciation for the sacrifices which our men in uniform went through to preserve our freedom,reality
although i did not witness nor was i even alive during world war ii i as an american count this as pretty much the best movie ive ever seen  i look at it like this if even one tenth of the movie is accurate as to what our soldiers endured count me among those who are forever indebted i cannot even pretend to know what they experienced and what they undoubtedly relive every day but i am so thankful  i am free to enjoy my life regardless of my religion my race or of my sex because of these heroes i personally did nothing to earn this honor except to be born an american reminds us of the sacrifice so many men and women have made in so many wars and battles we should each live our lives well and be good people if for no other reason than to honor those who paved the way that we may do just that without repercussions or fear,reality
from the stunning omaha landing sequence to the final battle this film is amazingthe first sequence the dday landings focusing on omaha are truly shocking yet i think in a good waythe reality and truth here is a giant step to destroying the ridiculous stereotype of an old man boring his grandchildren with when i was in the warall actors were perfectly cast and worked incredibly well on screenthis film thankfully has none of the rubbish frequently added to modern war films unlike the abominable pearl harbor and other such films this movie doesnt add romances sex or drugged up hallucinations and flashbacksthis is a no frills movie that tells is like it was which is a good thing not just because it doesnt want to it doesnt need to this film already has pure emotion and drama with its basic theme anything added to it would only dilute itit has so many standout moments too many to mention here that had me in tears and images of which stayed with me for daysid like to see anyone top this excellent war film itll be hard to beat,reality
i saw this on the big screen on opening day while the show before mine was clearing out i saw a guy i knew coming out his face a mask of dried tears hes not the kind of guy who cries for anything so i figured that i was in for something i might not be able to handle i went in and sat down shivering with anticipation the movie starts with an old man in a military cemetery breaking down at the sight of the hundreds of crosses marking the graves of his fallen comrades i was already near tears by this point then seemingly out of nowhere the infamous twentyfive minutes of the omaha beach landing hit me with the force of a speeding plane crash to put it mildly i have seen enough violent movies in my time to say ive been pretty much desensitized to violence even though the occasional violent gory scene can still get me on occasion while watching the beginning of this film i remember thinking at one point this has to stop please god make it stop the rest of the movie doesnt stray too far from the inyourface style of the first minutes and when all is said and done you walk away realizing that spielberg no matter what his detractors may say is indeed a genius i consider this movie to be the reason i wanted to get back into filmmaking after dropping out of film school this movie makes its points and makes you question the validity of the senseless slaughter of so many innocent lives in the face of war no matter what side of the fence you speak of i never gave the ww2 vets a second thought until i saw this movie now i think of them and their hardships especially around memorial day the cinematography here ranks among the best i have ever seen john williams score is phenomenal and if you dont believe me listen to the very last piece of music played over the end credits it is an incredible piece that can only be described as beautifully patriotic all of the performances in this film were spot on though it did jar me a little to see ted danson pop up out of nowhere with a smoking machine gun in hand i cannot recommend this movie enough though id suggest that anyone unnerved by extremely realistic and at times sadistic violence should avoid this because its pretty upsetting i can only say that like my friend i walked out of the theater a sobbing wreck on my way out i noticed that there were many vets in the audience many of them were crying on the shoulders of their wives who were busy consoling them along with the film as a whole it was a sight i am sure i will never forget rating  out of ,reality
after i saw schindlers list i didnt think stephen speilberg could top himself this man is such an incredible director who has given us such classics as raiders of the lost ark close encounters of the third kind et and now saving privatei still cant understand how this film did not win best picture in 1999 shakespeare in love won this movie is very violent but it is violence that is needed to tell the story and make the story realistic from the opening battle of normandy you feel like you are right there on the beach in the battlethe performances in this movie are outstanding this is tom hanks in his best role since forrest gump as the leader of the platoon assigned to find private one of the performances that was underrated was that of jeremy davies who played corporal upham who makes a fatal mistake with a german officer that comes back to haunt him edward burns was teriffic as well as private reiben who wonders out loud why risk the lives of several men to save one tom siezmore is equally as brilliant as tom hanks 1 man even matt damon who i normally do not like was outstandingthis is such a terrific film because the characters are developed so well and you feel like you know them by the time the movie is over the battle scenes are outstanding as well this is the best war movie i have ever seeni give four stars out of four,reality
tom hanks is a good actortom sizemore is also a good actor is the best war movie i have ever seen in my cool life this movie should have 14 oscars steven spilberg is a good director,reality
spoilers   spoilers eight for onethe fiveacademy award 1998 steven spielberg film stars captain john miller tom hanks private richard reiben edward burns private james matt damon and sergeant michael horvath tom sizemore the movie begins with world war ii dday invasion of omaha beach as the troops approach the beach in infantry pod boats they are swept with heavy fire as they struggle to the cover of the hills  germans sweep the beach with their machine guns stopping hundreds of american soldiers in their tracks  as captain miller leads his troops up the hill to clear a path for the second wave his troops overcome many obstacles after taking out the snipers and clearing the bunkers the infantry rests in the us letters are being sent out by the hundreds to the families of the soldiers lost in previous battles  it come to the attention of a typist that one mother was about to receive notice of three out of four of her sons were killed in battle she takes the letters to her superior and this information immediately makes its way to washington dc a decision is made to find her last son private james to relieve him of his duties and to bring him home captain john millers assignment changes from taking over omaha beach to finding private and getting him home safely angry and confused eight men set out on this task the question going through the soldiers heads is why are we risking eight for one the answer to this question is not simple orders are orders and do not question authorityalong the way they meet many confrontations of troops snipers and bunkers they stumble across a secret radar bunker captain john miller makes a decision to take the bunker rather than sneak past and go on with the mission by making this decision he upsets the crew the crew states that this is not our objective captain miller replied our objective is to win this war in doing so this results in the loss of their team medic by machine gun fire  after taking over the secret radar bunker captain miller leads his troops to another battle site where they join ground troops to find the whereabouts of private james they find private james at the bridge along with his troops is told the news of his three brothers  captain miller orders to come back with him and his troops heartbroken and distraught refuses to leave his fellow troops captain miller makes the decision to defend the bridge then to get home millers troops prepare themselves for a battle in which they knew could jeopardize the original mission at hand fighting begins again with the arrival of german troops at the bridge miller loses his men one by one as the germans attack a bullet strikes miller in the chest and he falls to ground  staring at the sky miller sees the us air troops bomb the germans to win the battle turning his head to see standing before him he utters his final word earn thisthe film in my opinion was fantastic the scene when the boats landed at omaha beach was extremely gory the graphics of color sound effects and the showing of everybody being shot to death was a real as it comes for me great movie,reality
i cant watch this movie without feeling traumatized to think people had to make life and death decisions in similar circumstances is impossible to imagine if the one of the reasons for watching a movie is to glimpse life experiences unlike your own this movie is in an elite group very few if any movies convey emotion and fear as does spr,reality
since today is veterans day i decided to review saving privatedirected by steven spielberg this masterpiece war film contains perhaps the most realistic battle scenes captured on film you see anyone can do an accurate war film but not many have the courage or patience to create an accurate war scene battle now while most war films especially wwii movies tend to focus on the political side of the war this one focuses on the people who fought the war which is why this movie is so great dont get me wrong theres nothing wrong with doing a war movie centering on the political side but when you focus on the people it gives the movie more of an impact which is perhaps why vietnam movies make some much have an impact on the audience my theory is that wwii was such an accomplishment to the united states that producers tend to focus on the political accomplishment4out of 4starshappy veterans day,reality
the best film ever beacuse its so good story and its a kick from the second war steven spielberg is the best director in the world the film is so real violent and cool dday is the best part i loved that part go and see saving private,reality
ive seen this movie 4 times now and i still cry this movie really captures the horror of war the special effects are incredible if you cant see this in a good theater make sure you watch it the first time on dvd with a good sound system,reality
this movie deserved every award it got and probably more the acting is excellent tom hanks along with the rest of the cast vin deisel edwards burns matt damon ect do an excellent believable job the direction is beautiful great camera shots and everything but anyone who says this is just another war movie is wrong this one has a plot and there are other great war films with plots but hardly yes it still has the big wars scenes of course but it has something more than just a whole load of killing and explosions steven spielberg always finds a way to do that but still leaving enough energy to keep us interested overall this film is accurate entertaining and powerful enough to make the people in the theater i was in start crying because of their memories oh the memories my vote is 910,reality
this movie is not just about the war it is more about the human values and how different people have different ways of valuing life all this is set at the backdrop of the world war tom hanks as the captain does not hesitate to kill enemy soldiers for his country on the other hand he leads his team to find one man because he believes that this job earns him the right to go home the war is shown exactly as it is in the battlefield some of the scenes are gross but real tom hanks and matt damon as deliver extraordinary peformances the sniper in the team who prays to god before shooting his victim the corporal who fires only one bullet in the whole movie have their own ways of looking at the war and also on their individual roles in the war overall the movie is excellent the absolute reality of the war as shown in the movie makes us think if anything good really came out of the whole war,reality
right lets get this out of the way with first yes this film is often sickeningly patriotic and it does not give a fair representation of how the soldiers of other nations including germany suffered dreadfully in the events of june 1944 good now thats settledi first saw this film when i was about thirteen id like to make two points before i go on1before i saw this film i thought war was cool 2before i saw this film i knew little or nothing about the most momentous event of the 20th centuryi wasnt expecting much then the ramps went down on the landing craft and the first twenty soldiers were cut to pieces in a hail of bullets obliterated in an instant i was appalled horrified all the more so because i knew that this had actually happened i had seen countless movie deaths in countless ways before but nothing like this the sheer ferocity of the opening beach landing is horrendous you are one of those soldiers on the beach desperately tying to find cover from the death raining down upon you from above the maimed screaming as medics attempt to operate on them in the middle of the most hellish chaos imaginable human instinct would be telling those men just to hide but they had to do more than just stay alive they had to take that beach at all coststhis is not just a superb war film it most definitely is a good drama the sheer trauma that the common soldier experienced the fact that young men who had never known death had to watch their friends slaughtered before their eyes is skillfully translated the audience cares about each one of the characters the death of wade the medic as his friends tried to help him reduced me to tears  it was so awful as the search for progresses the characters begin to develop also they are ordinary men caught up in the most terrifying events imaginable hanks gives an excellent performance one of the best of his careerthe film is possibly the closest thing to war i have ever seen on screen it pioneered the use of shakeycam and the use of washed out colours give the film a terrifyingly gritty and dirty realism that dispels any notion of glorious combat the very sound the ominous screeching made by the 60ton tiger tank approaching the town a hail of machine gun fire slamming into a human body makes is horrific some have complained about the faceless enemy of the german soldiers if anything this added to the terror at the films finale i remember upon first seeing it even though i knew it was just german soldiers approaching it was frightening  those were ordinary men just a few hundred yards down the street not monsters but they would kill you if they found you  i cant begin to explain it properly but this particularly a profound effect upon methe film is emotionally and physically draining at some points you just want it to stop but you cant take youre eyes off it it prompted me to find out as much as i could about the second world war and for this reason i am now studying history a level on nazi germany it is not perfect  no but because of seeing it i am now eternally grateful and fully aware of the tremendous sacrifice that that generation made for those after,reality
spielbergi think this is really where spielbergs greatest passion lies this movie really does it right this film really lets you know what it must have been like for these soldiers the movie has a good message this film just grabs you and shocks you and teaches you and makes you feel for the soldiers and think about war and it shows that steven really is a great directorfilm makeri never knew steven could make something this good steven spielberg has moved up in my top ten listthe effects are topnotch the acting is superb the visuals the soundpfff everything rulesi rate this with a 9 not a 10 because it might be a master piece but its not perfect you know   very few films are ,reality
this movie is the best war movie i have seen the filming in general was great the accuracy was to me incredible ive never been in a war and this looks like a very good representation of what it was like in world war 2 from the choatic opening sequence of dday to the final skirmish with the german soldiers have me hooked and interested in the horrors of war i liked the whole movie but i have to comment again on the beginning and end war sequences not implying the movie inbetween is bad at all it never bores you and its still good the beginning sequence was a great performance of acting of the main cast and a lot of extras working all at the same time at the end you got to follow individual soldiers on their fight with the camera following them the color tainting and the authentic weaponry and sound effects makes the best war movie,reality
my nr 2 warmovie after das boot shows tom hanks at his very best the other actors also deliver performances at the highest level typically steven spielberg gets the best out of the team and i think this is his best movie as das boot is an anti war movie the story is very good and well told this is one of those films that is a must see and enjoy,reality
steven spielberg that name should almost be sufficient this film is a masterpiece when it comes to showing the brutal sides and consequences of war how much should an individual pay for the freedom of his or her country   that is an essential question here the film starts in the present day and ends there as well the majority of the action takes us back to the days of ww2 where the mouth of a gun made most of the political statements if youre into war it doesnt come much better the casting is excellent the sound is very realistic and i recommend seing the movie in thx or surround the length of the movie helps to create the right atmosphere it doesnt stop when you think you were just getting started you should experience this movie rather than listen to what i have to say about it   if you can take the heat of the shells and bullets falling all around youthere is nothing like a movie that dares to make a statement and puzzles you with the consequences of it,reality
 spoiler country ahead this film has proved to be one of the more devisive that spielberg has made and along with schindlers list its certainly the most harrowing  when i first saw this in the cinema 95 of the audience couldnt stand up as the credits rolled  the trauma induced watching the battle scenes seemed to disconnect everyones brain from their leg muscles  if you ever want to make anyone realise that war is not a good idea make them watch thismany have said that this film doesnt have a plot  rubbish the plot is that 8 soldiers go off to rescue the last remaining brother of a family so that some high ranking officer doesnt have tell his mother the worst possible news without something positive to add at the end  sorry bit of cynicism there  it dont care if the plot is true made up plausible or a steaming pile of cow dung its still a plot  to me the number of soldiers who died in wwi to gain 100 yards of ground seems totally implausible  but it happened  in was lots of crazy things happen and sometimes the focus needs to be on the detail rather than the big picturei agree the plot is something to hang this film on  its a bit flimsy but it isnt why the film was made  i think this film like the gravestones in normandy is a monument to the fallen  its an attempt to do an honest war film  no punch pulling  no batteplans just individual soldiers stories in one huge story there players within  to do that well you need a simple story and thats what youve got  now the big controversial bit  patriotism  yes its an american film made by hollywood with american actors and money  its about americans at war maybe everyone should treat it as such  das boot is an excellent german war film about germans and the number of british war films made in the later half of the 1940s about brits does not need mentioningbutthe rest of world is starting to view america as a bit schizophrenic  on one hand very insular and not really wanting to interact with the world certainly wanting to be safe from the rest of the worlds problems  on the other hand american culture values interpretations of history art music are everywhere around the world  indeed most of the world are a little bit american  thats fine as far at is goes  you dont like you dont eat at mcdonalds  however when a brilliantly artistic and truthful film that we all want to share in fails to do this and goes all insular and uspatriotic on us we get a little bit disappointed  yes this film tells the truth but it doesnt tell the whole truth  its subtle but its rewriting history that gets peoples backs up and leads to tension and argumentsthe association of the universal truths with the us flag and us soldiers seems to be stealing something that we all own for an individual nation war it a horrible thing that men can commit the ultimate sacrafice for another man that fighting brutalises that the freedom to make this film was won on those beaches and fields this film has a message for all of us not just the usfilms should have an affect on you they should haunt your thoughts for days afterwards  still haunts my thoughts over 3 years since i saw it  please see it regardless of where you come from,reality
it seems moviegoers either love or hate this film  most brits look down on it for neglecting the allies perspective  yes it is a decidedly american film and why not  yanks coming ashore at omaha were not hand in hand with brits nor did they care  they were with their buddies and they were there to stay alive and kill germansnot just nazisgermansthe enemy the five sullivans were real and their tragic deaths ripped the heart out of most normal americans at the time and to this day  americans would never again risk that heartache upon a single mother  perhaps this did not occur with any british family making it difficult for the audience to relate to this premise of the filmmany say the first 25 minutes are excellent and then the film fades to standard  i believe the original hoopla is generated by the very real special effects  few can deny that this film raised the bar for moviegoer battle sensation  the scene in the village at the end where hanks et al are awaiting the panzers and the rubble shakes beneath them still sends chills up my spine  hollywood movie  sure american as apple pie  and hollywood will continue to make yank films becausewe will still find those eight yanks today that will risk their lives to save one,reality
oh please no more brits giving this film a bad review because it didnt show any british soldiers as one reviewer statedits an american film make a film about the brits on sword beach but quit dissing our film because you didnt see any soldiers wearing berets and blowing bagpipesspr is one of the best ww ii movies ever made if you brits want to make a good war movie how about remaking that dreadfully dull battle of britain or sink the bismaarck or a movie about dunkirk,reality
starring tom hanks matt damon edward burns and tom sizemorea group of men are sent on a long mission to save a young man who is excluded from the war because of the deaths of his three brothers  the movie is a real excellent war film that shows how war is really like instead of other films windtalkerswindtalkers i also have to note that the first 30 minutes were the most realistic time probably ever in a movie,reality
there is no aim in this plot why dont anyone mentions it there is completely no reason to use such a who cares reason to base a whole plot on it come on people this is a war movie people die in thousands not only sons of a mother but mothers as well wars dont only happen to distant places they may happen next to your doorthanks spielberg for another stupid completely out of interest ploton the contrary the directing was fantastic the imaging work on this movie was also fantastic maybe the best ever achieved on a war movietom hanks is excellent as alwaysid give it 1010 if it was for another plot for now sorry but 710 would be enough,reality
when we think spielberg we think indiana jones et and jaws  we wouldnt ever think war  however movie genius spielberg pulls out all of the stops in this epic war movie with none other than hollywood greattom hanks and whod have thunk itspielbergworking with matt damon  there really isnt a whole lot that one can say against this movie  its graphic and touching all at the same timewhile bringing the reality of wwii to life like no one has ever done before,reality
steven spielberg is a visionary i knew that before i went in to see this film at the cinema however i was not prepared for the opening 20 minutes or so at the same time it brought the horrors of war and the wonder of film making together at the same time this is matched with an end battle sequence again that gets the pulses racing and the emotions rising people have actually complained about the middle segment of the film claiming it to be clunky boring and cliche but this is just the unwinding of the plot the scene where they storm the radar base and capture the german pow is one of the most powerful in the film hanks is as always superb but my personal favourite in the film is tom sizemore who is the pick of an all round excellent supporting cast big mentions also to jeremy davies and adam goldberg who excelled in their roles,reality
this movie was one of the greatest war films ever made tom hanksberry pepperedward burns vin dieselgiovani rivichi tom sizemore played terrific roles besides all the action it had lot of history of world war two in it this movie was very realistic and gory i rate this film a 10 had some mistakes i spotted but overall it was a awsome flick,reality
what a movienever before has a movie enthralled me as much as this masterpiece of film makingfrom the horrific opening 25 minute sequenceto the directors emphasis on the psychological effects that war has on such young livesto the most stunningly realised locationsyou could actually be forgiven for thinking you are watching a documentary on world war 2 the performances are also breathtakingfrom the criminally underrated acting skills of giovanni ribisito the first noteworthy appearance of vin dieselthrough to the box office heavyweight muscle of the the leadtom hanksof whom we now take for a granted quality performances from the first minuteright through to its heartwrenchingalmost cruel endingthisto my mind is the greatest war film ever madein factforget thatit is quite simply one of the best movies ever madeand makes a welcome addition to any film fans collection,reality
what a movie  those who think of us as the ugly americans can bash it all they want i dont care im used to it  all i know is this is a movie that made me squirm made me think and made me love the men from all the allied nations even more who made this kind of sacrifice so that we can live with the freedom we enjoy todayas capt miller said to private and to all of us earn it,reality
this is a brilliant film  i have never seen a film that gives a better sense of what it is like to actually be involved in combat in all its shocking and horrifying reality  it also is rare that a world war ii film comes along that actually shows american soldiers as real people who sometimes do things theyd rather not talk about under the intense stress of combat  take for example the american soldiers who shoot the two germans who are trying to surrender during the dday landing  or corporal upham who is too scared during the final battle to save one of his comrades from being killed  scenes such as these help lend a humanity to the movie so that while still rooting for the main group of characters you realize that sometime during war men act in a way that they never would during peacenow as for the issue of the portrayal of the germans during the movie first of all i dont see how some people are complaining that they were portrayed as stupid  i cant think of a single scene in which the german soldiers are shown to be acting stupidly  are they shown losing the battle yes they are  but guess what  thats what actually happened  news flash  the germans lost the war  a film that shows brave german soldiers successfully stopping the americans and british on the beaches and driving them back into the sea would be nothing but a giant work of fiction because it never happened  and as for all out german friends complaining that germans are always portrayed as the bad guys and evil in world war ii films i have news for you germany was the bad guy  germany acted in as evil a way as a country can act  germany tried to conquer an entire continent because it felt it was its destiny  germany mercilessly butchered millions of jews and other undesirables because they werent pure  if germans dont like being portrayed as evil during world war ii then maybe they shouldnt have acted evil during world war ii,reality

there is no doubt in my mind that this movie should have won best picture and it is probably one of the top 25 greatest movies ever made i loved it every actor from giovanni ribsi to tom hanks gives an excellent performance but i could go on forever and ever telling you how much i loved itit starts out with one of the most powerful opening sequences in film history the dday invasion then after tom hanks must lead a small group of soldiers to rescue private matt damon behind enemy linesplease watch this movie,reality
best movie ever this movie start the ww2 wave look at all the games that have release because of this movie best in the film are the invasion of normandie its not often a film first scene forget the old man in the graveyardare the best one but that is not all see it if you havent if u already seen it see it again and again,reality
if you didnt watch the movie because youre afraid of watching horrifying scenes you could try to reconsider your position all of the blood scenes in this movie have poetry behind them and they should be understood within their inherent duality external horror yet warm at heart the figure of the mothers is referenced several times in the movie i think this movie is at least partially meant as a tribute to the mothers of the soldiersthis is not a typical war movie its not platoon either its very different from what a war movies fan would expect i guess many war movies fans will dislike this one while people who usually dont like war movies will enjoy it,reality
i have seen a lot of war films and i seriously doubt that any will ever show combat better than this speilberg offering i dont subscribe to the view that it ignores us brits as clearly we were not involved in that area the aside about montgomery is not particularly fair even though i do not rate him as a general he was playing the part dictated by overall strategy the first time i saw spr i rather think i held my breath for the entire landing sequence certainly i remember heaving a huge sigh of relief when it was over if there is a more intense 20 odd minutes of film anywhere in existence i have never seen it the film loses many points for some really stupid continuity errors but makes it up hands down for the action sequences the technique used to film on the beach has had its critics in my circle of friends but i really do think it lent great realism to the action many parts of the film were a little twee some tactics used considerably less than competent i have never been one to let such things stand in the way of good entertainment overall spr sits on my pedestal of best war film on the basis of its action sequences better war films are out there if you want a really good story historical representation or total accuracy if you want to see what it was like to be a soldier in ww2 when the lead flew then see it on the big screen and be prepared to duck what a shame that steven speilberg did not make enemy at the gates,reality
if someone doubts of the misery of a war heshe should see this film scenes very realistic of how difficult for the allies uk and us armieswas to get in europe germans fought heavily and to the last man they employed everything possible to contain the advancement of the enemies during the 2nd world war the story showed the number of victims from each side how scared many soldiers in both sides were and also the discipline of those american soldiers who received the order to save the last this film has high values of morale and spielberg once again showed his class as an extraordinary director,reality
i recently rented steven spielbergs on dvd and all i can say about this movie that is one of the best movies ever made the d  day scene makes you feel like you are on the beach and the acting goes above and beyond i recommend this movie to everyone,reality
this film is hard to describe in words much like steven spielbergs schindlers list to date it is the best war film that i have ever seen with a gutwrenching performance by tom hanks the film is extremely well acted it is a shame that this film didnt win best picture over shakespeare in love was superior compared to its competitors that year the opening action sequence the invasion of normandy was so bewildering i really didnt know what to think i was speechless especially at the end of the film this film may make you cry but it definitely will make you feel powerful human emotion on many levels hats off to mr spielberg to making the best war movie i have seen so far grade a,reality
i never knew i knew that my grandfathers generation did remarkable things during the war but i never knew i knew that we fought a tough battle during dday but i never knew i knew that people risked and lost their lives to fight for our freedom but i never knewthe reason why this movie is important especially to my genx generation is that none of us really knew what others sacrificed for our freedomi walked out of this movie and saw an elder gentleman as i was walking out i thanked him after viewing the movie i went to my car and just rode around for a while collecting my thoughts if this movie does not give you a punchinthegut feeling after walking out then you have missed the point the point is plain and simple ordinary people did extraordinary things so that we have the right to be free some of my generation take these rights for granted i did i no longer dothe rest of this for the most part goes into why i disagree with others who did not like this movie by doing this i hope that i have also explained why i do like this movie i have heard many of the complaints about this movie i disagree with just about every one of them i add a disclaimer about this at the endi have heard that this movie is not antiwar enough that the thin red line is a much better antiwar movie this misses the point of the movie the movie is not essentially antiwar it is about the sacrifices that others made to give us our freedomsi have heard that this movie is too gruesome i can understand why people say this but in order to portray truthfully the bravery that others made on our behalf the movie needs to be gorry i believe that this movie was not so much written for the wwii generation but for their children grandchildren and on down the line we need to understand what others have donesome have claimed that the movie beyond the first 20 minutes does not have enough action the movie is not an action epic beyond the first twenty minutes and is not meant to be the movie is meant to display that these people were ordinary this is called character development the characters are not as developed as some would wish but i believe spielberg did this with a purpose the characters are developed to the point that we know that they are ordinary we are supposed to see that they are just like us the generations after wwii yet they did extraordinary thingssome have claimed that the characters are too stereotypic well we are a stereotypic society we have cultures from all over the world and they all fought in wwii while many units may have been homogeneous many were not there are no africanamericans in the story and spielberg did hold true to the realism there as sadly african americans were segregated from fighting with white soldierssome have said that this another example of americans being jingoistic well we did fight separately from other countries units spielberg did not say that other countries did not fight in the war but this movie would have been twenty hours long if we chronicled each countries contributions beside that spielberg is american and made a film about the contributions that americans made why others feel that he should make a movie about each countries contributions is beyond me if he does that is his prerogative if a french director makes a movie about the french resistance i say good job not what about americafinally after fighting off attack after attack i wish to say that is fine that is your right thanks to the bravery of others i only wish to say that i hope that those who dislike this movie are still able to see the efforts that others made to give us this rightps thank you poppop,reality
i watched the movie again and still felt the powerful feeling from itafter watching the movie bloody fps pc games are really nothing in fact i have lost all the pleasant sensation of power from shooting cause its just madnessthe movie is so great not because of the american patriotismpride shown in it but the message of life and greatest love that is for oneones to die for the sake of others,reality
is simply the best pure filmmaking ive ever encountered in a lifetime in the biz  the normandy sequences use every technique possible to keep the viewer on the edge of their seat and maybe hiding their heads  spielberg uses solarization and strobing combined with handheld shots to put the viewer in the living hell of the invasion  the story the characters rung true this is the way people were before pc and during wwii ethnicities that seem exaggerated were very much in evidence at that time and spielberg wasnt about to make a postmodern war picture this is sands of iwo jima  guadalcanal diary but realistically portrayed it made one think if they would be so brave as to ride those tiny lsts to the beach knowing what was waiting for themfor those who wonder why it didnt win best picture i say wake up do you think the academy is a pure democracy  is it not possible that other less talented members are simply jealous of the consistently fine work that has put steven spielberg atop his profession  academy awards are simply the product of the likes and dislikes of each member of the motion picture academy  nothing more  they werent handed down from mt sinai and anybody who believes the world is a fair place should open their eyes  1010  an experience,reality
after seeing this flimmy perspective on what war is was changed forever instead of heroics and valiant speeches i saw madness chaos and death it showed how war can not only kill and man but destory them mentally the great sacrifice that was made by ww2 vetrans had finally become clear to me instead of feeling like i could blow up anything like i do at the end of most war films i felt like i never want to go through the hell that those brave men had to go through god bless america 1010stars,reality
much has been said about the opening scenes of heres all you need to know about it at preview screenings of it some veterans who survived dday had flashbacks of their unimaginable experiences some couldnt bring themselves to watch that being said anyone who wasnt there on dday should see this film so they will have some small idea of what those brave soldiers went through after the opening scenes we get to the plot of the movie the search for a young man whose brothers have all been killed in the war a troop of soldiers is sent to bring this young man home on the way they question the validity of their mission why risk a whole group of men to save one it is a question that has no easy answer for the characters or the audiencethis is in my opinion the greatest movie about the second world war ever filmed it was nominated for the best picture oscar but lost to shakespeare in love why the academy snubbed is a mystery and again in my opinion the biggest mistake the academy ever made,reality
what an amazingly breathtaking piece of cinema the fact that people on here are posting that black hawk down is better than this must be on something black hawk down is a load of bull compared to perhaps the most prominent difference being that the former is like 3 hours of propaganda and bad acting and the latter is without doubt the truest and most beautiful portrayal of wwii yetthe cast were excellent standout performances from ed burns reiben giovanni ribisi wade barry pepper jackson and of course tom hanks miller the only film that can really move anyone to tears,reality
it is a shame that some people trash movies just because they feel the need to go against the norm and try to be so original  this and we were soldiers is the best war movie i have ever seen rating 1010,reality
speaking as an american id enjoy this movie even if it was about russian german or canadian troops please stop knocking americans who like a film about americans and try to convince us that we like it because we are americans i enjoyed talvisota about finnish soldiers and i liked braveheart about scottish and irish warriors and zulu about british soldiers and even spartacus about slaves from all over the roman empireyes i liked longest day bridge too far and big red one which show a lot of americans as well as brits and even eeeeeeewwww frenchmen we americans like seeing americans in our movies but we also enjoy a good foreign film i think das boot blue max and cross of iron are among the best war films of the 20th century andsurprise no americans so lay off nonamericans we made longest day and it rockedyou brits made sink the bismarck and battle of britain and well they were kinda dullbut dammit i liked them,reality
as the opening sequence begins you cannot help but have a feeling of dread as the date appears on the screen june 6 1944   the opening sequence has got to be one of the best put on film  the jarring camera movements the bullets shooting through the water the absolute chaos of dday is masterfully captured  some people called it uselessly gory comparing it to glory with its battle scenes  glory was a great movie but comparing the civil war to dday isnt the brightest thing to do  once we realize the mission we hear the men complaining why is one life worth risking eight of ours  i wondered that as well but you soon understand that it isnt the point   the backlash says that the characters are paper thin and that the story is st  i disagree with both points  all these characters have depth with the possible exception of private  the story while i agree that the screenplay is not oscarworthy is actually not told as a plot story but as a series of events that take place dday the battle at the hill with the machine gunners the final battle  the acting does range and is not always great  hanks does give a good performance in a role that is not his type aka not forrest gump  edward burns does give a good performance but the two best belong to tom sizemore and jeremy davies  davies meltdown sequence on the staircase left me reeling  i saw it in theatres over a year ago and on video yesterday and was stunned about how much detail i remember  in my opinion this film is the best of the year beating a simple plan and elizabeth,reality
as few others have done before him steven spielberg depicts war as the true nightmare that it is no glamorization here shermans phrase war is hell seems like a day at the beach compared to what we see in the only other film i can recall that delineates war to be as horrific as it appears in is kubricks paths of glory albeit for different reasonsthe cinematography special effects sets and costumes all create a mindboggling sense of realism the script is haunting phrases just linger in ones mind such as captain millers rueful observation that every  man he kills takes him a little further away from homespielbergs direction is just that direct there is no dazzling  visual trickery here just naturalistic movie making at its best  when i left the theater i felt grateful to the men who fought the fight of wwii,reality
having viewed all of steven speilberg films over the years i was extremely disappointed in the first hour of the movie was very intense and unique the dday landing was captured with realism and superb direction tom hanks and tom sizemore give a very good portrayal of men in combat as the film progressed it became stagnant and eventually down right boring from the time they leave the crash site of the airborne paratroppersto the ted danson village segmentthrough the destruction of the heavy machinegunright up to meeting matt damon as private jim the movie becomes contrived artificial and plodding in all honesty i cant understand what all the fuss is about at no time did i consider this in any way a patriotic war movie while speilberg gives a good directing effort in no way should this movie be considered in the same class as shindlers list i dont think it builds very good characterizations by the final battle scenes i got the impression these actors were only going through the paces they had lost that 1940s feel  for the times that was neatly instilled during the first half of the film in my humble opinion will never rank up there with the greatest war films of all time even full metal jacket with its second half letdown was a superior motion picture endeavor then the best war films about 20th century conflicks ever produced are the bridge on the river kwai the longest day the best years of our lives they were expendable paths of glory battleground twelve oclock high from here to eternity patton the deer hunter apocalypse now a walk in the sun gualalcanal diary sahara porkchop hill in which we serve the dawn patrol1938 in harms way full metal jacket operationburma destination tokyo sahara 30seconds over tokyo the story of gi joe to many observers most of these films are old in black  white and just not real enough in my book realism should be left to the documentaries and people should use their imagination morefilmsmoviesmotion pictures should be more surrealistic than realisticand of course above all entertaining there are probably several more im overlooking but these remain the mainstays in the 20th century war film genre,reality
why is it the people who made this movie decided it had to be the antijohn wayne film hell i have a copy of sands of iwo jima seems to be pretty bloody close except that when say richard jaeckel or forrest tucker get shot their guts arent all over the place but same thing sarge rock time in between some pretty gripping battle scenes if you have scene platoon or hamburger hill though you have seen it before pretty muchmy problem with the duke being singled out is that everyone made war films like himincluding audie murphy who was only our highest decorated guy in the war speilberg avoided fighting in nam and hankshe was popping zits when the draft was done away with jan 73 and the rest of the casted burns for example are my age33 or sosome youngerwho if they didnt go free kuwaiti oil for exxon arent likely to be vets eitheri am glad they made this movie suremy grandfathers generation that fought in the war deserve no less but to go after john wayne is idioticwhy not go after say more recent war films that were boneheaded flag waving and utterly unrealistic  i think if you want to be truly honest targeting films that we all remember recently would be betterbut in all the publicity about this film never once did i hear rambo mentioned why is that is it because stallone chuck norris and gene hackman are all alive and can defend themselves take the die hard films orstevens little kill a nazi for indy series where offing a few dozen german stormtroopers is as easy as playing pacman and fun toogimme a break whos being unrealistic and glorifying violence now die hard ii had so many bodies dropping and so many cartoony violent scenes i half expected to see wile coyote come flying outta the plane sometime in the second reelfine crap on the memory of a star who was the usas 1 box office guy all time like it or not who is dead and cannot defend himselfeven though we all know virtually all of hollywood made the same kinds of films back then even jimmy stewart lee marvin and robert mitchum guys who served in the war and loved the dukeenough of my rambling you like private good but is it a documentary no it is a movie  enjoy it but cmonthats it from here,reality
for me has to be the best war movie that has ever been madefrom the first minute of this film i was total hooked i knew i was watching a modern masterpiece which would be very hard to be beat this film is as moving as it is sickening sickening in the respect of the horific portrayal of the landings in france  how most of the soldiers never stood a chance  dying a horrible death before they got of the boats tom hanks is fantastic as usual  i promise you cant watch this film without be deeply moved spielberg does it again 9 out of 10,reality
is the greatest movie i have ever seen  period  show me another movie that starts off with the most intense thirty minutes ever put on film  show me another movie that entertains me for another two hours after that opening sequence  if you show me that ill show you some oceanfront property in wisconsin  i have seen this movie several times now and it never fails to move me  the only thing i could possibly complain about is the sappy grandpa frame story  it is completely unnecessary and contradicts the rest of the movie but if thats all ive got to complain about thats okayspielberg has made the masterpiece  but then again every movie he makes should be a masterpiece  no one else has the funds or the creative freedom that he does  he should never ever make a bad movie  give me 100 million and free reign from the censors and ill give you a watchable movie  give it to spielberg and hell give you saving privateor hook shudder lets hope the hook days are behind us,reality
with the exception of a few poingant and incredibly well acted scenesie the storming of the beaches at normandy and jeremy davies cowering in fear on the steps near the end this film takes on a normal hollywood stigma  it is honestly a shame that the thin red line and were released in the same year  the thin red line is an honest depiction of the humanity or lack there of of war  while tries this with its tearjerker scenes it just does not have the same effect as the thin red line  not to saying its a bad movie  on the contrary it is a good film it just should not in my opinion be put on the pedestal that everyone seems to think it should,reality
steven spielberg ruined this film the story script and acting were great but spielberg turned it into the most melodramatic film i have ever seen the soundtrack made me gag ill give spielberg credit on one point the battles were the best i have seen overall this is not as good as youve heard its no where close to the best war movie ever but if a different director had filmed it it might have been,reality
first of all i consider this movie a very good war moviebut after all it is a classic american war movie resembling other classic war movies like bridge on the river kwai etc what disturbed me is the general view of this movie being an antiwarmovie the origin of this categorization is without a doubt the acceptance of steven spielberg as a sophisticated director if another director had created a movie with such realistic scenes as featured in spr the movie would probably be seen as violent and warglorifying spielberg does spr and it is automatically an antiwarmovie that realistically displays the cruelty of war showing us what never may happen again how can it be otherwise it is a spielberg movie in my eyes ridiculous and unfair to the directors who are not as established as spielbergin a movie against war the first thing that should be dropped is patriotism in order to reflect on war objectively spr starts with an american flag waving in the wind there is hardly more patriotism possible an objective movie does not require clichees like the evil nazi soldier who coldheartedly shoots american soldiers even after they spared his life despite of the indubitable fact that the nazi regime was one of the most gruesome periods in world history we also have make the assumption that in battle all soldiers are the same humans fighting for a countryby the way the only movie i have seen that definitely could tell a war story without sticking to just one side was the thin red line the problem was that terrence malick is not steven spielbergso again in my eyes a really great movie but let us see things as they are just because spielberg made it doesnt make it a sophisticated antiwarmovie,reality
the first 15 minutes of this film are very tough to get through great performances by tom hanks and though i dont like matt damon he was ok this was a very good film even if it does have alot of gore though but the only thing is that it is very long and complicated like i said a very good film but way overrated this one is not for kiddies,reality
everybody should watch it some people may say its great other people will say they cant stand more spielberg filmswho careswatch the movie and if you realize youre crying dont be ashamed you dont need to admit it in publicafter that you can say what you wish to say you can say its great or that you hate it or that its boring  or whatever you wish it doesnt matter too much because the important thing is that more and more people realize how a war is,reality
this represents a great lull in steven spielbergs illustrious career a collossol disapointment in almost ever aspect the biggest problem though is the casting of recognisable faces such as tom hanks and matt damon if spielberg had chosen unknown actors he would have been able to reach emotional chords with the audience that wasnt achieved  tom hanks reaches emotional depth by squinting matt damon by whining the films opening blood bath on the beach is a powerful image reinforced by many of the key scenes but the film becomes bogged down in its middle with prolonged memoirs and later in a lack lustre climatic battleafter this film i was left trying to like it but in the end gave up i believe spielbergs directions of the battle scenes were oscar worthy but as for the rest it wasnt a great disappointment from a first rate director,reality
when will steven spielberg learn to trust his own talent as a filmmaker why has he managed to ruin the endings of his two best films  the stones on the grave scene at the end of schindlers list and the as old man scene at the beginning and end of were gratuitous and totally unecessary  its like he said ok  ive made a three hour movie showing in explicit detail how awful racial hatred andor was is  but just in case theres one idiot in that theatre that has missed the point ill end it with a sappy ending to make sure everybodys crying  this is the penny marshall influence on spielbergs directingwithout the unecessary scenes schindlers list and may both have merited 10s in my book   with the scenes they are a 9 and an 8 respectively  steven bubby just tell your story  leave the moralizing and tearjerking to lesser filmmakers  give the audience a little credit,reality
dr spielberg or how we went over there and kicked assas i said to amazon this is not the best war film paths of glory has a better script and better direction all quiet on the western front 1930 has better battle scenes this is true i didnt believe it either and das boot has far better tension and characterisation it wasnt even the best war film of that year the thin red line was far superiorpeople should learn to differentiate between an excellent film and a mediocre film with two excellent scenes,reality
yes the first half hour is great maybe even brilliannah great i even have problems with the opening stormin beach scene but anywaysbefore the film started on opening dayi add this to let you know im a fan of mr s one of my friends beside me said if this opens or closes with some hokey memorial thing im outta here well we didnt leave but we got it in both the beg and end geesh and i dont buy thats an everyman crap its not like theyre supposed to be meeting brando in apocalypse now hey he doesnt have to be crazylike brando just oh i dont know interestingmr s has shown with his last three dramatic works that he does dead or rather the act of killing better than anyone great shocking and all that other stuff but how about ya know the living i dont consider myself a girlyman but hell yeah shakespeare in love was better than and another thing that opener has flaws too like the center shots of the men with their look at me ive got my guts spillin oooooh indeed,reality
i give very few perfect 10s  this is a must see for everyone  while it is too real at times it shows how horrible war can be when i left the movie house no one said a word all the way to the parking lot  it gave me chills i cant believe that it didnt win best picture,reality
typical moderndaymovie predictability and overdramatization  im the kind of person that approaches movies with an open mind however certain things may become apparent in these movies which quickly bias my opinion and ruin the movie for me  i cant help it its how my mind works  as soon as i see something that makes me cynical i start picking the movie apart this movie had that effect on me  realize im 29 and have no combat experiencein the opening battle i wondered why they would attack a fortified position without any softening up of said position by either shiptoshore artillery or at least handheld heavy weapons  i assumed this was a realistic representation of what really happened everyone said it was so realistic  for whatever reason they didnt have the necessary firepower so be it  but then i see after theyve already nearly secured the position with heavy losses there is a guy with a rocketlaunchertype weapon where the hell was he earlier when the bunker was mowing down everyonethere were numerous other things that put me into cynicmode1 the guy that gets hit in the helmet then just stands there and very predictably gets shot in the head  isnt it a natural reaction to duck when you get hit in the head 2 solders shoot surrendering enemieswith friendly troops walking just beyond these enemies  you tell meat close range wouldnt one of these rifle bullets go right thru a person and potentially wound another in the line of fire  okay maybe these people were just stupid and lucky they didnt injure any friendly troops 3 this movie was supposed to be sooooo inyourface realistic  did anyone else notice how clean and bleached white pvts teeth were  oh thats realistic yeahi could go on  dont get me wrong there were things i liked  like the translator that finally hardened to the point where he killed  but overall i couldnt take the movie seriouslyand tom hanks  he was a pretty poor choice for the role  however this may have been spielburgs intention  more realistic maybei just watched this movie and thin red line for the first time today on direct tv  im probably the only one here that liked trl better though admittedly that had its flaws too can you say underpowered grenadesoh and for people wondering about the battle scenes  they were shot with handheld fastshutter speed cameras but the actual speed of the footage was not increased  it was a good effect but overused,reality
is great  definitely a 10  but platoon is the better war movie it has a richer better developed story and features better performances toptobottomthe first 15 minutes of private are as good as any ever filmed but the movie soon morphs into typical hollywood fare cut from time to time with gripping wellcrafted scenessee platoon first and maybe full metal jacket then private,reality
although it has a fairly simplistic plot this film manages to do what only one other war film i have ever seen has done it has recreated the battlefield so that the viewer is not witnessing it but is a part of it this movie features well drawnout characters trapped in an incredibly brutal and alltooreal situation they must survive the greatest hell ever to exist on earththeir mission is to rescue one man who is the last of his line  privates brothers have all died in combat and he now has a free ticket home however he has to be found first and a team of soldiers led by captain miller tom hankstravels around the lines of the dday invasion looking for himbut the real reason for seeing this has nothing to do with the plot  as far as plots go it is a fairly simplistic one despite the fact that these basic events really did happen  the film suffers slightly as the ancient morality of the other guys are the bad guys sets in making it slightly less horrifying than it could have been  however the real reason for seeing this is the experience  the viewer is at dday and the following chaos watching as soldiers get their brains blown out before they even have a chance to get out of the landing craft  watching this film is an experience of walking through hell and no viewer can come out of it without being changedthis is a film everybody should see at least once 455,reality
when i first saw this film a year ago i was completely blown away  i knew people who had seen it said the battle scenes were pretty intense  but it was nothing like i expected  i was in a state of shock as was everyone else at the screening i attended  the two extended battle scenes that open and close the film are simply the greatest battle scenes ever recorded on celluloid  the primary reason is because they show absolutely everything blood body parts gore you name it  this is easily the most violent film ive ever seen  can you imagine what the reaction wouldve been like if this movie came out at the same time the wild bunch did  i was somewhat surprised that this film sailed through with an r rating  the film tells a fairly straightforward story of a platoon of soldiers led by tom hanks who are assigned to find and bring back a young soldier whose three brothers have been killed in action  the characters are sharply and simply drawn the editing is phenomenal the cinematography is excellent and the score is appropriate  this is spielbergs fourth wwii movie and arguably his best film ever  the only complaint i have about this film is its continued absence on dvd  please please mr spielberg get this masterpiece out on dvd real soon,reality
i dont see why i even bother adding my comment on this film theres already like 780 or something but let me just say that should have definately withoutadoubt won best picture of 1998 i mean who else besides 20something women really thought shakespeare was worthy of best picture come on people was the best film in years i was so sad when seeing the ending of this movie that i was crying the beginning grabbed you by the heart and wouldnt let you go i have never seen a war movie better than this the people saying that all of that violence wasnt necessary had better realize that was only a fraction of how bloody and awful real war can be speilberg did an excellent job directing this movie and i felt very sorry that he did not win best picture after all that work tom hanks did an excellent job at his part and although the acting was not exactly topnotch no one in this movie did a bad job at all is one of my favorite movies and was ripped off when it came to the oscars i dont know how people can hate this movie say it was bad or tell me that it was boring i would watch again any day go see this movie stars out of 2001rulz,reality
this movie is an instant classic i loved it it shows wwii in a very real way it doesnt mention the atrocities of hitler because they are already showed in so many movies instead it show the atrocities of war the first minutes of the movie are the most stunning that ive ever seen specially because its based on real events this movie show the soldiers of both bands  allies and germans  as human beings  this is refreshing because most war movies pictures one side as pure evil and the other side as the good guys specially wwii movies but this movie shows that not all german soldiers were jewhating hitlerloving killing machines with no soul  i liked shakespeare in love but i think this movie shouldve won the oscar it has everything you want in a movie good acting good story and good special effects the main characters are welldeveloped and you feel you know them if you ever cry at movies you will cryi would recommend it to anyone except children,reality
its easy to see why those who have not yet faced the task of grieving departed ones might see as sappy and feel manipulated by it there is little doubt that spielberg wants to impart strong feelings of tragedy and loss in this film  the same authentic tears that surface each day at the vietnam war memorial to my mind he evokes these feelings with as much if not more intensity than he did in schindlers listfew directors block a shot to serve feeling story and characters as well as the mature spielberg and in private he scores emotional bullseyes with devasting power unlike george lucas whose narrative skills have gotten rusty with disuse spielberg continues to work hard at his narrative thoughtfulness economy and authenticity in spielberg shows his mature pacing and mastery in numerous scenes   most notably in his shot coverage of the wordless scene in which privates mother realizes shes about to be notified about her sons spielbergs model here is not kellys heroes or other war films but the best years of our lives the lateforties academy award winner that best enshrined and exorcised the postwar experience for wwii vets and families unlike that epic private deserved but was denied the best film oscar many cinematic virtues have been attributed to private that are to my mind unremarkable gritty realistic action is to be expected from any eight figure 90s battle film i award spielberg no points there subordinating plot momentum to explore characters episodically is risky but its still not a stretch what is a stretch and would be for any director is achieving the utter respect reverence and quietude the average viewer  leaves the theater with just fifteen minutes after the sensenumbing climactic battle scenes are over this is primarily because privates opening and closing scenes bracket the cinematic tour de force with a much quieter and stillcurrent personal reality how many were saved in similar sacrifices how did my own father or grandfather survive when we realize what is truly owed were all humbled the open and pliant soul who has known grief and loss firsthand and who watches this masterwork cannot help but reconsider the sacrifice of a generation of young men  and the connection between those young men on the screen and the very real 75 year old men still walking our streetsit is this accomplishment this bridge that spielberg built between three generations of twentieth century americans that impresses me its a film that had to come when it did  for us living now although future generations may benefit from watching private by then the generation portrayed on screen will have passed away for now they are still with us and have stories to tell private awakened my gratitude to themcall private sappy if you like i know it left a fingerprint on my heart deeper and more meaningful than et ever did for those of you who dont get it i hope youll ask your grandparents and listen to their stories while theyre still alive maybe youll relate more personally to the material,reality
i must admit i watched this with apprehension as i firmly believe that tom hanks should stick to doing comedy the burbs dragnet and spielberg hasnt made film better than jaws in his whole career  anyway this film is overrated  sure the opening scenes are shocking and brutal  this is to show what war was really like apparently  we all know what war was really like so who caresspielberg cannot decide whether to make a totally serious war film or a sentimental heart tugging oscar winner  so he tries both  the comedy of the bumbling interpreter is out of place and the snipers amazing shot through the sight of another snipers gun is plain ridiculous  even more so the feelgood ending made me want to vomitbizarrely seems to be a shameless rip off of the eastwoodsutherland savalas classic kellys heroes  the end scenario is too similar to be coincidence with the tank ambush the radio music and the sniper in the bell tower  i spent the whole 2 and whatever hours thinking its kellys heroes but without the humour or the superb actingwhile is highly watchable it is by no means a classicwatch kellys heroes instead,reality
ok  i admit it you americans did liberate my grandad from a prison camp in germany in wwii but please why do you always make us brits out to be upper class fools  i mean in this film mr spielberg decided we all would come strolling out and say oh dear there seems to be a jolly awful rumpus going on lets have a cup of tea and a crumpet while the americans single handedly win the war for us yeah maybe a large exaggeration but im sure many of you will have gotten the idea  apart from this the film was fair if not slightly over hyped and in honesty tom hanks grated a bit then again he always does in my mind  it would be unfair to call it a poor film because the film making does have its merits and apart from that is an extremely entertaining film,reality
writing an anti war book is like writing an anti glacier book a sort of quote from slaughterhouse 5commendable for its use of realistic ground level shaky camera angles in the beginning and end battle scenes this film really does bring the horrors of war home the depiction of the unfair randomness of the conflict and the gruesome results are truly superb on a par with certain scenes in hamburger hill and stalingrad in its ability to discourage volunteering for military service i defy anyone to leave the theatre after seeing this film and not feel as though someone has really spoken out to themhowever this graphic depiction of war does come with a fair amount of hollywood baggage noteworthy scenes include the ones with the present day private officers back in america and the bit where hanks says savingprivateryan which i objected to on general principles despite these scenes this film still has to rank up there with some of the best executed anti war films around i would personally recommend stalingrad more strongly if only because it had the same shock factor and came without the cheese,reality
although i really liked this movie i dont think it captured the true horrors of war like oliver stones platoon  the first dday scene was great but to me the movie kinda died off after that  there may not have been as much blood and guts in platoon as in but i think platoon was a stronger war movie,reality
finally i saw the picture and actually can not share all the enthusiasm of those sticking an movie of the year label to it cause i can compare i wish you could see one of war movies made by russian filmmakers i believe we have thousands of them and each of them overtops in sense of movie in sense of story behind the screen in sense of tragedy courage brotherhood  of course is the perfectly tailored flick empowered with technically advanced filming and extranatural gutswrenching effects to let you practically feel all the disgust of the slaughter but this is not what makes war so horrible unfortunately fails to deliver the message among movies about wwii this one definitely belongs to b box its flat and onesided its like trying to imagine a holiday looking at the resort ad postcard bright colorful rich exotic but tasteless something you can not touch feel enjoy remember what we see in is true but its not war,reality
every possible thing has been said about this film but lets accumulate the dissent some more  no doubt the first bit is pretty realistic and moving and deserves acclaim but after that the plot gets lame and the acting even worse  and whats this nonsense with the american flag  oh well if they want horror cruelty and moral vacuum symbolised by the stars and stripes thats fine by me  but it turned what was potentially a worthwhile film into a bit of a farce although empty headed middle america will appreciate it  i was never sure about tom hanks but now its clear that hes only good at sitting round with his head in a spin   save the first half hour for excellent documentry footage to teach the ones in power about the cruel nature of war  save the rest of it for serialisation on daytime tv,reality
another example of hype making people think a movie is better then it really isthis movie was clichd in the worst waysmy friend and i were laughing at the beach landing scenes i mean the guy getting shot in the helmet then taking it off and getting shot again was the most predictable amateurish scene everi mean anyone with half a brain knows that nothing can approach the true horror that was dday or any battle in wwii why does spielberg get all the credit for it when coppola and kubrick and yes even stoneuugghhhdid it so much better but still couldnt come closei would even venture to say that the thin red line was a better movie then this and i didnt like that eitheredit after several years and several more viewings spr may not be as bad as i thought at first but it is still nowhere near as good as it gets credit for,reality
riveting initial 30 minutes followed by some extremely poor acting most notably on the part of young mr damon  predictable plot manoeuvres all ridiculously bookended by spielberg sentimentalitythe scene that affected me for some days however involved the youth hitler knife  the intimacy of that death still frightens me  yes i was moved but another scene to be endured nonetheless,reality
i dont like war movies at the best of times but i just couldnt see that this film served any purpose but to make the audience disturbed and deeply moved at the end of the film the performances were ok but nothing special its films like these that in my opinion glorify war it may have been shown to be horrific but do we really need to see it and how are we expected to cope if it were ever to happen again when films like this existif you want to see a good film find a comedy or scifi you can watch the film and either laugh or see it as a possibility of a future a war movie is showing us events of a terrible part of our past something that does not need to be depicted in such a manner on the big screen we know war is a bad thing just film simply disturbs its audienceas you can tell i really didnt like this film 010,reality
peoplecharacters includedcannot remember things that they themselves didnt actually witness or experience  as a flashback by ed burnss character this screenplay would fine except for the dillydallying that occurs immediately after the dday sequence and the moral mushiness of helping your fellow man out of a living hell only to earn a ticket home but as a flashback by private as clearly intended by the melodramatic modernday frame this screenplay would no doubt get roundly criticized by any introductorylevel university screenwriting or creative writing workshop  this was definitely not the heir to schindlers list,reality
my son rented last night and i watched it even though i had no real interest to do so because i had heard that steven spielberg forgot to include a black or hispanic in the movie if he did his homework he would see that during one of these major invasions a black medic was awarded the congressional medal of honor for treating other wounded soldiers though he himself was constantly being wounded as he kept going from soldier to soldierone thing though in the beginning of the movie while the old man is visiting the grave of his fallen comrade you can see the real name of a hispanic soldier by the name of martinez or ramirez as i recall on one of the cross i guess steven spielberg over looked that one on another note others have commented about our allies not being in this movie and i can understand why spielberg did what he did but keeping us other americans out is a disgrace to all those blacks and hispanics that fought and died for this great country of ours if i was to meet mr movie maker himself i would ask him heywhat happened to us blacks and hispanics and if anyone else out there feels that what im saying is a crock of s well all i have to say is that im a vietnam combat wounded veteran and a hispanic at that i know what combat is and the fear that goes through your mind as you look for the enemy in the jungle and more when you find him you find yourself doing things you would never have imagined and how close you become to other soldiers whether they are blackredbrown white or green i must honestly saythough that i did enjoy the movie and felt sad when ever a soldier was killed for ive been there but being that this movie was to honor the world war two veteransalong with all other veteranswe forgive you spielberg,reality
the only film i could in honesty give a 10 to so far at the end the silence lasted and lasted and lasted i am not sure i could stand watching it againmaybe in a year or so,reality
ill keep this simpleis the real best picture of 1998i admit thisi loved shakespeare in love  but as i was walking out of the theater after seeing it i thought it was the secondbest movie i had seen in 98shakespeare didnt deserve best picture  why  because the film did nothing that couldnt be done in a play  everything that happened in that film could have been reproduced on a stage  and this may be considered a personal bias but a film that could honestly be a stage production should not be remotely competitive for film awards when its up against the likes of the shocking and fantastic film work ofadditionally i have another personal bias  i believe a best picture should transcend the material seen on screen  it should have an emotional impactit should touch the viewer in a way where it becomes much more than a movie for the viewer  and lets face it shakespeare was welldone but its only a welldone story that doesnt have much to say beyond the screen however i think we all know how much impact had beyond the actual film itselfthe academy got it wrong  period,reality
ok ok ok  i have seen this good movie as well as shakespeare in love  i think this years oscars were on target  i think sil was better than spr yes i was totally blown away by the opening scene  the end was powerful as well  the middle was boringthe difference between the two movies is in the writing and acting  sil is a very witty movie well acted  spr relies on technical wizardry to bring out the emotions  dont get me wrong the wizardry works in this movie and boy does it work  the writing in spr just wasnt there  the bonding was extremely forced  and the one thing that trivializes the emotional impact is the sentimental ending  i could not believe the fact that i was being told how to feel at the end of the movie  did we need the scene in the cemetery just to tell us that we should feel for this man  we already dowhile i agree with sil winning best picture i also agree with steven spielbergs directorial oscar  this man used the technilogical tools of filmmaking to give spr the impact that it doesi plan on buying both movies when they come out on dvd  spr will sound awesome on my home theaterif i had to rate both movies i would say spr is an 8 out of 10 versus sil a 9 out of 10,reality
this is the first movie ive seen that tom hanks handled remotely well many things made it better than most war movies but the final shootout was just like any other war movie  would all those guys really have been out there without helmets  did they have to take them off so we could tell which character was whichi know the english will be upset that there was no reference to the other nations taking part mostly because they ignore even the scottish in their view of the war between germany and england but thats no excuse for spielberg to leave out any reference to the many other nations taking part we dont have to have a whole series of characters but they could have been mentioned in the dialogue  some of the irish soldiers used as extras could have been australians or canadians or whateverseems like there was good reason to leave out the smoke on the beach but did it have to be replaced with the numerous fires that continued to burn during the pouring rainthe character of the corporal was well written and acted and the morphing at the end was good but i would have liked it more if geographical and historical details had been more accurate and the laws of physics hadnt been ignored,reality
just last summer i became a proud member of the united states army  as the son of a retired army officer and the grandson of a world war ii veteran this movie hit somewhat close to home    never before have i seen such a realistic portrayal of battle  anyone who sees this movie should keep in mind the sacrifice men and women have made for them and be reminded not to take simple everyday freedoms for granted  when cpt miller says to pvt earn this he is speaking to us all  we must never forget the cost at which our freedom was gained and never disgrace ourselves and our country,reality
firstly the lionisation of spielberg must stop  he hasnt made a classic film since jaws  and spr although interesting is by no means in that category my main problem with it comes from spielberg himself  as a previous user commented he contradicts himself with his attempt to unglorify war and yet plaster patriotic and nationalistic symbols all over the screen the war is pointless theme is a meritable one but in painting the us soldiers to be victims there is no thought to the feelings of the ordinary german soldiers who were surely experiencing the same fears  they are portrayed as ruthless coldblooded and evilalso spielberg would have us believe that us won the war on their own despite traipsing across french countryside for miles not one british canadian australian french etc soldier is seen  the bridge they defended at the end was actually in reality held by a joint angloamerican force spielbergs reputation is such that historical inaccuracies like these are damaging as for the opening scene yes it is involving spectacular scary and all the rest  but the camera techniques have been used before by kubrick and peckinpah etc  he is not a genius,reality
ok so i was obviously not part of wwii or any war for that matter even so i have seen some great war movies in my time that made me feel like i was actually there and going through the emotions and struggles that all soldiers experience in battleso why am i calling overrated when its been touted as the most realistic war movie ever made it just didnt have the emotion sure it looked grisly on the screen especially the first 15 minutes but i never got a sense that i was therethat i was feeling what tom hanks was feeling in fact i felt as if i were sitting in a movie theater watching a movie the special effects in the first 15 minutes were also very bad i cringed at the corniness whenever they had a scene with a downed soldier playing with his innards it looked more like spaghetti than intestines and was an obvious device for shock value which did not work one single bitthe story itself was interesting enough however it was very limited if you think about it the movie transformed itself from a dramatic war movie to a simple action flick about searching for an ordinary soldier and then taking on an entire german unit with 6 or 7 soldiers it reminded me more of rambo than an oscarnominated moviethe two best war movies i have ever seen both came out in the same year platoon and full metal jacket were real war movies i absolutely fell in love with platoon when i watched it i actually felt like i was there in the jungle with charlie company and i knew all the soldiers in my troop it was an experience never really puts you there instead it drags you along and makes you follow a bunch of guys walking around the whole movie looking for this private guythe movie was important because it was about wwii and because steven spielberg was involved spielberg has reached the status where he can do no wrong and everything he comes out with is considered a masterpiece if he were to make a film about origami everyone would suddenly embrace origami as the greatest lost art of our time and there would be conventions and books and tributes about how great origami isis a product of a wellrespected director and actor making the best out of their reputations as a film it is certainly not the best movie ive seen and even not the best ive seen last year life is beautiful and dark city takes the cake on that it is more of an action flick than a human drama and mroe about making money than it is about warwhile i still enjoyed the movie i enjoyed it on the same plane as a regular action flick if put next to a film like life is beautiful or platoon it certainly takes a back seat,reality
wow thats all i could say as i left the theater after seeing this movie is what film making is all about as i walked out of the dark theater with my grandfather who experienced the horror of omaha beach first hand over 50 years ago i turned to him and said was it really like that what he told me was just about the best way to describe this movie you can get he said mathew that movie was just about as close to war as you can get without the fear of taking a bullet i must say that stephen speilberg has outdone himself once again not only was the best war film ever made im trying to decide if i think its the best movie ever made of course the movies highest points are the brilliantly realistic war scenes especially the omaha beach scene but the visuals arent its only good parts the story is quite well thought out and the reactions from the charecters are very realistic ie the soldiers arent too happy about having to risk their lives for one private who no one has even heard of the charecters are very well developed and you really get to know and love or hate each and every one of their personalities individually speilberg got his point across so well that by the end youre screaming kill some nazis then kill more nazis then after that kill even more nazis believable story amazing visuals top notch acting superb directing touching dialog all in all a true masterpiece see this film at all costs i recommend it to everyone,reality
when i go to the movies i expect to be transported  when i watch or any other spielberg movie such as schindlers list i feel strangely detached from everything  ofttimes his movies have that epic feel but they dont seem to have captured spielbergs passion do they while i was watching the famed first 20 minutes all i could do was look on at the screen almost indifferent to the violence  maybe its because im growing up in a society obsessed with violence and bloodshed but i didnt feel like i was there  i felt like i was watching it 50 years after the fact and it was just very ineffectual to me  the other wwii movie life is beautiful however was created as a much more intimate film with less violence and affected me much more than and schindlers list did  i hope in spielbergs next film he puts the story and the characters ahead of the spectacle of it all,reality
is a film containing ironic humor this is a unique perspective on war and although it emulates the longest day it is completely original in the level of realism i give the movie five stars it is a timeless historical film that should never be forgotten if you havent seen this in the theater yet find out where its playing and see it dont just wait for the video cassette releaseever onward,reality
i wasnt all that enthusiastic about paying to see this when it first came out but as a friend lent me a video cd i took the time to watch it the result a major disappointmentthe story is all over the place not telling a continuous narrative but a series of escapades that do not remotely further the storyline instead they show some ambiguous moralising that simultaneously condemns and celebrates warfare the story has very little new or original to say beyond the old chestnuts of war being hell and its corruption of humanitythe acting is also fairly lazy tom hanks seems so lacking in talent that gives the impression that he couldnt act his way out of a paper bag and matt damon and the rest of the cast are so laidback that i suspect most of them are acting in something else on another soundstage the opening beach landing and most of the violent encounters during the remainder of the film are somewhat ludicrous people burning to death three feet from water a sniper being shot by a bullet travelling down his scope into his eye mellishs death it doesnt matter if its realistic it still looks bizarre the production is quite good and suitably colourless but scenery a good film doth not makein summary this is a poor film in which high production values fail to hide a feeble script and indifferent acting but then almost any film could be guaranteed a big us gross and a clutch of oscars when its about american soldiers being heroic it is therefore not surprising that frank darabont had his name removed from the script had i been in his position i would have boycotted the damn thing,reality
am i alone in thinking that tom hanks is not a great actor he is just not convincing in this role and is made to look very ordinary when compared to the performances of the supporting players whose role in this film has been unfairly ignored it is a sad day when ted danson makes a more convincing army captain than mr hanksthis is a good movie but it is not a classic the battle scenes probably are the most realistic ever filmed but once they are over you are left with a fairly standard war movie with nothing new to say sure war is hell but if you have watched any war movie made since apocalypse now then surely you know that already the view of war from the perspective of the common soldier has been done many times before and in my mind much better in films such as das boot stalingrad and restoration i hope that those who are so impressed with take time to check out these films i would also like to say that as a brit i did not find the so called nationalistic tone of the film offensive i dont think that it is an accident that the american flags are shown to be pale and washed out i think that this simple image is an  effective way of showing a pride in the american achievements in wwii whilst appreciating the tragic loss of life and perhaps an acknowledgement that atrocities were not just the preserve of the germans what i did find offensive was the insulting bookend sections which sledgehammered the message home perhaps if mr spielberg reads the negative comments about these sections in the imdb he might realise that we film goers have more intelligence than he gives us credit for and will stop using such unnecessary sentimental devices in his films in general this film felt like a roller coaster where the biggest drop is the first one its exhilerating as hell at the beginning but then you never quite reach the same hights again and end up coasting to a disappointing end,reality
the film means well and for the first half hour is indeed riveting but is done in due to spielbergs clumsiness in time the battle scenes begin to simply play out like a video game and why the triumphant music when jeremy davies kills the german soldier is spielberg trying to declare all germans to be pond scum and deserving of death probably not but its poorly directed and ambiguous and regardless of the absurdly jingoistic sentiments of some of my fellow countrymen here which are not worth responding to the us flag at the end was tacky and implied american superiority even my greatuncle a proud wwii veteran agreed that this was unnecessary spielberg may have meant to shown the true hell that war is but he has inadvertently made a prowar film american entry in wwii was inevitable and necessary but its nothing to celebrate,reality
undoubtedly the success of this movie in terms of awards and nominations stems from the cliches of the lets make everyone aware of the horror of the war etc  although this may be a very altruistic objective it does not imply that the movie has a good story or that the script is artistic or even cleverthe story line would have been more suitable for a tv show like combat or mash rather than for a fullblown threehour movie  it seems that the whole objective of the movie was to depict with extreme realism the omaha beach situation and to do so the movie makers had to find some movie plot regardless of what it might be  in fact despite of the absolutely incredible vividness of omaha beach i started to get really bored  mr spielberg seemed to exploit that ad infinitum  same could be said of the bridge battlefollowing the same political correctness track the way that germans are depicted is unfair at least  there was a clear intention in the movie to show the soldiers are traitors and sanguinary eg the knife scene where the americans where all nice and warm eg the kid who was a translator full of love and careoverall i was quite disappointed by this movie  after watching it it really made me wonder on what basis globeacademy awards are given  may be on the technical quality of the movie and their pc bent but certainly not on the grounds of its cleverly designed script and plotthis movie falls miles behind other realistic movies about the war such as apocalypse now,reality
in lots of movies and documentaries war is being depicted as something glorious as a time and a place where mostly goodlooking young men can prove how brave they are spr would be different so i expected in this movie spielberg really would show his audience that war is horrific not heroicthe first half hour of the movie really was shattering people who still believe war is an exciting event for young wouldbe heroes think tom cruise in top gun should be obligated to watch the omaha beach landingscenes because it really makes you experience that war is hell a sickening horrible hellof course you cant fill a three hour movie solely with scenes like that of the omaha beach landing to make a good movie you need more like good actors a capable crew convincing special effects and the most important an interesting story well no one will dispute the fact that spr technically is a masterpiece the camerawork the special effects the sound they are all overwhelmingly goodin spite of all these plusses i really was disappointed by at least two hours of spr because it missed the most important thing a movie needs an interesting story the characters werent convincing i dont blame the actors for that they all did a good job it was the script that i blame i never forgot i was watching a movie with madeup characters when a movie is really good i tend to get so absorbed by the characters that they become real to me that i start to symphatize deeply with them this never happened while i was watching spr i never felt anything more for captain miller and his men then i felt for all the other anonymous soldiers you see in this movie and the story the search for private even bored me sometimes there were just a few scenes like the one in which the men were reading the nametags of the fallen soldiers that were really compellingthree things about spr i really disliked first there is the way the german soldier known as steamboat willie was portrayed why is the only german we got to know a little bit such an awkward silly guy im pretty sure lots of german soldiers were ordinary men who didnt want this war any more then anyone else did they must have been just as afraid as the american soldiers they must have felt the same pain and horror but thats not the way it feels like in spr the overall feeling you get is americans are good and germans are bad second there is the fight for the bridge this kind of stuff the brave heroes who against all odds succeed in defeating the enemy well this has been done so many times before this kind of clich was exactly what i expected spr to avoid third there is the point of view you are made to believe that the omaha beachscenes are seen as the memories of the old man on the graveyard then in the last scene you learn that that man never was there i felt manipulated in a negative wayit was very hard for me to grade spr technically its an absolute 10 the omaha beachscene was extremely good and i think its a real homage to the veterans who were there but there were too many things i did not like i decided to give this movie a 7 out of 10,reality
all since i was a kid i used to envy the soldiers fighting against hitler and wish for being one of those attacking at normandie in 44 but now that ive seen save private im glad i wasnt therespeaking as a field medic of the norwegian stormtroopers i wish ill never go to war because if it is as the veterans say that the movie didnt come close to the terror of the dday i cant imagine the terror they experiencedi sat the first halfhour with adrenaline pumping and ducking for cover and the rest of the film my heart pounded harder than it has in yearsspielberg has realy done his best here ive admired his work before but this movie is brilliant,reality
a poor movie spielberg has a limited emotional compass and boxed himself into an impossible corner with the opening carnage after that he needed to make a serious movie of the calibre of all quiet on the western front or la grande illusion to avoid bathos as it is the film meanders hopelessly unable to decide whether to take itself seriously its a shame since hanks can act better than here directed and spielberg showed in schindlers list that he can handle a serious theme with telling economy for me the truly bathetic scene was when the band of motley misfits decides to do a john wayne and kill as many germans as possible this erodes the impact of the opening scene,reality
spielbergs can perhaps be viewed as the aesthetic masterpiece that all of his previous endeavors in film has been working toward  private from a purely cinematographic point of view is an absolute masterpiece an exploration of the uses of cinematography in a studio film must be applauded for doing so however the script leaves something to be desired  the characters are cardboard cutouts you know a character is when you can describe him in a few words and the fact that the theme is practically drilled into our skulls by the bookending modern day sequences should be insulting to the intelligence of every audience member watching spielberg deserves applause for his technique in but how it got filmed in the first place on the basis of its script is beyond me,reality
lets begin with the in your face gore guts on film dont bother me and im sure it was historically accurate but as a movie it played out like a predictable horror film after the first few heartpumping minutes who didnt see it coming from a mile away when a guy tom hanks is dragging gets blown in half pure shock value not story valuealso the film doesnt look good from scene to scene we endure a barrage of styleseverything from choppy pov whose to grand panoramics i assume the drastic changes in cinematography are meant to represent character experience but i found them a major distraction to becoming absorbed in the filmcharacters are poorly defined and even stereotypical the hothead who doesnt want to follow orders the 98 lb weakling whos never shot a gun weve never seen those before the only thing that really surprised me was that he didnt find his inner strength by the endthe modernday bookends were quite bothersome as well this device rarely works because it does nothing more than hinder the audience from being in the moment i also had a very hard time empathizing with the character who appears in those scenes i wont spoil it for anyone who hasnt yet seen it were not given a reason to believe he would feel so strongly later in life so i simply couldnt share in his dramathere were certainly some great moments in the film especially in the final battle sequencethe stabbing death of one of the soldiers and another shooting at a tank with his pistol in desperation overall though the film just didnt flow and i wasnt drawn ini think audiences are confusing what they think was a shockingly realistic war movie with what was actually just plain shocking for a spielberg movie for a good war movie ill take platoon anyday,reality
opens amidst the flurry of panic and madness of omaha beach the us troops trying to make it past the shore and up to the elevations of the enemy who fire machine guns at the defenceless troops whilst sitting behind fortifications its a graphic powerful stirring and extremely violent 25 minutes an unrelenting barrage of gunsmoke blood and gore it captures the futility of war through its no holds barred methodstom hanks plays captain john miller assigned to find a missing private by the name of whose three brothers had recently been killed he takes a team with him to find and along the way runs into a lot of troubleunfortunately the film trails off into the american patriotism rigmarole that seems rudimentary in each war film becomes boring in the middle of the movie with contrived blatant war is so pointless and this shouldnt be happening sort of thingthe finale is very violent and doesnt have as much impact as the opening sequence the film loses its impact due to the overlong middleseven out of ten,reality
i had quite a few laughs during the movie it could have been tears too especially at the end where spielberg shows his nationalistic view to comfort his compatriots at times i couldnt look at the screen anymore and not because of the bloody scenes when tom hanks says his last words make sure youre worth it only the nice lady next to me prevented me from stepping out of the theater in my opinion the movie shows the sentimental stuff that is typical of so many american made commercial movies it was so ridiculous the germans outnumbered the enemy but even after 4 years of fierce combat training they werent able to conquer a piece of land defended by a dozen marines instead they fell like dominoesif you didnt like it either for the same reasons try watching stalingrad 1993 directed by joseph vilsmaier no false sentiment in that onewhat i quite liked about spr were the landings on the beach and the germans actually speak german for a change try watching dday to berlin by george stevens filmed during 1944 45 and in full colour not easy to get your hands on but very impressive,reality
this film has variously been described as the best war movie and as the best spielberg movie those who describe it thus can only never have seen another war film or another spielberg filmexcept for the dday landings which are amongst the most graphic war scenes ever seen and which should be compulsory viewing for all those who believe the old lie dulce et decorum est pro patria mori it is long and drawn out it fails to ignite an emotional rapport with the audience who sit as bored voyeurs wishing they were elsewherewhile it is as not as gungho as some films and for this reason cannot be rated the worst war movie ever it can be rated the worst spielberg ever it is not worthy of the person who produced many wonderful films right from duel up to schindlers listthe tragedy is he will probably win an oscar for it2 out of 10,reality
theres a lot said about this film and most of it is completely justified steven speilberg has made a new milestone in the portrayal of the horrors of war the opening combat scene is probably the most graphic and moving battle scene ever with the final climactic skirmish taking second place the film also contains some excellent character work which works so well in war filmshowever there were a few things for me that stopped this film short of being the best war film firstly was the blatant americaness of the film there was little or no reference to the canadian and british troops that took part in the invasion also being british i find all the starsandstripes patriotism very cliched and tiresomethe biggest letdown i think was in private himself unlike the majority of the people in the film he seemed to be completely devoid of believable character i found it disappointing to wait most of the film to see him and find that he had been plucked almost straight from the filmmakers az of likeable 20yearoldsstill the film was excellent hanks and sizemore pulled off their parts brilliantly and the film had me and all my friends genuinely moved i think that schinders list is still speilbergs best so far though,reality
this is a silly movie spielberg should stick to special effects for fantasy movies  his one foray into real life drama that worked schindlers list was fine but this is too much  it is full of holes what was the point of confronting the first who was not the it indulges in highly improbable events to prop up the frail and flimsy script coming across the real by accident in a fight with a german half trackand resorts to american false heroics to find somewhere to stop the fighting american fighters blast the german tank as it is about to shoot our hero  this movie takes a noble message reinforces it with stunning special effects then shoves it in a vacuous and pretentious story that simply falls over and the cast dont cut it war is hell so is this movie,reality
first let me start with this comment is not the greatest war film ever madenot even closeit is however a very moving and affronting action filmit is a great homage to all those older world war 2 films and to other war films of different conflictsi say action film because it makes no attempt to explain war or focus on issues other than to shock us with its brutality in the opening 20 minutesthat is what jarred methe first twenty minutes represented what the film should have beenthe middle section were what it wasa sentimental cliched journey through old war picturessure it was the goriest but hamburger hillplatoon and dear americaletters home from vietnam take the cake for the best accounts of war and socialpoltical atttudes towards italso watch deer hunter for a powerful look at the effect of war on the common soldierthe only thing that saved from being an average film for me was the excellent performances and the handling of the jeremy davies characterwho thankfully was saved fro ma cliched endingapart from thatthis poorly writtensloppilyin partslike hanks giving a tearful speech when his men gather behind him scenedirected yet wonderfully shotas always by januz kaminiskifilm was little more than a sentiemental entertaining romp through old war films discounting the brutal opening scenes pscant wait to see how mallick handles it in the thin red line,reality
if a powerful 25 minute opening sequence defines a great movie then i guess that this is one unfortunately i was always under the impression that plot was also important as is some sort of realism in the plot line or did they really just disregard orders during the war and ramble around doing the right thing after some democratically resolved squad level rebellion by the way where were all the other nations soldiers i know they landed at different beaches but i could have sworn it wasnt just the us that landed in normandythe typically spielberg beginning and ending did nothing for me except to invoke the feeling of here we go againthe movie is watchable  has some strong action footage but in my opinion is not oscar material i suspect however that the red white  blue smaltz sequences will win over the american voters,reality
i saw the other day and if you ask me the movie was very good but not great  yes it by far was the most graphic and realistic war movie to date but it seemed to lack in certain places  i did not agree that the us would risk eight men for the life of one and the movie seemed to drag on in the middle sections  however i give it 8 stars out of 10,reality
visually this is the best war movie ever made and everyone should see it because for younger generations its the closest well ever get to understanding that war  however has the dumbest plot ive ever seen and that takes a lot away from the movie  its really unfortunate that a director of spielbergs undeniable talent would waste such a powerful film by using such a stupid story line  the fact that so many soldiers had to die  not only that but one of the best generals tom hanks was taken from the battlefield where his services would have been much more important  in order to find one man  i would not be surprised to see this movie sweep the oscars but based on the weakness of the screenplay alone this movie should never get the honor of best picture,reality
from the moment spr was announced i had a feeling that it was mostly hype and little substance this feeling was confirmed after the first battle sceneno one doubts the technical brilliance of spielberg a movie however needs more than special effects to be memorablewar movies like platoon and apocalypse have it all  and i suspect will better stand the test of timewhat i feel that spr failed to achieve is to sustain the dramatic impact between war scenes we were subjected to all manner of light hearted banter irony coincidence and schmaltz but then again this is a spielberg trademark  he also did it in schindlers listthe plot was highly predictable hence there was little suspense one became immune to watching the blood and guts after the first hour by this time the film had nothing more to offera fellow contributor wroteto those who thought the film didnt have a good plot  what film school did you say you went towell it didnt have a good plot and i didnt go to any film school but i know what i like,reality
this film would have done better as a documentary the action is great and the depiction of war is excellent but the story is barely adequate and hardly matches its contextthe idea of sacrificing many for the one is greatly overplayed and many of the scenes in which characters discuss the morality of war seem painfully contrived add to this a waving american flag and some cheesy warmusic from williams and you get a film which is great but could have been fantastic,reality
theres no doubt in my mind that is technically one of the best films ever janusz kaminski should be congratulated for his cinematography especially in the opening sequence the sound effects are amazing and i for one was particularly impressed by the part where the sound of raindrops on leaves imitated the sound of guns firingits no understatement to say that tom hanks is brilliant he has proven himself to be the most versatile actor in hollywood without exception if the hype is true that is up against the truman show to sweep the oscars and hanks is up against jim carrey for best actor then and hanks should win hands downyet all the same i felt severely disappointed maybe even cheated by the movie beneath the main plot a sort of subplot developed in which the audience is given glimpses into the internal emotions and mental turmoil of all involved especially captain miller at least thats what i perceived the shaking hand and the im a schoolteacher bit to mean the audience is sucked into thinking that regardless of how many die and whether or not is saved this subplot is going to lead to spielbergs big thematic message his conclusion his comment at the end but that resolution never comes and there seems to be no point to the film nothing its trying to say while that in itself is not disappointing as many films have no message what is frustrating is being led to feel as though a lesson is coming and then not getting itin terms of the violence i dont think the omaha beach landing sequence is particularly gruesome at least no more graphic than the part in the middle where millers men apply pressure to a stomach wound and you feel the victim suffering as he turns white and diesand not being an american but an australian there has been a lot made of the socalled americanism of the film how no black american soldiers seem to be mentioned and how the other allied troops are forgotten about but i tend to think thats no more than pedanticism taking a stereotypical swipe at a film where such bias has no glaring impactso in short is technically brilliant but it still left a very hollow feeling 8 out of 10,reality
this is definitely spielbergs finest this film uses the elements of drama action comedy and horror to create a most spectacular movie which depicts the horrors of what war really is wanna turn off someone from the idea of going to war make them watch this,reality
is a terrific cinematic achievement its a great combat film very violent and often relentless with battle scenes that lift the genre to  new heights is a classic shoot em up film or should that be shoot em off film one that will always be compared favourably at least in terms of the fight scenes to other modern american battle movies like platoon apocalypse now or the deer huntera squad of american infantrymen lead by captain miller tom hanks having somehow survived the carnage of the d day landing on omaha beach in northern france are given the task of  finding private matt damon whos three brothers have all been killed in action in other battles the army have decided to try to evacuate the last remaining brotherthe squad have reservations about this mission feeling that risking eight of them just for one private is a bit rich but off they go searching for this lost paratrooper behind enemy lines in a very hot war these men are battle hardened except for their translator corporal upham jeremy davies who has yet to fire a gun in anger along the way two are killed raising the stakes considerably private when and if they find him had better be worth itis striking on a number of fronts overwhelming realism is forced on the audience in all of the battle scenes beginning with a whole landing craft full of soldiers slaughtered in seconds by machine gun bullets when the door of the craft drops even before they hit the beach and thats only the beginning throughout the film a hand held camera jerks and ducks with the soldiers as they try to just survive limbs and intestines are lost and maimed the horror and bedlam of war has never been portrayed as graphicallylots of new cinematic ground is broken for a start the slaughter by americans of prisoners of war in the heat of battle becomes justifiable or at least understandable in this film i cant remember american soldiers murdering unarmed assailants on film before not like they do in i can see now that the viciousness of the situation the deaths of comrades makes a mockery of the geneva convention when the bullets are flying on a battle field these things arent right of course but they are understandableas such its salient that this was a second world war battle movie its hard to imagine this sort of  film being made about american soldiers in vietnam or iraq for example its still arguable that the yanks were fighting a relatively just war in europe in response to the invasion of the rest of europe by hitlers army but it would be difficult for such claims to be made of many of the usas more recent invasionssteven speilberg the director of is steeped in the traditions of hollywood and wasnt slow to use the conventions of the old propaganda post war films the multiethnic mix has been resurrected amongst the squad the wise cracking brooklynite edward burns the jewish american adam goldberg the solid middle american sergeant tom sizemore and the sharp shooting and unfortunately bible quoting southern boy barry pepper are hauled out yet againoften war films are coming of age movies but jeremy davies as the aesthete translator is the only character in who develops and grows the rest are already established as warriors tom hanks plays the captain very effectively indeed with a great deal of restraint and i would imagine that he will be nominated for yet another academy awardthe american flag is unfurled and waved with more than a little enthusiasm in which is a tad trying for some non americans but again this seems irrelevant because is essentially a battle movie and an exciting one but of course the only traitorous individual in sight is a germanperhaps its a mistake to expect too much subtlety from speilberg anyway steven speilberg strengths lie with the visual hes uncomfortable with character development conversation and the variance of personalities schindlers list another of his films and the one most likely to be compared with was devastating for its audience but that was because of the slaughter the heartlessness of the huge massacre that was the holocaust it was painted with a broad brush on an immense canvasthe same can be said of we care for the way that some of the characters die but there are just too many of them this is spielbergs triumph in and also its weakness if spielberg had been able to make us care very much about whether private was saved of not then would have been even more magnificent,reality
i saw spr and felt ill after 5 minutes for anyone like me who suffers from motion sickness be warned the handheld camera shots will make you feel decidedly queasy i spent the entire film feeling ill and still felt ill the next morningi would love to have really enjoyed the film but it was simply not possible,reality
it is a good film but from the appearance of the film you would think that europe is full of americans since they landed on dday themselves and meet a few french folk and some german soldiers and pows  the film is far too patriotic with the american flag at the start and the end with spielbergs family coming from pow camps during the second world war camps i though he might of had a less us view of wwii  it could have been one of the best films ever made but after the start with the horrific beach landings it never achieved those heights again,reality
the 20 first minutes of are among the one of the most dazzling sequences in the history of motion picture ive remembered particularly sergei eisenteins potemkin  perhaps because of the handheld shaken camera or because of the reality of the scenes but unfortunately spielberg hasnt got to  or hasnt wished to  develop the madness of the war in his movie the misorganization of the operations could have been deeply developed the consequences of the star wars between patton and montgomery could have been shown implicating both for part of the useless death of thousands of young men and the disorientation itself of the soldiers could have been better exploitedalso an annoying series of cliches runs during all the movie the soldier that has feelings and gets killed because of them the coward changed to a hero in the end of the battle the guytobesavedthatshouldbeamoronbutitsnot the arrival of the cavalry in the very last moment and last but not least the america brings back home their children motto disgustingits also annoying to see  or better speaking not to see  the participation of the french resistance that gave valious information to the allies and fought the nazis from inside with their guerrilla tactics but who cares according to spielberg the americans would have won anywayfinally this is the third movie that is released by the director in the 1851 aspect ratio probably to be better adapted for the dvd technology coming soon the screen ends being too small for a movie like thisif was meant to be an antiwar film it has falled kilometers from this objective apocalypse now is far more efficient this way spielberg is yet to release a great movie after schindlers list,reality
yet another hollywood product where an incredible amount of money is spent on stars special effects huge sets anything but story the plot in spr is just too lame if the intention is to show the pointlessness of war then the story should be absurd  not just stupid read catch 22spielberg is good some parts of the movie are great but that doesnt help the melodrama is still there people tell me that spr is an antiwar film i dont agree the battle scenes are really repulsive  but  an eternal glory is still offered to the brave american heroes and the germans prove to be bad guys  all of themi think that spr is worth seeing for a few amazing battlescenes spielbergs ability to tell stories in pictures rather than words and for its very good sound not for much else,reality
not a bad film with just one problem  wasnt britain involved in the 2nd world war somewhere  oh no i forgot the americans won it single handed,reality
sorry but a first viewing leaves me feeling totally overrated nonmovie i didnt like the onscreen format too low aspect ratio the size of omaha and normandy were not there the initial scenes which were supposed to be so stark all this preview hype about veterans freaking out well im sorry if they did but i didnt see how spielbergs psychology was so easy to see already in the initial moments instead of hitting you with a big build up as is done in ordinary scare movies he just hits you when youre least expecting it  and knowing that you can read the surprises and the horrors that hes supposed to deliver like an open book so much for realismnor was there much vastness to the dday assault memories ofs book on screen were much more convincing from that viewpoint at least omaha was a terrible disaster  and vast as well and three allied boats on screen do not really do the trickhanks was excellent of course they all were sizemore damon who couldnt be drawn into the story but watching the aftermath a la schlindler  no i do not find this kind of storytelling convincingseveral critics have hailed this movie as spielbergs best ever i find it hard to agree  although i wouldnt know which movie to pick in its place  as i do not think spielberg is a real auteur by any stretch of the imagination or ever could be he is imminently successful but his is the big shot the opposite of ingemar bergman who says kill your darlings he can film he can see the shot but he cannot create harsh words and perhaps a bit overdone but it seems accurate at this momentwhich is not to say i did not enjoy the movie of course i did it was an excellent movie well told accurate depictions for the most part astounding acting all around  it just wasnt the it was cracked up to be its reputation bloated it all out of proportion it is not spielbergs best movie though it may be close it is not  i firmly believe right now  an academy award winner either which is a shame for tom hanks who has worked so hard and been such a convincing actor through so many memorable performances perhaps his time  his third oscar  will yet come,reality
wasnt really up to its reputation the movie did have its moments and merits but sadly most of those merits were on the technical side the effects and the setups were great but that does not tell much of the movie itself except that a lot of money was burned while doing it so most of the things that money could buy were done beautifully but the movie didnt really have too much to offer on the other areasi left the theatre wondering what on earth were they trying to tellsay to me with that movie the first half hour of the movie was good enough to stand on its feet showing the madness of the war but after that the movie started to stall there was a lot of useless and overlong scenes that didnt really add anything to the movie except maybe a little frustration for the viewer length is not a bad thing for a movie as long as the creators have something to say or to show in there seemed not to betechnically beautiful very violent okay its a war movie so maybe it is acceptable and rather empty movie i just hope that it is not becoming a habit of praising these overlong dramamovies where a fictional story is placed into a historical context,reality
i wonder why the press loves that starting scene of the landing of the allied in the normandy the first person camera was shaking so much that i was quite literally thrown out of the scene and this just went on when miller and his team engaged this german apc or whatever on a green field with flowers that said lets continue the good things about the movie were the story idea made it possible to blank out any strategical or tactical aspects of war which either divert the watcher or justifies war itself lost bla but saved blabla  at least up to a certain point the value of that bridge was only outlined with the one of two remaining intact ones the movie features also very moving graphical effects by that i mean wounds lost body parts outflowing intestines and also audio effects like the noise of the tanks in the beginning of the german attack on that bridge i hope you know what i mean some nice ideas like the rain drops splashing onto the leaves making you think that its like the sound of gunfire which turns out to be true afterwards and others which were tragicomical soldier takes off his helmet after it luckily deflected a bullet and is promptlybut i dont like the movie actually i hate spielberg for this goddamn movie pardon the term the very scene i mean is when a german and an american soldier fight attack on bridge on the first level of one of the houses and the german pulls out his knife and happens to be on top of his enemy and what then happens must be told in full as i remember it the silent whimpering of the soldier as the blade cuts slowly through the fabric of his jacket and then on and on and on and all the time the german whispers give up you dont have a chance it well be easier for you give up it be will easier  shhh shhh until the blade has fully made its way through chest and heart and the soldier is dead no bursting out you goddamn nazi i never give up no ha ruthless defender of socalled democracy receive your true punishment or whatever no two people forced to kill each other and only one can win this scene is still in my mind all the time and i do hope that it will fade somewhen but lets cut out that personal stuff of mine  the movie was great in a way when those tanks are coming the little hill behind which the americans take cover sliding down by the trembling of the ground captain miller pulling a soldier after him at the landing whose legs are blown away and miller does not realise it you really went out of it and were stunned but the beginning is the weak point in my opinion the stunning phase happens in the endnow on to my general concerns last paragraph i swear i think war is bad the stupid thing about war is that it involves humans and especially the killing of humans further on war is even stranger humans kill without any inner motivation without real hate or anger out of personal reasons although sister was killed by germans v2 in london  it is so abstract and so unreal one of the other commenters said that full metal jacket would score better in showing the futility of war and thats the point  futility desparation hopelessness the lacking of sense and reason  that is war for me concerning humans there is not a single good thing about war lives are simply thrown away dumped cannonfodderopen bodies blown away extremities or injuries like that dont touch me but things like soldier a nearly makes it to blabla but just before he reaches it hes shot remember a bridge too far when the solider runs for that cylindric box hoping to find ammunition or whatever and there are only hats inside  this is war for me i think platoon is better i think a bridge too far is better i think the bridge is better actually although all the antiwarmovies i know are inferior in terms of visuals and sound they all are superior to the only thing speaking well for all of you is that good visuals and sounds directly influence unconsciousness,reality
first and foremost this is an aweinspiring masterpiece of discomfort spielberg has succeeded where stone failed with natural born killers  he has made a movie which genuinely affects its audience and serves as an indictment of the cinematic tradition of defying the violent and the warlike without running the risk of inculcating a cult of violence as cool among the impressionable and the stupidspr moved me to tears within about ten minutes of the opening credits wonderful performances from tom hanks a little saccharine actually tom sizemore and  especially  young giovanni ribisias in schindlers list spielbergs camera is uncompromising in its gaze presenting horrific acts of violence and tragedy unblinkingly and without fanfare where the earlier film occasionally strayed into manipulative heartstring plucking however spr treads a fine line bordering on heroworship to draw comparison with oliver stone again spr lacks the sense of futility helplessness and desperation of full metal jacketbut then it is a far more didactic enterprise than was jacket and in its fullon vitriolic condemnation of capitalw warit succeeds admirably nausea tears exhaustion are all common amongst people leaving a screening blase attitudes and takeitorleaveit shrugs are notcertainly a film which should be seen and pondered upon at length there is however something wrong with saving privatedday 1944 right loads of allied troops dying their way up the beaches of normandy right mission in the thick of the front line in the immediate aftermath of the invasion rightso why do we only see americans and germans where are the british soldiers where are the poles the czechs the dutch what about the australians the canadians the russians we see a family of three french refugees but can that really be it spielberg seems to be trying to depict wwii as vietnam but with less greenery and no dopecontrary to this films thesis wwii was not a war of attrition between the us and the third reich the whole world was involved  hence the first w in wwii you have to get used to americocentric conceit in hollywood movies but this is one opportunity to present an accurate and unbiased account of the war that has been horribly missed,reality
a fair movie but who rated it in the very  top  the same idiotsthat thought titanic was so great because others said it was,reality
this may be the best film ive ever seen a film which give me so much thoughts and feelings although the film is a little bit too cruel and fleshly it is a good media to let people think about the reality of a war a campaign that can ruin millions of lives and souls the most horrible thing to take part in a war is not being killed but to watch the others died one by one besides your feet think of it they are flesh and blood not the characters in the tv games should they be killed just for one or two peoples foolish decision they all have families they are innocent i appreciate with the decision about that chief marshal to save private and send him home at any cost he didnt mind to sacrifice 8 soldiers for giving console to the old lady with 3 sons already died in the battle fieldssteven spielburg has produced a very great movie different from the other scientific film he had ever made but it is a most touching film that gives a good lesson to most of the people it makes me think about the song where have all the flowers gone yes there are still battles even in this modern world still destroying millions of spirits and families when will they ever learn,reality
makes sures that machine guns will still be rattling in your head even after you leave the cinema the movie set in the dying moments of the second world war explores the brutal truths of war limbs fly and blood splatter with historical accuracy as steven spielberg takes an unflinching look at dday this film wins the heart of many by exposing them to the terrors of war with the help of  computer generated effects the madness of the warfront is brought to our world knocks across the idea that war is senseless and should be avoided at all costs this is easily one of the greatest movies ever made with its superb plot stunning effects and documentarystyle camera angles move over titanic is the iceberg that is going to sink you,reality
like several of the viewers whose comments appear here i was expecting great things because of all the hype but was rather disappointed by the film when i actually saw it true the opening and closing half hours are very violent with no holds barred in showing us the horrors of war but lets face it  is there anyone out there who doesnt realize that war is horriblei think one of the main problems i had with the film was that is was yet another of those nauseating america won the war singlehanded type films there were no references that i spotted to any other nations contribution to the dday landing i also found the story line rather weak  the idea that a team of men would be dispatched to find one soldier just because his brothers had been killed is hard to swallow tragedies such as that must have occurred many times in ww2 and i cant imagine the military would go to those lengths every time it happenedthe script is also rather weak  for most of the middle part of the film very little happens and the scenes where the soldiers try to give deep philosophical insight into their feelings about the war just didnt grab mesorry but its only a 5 out of 10 for me,reality
yes its a good film  thought provoking and horrifying gory and traumatic but its not a great film  why not  simply because it tries too hard to do too many things and ends up as neither one thing nor the other is it a hardhitting attempt to reveal the bloody futility of war or is it a shoot em up hollywood blockbuster action movie with an unbelieveable plot and overly realistic gore and special effectsin my very humble opinion it fails as soon as private is found  up to that point all of the horrors of war are exposed for our wretched entertainment  the senseless but inevitable waste of human life the vile slaughter in the sea and on the beaches mans inhumanity to man etc etcand then all of a sudden its hello to kelleys heroes ii  a handful of battleweary men thrown together in dire cicumstances spitwad weapons a few smelly socks and a tub of axle grease up against 4 tanks a 120mm gun and 50 german infantrymen  well dont we just know whos going to win that one right from the start  and as for the airborne tankbuster cavalry arriving just in time  pleasetwo thirds of the way through this potentially great movie sold out and diedone more point the stars and stripes flag at the  beginning and end is jingoistic patronising and insensitive to all the other nations who were involved in the normandy landings men from all over the allied world died on those beaches  contrary to popular belief the world does not begin and end at the borders of the united states of america,reality
i am glad i saw this movie and some elements in it tend to justify my anti war attitudes but it is not one of the greatest movies of all time it might not even be one of the greatest steven spielburg movies raiders of the lost ark and jurassic park are definitely better and spielberg has made several movies that might be better like jaws amistad et close encounters of the third kind schindlers list and maybe moreis a good movie with some good qualities and some bad ones after how great i had heard spr was when i saw it i was disappointed in the directing writing and acting i expected all of those things to be great and found the directing to be pretty good the writing to be pretty bad and the acting to be mediocre im sorry but graphic war action which makes us think long and hard about many things is not enough reason for me to love this movie as much as so many other people seem to and the emotional nature of 3 brothers getting killed in action and the attempt to bring the last brother home to his mom doesnt cut it either because quite frankly thats pretty much all this movie was about it was a good movie but thats all,reality
as a british man and european i could not help but feel insulted by the general jingoistic attitude where were the other allies the british canadians australians french poles etc america did not win the war on their own and a bit of recognition for the brave men of every country that died would not have gone amiss having the stars and stripes as the opening and ending shot was little more than insulting to these men similarly why were the germans portrayed as deserving cannon fodder they were humans too men fighting for the lives of their friends and family why couldnt we see that surely the true horror of war is that on both sides we are the same simple men that aside its a fantastic film despite having a weak plot and stereotyped onedimensional characters and is well worth seeing,reality
i watched the other for the third time hoping i could find it better then i did the first two times i got nothing the only things about this film that are worth mentioning are the battle scenes and the acting everything else about the film is badly done i didnt care about any of the characters i felt nothing when they died because i wasnt able to get to know each character and understand their feeling of the war they the soldiers were just there and did nothing but talk and talk and talk the film is dull and badly written an excellent war movie is one with great acting a great plot great battle scenes great direction great dialog and likeable characters this movie only has good acting not great good direction not great and great battle scenes it lacks everything else needed to make it a great war movie this war film is not the best ever made it doesnt even compare to better movies like the thin red line black hawk down we were soldiers apocalypse now the deer hunter platoon and all quiet on the western front if you want to rent or buy an excellent war film that wont bore you half to death then get any one of those films that i just listed with them you cant go wrong with you go wrong,reality
yes i enjoyed although it was full of spielbergesque drama and not exactly a history lesson here spr is very short on the facts that took place during this period in ww2 this movie is basically a story with a plot that took place during the turning point of ww2 unlike most war movies spr is a movie with fictional characters and the realism of the battle scenes is the only realistic part of spr the opening scene was amazing better than the longest day which depicts ultra realistic scenes of the infamous dday invasion of normandy france but if your looking for a really great ww2 movie then purchase a bridge too far that is by far my favorite ww2 movie of all time i thought stephen spielberg copied the kubrick method of handheld camera style filming he used in full metal jacket it had a documentary feel to it and spielberg definatly copied that but the battle scenes in this film are unmatched with the excepton of ridley scotts black hawk downhowever stars out of 4well worth the 25 bucks,reality
the american people think that spr is an excellent film but the real european who are more educated than you guys are right in saying that this war film is mediocrethe best war films are from renegade real artists filmmakersnot like spiel who like  ff coppolaapocalypse now or terence malick if you feel superior because you live in the united states  you should seewe were soldiers it portraits how brave the american soldiers werei bet you will cry 510,reality
this is the best war movie ever made totally realistic graphic great acting ensemble this is the movie that should of won best picture to give the oscar to shakespeare in love was the biggest oscar travesty obviously that film won it through their aggressive marketing only i was never really interested in world war ii until i saw this movie now i learn all i can about it this movie brilliantly portrayed every aspect of war especially the psychology,reality
those who think war is wonderful or glamorous ie john wayne need to just watch the first 30 minutes of this mindwrenching tragedy if your mind is still not decided than see the remaining 110 minutes and you should be well on your way to accepting peace spielberg after the box office failures of 19941996 and the critical failure of lost world finally hits the big time the talent is back this movie is definitely only for adults kids under 19 id say would have their minds warped too much,reality
i saw this movie again last night as a dutch network premiere i have to say it strengthened my impression after my first viewing some years ago as war films get its one of the best most realistic and exciting there are and yet i dont really understand the big deal that people sometimes make of war films in my opinion they shouldnt always by revered as important films or be taken with deadseriousity after all no matter how realistic they are made for entertainment value and little more this is a movie that has terrific bloody action a realistic setting superb cinematography and production design welldeveloped characters and some emotional moments but people is it really anything more than that it is certainly not a lesson in history did private or captain miller ever really exist no in spielbergs schindlers list an obviously superior film many of the characters shown really did exist but is really just a work of fiction crafted to manipulate and excite the viewer im not saying that there are major historical innacuracies in it since im not a historian im just saying that it is in no way an extraordinary or transcendental movie experience it is also far from spielbergs most accomplished work raiders of the lost ark et and jaws are all clearly on a much higher level as they all transcend their genres and become something truly extraordinary private may be a very good war film but lacks that extra bit of magic to make it truly extraordinary and a masterpiece in ever regard like so many war film it doesnt truly leave an indelible impact on the viewer and this is a member of the war film genre in every bone of its body it doesnt surpass films like platoon full metal jacket apocalypse now as the ultimate war movie if you want to see a true masterpiece a film that is truly unforgettable and extraordinary dont look for it among the war movies trust me see 2001 a space odyssey see the shawshank redemption see raiders of the lost ark those are genuinely extraordinary pictures that transcend the limitations of their genres and bury themselves into your subconscious never leaving your memories as well as every other war film ever made cant possibly have that resonance,reality
to me the greatest war movies of all time are those that address the issues of why war is fought to begin with the psychology of the people who fight it and human nature in general  simply does not address any of this  spielberg instead packages world war 2 into a neat commercialized container for mass consumption  the movie although perhaps more realistic in its depiction of the violence of war than previous films has stereotypical and flat characters little character development too many stupid oneliners and attempts at humor and a cliched feelgood ending  is maybe a decent drama but in no way is it in the upper echelon of war films which ask and attempt to answer the real questions of war  if you want to see a good war movie which does address the real philisophical issues of war and human nature and doesnt have a hollywoodized happy feelgood ending go rent platoon or the thin red line,reality
if did anything it changed the way film makers looked at war the graphic detail of the deaths and wounding of the americans on omaha beach showed what it is really like to get shot you dont get back upi for one can not stomach another john wayne film  where a man gets hits with a bar stool and gets up like there is nothing wrong you dont any new film you see now is judged and by private and possibly glory and so it should be do not trivualise violence in films take a long look at what is happening in the world today and see its effectforget the plot but thank god for spielburg,reality
one of the most heart stoping movies i have ever witnessed a stunning and emotional cinematic rollercoaster ride portraying the hideous reality of the second world war i am a brit but i also deeply appreciate the american contribution to this war and in particular the dday landings remember we all made sacrifices at this time of history brits french canadians polish dutch and of course the jews a speilberg masterpiece which deserves five stars,reality
i love every minute that i spend watching this movie because it does an excellent job at depicting the true horror of war and because the story is very touching and compassionate  this is one film that is very easily worth the nearly three hours you spend watching it and it is my opinion that it was by far the best movie of 1998 and one of the greatest films in all of cinematic history  i couldnt possibly recommend it more strongly,reality
a good film which is marred for many brits with the inclusion of that quip against montgomery repeated by some reviwersmontgomery and the british divisions face the toughest forces on dday they were up agianst the only ss panzer divisions on the day montgomery wanted to go careful to lessen casualties nothing wrong with that  after all the british and their commonwealth allies had been fighting since 1939the americans created their own difficulties at omaha by landing away from the original beach,reality
the battle scenes in this film particularly the vivid recreation of a beach on dday are surely the most realistic vivid and gory battle scenes ever depicted spielberg shoots  the action as if a camera crew were there amongst the men the first 20odd minutes are extremely powerful and beautifully shot unfortunately the great technical merit of the action scenes are let down by the rest of the film the script is flat so the characters are stuck with being either the cocky jew the medic who loves his mum er mom or the wise guy new yorker the scenes in between the action sequences tend to drag because theres lots of talking but no one has anything interesting to say the scene in the church and in the french town near the end seem to last for hours theres none of the depth of character or analysis of human behaviour that was apparent in schindlers list what made that film so shocking was its objectiveness and absence of sentimentality the same cannot be said for the film has been criticised for only depicting us soldiers in the war but this is unfair since its a film about a squad of us soldiers its not about the war germany the war is just its setting but all in all i would recommend this film just to see its reproduction of the horrors of war,reality
to all of those who like to see a very well done war movie realistic and faithful to reality the best the performances directing the script and the realism of the war sequences might be for many hard but thats the way it was the worst the movie was very long and its one of those movies you only have to see once which isnt necessarily badduring the hard world war ii us soldiers risk their lives beyond enemy lines to save private james brother of a bunch of killed brothers on action that should be saved before his mother loses everyone she has in the worldonce more and not as a big surprise steven spielberg directs this movie majestically im used to that his muscle for tense and dramatic and action sequences was once more set in motion wholeheartedly and greatly directing a remarkable cast lead be tom hanks if to you tom hanks seemed to you exactly equal to himself again thats because he is but thats just me because i believe that tom hanks is nowhere near that great actor that everyone makes of him and thats not the only one america seems to canonize some hollywood actors like jim carrey tom hanks and will smith i like neither of them specially will smith who bugs me immensely as of jim carrey he doesnt bug me that much what bugs me the most is that carrey always makes roles of jerk or idiot carry on the cast his great once more matt damon again proves to be a great actor againafter all this is still a must see wasnt it one of the greatest movies ever mademy verdict 7 out of 10,reality
in todays context where the amerikan military has launched a succession of wars of aggression and is gearing up for more this objectively contributes to reactionary militarism even though it is billed as antiwar focus on individuals obscures the fact of war as the highest form of class struggle  and the fact that amerika was on the right side in this one,reality
possible spoilerthis is a good movie with good performances and superb production values but hardly the best war movie of all time some scenes deserve notice however as truly devastating movie work and one connecting scene still confuses methe opening leaves us with what we will learn later as a grandfather many years later visiting the cemetary in normandy he is kneeling by a tombstone in tears with his family around him at the end of the movie we return to see now at what seems to be a different part of the cemetary with his family in the distance his wife comes over and he says tearfully am i a good man referring to the sacrifice others made to save his life well i thought he should have figured that out by now manipulative and cloying i thought then he stands straight comes to attention and i think to myself oh no dont salute its too obvious please dont salute dont do it he salutesthe twenty minutes devoted to the omaha beach landing are surely the most gruesome bloodiest twenty minutes ever put on screen spielberg captured the horrible reality of war bodies are cut in half limbs are severed young dying soldiers cry for mama this is what is was really like  not a thing was sanitized here you have to be emotionally dead not to be affected by what those brave men did at that beach and what they suffered and by extension all the men and women who have died in all warsfor me the most devastating scene was the little girl being passed down by her father to the wellmeaning soldier both somehow trying to get her to safety the soldier is killed and the little girl scrambles over the rubble to get back to her father her father lifts her back up but she stays an arms length away crying uncontrollably the father trying to draw her to him she is crying and screaming and then slaps her father hard in the face still crying and yelling at him she slaps him again for her it was the ultimate unforgiveable sin for him he was trying to save her life but war destroyed this most indestructible bond imaginable between a father and his trusting little girl this was the greatest horror of the movie,reality
i just saw this movie on tv last night so i missed a lot of the sound effects that im sure contributed a great deal to the atmosphere but based on what i did see i thought the film had some great things in it but was still flawedspielberg seemed mainly interested in recreating the feel of fighting in wwii and in many ways he did an excellent job as far as i can tell not having been there the camera work and stunt choreography was often simply astonishing and id like to give a special jawdrop to the stuntmen who worked on the film but spielbergs goal of verisimilitude interfered in some ways with the storyline i agree with a previous commentator who said that the handheld camera was sometimes distracting and difficult to watch having a bunch of extras stroll in front of the lens whenever possible did add to the sense of you are there but it also made it hard to concentrate on what the main characters were saying when the screenplay suddenly jumped from cinema verite to heavy symbolism stop here if you dont want to learn any details about the plot with the agonizingly slow death of an american jewish soldier at the hands of a representative german while a terrorstruck american goy lies powerless outside the transition was awkward though such heavyhandedness would have been annoying in almost any filmi didnt think the characters were particularly welldrawnin fact i couldnt tell them apart much of the time though i suppose uniforms contribute to that i got the impression spielberg didnt want to waste too much time exploring character when he could be terrifying the viewer in fact i think some of the film was sadistic though im sure spielberg would argue that he was simply trying to show the actual horrors of wari could have done without the couple of misogynistic anecdotes from some of the soldiers although probably many soldiers talk like that one of the previous commentators thought privates story about his brothers and a neighborhood girl showed his humanityi thought it showed that he was an ahole im glad i didnt see it in the theater i wouldnt want to know how many people laughed at that story i was grateful for the youdisgustmebutimtryingnottobeobviousaboutitgiventhedifficu ltsituationwearein expression on tom hanks characters face when he heard it at least thats how i read itoverall i think spielberg took on more than he could chewhe seemed to jump back and forth between epic reenactments and the storyline of his main characters rather than finding a way to fuse the two into a coherent wholei appreciate the war movie recommendations that other commentators made and would like to add my own europa europa but its really a civilian story so battlefield fans might not find it so interesting,reality
as well as giving a brief review of i would also like to give a little bit of the history behind it granted i have not read all 1300 of the previous reviews that are already here as i begin to type but i did read one review that i feel i must correct somebody said that the film was loosely based on the sullivans who were five brothers from waterloo iowa who all died when their ship the juneau was torpedoed off guadalcanal in november 1942  this person was misinformed  the sullivans were indeed real men who died in the pto of the war and were even mentioned in their deaths were the reason that the four boys were supposedly split up into different units but the story was in no way based on them it is however loosely based on the niland brothers the real private was sergeant fritz niland of the 501st parachute infantry regiment pir he is mentioned in stephen ambroses novel band of brothers as a friend of donald malarkeys and warren skip mucks played by scott grimes and richard speight jr respectively in the hbo miniseries shortly after dday sergeant niland learned that his brother bob had been killed bob was part of the 82nd airborne which was another regiment that jumped behind enemy lines in the early hours of dday niland then discovered that another brother who had been a platoon leader in the 4th infantry division had been killed at utah beach when he returned to his company a fellow soldier was looking for niland to tell him that his third and final brother had been killed in the chinaburmaindia theater and that he was supposed to be sent home immediately  and he was  no secret search mission no babysitting bridges no defying orders however like private he did return home to a mother who had recently received death notices for three of her  sons there might be some spoilers here i guess  nothing that ruins the ending of the film though saving privates realism is undoubtedly one of the best when it comes to war films i think band of brothers outdid it though then again that came three years later the opening dday sequence is spectacular and it really gave the sense of what it was like to be there random moments stuck in my head much after the movie had progressed into its search for thesere all weve got between us and the almighty referring to the crosssteel objects that had been placed on the beach by the germans in order to rip apart landing crafts on a high tide but actually worked to the advantage of the invading americans  captain millers hanks shouting tell shore party this tell shore party that only to find out that the radio man had a giant hole puncturing his face and that the radio was busted  one soldier getting shot in the helmet and private caparzo vin diesel saying lucky bd then the soldier takes off his helmet and is shot in the head and of course the terrifying mama screams all of these elements plus the incredible special effects sounds realisticlooking beach and amazing costumes make the scene one of the best combat sequences ever filmed  i really did feel like i was there the rest of the movie went downhill the first time i saw it i thought the whole movie was fantastic but on later viewings the seventh the eighth the twelfth the thirteenth  yes that many i realized i didnt like it as much as i originally thought i did  captain miller and seven men who are undoubtedly part of the stereotypical combat squad the hick sharpshooter the italian guy the jew the worried guy the annoying guy everyone hates the brave sarge and the medic who is more concerned about the safety of others than the safety of himself are sent on a mission to rescue private james who has lost three brothers within a week and is to be sent home immediately jumped into normandy with the 506th pir part of the 101st airborne the same airborne our friends of easy company in band of brothers are in but hes been misdropped and is lost somewhere behind enemy lines as were about half of the men dropped into normandy early on dday  misdrops were everywhere  sergeant horvath tom sizemore calls the mission finding a needle in a haystack and miller corrects him its like finding a needle in a stack of needles the rest of the movie is fantastic in realistically portraying the horrors of war and the acting is superb by every actor who commits themselves to a role the actors portray a bunch of world war ii army rangers as accurately as they can much of this is probably thanks to captain dale dye who put them through a boot camp before the movie began shooting dye makes a brief appearance as the war department colonel in the beginning of the film and for band of brothers which he also helped with to transform actors into soldiers he had a much larger role as colonel robert sink and does a great job representing him however as i watched it more and more the plot grew weak and boring for me thats something i never thought id admit but im admitting it now i guess i like things of this measure to have actually happened such as band of brothers actually happened i dont know its something about eight guys wondering through all of france to find one guy that begins to disturb me now i cant put my finger on why oh well  its still a great film but simply not the best check out the thin red line for a more philosophical approach and band of brothers for a brilliant approach to real events and real characters

isnt a bad flick  it has a great opening act and then deflates into your average genre war film  complete with a dodgy deux ex machina  when those tankbuster planes bail out the gi s getting a pasting at the hands of the ss but  hey ted danson and  steven spielberg  how dare you disparage the british effort both in the landings and in the dday campaign we dont need ditsy hollywood glamour guys making pat judgements about the courage and sacrifice of the british army in wwii  and passing it off as coming from character wont wash you only make yourselves sound foolish if you want true realism as opposed to brittlle tinseltown hogwash check out the brilliant russian film come and see instead  spielberg appropriated much of its horror for his story and needless to say  his aint half as good,reality
first of all i wanna say that the movie has a stunning first 30 minutes great action great value of realism but then the story collapses pretty bad when i saw the movie it was nice looking at it but afterwards i realised that it was a very ordinairy storyline and that dissapointed me it was all so damn predictable and thats why it is not a masterpiece imo apart from the storyline its a great movie ,reality
im not exactly sure why everyone went so bananas over this one yes its good and fairly enjoyablebut its certainly no platoon i found several moments of this had long stretches that were rather dull whereas platoon was interesting from one end of the credits to the others perhaps it sparked because there simply hasnt been many great war films for years now im not ripping the movie upi simply dont think it deserves the legendary status thats been assigned to it recommendedbut with the reservation that if you thought this was greatrent platoon,reality
its my opinion that this movie suffers from a typical american disease the overpraise for movies that glorify the usof ano doubt this was a very good movie that showcases spielbergs brilliant technical mastery but his storytelling is awfully amiss here for the average nonamerican this movie might seem rather ordinaryhaving said that this is by no means a solid output from steven spielberg as usual he brings out excellent performancs from everyone manages a tight screenplay a great score brilliant effects a quality film that just lacks in one aspect  for some reason it comes across as being short on the emotional aspect the movie fails to capture the horrors of war for a truly brilliant antiwar movie watch terrence mallicks outstanding the thin red line sadly overlooked at the oscarsa high 7,reality
spielbergs is both powerful and painfully maudlin spielbergs direction and cinematography is great but the absurdity of the plotannoying actors particularly ed burns  daviesreally bring the film down way to longand full of melodramatic dialouge there are some great moments in the film the opening 25 minutes the scene where the nazi soldier slowly plunges a knife through the jewish soldiers chestand few others but much like platoon it cops out  with predictible hero deaths and sentimental outcomes if you want to see a true masterpiece of war or military in general try kubricks full metal jacket                                                             i encourage feedback on my reviewprove too me full metal jacket isnt the best war film ever,reality
the first 2030 mins of war are breath taking one sits there in wonder as to could i have done this or what the hell was it like to be there which is where the film for me personally falls down later on because no matter how undeniably advantageous the presence of the us to allies during the war was they werent the only allies at dunkirk now admittedly it could be deemed more offensive to have british canadian troops etc as guest stars or bit roles but i think what nulls this argument is the stars and stripes we are drowned in at the end of the movie now unfortunately comparisons will always be made to the thin red line if no other reason than because they were released in the same year there you have an engagement where americans were the only allies present yet this fact isnt driven down our throats by a flag pole the other main gripe is the villian of the feature the german soldier who we see begging for his life and who we are made to realise is a human being after all quite a moving piece of cinema which later on is ruined by the reappearance of the said german all suited up and ready for killing the main characters ysee they shouldve killed him after all a phrase undoubtedly uttered by many people watching but dont those people hate germans any way wasnt it a bolder move to let us feel sorry for him and leave it at that overall an overhyped film all explosions and fairy tale from lets face it the most overhyped director in the world i liked jaws but,reality
american overlong sentimentally contrived brutally realistic overrated but still worthy of high praise is a testament to what can be done to highlight moments of a countrys historyokay i admit i am britishborn and i am going to mention the lack of any other nationality in the film so i shall start with this obvious moot pointwhat annoys people is that tom hanks unit never comes across someone of another nation as they move inland and not the superlative and startlingly realized opening anyone who knows the slightest bit of history knows that the airborne forces were missdropped all over normandy having said that if we british complain so much about the nonrepresentation of our forces in american films why dont we make something equally as jawdropping after all most of the technicians on the film were british ill tell you why not after the release of his film a bridge too far in 1977 director richard attenborough said he would never make another film whilst participants in the historical event were still alive why because veterans of the parachute regiment complained that they had been made out to be too heroic hollywood makes u571 we make enigma go figure  we should stop taking pot shots at our american cousins who did bail us out of the war even if it was late in coming and make some films to redress the balancewhat rankles the most is the underhand way in that spielberg comments on field marshall montgomery so he was egotistical  show me a military leader who isnt but to have two field officers passing judgement come on the soldiers i spoke to were more bothered about keeping themselves alive than worrying about how they rated their commanders most of my family were killed in china many of my south african relatives fought in africa and europe my grandfather and fathers friends included bomber pilots paras and chindits so i understand the need to honour these men i have visited pointe du hoc and i have full admiration for the rangers that tackled their objectives but i digressthe opening is phenomenal and is being recreated derisorily time and again in computer games nothing has captured the sense of what it must have been like but this goes some way to accomplishing that the first time viewed i dont think i breathed outunfortunately after such a visceral experience there is always going to be a comedown physiologically this is what is going to happen with adrenalin and thus the viewer is unwittingly experiencing what an infantryman might have gone through the comedown for the audience however is in the films pacingthe midsection does drag and yes maybe this is to show the lulls between the fighting etc but if i wanted to experience boredom and nothing i would do nothing or i would watch the thin red line a truly dull experience indeed this lack of pacing is noticeable on repeat viewingthe characterization is not fully realized for such a running time and many of the characters remain clichd eg dependable sarge the coward nevertheless this does not detract from the film as the casting compensates in their visual appearance from just their looks we are compelled and can empathizethe cinematography editing and sound are all first rate as we have come to expect from spielberg although the shafts of light were unnecessary the washed out colours added a texture of reality and with the age of digital filmmaking the look of the film is far from the normal sheen of fantasy  an edge of documentary lending itselfon a technical note and perhaps superficial there are a few errors that irritate firstly why do they use the mortar shells when they have grenades on their belts which stay unused having practised fire support team drills why does mellish not carry the spare ammo the unit has two bazookas and yet they leave one lying around lastly continuity should have picked up the fact that tom hanks pistol suffers stoppages twice consecutively when he is firing at the tiger tank an impossibility but these are minor complaintsoverall   far better than the thin red line and on a par with a bridge too far,reality
is the most overrated film of the 1990s  if you were to see the film according to the reviews youd think it was the best film of all time which is far from the truth  the first 30 minutes for one thing have absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the movie while the opening is admittedly the best part of the film in terms of accuracy and its intensity it simply shouldnt be there  it appears that the normandy scene is just there so stephen spielberg can tell us what a great director he is  while the opening scene may be accurate the ending is right out of the dirty dozen in its implauabilty with something like 12 soliders taking out no less then what seems to be 75 nazis  i will say that i enjoyed the film and it is by no means bad all i am saying is that the film is not as great as people say  i believe that in the summer of 1998 critics simply saw who was directing and starring in the film and thought right away it was going to be a 4 star movie which it wasnt if your looking for a great war film see glory gettysburg or spielbergs own empire of the sun i give the film 8 out of 10,reality
i thought this was a fine and realistic war movie until they found private matt damon and when he was talking to tom hanks his pearly white teeth were so white and perfect im sorry but there is no way people back then wouldve had white teeth like that they didnt have fluoride in their water yet and they wouldve hardly had time to brush their teeth while they are fighting a war  they wouldnt have teeth brightening chewing gum either  okay so matt damon did a great job in the role but that one thing pretty much ruined the credibility of the film for me,reality
whilst spr might not be the beall and endall war movie i take great humor in reading most of the negative reviews on this movie many have nothing at all to do with the movie per se but more with peoples gripes about how other nations were portrayed in this movieget over itthe movie portrays the efforts of the american rangers on omaha beach thats omaha not gold not sword not juno thats why theres no portrayal of french canadian or british troopsit seems to me that any time there is a movie that shows what the us did in wwii and doesnt give equal time to the other allied troops everyone needs to kvetch what most seem to forget is that the us lost more troops than all the other allied forces combined that they spent more than all the other counties which still have not paid the us back and were it not for the uss involvement in wwii all of europe would today be wearing lederhosen and playing the accordian this from a country that was not directly affected by the events taking place in europesimilarly i read many reviews taking umbrage with the negative comments directed towards montgomeryget over itmonty was a megalomaniac with a serious case of pns envy because he couldnt run the whole show patton proved that he could outbattle outtactic and outrun monty in any theatre of war granted monty had some success in africa but he spent the rest of the war whining to eisenhower for equal authority and supplies which i believe eisenhower gave him to shut him up at the expense of pattons troops who were taking names and kicking butt what did monty do why operation market garden of course an operation that pretty much decimated all the allied forces that took part in itnext i read about so many people finding the middle of the movie boring do these commentators forget the adage about war being long periods of boredom interspersed with moments of sheer terror what did you expect that they fight a gazillion troops all the way to and fight their way back out again unscathed war is like that it is not like the current action movies out there today where the hero might get grazed by a bullet and continue to fight only to get the girl in the endi also read about the germans being demonized in this movie how quickly they forget auschwitz how quickly they forget dachau how quickly they forget that as an occupying force the germans raped whomever they pleased shot whomever they pleased millions of germans bought into hitlers promises they willingly went to war for him they tried to conquer the world and cared not for the innocents they were slaughtering along the wayso dont whine about it in this politicallycorrect liberal un peacekeeping day we forget that soldiers were encouraged back then to hate their enemy to believe him the devil they called the enemy krauts and nips and eyeties so that when the time came to kill them soldiers were able to do it back then we fought until they were defeated today we do it until they say im sorry and then pay them billions of dollars to rebuild finally remember the scene after the us took the beach the scene of americans carelessly shooting surrendering enemy forces dont try to say that it was onesidedlastly i saved the dday beachhead for last too many people have commented that this was too gory too long too dully filmed and not an accurate depiction of how war really is to that i can only offer this why then did so many veterans of that invasion feel the need to walk out of the movie stating that they couldnt watch it because it was too real why did many veterans cry during this scene as to it being too dully filmed please check your history the invasion had been postponed several times because the weather was too rainy and as late as the day before it was pouring rain up and down the french coast and in england as wellmight not be the best war film ever made but it is the best war film made to date,reality
the story of the movie is really simpleit is about an expedition that are looking for a guy in the middle of world war twoit is of course fiction about this privat they are looking forbut the movie still captures a lot of the second world war what makes the story so great is what the soldiers experience on their way and that they have to stick together to survive all the actors does a great job playing their roles and especially tom hankswho i think never have played a bad rolethe movie contains some strong scenes and some sad moments when young soldiers lying around screaming and waiting to diethe movie is great told with very good camera workbut thats what you expect from steven spielberg moviesteven spielberg has made another great movie that is worth watchingi give it a 9 out of 10,reality
i just saw this movie today and i am totally upset about the beginning in the first ten minutes of there is more blood violenceand gore of which are all terribly graphic i am not against violence in movies because i love films that are hailed as violent films like a clockwork orange and reservoir dogs but no one hailed as a violent film its called a masterpiece and i am bothered by this they showed more bloodygory violence in it than i have ever seen before it makes the most violent movies ive ever seen look like kid moviesdont get me wrong i thought that it was an ok movie but the plot was stupid and only there so spielberg could make a bunch of long violent and dramatic ww2 battle scenes seriously the us government would never risk a bunch of lives so that a women could not have every one of her sons die its just not likelynow i know that the movie was trying to be realistic but i think they went to far and the drops of blood on the screen itself is disgusting spielberg as usual messed up again,reality
im not gonna make a bucketload of friends with this review but im sorry left me feeling a bit underwhelmed noteone or two spoilers aheadfirstly the story is well stupid the american army sends 8 men under the command of cpt miller tom hanks to go behind enemy lines is normandy just after dday to rescue private james matt damon as his mother has already received telegrams informing her that her three eldest sons have been killed aits simplistic bthe army is not that compassionate im sorry it wouldnt happen not then not nowits a shame as the film has loads of qualities like most spielberg movies there are the battle scenes which are immensely realistic the beginning beach scene is like watching a documentary it seems so real and true to reality in fact most of the battle scenes are great theyre all very exciting this is due to the great camera work handheld and  to the effects the sets are fabulous the music is absent during battles for realism and the scenes are bloody and realistically disturbing best invokes the chaos of war full metal jacket evoked wars stupidity paths of glory was about the wastefulness of combat and deer hunter my favourite war movie was about its heartlessness bur creates scenes of madness and chaos in keeping with the madness of the mission with the exception of hanks and damon the acting is terrific adam goldberg edward burns giovanni ribisi and tom sizemore are great as is most of the castyet these qualities are wasted by a lot of drawbacks i can make my peace with the story it can be called poetic license although the supposingly compassionate american army did send hundreds and thousands of gis to their deaths by making the land on and storm the beaches of omaha and utah which were surrounded by easilydefended but hardtoattack cliffs from which the germans easily massacred the advancing american troops if they had chosen a duned beach like the english and the canadians did the casualties would have half those suffered but i digress what i dont like is the reckless clicheing theres upham a detestable character seen in about every war or adventure film ever hes wimpy feeble and never uses violence oh and his complacent wetness results in the deaths of several of his squadmembers yet hes a corporal lets face it he wouldnt have gotten past training also the germans are pictured to be monsters they are the enemy only there to be killed or to kill and they are always more treacherous than the good old trusty gis who all have hearts of gold even the aggressive rieben burns who is another cliche character by the way i mean just look at the german they release who comes back and coldbloodedly kills a couple of our goodies and is made instantly hateable while watching it my mum cried kill that bstrd german i rest my case finally the ending is awfully twee the death at the end reminds me of every sappy film on earth the tears the whispering voice the brave face the honorable death my god its like et i admit it i laughed radio flyer is less sappy as i said i dont like hanks or damon damon is sort of smartass bigheaded yob just like in good will hunting why did everyone like that movie and hanks is just being hanks hes just reprising his philadelphia persona but at least it was original back in 1993 you know hes all goody twoshoes all honest and pure and hes a tad overweight i hate to say it hes almost as twee as in castaway which is a dreadful movie ive only enjoyed watching tom hanks in two movies philadelphia and forrest gump at least in those his performances were originalits a shame that spielberg leaves realism behind halfway through and turns to sentimentality and sappiness because the beginning announces great stuff a shame 510uppers 1great camerawork 2realistic battle scenes 3great sound 4dramatic portrayal of the chaos of war 5the supporting castdowners 1hanks and damon are a four letter word rhyming with trap 2riddled with cliches 3uphams character what a stereotype 4what is this the dam busters why dont they just run up screaming filthy krauts and dirty jerry what a manichean portrayal of the germans quite tasteless 5the ending is downright tritea quick note its amazing how in the uk and france at least spielberg avoids severe certificates jurassic park easily warranted a 12 it is a pg13 in the us after all a mans arm does get ripped off in schindlers list we witness the horrendous mistreatment and murder of jews plus several scenes of nudity yet it remains a 15 and in people are disembowled and shot to bits in grisly detail yet it is also only a 15 i agree that we need to be more liberal but why does spielberg alone get this special treatment i see it as a tribute to his talent as a director apart from and et,reality
while the first twenty minutes were a 10 on anyones list the remainder of the movie lacked true suspense emotion and direction  i failed to care what happened to the remaining soldiers  it was very anticlimactic perhaps spielberg should have spent less time editing another movie and more time developing for us,reality
as i refer in the topic spr its only 30 minutes of the dday the rest of the movie looks like american patriotism that is used in too many movies an exception is the thin red line that shows how the war really is you dont really need to see the two movies just look to the name of them and you understand what im sayingthe first 30 minutes od spr are the more remarkable example from that day that really shocked me,reality
i am not going to write about historical innaccuracies  this is an american film for americans  bit like forrest gump in that respect  i thought the first 30 minutes with the assault on the beach was great and very effective  probably the best piece of action ive seen however the next piece of the film is very average and verges toward sentimentality  if you want to see what this bit could have been like check out cross of iron   and it just seems to peter out toward the end i wasnt that bothered about what happened to any of them or whether they saved or not i think it would have been better if moms apple pie had been kept out of the last half and it would have been a more honest film,reality
is a very good movie it isnt entirely historically accurate but it is a movie and doesnt really bother meim canadian for anyone who is wondering what country a canadian comes from it is canada the one above the usa and it does bother me that there isnt a canadian or british soldier in sight truth be told only canada reached its dday objective though it was a single tank unit anyone who is fuzzy on history there was more than one landing at dday there was five in fact two by britain two by american and one by canada so other than omitting the existence of two countries that was fighting wwii long before america got into it i liked the movie also tom hanks was in the movie and i think he will go down in history with names like gregory peck or jimmy stewart the omaha beach invasion is most definitely the goriest scene in any movie in history even last years gladiator doesnt even come close a spectacular scene that is breath taking in the fact that it actually happened and real men were doing what tom hanks did this is a very good movie simply put it is the best world war movie i have ever seen not saying much im young,reality
this film has a very good story line wich is based on a true story it is about a captain that is put to the test and has to find a private by the name of james it has you clinging to your seats all the way through i would recommend this film to any one that is not younger than 17 because of the intense violence but over all i would recommend if you have not seen this film to go out and rent it it is  touching film and will have you crying your heart out at the end,reality
i typed a comment about this before and now ive had time to rethink it there is only one major source for my distaste for this movie  robert rodat he trashes almost every country he can when he can except america which he tries to make out as brilliant and valiant and heroic etc i mean where were the other armies at the dday landings it wasnt just the yanks who landed there and monty overrated come on robert the fact that this guy wrote the patriot only shows his ignorant britdissing even more randall wallace is another culprit of this super duper proamericanantieveryoneelse sentiment i mean in braveheart the brits are made out to be totally evil which is just pure rubbish plus he scripted pearl harbor which did its damnedest to make the americans not look stupid over the attack  the only good movie about pearl harbor is tora tora tora which got its history correct down to the smallest detailmy major gripe said this film is gripping from start to finish the tension really builds up in the landing craft at the start and the landings really do stun you janusz kaminskis camerawork is a great defining feature of this movie and deservedly won an oscar john williams score wasnt very apparent but when it was it was effective enough but rather repetitive the characters and the moral question behind the story are also well put out to dry as in why several soldiers for one and captain millers last words really do express how he felt about going to save privateall in all by my reckoning a half decent war movie that is needlessly proamerican and disses other countries mind you this is probably the main reason it won any oscars,reality
this is a great movie a gave it a nine everything was right sound visuals characters story etc but just one remark hello america although your part in ww2 was very big you were not alone not even on dday lots of other countries canada england etc also fought hard to libarate europe and the rest of the world,reality
warning spoiler alert,reality
okay ill start with something positive  those scenes  you know those scenes which everybody would not stop crapping on about being so bloody brilliant that is the opening battle scenes of the dday invasion  are done yes almost brilliantly  perhaps it was merely the choice not to pull any punches in portraying graphic deaths and mutilations or maybe it was just the fact the volume was cranked up to extreme rock gig levels at the cinema i was in but the battle scenes of this movie were actually done very very well  i  and i say this as one who has watched one hell of a lot of war movies over the years  was quite impressedthat being said the rest of the movie was an utter crock of st  ive probably seen worse but when its accompanied by the kind of hype this one came hand in hand with its hard to remember that fact  i think the problem for me was that it purported to be so much more  more of what i dont know art maybe or serious historical narrative or cinematic realism perhaps  but really it wasnt even just a good old shootembangem war movie  personally i like my war movies best when theyre high on the intellectual ponderings of the ambiguous nature of good and evil and all that pretentious style jazz  however im also rather partial now and then to a good old superficial war action flick with lots of fake violence and intriguing plot twists of the alister maclean varietythis film failed on all accounts  it tried to be an intelligent thoughtful movie about the horrors of war and the nature of heroism but frankly it stank  heres the litmus test for this film  take out the aforementioned well done battle scenes and what do you have  a tired old extremely cliched badly written and above all boring war movie of the kind we all thought the war movie genre had moved on from decades ago  but hey i shouldnt just bag it out without some reasons now should ifirstly  if youre going to hype up about historical accuracy in the promotions for your movie at least make sure the damn thing actually is historically accurate  yet as far as actual history goes this movie is so inaccurate they may as well claimed wwii consisted of martians invading new york and the americans fighting them off oh hang on that was the season befores blockbuster  now i understand that this is a movie not a documentary and certain dramatic elements are necessary to sustain interest not that they worked  its fiction  fine im happy with that  in fact ill go as far to say that in normal circumstances i dont give much of a toss whether it has any historical accuracy at all  only in this case historical accuracy was one of the selling points of the damn filmfor all you kiddies who may get your history lessons from the movies let me just repeat  this movie is very very badly historically inaccurate  if you want to know exactly how as i dont have time to go into every detail here go look it up  you know in a bookscary aside here i used a military metaphor with a bunch of fifteen year olds recently who looked at me blankly at mention of the gulf war and had no knowledge whatsoever of the social cultural and political circumstance surrounding wwii  yet their eyes all lit up with recognition when in desperation i turned to to illustrate my point  ughyes before you ask i have studied the period  extensively  and frankly if the germans were as dumb as they were portrayed in this movie why did it take so long for us to win the war  oh and another thing  just where was everyone else  i know criticisms of hollywood being overly uscentric are so common as to be cliched themselves these days but really as far as i can see from this movie the americans were the only ones in the war im sure they only let the germans in because to have americans fighting americans would have produced just a tad too much ambiguity and we couldnt have that now could we  i must admit im getting a bit bored with the whole america saves the world again thing though at least in armageddon i could laugh at bruce willis sacrifical ending  one of the top ten hysterical film moments of the decade that onethe acting was pretty much as youd expect hanks was fine the rest backed him up without any major problems i didnt truly notice the performances to tell you the truth either good or bad  the sets were of course wonderful to back up the elaborate battle scenes  the rest well what else can i saycharacters were cliched badly so  the nature of war was reduced to a very superficial good americans versus evil germans and  shudder dread i say it  a mans gotta do what a mans gotta do  not even cheap bgrade action flick war films rely on that foolish mantra anymore  weve seen it all before its boring and its above all dumbtalking about dumb another scary aside  walking out of the cinema after seeing this film a twenty something couple were walking arm in arm just ahead of us  she asks him what war was that  he replies  the vietnam war baby  oh the humanityall in all maybe im a fool for expecting something worthwhile to come out of all the money and effort spent on this film  i should know better big budget blockbusters rarely if ever deliver  this one purported to be more than just a blockbuster however  it promised thoughtful intelligent treatment of the subject matter  unfortuantely it failed miserably,reality
this movie is indeed nothing to get excited about when it was released in theaters i couldnt wait to see it but i never made it so i waited for video when i saw it it put me to sleepi will admit that the movie does have very good war scenes but nothing to get excited over the wwii veterans deserved something better then this if the soldiers arent fighting in the movie its boring even tom hankss performance is nothing to get excited abouti hated it,reality
i fell asleep during this movie twice not to mention almost being tempted to leave the theater and chuck my corn at the screen tom hanks is horrible in this film he doesnt act seriously and comes across more as a comedian than a soldier steven spielberg is a horrible director and couldnt direct a porn flick this doesnt even compare with real war movies like missing in action hell the landscapes in the movie didnt even look real it looked like the characters were walking around in ohio or something this was definitely a waste of 5 dollars even billy drago couldnt have saved this disaster,reality
a masterpiece in every sense of the word how they pulled it off is beyond me it didnt have any irritating cliches and was unbelievably realistic the camera work the sfx which added to the movie rather than subtracted like many modern day flicks do and the sound was unbelievable i was taken back by the gore but in the end that just made me think the ending had me in tears i understand the fictional elements but it made me think of what the story meant and how many lives were needlessly lost in the war an awesome movie spielburgs best perhaps 1010,reality
one example that sometimes you can not watch the best movie of the year impressing oppressing merciless and still great really great acting directing and terrible good special effects which do not hide any detail,reality
i commend steven spielberg on this spectacular movie is or at least it should be one of the best war films ever created from the beginning and until the end of the movie i hardly blinked or even breathed during some scenes one of the reasons which made me appreciate this film more is that i saw it with my grandfather who happens to be a veteran of ww2 even though he wasnt at omaha beach or even saw as much action as the men in the movie did i could tell how he felt by looking at how he watched the movie with his eyes and how his posture was this movie was also one of the only movies i have ever seen him not fall asleep during that is only one of the many good reasons why this film was enthralling the characters were also well picked despite the fact that alot of the actors in this movie were actors that dont star in many films not only that but spielberg made these actors live as actual soldiers lived at that time so that they would get the feel of how a soldier really felt tom hanks was also phenomenal  for his part as alwaysand each other actor acted so well that you feel terrible when one of them gets killed or hurt because you like each one of these soldiers err uhh actors i mean the cinematography was top notch and that goes for costumessoundgraphicsbackgrounds and any other things that would make a movie worth seeing over and over again of course this film isnt for everyone especially those of you who are squeamish or sensitive and this probably isnt for children either but for those of you who are in the mood to see an amazing welldone action packed heart felt movie then rent this one anytime oh yeah this is also one of those movies that are alot greater on bigscreen if you know what i mean enjoy every scene,reality
this was an okay movie it looked very good and the direction was well done but it just seemed a bit trite to really push it beyond the averagethe story was pretty lame and all through the movie you get beaten over the head with morals and messages about how war is bad and peace is good the big battle scene in the beginning starts out well but by the end it becomes a case of yes we all know war is bad could you get on with the movie nowthe characters seem pretty false and boring they have the usual hollywood moments when they want tension they make the characters yell a lot when they want a big cathardic climax they have string music and a short deep sentence which make it seem less a serious work and more a moneymaking device that uses tricks of the trade to make audiences think they are watching a good movieand all the jingoistic flagwaving was a bit monotonous  i dont think american filmmakers realise how scarily fanatical it makes americans look and the total absence of any other allied country in the picture was notableit looks good but has no real depth or substance and hence no real credibility when it claims to be the greatest war movie of our time,reality
i dont know if i can describe the feelings i had watching this movie as an infantry veterancold war timei could smell the rifle firethat distinctive sound of the m1 clip popping out of the riflefor this picture not to get oscar for best picture of the yearit just tells what dopes the academy votersi was still numb hours after i got home,reality
as you did with schindlers list you have shown us something that we can not read in our history books something we can not see on the evening news you have givin us something to love our country for if people say that our country is going to hell then they need to look back and see what we have fought for and what we have tried to keep is this the best war movie ever made no is it the best movie ever made yes,reality
the opening scene had my adrenaline pumping for days after and thanking the lord that i have never had to fight in a real warwell filmed superb acting and direction accurate with regards to history and detail  tense and realthe best war movie everonly cheesey part is the way the tank blows up at the end just before it drives over our hero suppose hollywood will always have its say no matter how good the score director etc,reality
technically speaking this film was practically flawless  the combat scenes were well shot almost too realistic and gave you the feeling that you were actually witnessing a real battle  despite that fact i simply didnt like this movie  i kept trying to convince myself to like it but i just couldnt and heres why although wellmade and well acted it failed to actually draw me in emotionally and make me care about what happened to these characters  perhaps spielberg was a little bit too preoccupied with making the battle scenes realistic or maybe theres just something wrong with me i dont know  thats not to say that the film didnt have its good points  i really enjoyed barry pepper as the sharpshooter who quotes scripture while preparing to kill the enemy  but that was about it,reality
is not a great movie  in my book its not even a good film  i watched the movie when it came out despite the hype that came with it  and i feel sorry about wasting valuable time of my life watching scenes from a butcher shop  a clear intention to shock us  and bclass drama its not a waste  it has some bigtime stars and even some good actors in it  few of them perform extremely good too  it is rich and that shows in every aspect of the film it is technically perfect it is made from the stuff intellectual blockbusters are made of so why did i hated it  because there is something more in a good film than all the above  there is feeling there is genius there is passion there is more than kindergarten morals and none of them is present in  you want to watch a film about how horrible war is  watch jonny got his gun  watch full metal jacket  watch the iron cross  hey you can even watch platoon or the thin red line  not this movie,reality
well what can i say now thats what i call a movie what i really loved about this movie is the emotions you almost feel that you are there in the war nothing pretty of course i couldnt stop myself from crying through out the movie i think that everyone should see that movie,reality
i really recommend this oneyoull be surprised of the realism on this movieworth to see itthe acting of tom hanks is really amazing as always and the opening sequence at omaha beach is a blast i give a 1010,reality
i first saw spr back in 1998 on opening night and was moved then and still am  i display it prominently in my dvd case and defend it as the best war movie ever madewhat i cant figure out is why people cant get it  when you observe the two bookend scenes of the old man and his family and the american flagit says much  i think it is a question of values and morals  far to many people watch oliver stones platoon and can only think that war is evil and anything that goes back to wwii is graphically irrepressible  while platoon is a great adaptation of the vietnam war and ill endorse it for that conflict and why we should never have been there all one has to do is see spielbergs earlier epic of schindlers list to realize why wwii was right for america to be in  all too often these politically correct values that came out of the vietnam war era seam to go against what often are traditional american values such as home and family  nothing is worth losing ones life for i think is a bad attitude that has resided in our society for the past three decades or more  make love not war seams to have replaced any moral values we once had as a society  the risking of the lives of eight men to find one is a scenario that troubles those who think in this purely secular way  im certainly greatful to those of that earlier generation that were called upon to fight  something i dont think the later could do even if confronted with such a threat to personal freedoms that nazi germany represented at that timethis is a great show for older teens 1415 and older  to those who feel this show should have received an nc17 rating take a look at your thinking as stated above  if the mpaa had a split r rating as most other nations ratings boards have mr spielberg im sure would argue and i would agree that it should go into the lower of the two ma or m14 if youre a moral person youll like this show and the story of heroism courage and honor it brings to the screen but if youre a purely secular person with more humanist values you wont  i too feel it was the greatest heist that shakespeare in love narrowly edged it out for best picture for 1998  but then im sure that those with the values opposite to mine felt otherwise david moore,reality
this is perhaps the most powerful emotional film i have scene i openly wept at various times in the film we are shown the horrors of combat first hand we get to know the main characters and grieve at their lossive just sat here and read the reviews posted before me and let me say this many many of you do not get this picture at alli have read people comparing this picture to t2 and the matrix hey i like a good scifi action film as well but that is far from the genre that is attempted hereand as far as comparing this to full metal jacket or platoon both good films in their own rights this was a different time a different war with different politics there is no comparing the two warsif you havent seen it rent it or buy it go into the past in their shoes hit the beach with your fathers your uncles and grandfathers on dday feel what its like to be involved in a mission you dont agree with but have to continue on grieve for the death of a friendthis movie is a tribute to all of the veterans of dday god bless them,reality
i dont know what the heck the folks at the oscars were thinking  i still cant believe that shakespeare in love got best picture at the oscars in 1998  shakespeare in love is a good movie but nowhere near as powerful and thoughtprovoking as  the fact that this movie didnt win best picture is a crimei have seen war movies such as platoon full metal jacket and the thin red line and none of these movies reaches quite reaches the standard established by though they are all excellent movies in their own right  the acting dialogue and action is top notch  though some of the movies do come close but presents the most disturbing images i have ever seen in a movie of this genrea friend of mine complains that speilburg is too cheesy in how he show the american flag at the end of the movie  there is nothing cheesy about that at all  the flag represents among other things the people who fought and died in all wars past and present  i hardly call that cheese  he also claims that because it is more uplifting than full metal jacket that it does not convey to full lengths the reality of war  i agree that it is more uplifting than full metal jacket though war movies in general are anything but uplifting the setting and mood of the war reflect each individual film  vietnam was the most unpopular war in american history  it had very little support by the masses and the outcome was horrendous for america the fact that we lost the war at the cost of thousands of lives gave this war a more naturalistic outlook than movies based upon world war 2  in that the war the good guys won as america had a more moral cause to defeat the axis powers and free the imprisoned and avenge the victims of the nazis genocidal regime  this mostly explains why was not as naturalistic as movies that took place in vietnam such as full metal jacket and platoonif there was one movie i would ask anyone to see it would be this movie fulfills masterfully the mood and tragedies of war and the price of american sacrifice  a masterpiece,reality
it started well enough with the protracted horrors of war on screen there to teach the audience the cost of war and then spielberg as always played for sentiment and proceeded to created the best leastchallenging warpatriotism movie on record it was well acted made and stunning to behold it just offers nothing newand fails as a lesson about war spielbergsighi just cant get excited about the guy i know what hes going to dothe starship troopers comparison is good the bugs  nazis but the troopers were nazis too it isnt that private were evil but you can see the way propaganda runs its course in media i remember the audience cheering for the sniper all the way that doesnt sound like the horror of war stuck with anyone patriotism is a good thing but maturity as an audience involves recognizing our flaws tooand thats why we have movies about vietnam,reality
war movies have in the past tended to lean toward patriotic flag waving or antiwar sentiments there have been a few notable exceptions such as hell is for heroes and castle keep  these movies shine through because they depicted the action relatively realistically  is another movie that thrusts the viewer into the confusion and carnage  the action scenes were extremely realistic  if it had tried more to show some of the routine hardships of a combat soldier such as fatigue cold hunger etc then i think this masterpiece of a movie would have been even better  even so i rate this as the top movie of all time,reality
he just puts the camera on our shoulders and takes a dive  from blistering hell to silent agony apocalypse surrounds us and never lets go that is how to sum up the first 27 minutes of what is certainly the greatest war picture ever more human realistic and breathtaking than its predecessors  spielbergs masterpiece takes us to the bottom of human despair and into the courage of a few men who fought for the end of totalitarism in the last great war millions of people lost their lives in this terrible event millions and all that spielberg is saying is  remember who you have to thank for living how you do today congratulations mr spielberg,reality
politics has come to be associated with dishonesty and greed but we should never forget that the sacrifices depicted in this film were necessary because europe had been depoliticized by the nazisi shudder whenever i hear proposals to depoliticize elected positions such as district attorney county administrator etc or the creation of special tax rate setting committees we have vowed never to forget the human suffering of the concentration camps but we seem to have already forgotten the reason those beaches were stormed the world did not yet know the truth of nazi atrocities on dday those free men who gave so much only knew that a depoliticized europe had dehumanized its citizensto avoid the same mistakes we should make this film required viewing in all high school history coursesthen give thanks to those heroes who made politics possible,reality
this is one of the greatest films ever made  it came out providing competition to another good war film the thin red line but for those who know what theyre talking about its obvious the latter didnt even put up a contest  the first 28 minutes of spr are a work of art  if you think otherwise then try and do it better yourself  the manner in which it is filmed has influenced other films such as gladiator  in regards to the comments some make saying that the film is to usa have you noticed that the film follows a group of american soldiers  it is about their struggle amidst certain events like dday as for cliches what isnt a cliche today  to say that human struggle when young watching your friends due around you not knowing if its your turn to die tomorrow watching not just peoples homes but their lives destroyed by a war is not a cliche and for those who think differently get a humanity transplantthis is a gripping film that makes you part of the group a compatriot in this mission and not many films allow you to get so close to the characters a cliche ridden film is the remake of the thin red line by terrance malick but true masterpiece true emotion is found in the story of capt john h miller a man who has lost so many men under his command who tries to save one,reality
staggering is the only word to describe watching this film is a truly powerful experience you will remember this movie long after it is over the battle scenes in this movie are unparalelled in cinematic history they show the true horrors of what soldiers in world war 2 went through the performances are excellent tom hanks gives his best performance yet as captain john h miller the leader of the platoon to find private james who gets to go home because his other brothers were killed in combat a truly unforgetable experience dont miss it,reality
this film has been mentioned as the greatest wwii film of all time  it was very good but nowhere near that good  it probably qualifies as the one of best wwii films made after 1970  there were dozens of great films with better stories made in the 1940s 1950s and 1960s when the war was still fresh in everyones mindsthe story was about a rescue mission to find a paratrooper behind enemy lines and bring him back alive because all his brothers had been killed in the war  the platoon was commanded by captain john miller tom hanks who had to take his men through enemy controlled territory to rescue private matt damon  it is a combination character study and action film more about the platoon than about private himself  other than captain miller there wasnt very much character development but there was a good deal of time devoted to the human dynamics within the platoon which was excellent what really stands out about this film is the direction  steven spielberg has created probably the most gut wrenchingly realistic war movie ever made the scenes on the beach at normandy were terrifying  this should be required viewing for all politicians and generals before we commit men to battle  spielbergs attention to detail and willingness to show the grisly and horrifying results of men being thrown into a fusillade of projectiles is unparalleled  the entire ensemble cast did a terrific job  tom hanks as always was masterful as captain miller  he struck just the right balance between the sympathetic commander who understood what his men were going through and the hardnosed military man who had to force them to do a job they didnt want to doi rated this film an 810  it wasnt the greatest wwii story ever told but it may have been the greatest telling of such a story  this film shows explicit battle scenes that are brutally gory  it is definitely not for the squeamish,reality
im not saying that shakespeare in love wasnt a good movie just that epic films such as are almost always due the academy award for best picture  the names steven speilberg and tom hanks already have the term academy award winner in front of them and when you get both of those big names together you get the best picture made in 1998tom hanks plays capt john miller a high school english teacher sent off to fight in the war  the movie opens with a very dramatic 15 minute massacre on the beach  miller along with his company of troops takes out a group of german soldiers manning a huge gun spraying bullets on the rest of the allies  after the battle miller learns of his new orders of seeking out a soldier by the name of  it seems this private james francis is the last of 4 sons sent to fight in the war  the other 3 sons have been killed and the us army deemed it necessary to extract the last of the brothers before he is ultimately killed as well  there is a very poignant scene wheres mother receives a message delivered by some army diplomats telling her that 3 of her sons have died  this is a very well put together story all the way down to how difficult it would actually be to find a paratrooper in wwiitom sizemore sgt michael horvath vin diesel pvt adrian caparzo giovanni ribisi medic irwin wade and matt damon pvt james round out this starstudded cast  by far the best performance is by of course tom hanks  his ability to act in any surrounding be it on top of the empire state building sleepless in seattle in cyberspace youve got mail or in a department store jumping on a large foot piano big tom hanks is definitely one of todays greatest actors takes us on a trip across the battlefields to find pvt and get him home to the states  the film has some very dramatic substories and a few slightly funny scenes  steven spielberg very carefully created a movie that will have you shocked from the seriousness of the opening scene to laughing at some of the lines to crying from some of the very sad moments of this filmthe vivid cinematography by janusz kaminski made this epic film what it is the camera angles used created the feeling of actually being there next to vin diesel as he is taking out the enemy sniper  due to the heroics shown in the opening sequence we develop a likening with the main characters especially capt john miller and throughout the film we are told more and more about their backgrounds  another very cleaver addition to this film if that the captains men have this continuing bet going about capt millers personal background and by the middle of the movie we are told what it is he did before being sent to fight in this war when the academy awards handed out the award for best director to steven spielberg i was happy and just waiting for them to announce the best picture also  however when they called out shakespeare in love as the best picture winner i was stunned  to reiterate im not saying that its a bad movie just that if spielberg was deemed the best director how come his film wasnt considered the best of the year  its no surprise that im not a fan of giving the best director award and best picture award to two different pictures as they have done in many years including 2728 56 81 and most recently 89  it just doesnt sound right to me with all that said there are a few mistakes in the film as every movie does however is definitely one of the greatest epic films joining the ranks of braveheart and schindlers list  this movie must not be missed by anyone who calls themselves human,reality
i remember the day i went to see first blood in the theaters  i thought that it was a good movie with plenty of character development and a simple storyline  however when rambo ii came outthere was such an outcry because it was being racist in the way it portrayed the arabs  it was much too violent too  there were protests in the street and news articles in the magazines devoted twopage spreads on the ravages of war  enter  i finally saw the movie and was left with my mouth open dont get me wrongi love war movies and i love movies that have a sense of purpose to the killings that go on during the film  however with this movie it was different  i was left empty  absolutely no feelings whatsoever once it was over  i really didnt care after a while seeing soldiers die or explode for that matter in the heat of battle  it was kinda boring after a while  its funny i get more from watching scarface then from seeing this movie  this movie did not have one iota of character development  not one tiddle  you think that with all the hoopla during the oscars that it was a good movienow i know why shakespear in love won best picturebecause it was entrenched in emotion and the audience cared for the characters  in i got to the point where i saidwho cares  it was long drawn out and boring  speilberg should stick with dinosaurshe gets more responses from them then the actors in this movie shoot the dinosaurs were digital or mechanicaltheres a clue  what i cant get is that the movie won speilberg all these world awards for bringing people to the awareness of the ravages of world war ii ahyeah  the thin red line did that tooi didnt see that director honored for his achievementhmm maybe because he was trying to make a movie that actually was good and not appealing to award councils  oh yeah when i said i got more out of scarface it wasnt a jokein fact goodfellas was even better than this movieand had way more violence then both these 2 movies combined  anyway i think that speilberg should stick with ets and let other directors do the war stuff oh yeah when this movie was over i thoughtgee all i have to do is make a movie with a historical context and i be a famous director  nahid rather go back and watch rambo movies they are much more docile,reality
i absolutely love this movie  it was so intense that i became emotionally overwhelmed  the camera work was superb and it was as close to being in combat as you will ever get without being a soldier  too many war movies try too hard to grind an axe  we are the good guys or war is bad or war is heroic or something  allows us to see heroism without making war an adventure shows us about courage while showing understanding of cowardice and teaches us about the carnage of war without detracting from the fact that sometimes it needs to be fought,reality
i saw this movie and i felt bored during the middle of iti felt that it was showboating tom hanks and it seemed to revolve around himhanks made an oscar worthy performancebut i felt that was itmy final rankinga 4 out of ten,reality
steven spielberg has given us one of the best movies of all time certainly the greatest war movie ever made  but more importantly an entire generation that views world war ii as ancient history will finally be able to appreciate the sacrifice made by thousands of young boys whose willingness to die allows us to enjoy freedom  the graphic realism of combat that spielberg portrays on screen is necessary and will take your breath away  it will also make you proudis a must see movie  it should be viewed every year right before memorial day,reality
this is my favorite movie of all time and it is a great one  like all great movies it has unfortunately become prone to backlash and criticism i think that almost all of it is unfair the movie is brilliant and it is not supposed to be a typical war film  instead of talking about the film itself i actually feel compelled to defend this masterpiecefirst of all what people bash more than anything are its bookends in the military cemetery  every war movie has its own themefull metal jacket was about men dehumanized into killers gallipoli was about soldiers as individuals and spr is about the sacrifices that wwii veterans made that we no longer appreciate  the bookends would not have worked in the thin red line or apocalypse now but they are necessary here  true they are a little overly sappy and the familys girls are so attractive it is distracting  but one of the major points of this movie is that many of us have forgotten what the veterans of this war did for us and that we no longer appreciate the sacrifices they made  far too often do younger people look at those from the war generation with indifference and disrespect  i am a wwii buff and ever since i started reading about it in high school i was always bothered by the fact that nobody seemed to care about it  the faded flags that open and close the movie are not symbols of patriotismthey are our fading appreciation for wwii veterans sacrifices  i am happy that spr brought a renewed interest in this subjectspr is about the american gis experiences in wwii europe and spielberg is not claiming with this film that people of other nations did not help or die fighting fascism with us  the second world war almost covered the entire globe  i would never complain about the lack of americans in soldier of orange or hope and glory two great films that are about the dutch and british experiences respectivelyspr is not as black and white as many people claim it is  the germans are not all evil monsters in this movie isnt it americans who sadistically shoot germans actually czechs who are most obviously surrendering  the steamboat willie character is just a soldier doing his jobhe later comes back and shoots americans after millers squad released him and no he is not the ss trooper that stabs mellish with a bayonet  miller made the mistake of letting steamboat willie go because it seemed the decent thing to do  but was it  a pow who is let go cannot be expected to surrenderwhat do we expect him to do  tell his army upon meeting them that he can no longer shoot at americans according to the video hound book on war movies the ss trooper who stabs mellish tells him in german dont fight it  soon this will be over  youre going to a better place  he is mercifully killing his enemy he also lets col upham live since upham poses no threat to him  this soldier is a good soldier unfortunately on the opposite side  to many it may seem like the germans are depicted as monsters in this movie  but we must look deeper and remember that men under fire dont really care what nice guys their enemies are outside of war  and comments like the german army were not nazis  they were just soldiers are as much generalizations as saying all germans were nazis  there were plenty of nazis in the wehrmacht  as far as i know spr was well received in germany  spielberg was honored with an award there shortly afterwardthis movie is anything but unrealistic  i think i even saw a claim on the imdb that it was fake because soldiers would never storm normandy without air and artillery support  guess what  they did  normandy was an awful mess  heavy cloud cover and fear of killing their own soldiers prevented the us from defeating the defenses at omaha and lead to the ultrarealistic slaughter depicted in the first halfhour of the moviesome have called the actions of the germans in the final sequence one of the greatest i have ever seen unrealistic and unintelligent  at this point in the war the german army was in no position to carry out proper bythebook battle tactics  they were under hitlers stubborn orders to hold at all costs and were sent on many suicidal missions like this one  it was so bad that by the time of the battle of the bulge americans were appalled at the way that german soldiers marched right up a road in broad daylight to the front  historian steven ambrose said that americans had no choice but to open fire on the columns and mow them down like a scythe cutting wheat besides generals captains lieutenants and privates etc on both sides make horrible mistakes and this war was no exception as for the plot of this movie one historian described it as very possible but not very probable  take the case of fritz niland of the 501st pir  all three of his brothers were killed in combat in different divisions  luckily high officials in the us army knew where he was and they had him sent home immediatelyi dont see how anyone could not be affected by the opening sequence on omaha beach  it is clearly amazing  actual veterans have offered their medals and patches to spielberg because of it  the climactic battle sequence is absolutely unforgettable  ive seen it so many times yet it is still difficult to watch  it is incredibly suspenseful frustrating explosive horrifying and shocking yet it is all beautifully and coherently filmed  when miller tells to earn this he is also speaking to us to the generations born after wwii who have to respect what the veterans have donemost of us havent been there and we will never be able to say that we know what combat is like  but spielberg has pleased veterans in creating a movie that depicts their experiences as well as a movie possibly can  spr is a wonderful movie that will always be remembered and thats worth more than any oscar award it could have received,reality
in the past few years weve had a slew of memorable wwii moviesdont forget themwhatever your preference is schindler thin red line or life is beautiful dont forget itdont forget the european battlefieldswas the best movie of the 90s  spielberg took no prisoners in his ultraaccurate portrayal of the war  see it again hopefullydont forget the pacific theaterthe thin red line shows the barbarianism of both armies  it shows what happens when beauty and chaos collidedont forget the holocaustschindlers list  life is beautiful are unforgiving and unspeakably important movies  be sure to see themdont forget wwii  remember it through these movies if theres no other way  if is at all representative of the war im just glad to have it to remember,reality
i saw this movie the first day it was out  i went in got myself a large popcorn and when the movie started i could not eat or move for the first half hour  this movie was so powerful that it makes all other war movies seem unrealistic  it is hard to put into words the feelings i went through while viewing this movie  i will never look at older people the same way after seeing this film  what we owe them is everything we have  our lives our freedom and our way of life  i understand that this was an american film and i only wish that they could have shown a little more of the sacrifices our allies had to go through  i can only say in the movies defense that most of the younger english and other europeans already understand the hell their nations went through during wwii where as this was a learning experience for most americans  we tend to take our freedom for granted like it is a gift from god but it is movies like this that show us that our way of life is something that the generations before us had to fight and die for,reality
saving privatedirection 100 if you can find a better dramatic war action film than this please give me a ring flawless and impeccable with room to bring the viewer into the action in the two major war scenes the small incidents still manages to pull you into the tension  a well deserved oscar win in this categoryacting 91 upham and hanks leads the way in the emotional scenes perhaps more could have been expected from other characterseditingpspecial effects 98 supreme and impressive war scenes the first 20mins are the most memorable and exciting the director manages to pull the whole cinema into the movie and wont let you lot go until everyone either dies or they just managed to liveplot 72 not complex but neither is it too simple as emotional scenes and characters tell their own story on how they are reacting to the challenges of not all war movies need to have detail plotlinesstrong words and violence etc 94 the action is stronger than the words it may give you nightmares but at least you will know how it felt to be on the beach best seen and heard on the big screenmusic 76 there for the quiet and victorious momentssound 99 with the surround sound effects hitting you with virtual bullets and explosions will your senses survive in the cinemahookability 99 as soon as you see the bodies drop you will be running for coverlastability 87 you will want to see the ending if continuing the mission was worth the troubleoverall 90 just manages to get to this golden mark only on virtue of its technical merits and placing the viewer on the screen for the first time in a cinema setting  instead of its oral drama onscreen even though this was exceptional in places right mr upham why this movie felt it needed to distort history by implying that america saved the world from hitler with non nato style american flag waving will put off the most sincere film goer,reality
well at least on videodvd you can fastwind through the pointless graveyard scene that opens and closes the movie  the rest of the film is surprisingly moving so long as you suspend disbelief enough to accept that the army would ever launch such a rescue missionthe battle sequences are really unlike any other war movie ive seen graphic and disturbing rather than cheap gungho thrills  the handheld camera work draws you in and really makes you feel as if youre there experiencing it firsthand and the bleachbypass effect gives the whole film a suitably cold and bleak lookmy only concern is that millions of americans of my generation and younger might think that world war ii was fought only between americans and germans i am eternally grateful for the intervention of the us in world war ii and i understand why the film revolves around a group of american soldiers but the fact that no reference was made to the british forces who saw the war through from beginning to end leaves an extremely bitter taste in the mouthwhat a shame,reality
awhile back a group of us decided that we wanted to experience what combat could of been like the closest thing we could use for that experence was a game called paintball we played the game for over 2 years i wont go into a lot of detail about the game other than when you get shot it hurts sometimes it hurts a lot those of you who have played know what i mean it hurts enough that it makes you go to great extents while youre playing to not get shot this in turn generates alot of emotions fear anger cowardness joy these are a few that come to mind i want to expand on the fear ive felt my stomach twist into knots as a group of guys bear down on my particular position in a game ive felt scared knowing that whats about to happen is going to hurt maybe alot probably only a few readers will have any idea of what im talking about but the point is i always got up and went home thats what this movie is about those that didnt get up and go home i get down on my knees and bow to all of the combat veterans that died and those who survived for i had no idea what you went through until this movie thank you for those of you who have to grind an axe on this site with spielberg hanks or who ever leave it in the closet the movie isnt about personalities or politics its about war thanks for the forum,reality
i feel compelled to finally say something about this film i saw it in the theaters when it first came out and rented on video ill admit it was good but to call it the greatest war movie ever made is a major overstatement first of all didnt anyone notice how badly spielberg ripped off kurosawa that alone i found rather disappointing second the blatant and heavy handed symbolism come on we just watched people get blown to bits do we really need to stare at an american flag is the american public so dense they couldnt get itthird okay i realize private was a symbol but wwii was real to say that after filming some very intense real images of war we need a symbol to understand what all those millions of people died for was the military so lax the day after dday that they could waste their time tracking down some young kid to make mommy feel better why not ship the whole army back home and forget about europewhen you get right down to it spr is nothing more than a feel good disneyfied version of war there are many of fine outstanding films about war all quiet on the western front platoon the thin red line escape from sobibor ran apocalypse now heck apocalypse now was full of symbolism but it didnt hide behind the pretense of realism,reality
the first minutes i just found incredible never seen such intensity in a war movie before you can feel the horror and the fear of the man 10 points so farbut after that the film follows the standard hollywood war movie pattern american boys being heroes some sentimentality some victims some blood some bad guys and so oni expected more by spielberg than making sure the movie goes well at the box office a lost chance could have been the ultimate war movie,reality
despite the brilliance of the warscenes and they are truly amazing this movie still has too many spielberg moments for me the film is stylistically schizophrenic he should have used the documentarystyle all the way through now he falls between two chairs making the movie feel disjointed and unbalanced what irritates me is that he could and should have been more consistent in tone he of all directors certainly could afford more experimentation now it has moments of genius and moments of cheesy standard spielbergsentimentality and a paradoxical prowar message war makes you grow as a person very good performances but a questionable matt damon and striking photography and sound but unfortunately not as good as it should have been,reality
having put off seeing this film for months because people said it was graphic violent and bloodyi finally saw it yesterday  i am extremely grateful i did  yes the landing at omaha beach on dday was realistic to say the least but it showed what the men of wwii actually experienced better than any book could possibly do  stephen ambrose the wwii historian and consultant on the film has given it the highest marks for realism  if anyone has any idea of what it means to be an american of how invaluable our freedom is of the sacrifice that our forefathers made let them watch spr and feel no doubt  undoubtedly the best picture of 1998,reality
theres violence and theres violence with the huge numbers of personal reviews of this movie im hard pressed to add much the first half hour affected me like no other in recent years i wondered as the boys threw up on the amphibious carriers whether they were seasick or scared beyond belief when one uses the expression cannon fodder so casually do we realize that this means the second wave makes its way to the beach over the dead and dying bodies of the first wave like ants sacrificing themselves to ford a puddle the ones that get through get through because there are only so many bullets and so many people they are exposed disoriented helplessthey have no place to go but ahead i will be haunted forever by the soldier searching then finding his dismembered arm in the carnage i will remember those trying to get above water only to be cut down below the surface if anyone has a heart his or her attitude toward war should never be the same how can we who have never been there have a hint of what it must have been like like schindlers list on the holocaust this should be a training film on war,reality
why it had such potential it has some of the greatest battle scenes ever filmed but why did they have to include such a banal plot that manages to send dual messages that contradict themselves in the worst way possible sure when speaking of the technical aspects of the film it is in fact a great achievment and the acting is above average but spielberg packs into so full of repulsive nationalism especially during the later part of the film that when the final frame appeared i almost want to throw up in disgust towards the overblown cliches that populate this film and then we have the thing that has always kept spielberg off my list of outstanding filmmakers the film is so sentimental it almost caused me to start yelling obscene words at the screen plus the film is way too long and very predictable but it is worth seeing for the great cinematography acting editing and the battle sequences can you guess if i think this is one of the best films about war ever made do i really think that about the film hell no its a pretty good film all in all its better than most films spielberg has made since raiders of the lost arc not nearly as good as schindlers list though if you compare it to the likes of missing in action it looks great but when it faces the likes of apocalypse now full metal jacket salvador and bullet in the head its doa,reality
this film is excellent except for one respect the toning in of the stars and stripes at the beginning and the end unnecessary egocentric and downgrading most people who fought and died in ww2 were europeansthe thing that really made this film is the opening sequence the first 30 minutes are brilliant horrifying and historical never ever has war been depicted in such a realistic manner its genuine and true  not john wayne waltzing out from the landing craft with the bullets whipping past him and his brave men this is what it was likeother than that this film is not too original most of the germans are anonymous and disgusting and even though the poor sod who gets to dig his own grave turns out to be a real brd and there is one part i really dont like why on earth does the guy theyre looking for want to stay its irrational and unthinkablebut all in all  this is a great movie not all too believable  but nonetheless a realistic war movie just get rid of those flags you guys,reality
while i cant say i was there i do a lot of reading of ww ii and i dont want to down play or forget the sacrifice our veterans made in the war however im really sorry but i saw so much wrong with this movie i dont know where to beginfirst does anyone really think the us military would notice 3 people kia are brothers and 1 brother is still alive does the sullivan brothers mean anything to any onesecond the german mg42 machine guns used in this movie have a faster rate of fire than the ones used in this movie they were also deployed with a 10 man squad toothird  ask any wwii vet the germans werent an easy army to beat that battle at the end of this movie any good officer would know you dont send tanks in first into a built up area like a city you send in infantry to find enemy positions firstwhen is some one going to make an honestly accurate war movie not this piece of fiction,reality

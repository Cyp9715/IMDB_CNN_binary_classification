george miller returns to liveaction filmmaking with one of the greatest action films ever put to screen fury road is ridiculous in all the right waysfor those who have seen the original films and loved them youll fall in love all over again with this film tom hardy takes the reigns this time around as  a man of few words who has been hardened by the world in which he lives along with him is charlize theron as imperator furiosa  a woman who seeks redemption by helping five young wives escape from the films antagonistleading up to the films release many speculated if this would be just another action film that lacks a solid narrative and motive but i am happy to say that this is simply not the case yes the film does fill 80 of its runtime with action sequences but it never gets in the way of the humanity between these characters that miller has brought to life there are some emotional moments specifically with therons character is the story something we havent seen before not at all but in a film loaded with action its nice to see a solid narrativenow how about those action sequences incredible  exhilarating  jawdropping george miller has put together some of the greatest most memorable action setpieces ever one thing that sets the action in this film apart from a good majority of mediocre action films today is that every action the characters make have an affect on them for good and for bad the action is not pointless its motivated and its glorious to behold thanks to the use of practical effects incredible stunt work and stunning cinematographyfury road has set a new standard for action films its arguably the greatest action film of the 21st century its that good george miller has brought back what we loved about 80s action films while also brining new ideas to the table its the best time ive had in a theater in a long time and i couldnt help but laugh in appreciation of the ridiculousness that was unfolding before my eyes the film left me feeling giddy with a big smile on my face,reality
an action essential through and through its plain and simple since the days of die hard and terminator the action genre has turned into a repetitive overthetop array of films trying too hard to create entertaining sequences that instead look too cheesy due to bad composition or an overuse of cgi of course along the way we have had some fine exceptions in the style of casino royale and the dark knight but certain directors cough michael bay dont seem to be able to use their knowledge of an action sequence to its full potential and instead have constant fiery explosions and overthetop shaky camerawork among other things oh but then theres fury road talk about epic action pieces it has been 30 years since the release of beyond thunderdome back in 1985 and george miller decided to return to the directorial chair for a reboot and my god he truly is a mastermind of action after creating the epic scale of an action film in the form of the road warrior it was going to be hard to live up to the previous films in the franchise but miller didnt just do that he excelled at it and instead beat his previous films with tom hardy as the new face of and namibia as the new backdrop for post apocalyptic australia fury road is an exhilarating action fest that goes beyond its boundaries in creating what might just be one of the greatest action films ever made hearing that nearly 90 of the stunts and effects were practical literally blew me away the sequences are extravagant and complex with frequent fireballs and car crashes filling the screen george millers 2015 vigorous tale blends emotion and brutality with drama and action to reignite australias greatest film franchise and create the epitome of the action genre,reality
fury road starring tom hardy and charlize theron is george millers attempt to reignite his long dormant franchiseand my god does he ever for the past decade or so with exceptions such as john wick the bourne trilogy and the raid action movies seem to be struggling to capture the excitement and enjoyment the genre once held a tenacity that classics from the 80s and 90s had in spades george miller single handedly delivers our saving grace with fury road on the back of a spike covered oil rig with a blind zombie playing a fire breathing electric guitaris a man of few words but tom hardys talent for portraying strong silent characters shines through in a gruff but sympathetic performance he teams up with charlize therons imperator furiosa to save the last 5 hot women in the world from the leader of a powerful cult with a terrifying breathing mask inspired by the cheshire cat from alice in wonderland from there the chase is on using this simple plot as the setting we are able to bear witness to one of the most beautifully shot films in years the world of looks absolutely gorgeous combining aweinspiring practical effects and landscapes with bold colours brimming from all edges of the frame these are of course just bonuses in enhancing the primary reason people will love this film the action itself im happy to report these action sequences are damn near flawless no shaky cam barely a hint of cgi and scenes where we actually feel like our characters are in danger yes furious 7 im calling you out total chaos relentlessly ensues for the majority of the film but its chaos you can follow clearly and marvel at whether its one of the explosive car sequences or one of the smaller emotional moments fury road refuses to let up on tension for one secondtheres a reason this movie is sitting at 98 on rotten tomatoes this is an action movie that will set a precedent for years to come roaring ferociously at all who may challenge it hopefully this is only the beginning of a genre revolution early in the makingfinal verdict fury road is a beautifully chaotic display of masterfully executed action sequences with a strong emotional core and a raw energy unmatched by nearly all of its action genre competition,reality
im not completely sure what i was expecting from fury road but it was more than this this is the latest example of hollywood rehashing a successful and good movie franchise solely for profit its mindless repetitive action sequences melded between horrible acting and overused clichsone of the allures of this series is seeing the outlandish road vehicles that are used and in this the movie mostly delivers you have the highpowered warrior rig driven by furiosa theres battle vehicles equipped with spikes rigs with counterbalanced poles for launching warriors into other vehicles and theres even a vehicle equipped with large bass drums and a stack of speakers that would make kiss jealous with a psychotic guitarist wailing away for our musical enjoyment and of course each vehicle comes equipped with more explosive arsenal than a battle ship and its put to good usehowever once you get past the eye candy you realize theres nothing else to it the story is weak the characters are weaker and the acting is the worst the movie never drew me in not even close whenever the movie tried to add depth and be dramatic it was painful and embarrassing to watch the scene where furiosa reacts to finding out her birth home is gone by taking off her prosthetic arm and dropping down to her knees may be the worst movie scene ive ever watched and it says something when the most interesting character is nux a relentless slavewarrior who actually has a mind of his own and decides to help and furiosa in their quest of course one of immortan joes wives falls for him representing one of the many poorly executed clichs this movie is riddled withi can watch a superficial action movie and enjoy it for what it is to a point this one however is just generally so poorly executed that it leaves a lot to be desired i didnt hate it but i have absolutely no desire to see it again,reality
its hard to believe that the same talented director who made the influential cult action classic the road warrior had anything to do with this disasterroad warrior was raw gritty violent and uncompromising and this movie is the exact opposite its like road warrior for kids who need constant action in their moviesthis is the movie the good guys get into a fight with the bad guys outrun them they break down in their vehicle and fix it rinse and repeat the second half of the movie is the first half again just done fasterthe road warrior may have been a simple premise but it made you feel something even with its opening narration before any action was even shown and the supporting characters were given just enough time for each of them to be likable or relatablein this movie there is absolutely nothing and no one to care about were supposed to care about the characters because well we should george miller just wants us to and in one of the most cringe worthy moments charlize therons character breaks down while dramatic music plays to try desperately to make us caretom hardy is pathetic as one of the dullest leading men ive seen in a long time theres not one single moment throughout the entire movie where he comes anywhere near reaching the same level of charisma mel gibson did in the role gibson made more of an impression just eating a tin of dog food im still confused as to what accent hardy was even trying to doi was amazed that has now become a cartoon character as well gibsons was a semirealistic tough guy who hurt bled and nearly died several times now he survives car crashes and tornadoes with ease in the previous movies fuel and guns and bullets were rare not anymore it doesnt even seem postapocalyptic theres no sense of desperation anymore and everything is too glossy looking and the main villains super model looking wives with their perfect skin are about as convincing as apocalyptic survivors as hardys australian accent is theyre so boring and onedimensional george miller could have combined them all into one character and you wouldnt miss anyonesome of the green screen is very obvious and fake looking and the cgi sandstorm is laughably bad it wouldnt look out of place in a pixar movie in the previous movies there was occasionally a sped up frame rate that gave a nice homage to the silent era nowmiller has gone full looney toons and sped up the majority of the action making many of the real stunts redundant theyre too fast to fully enjoy theres no tension no real struggle or any real dirt and grit that road warrior had everything george miller got right with that masterpiece he gets completely wrong here,reality
yo punishable by death just letting you know that this movie was shot using 80 practical effects and thats a fact on this web page so youre completely wrong when you say that its full of cgi but anyway this movie is a real crazy ride from the very beginning it takes you straight into the action and never lets go this movie is so incredibly filmed and the stunts are performed marvelously although this movie is said to star tom hardy and charlize theron the real star here is george miller this man created a masterpiece and it was so beautifully put together he managed to show the chaos and urgency without the constant shaky camera crap that we see out of action movies now this is the best pure action movie that ive ever seen,reality
first off this is another movie in which the action sequences last so long that you can go to the bathroom get a soda come back and still find the same people fighting the same fights you saw begin 15 minutes earlier personally these type of action movies bore me to tears because the story has to stop moving every time we watch one of these extended action sequences in terms of story the good guys and the bad guys meeting is a plot point then they fight then one of them wins as an audience member im ready to know who wins as soon as they start fighting and i really need the lead characters to have some logical reasons for doing what they are doing heres my spoiler they drive away from someplace for half the movie and then decide to turn around and go back the only thing that happened was that they picked up a gang of old ladies thats as deep as it gets right there theyre running away fighting the whole way they get away and then they decide to go back so they have to fight the whole way nothing makes much sense no characters are anything but as shallow as they could have possibly been made if you like avatar youll like this movie if you liked and road warrior youre going to be angry about how that franchise was exploited in name and setting only this character isnt he doesnt have a dog he doesnt eat dog food he doesnt eat anything nobody in the film ever eats anything nor are people clamoring for gasoline they all just seem to have it theres an issue with water but it makes no sense and the entire weak plot seems to depend on it the movie ends with giant water valves being opened just like the air valves on mars get turned on in the end of that governor arnold movie i cant remember the name the reviews calling this something new and different are absolute hogwash this is nothing but things blowing up and cars crashing for two hours which by the way is another egregious offense of these silly movies they take a 90 minute movie with a great story line and they strip it of plot and somehow extend it by 30 minutes its a scary trend the kind of thing that makes one think idiocracy was prophetic the less the story and the more things blow up the higher the ratings ridiculous,reality
fury road is george millers return to the franchise he started way back in 1979 with i will start by saying this movie was absolutely batsh insane it was filled right to the brim with continuous over the top bloody ridiculous action sequences that keep you on the edge of the seat and just amazed at what is happening on screen now this film doesnt have much of a plot at all but seriously youre not going into this film for an intense plot this is a film that almost didnt even need one at all the one thing i was worried about going in was whether i needed to have seen the previous films to understand this one and thankfully you dont the story is independent of the previous film which was really helpful the characters were all awesome and it did an amazing job to introduce them all almost instantly and get right into the action tom hardy and furiosa charlize theron were were great and extremely likable characters even the villain who i will just call sweet tooth was so great he wasnt anything too special but was a great threat throughout the film i just absolutely loved this movie intense action from start to finish and didnt slow down at all that made it ridiculously fun to watch the great characters and the performances are awesome on screen and were always interesting to watch if there was ever a twisted metal movie this is what it would be nothing really let the film down and everything really worked such a great time and the best cinema experience this year so far  10,reality
its troubling that a movie can be singularly focused on loud explosions and violence with no plot dialogue or character development yet receive widespread critical acclaim this is the first film ive ever seen that actually reminded me of the type the populace in idiocracy would find enthralling to be clear there are no redeeming qualities about this film none and i went in with pretty low expectations figuring this would be some fun mindless entertainment ie the expendables or any jason statham movie the first few minutes werent too bad it looked cheesy but it had potential but then i realized that this movie is one long boring car chaseand thats it really i mean it really was boring  exactly what an action movie should not be the car chases are all one and the same after a few minutes it just isnt excitingthere is no story the two leads drive to the middle of nowhere then turn around thats it two of the characters mention they are looking for redemption or some other trite nonsense but the audience is never told why not that theyd care is the story about survival at first youd think so mentions in the opening credits that he is a man reduced to one trait survival yet at the films end when he finally has an opportunity to survivehe chooses not to what the movie was bad enough until this actually i forgot there is an incredibly forced romance between two side characters that does nothing to further the story this is a b movie with a big budgetlikewise there is essentially no dialogue save a few grunts from and cringeinducingly awkward lines from the rest there isnt any character development but then again the characters themselves resemble video game characters there are no characters to develop just twodimensional avatars used for an excuse to show explosions so what is this films targeted demographic im not sure i can imagine that if you are a 13year old boy really into carstrucksslipknot pretty redneck and probably a little slow this movie may seem pretty cool i mean it does have ridiculous carstrucks outfitted with lots of weapons spikes flameexhausts breastmilk and guys playing cool guitar riffs for no apparent reason theres also lots of explosions and fighting and scantily clad women and tornadoes and skulls on top of all that there is no need to pay attention to petty plot lines or dialogue in order to enjoy the film hell once they reach the desert the movie repeats itself as the leads drive the truck back through the same place being chased by the same guys for no discernible reason the special effects arent even that good the whole movie looks fake i know they went to great measures to avoid using cgi but honestly i thought id at least be impressed by the special effects since clearly nothing was spent on anything else and im not the kind of person who usually notices when cgi is used or not truly awful i would rate it lower if i could the only recent movie that may have actually been worse that this was lucy which was also mindnumbingly stupid as the principal in billy madison once said everyone in this room is now dumber for having watched it avoid,reality
george miller returns with a bang and takes the helm of this crazy 2hr bonkers extravaganza named fury road first of all the stunts and action sequences are spectacular tom hardy breaths life into rockatansky and charlize theron is excellent and emotionally perfect as furiosa the story opens with immortan joe who has young ladies as his wives but hell goes down when they escape the sadists hands who has a violent past with joes cronies decides to help imperior furiosa take the girls somewhere safe furiosa cant trust and neither can he so it all comes down to joes cronies fighting against them reaching to their destination the movie is a bananas car chase for the runtime as and furiosa work together to fight against the evils and then there is nux a bonkers really skin coloured guy who works with joe played well by nicholas hoult the 3d really pays off and is worth the extra ticket the movie puts all other action movies of shame the effects really pop out well this is a definite masterpiece one of the best movies of the year one of the best action movies ever made and the role of therons life miller is truly a mastermind as stated clearly in the trailer this exceeded my expectations and will exceed yours as well the dark style dark comedy and the over the top characters make a return in this reboot must watch and worth the extra i3d ticket,reality
i cant believe why people like this movie unless youre a fan of nobrainer actionpacked movies without a story 2 hours of non stop rubbish without dialogue i was a fan of the original and at first tom hardy seemed like a great actor for the role but this movie didnt do him justice he did well as bane but he wasnt the star in this movie almost like a support character i almost fell asleep and left the theater because i can find better ways to waste my time the only positive thing i can say is that the world looks great as well as the props good job on that george miller at least theres something good about it the trailer was promising and since many people praised this movie i gave it a shot how can you watch this for a second time to indulge in the deep content and story it provides there was absolutely nothing in there yes beautiful woman owned by a dictator who holds all the water and controls the people lets escape make a diversion trap him beat the living hell out of him and return to be happily accepted as the new rulers hurray,reality
fury road sees veteran maestro director george miller return to the franchise after a 30 year hiatusfury road is a hallmark in action films millers postapocalyptic future provides an impeccable backdrop for the crescendo of mayhem present in this movie from the first scene to the last there is plenty of spectacular action vehicular and human the cinematography is lush throughout from the opening shot of the lizard being stomped by tom hardy to all the action scenes raging in the desert the camerawork remains consistently on point many iconic shots are to be found in this movie75 of the movie consists of action so much that there isnt an action scene present any action aficionados will have their expectations transcended while common moviegoers will have their satisfaction met too what is surprising however is the emotional heft of the 25 that remains much of it is dedicated to the back story of furiousa charlize theron who effortlessly delivers an oscar worthy performance by mixing brawn with emotion for her internally wounded characternicholas hoults nux who provides one of the best lines of the film its a lovely day at the midst of a crazy thunderstorm consisting tornadoes consisting cars consisting humans nux is an interesting character in this interesting world and provides plenty of the action by his well actionsfinally tom hardys delivers a subtle performance as for a character whose name is slapped largely in the film poster he receives barely a page of dialogue minus a monologue at the start considering the fact that he wears a banelike see the parallel mask throughout much of the film it is surprising how powerful his performance actually isone musical masterpiece act in the movie comes in the form of the guy the mask furiously shredding a flamethrowing electric guitar while dangling above a mobile wall of speakers that roars through the desert imagine that when all hell breaks loose only accompanied by that as the background music epic is truly an understatement as a descriptionoverall is a gleefully insane symphony of destruction that makes the avengers seem like misfits and the fast and furious crew seem like the slow and sweet crew this action packed masterpiece exhibits no shortage of high voltage 2000 horsepower action that also contains of lush cinematography sufficient character development and a satisfactory plot that works cause its 75 action anyways fury road is definitely one of if not the finest blockbuster of 2015,reality
i was left speechless when this finished it can be hard to describe  indeed but ill go for it  sheer madness that isnt sullied by bad acting or laughable lines a  blockbuster that is gritty and doesnt have a sense of humour that  could be equated to a fluffy kitten no lets all hug sentimental bs  this is seriously a movie i thought id never see a cgifilled  blockbuster that i flat out loved the stunts are so much fun the fx  so great it is the first movie i have seen where i have thoroughly  enjoyed all this type of stuff  probably because the cinematography  for once doesnt suffer cos of it it is all incredibly shot  the action is so brutal and appropriately highoctane i thought to  myself more than once i think i am loving this more than terminator  2 but other than that there wasnt time to think it kicked off fast  and barely stopped and the lulls were amplified by the insanity  preceding them plus it is a dark film which made it even better i  many people do an aussie accent even close to well was hardy actually  trying for that either way he didnt talk much so it didnt really  matter this is more therons movie than hardys he doesnt say much  and does next to nothing for the first third or so therons furiosa is  more of the hero is the story if there were to be a hero in such a  grisly and dark world  i dont even like this type of movie but the execution is  everything im gonna go see this again soon 455,reality
even at the beginning theres no hint fury road is going to a stop right at the very start the engines are already rewing gathering furious fires of vengeance and redemption and before the audience could snap out of the sheer moments of brutal grittiness and exhilarating highoctane drama they are surely already held hostage within the confines of a postapocalyptic world where everything is horrendously scarce not that its a bad thing no its not i tell you this is like being hurled into the space in a rollercoaster ride its dangerous but its also thrilling witnessing this dystopic world and all its hellish drama unfold might make you grope for seatbelt under your seatthe film shares rockatanskys tom hardy adventures is an ex highway patrolman hes been haunted by the past by family he never saved he meets the imperator furiosa charlize theron who is being pursued by the dictatorial wasteland leader joe furiosa reaches for for help in keeping the five wiveswomen she brought with herinto safety as joes deranged breed of warriors called the war boys that are barely humans are raging across the desert to capture them this pursuit throws the unlikely partners into the whalloping dangers of bloody escape suddenly sending them into a game of survivalafter a riproaring opening chase sequence is held captive in the citadel the city where the ruthlessly totalitarian leader joe is ruling over the grotesquely brutal lord maintains tight grip of every valuable resouces across the land this brings the entire populace crippling under his control as for he becomes merely a blood bag for nux nick hoult one of joes war boys who is a fatal devout to the cause of their fascist leader who has promised them the glory of getting into valhalla the promised landeverything in this cinematic behemoth screams grandeur even the feverish chase even the dark erubescents spurred from the ruthless violence miller has molded a world where darkness is an escape from the stream of clichs and retreads surging into the cinemas today its a visual feast but surprisingly with sense its explosive in every unimaginable ways but its not devoid of a human story which in this case is propelled by stellar performances from incredible actors on the movies payroll tom hardy is utterly capable as the main hero but the emotional spine of the narrative mostly runs on therons character at some point there would be a sense that isnt the only one playing under the spotlight as it gets evident furiosa is equally as massive as his role is hardy here is singularly stunning playing his role with utmost credibility as he is required his mission transcends past his emotional torments and hes never pulled himself free from the ghosts if his past same can be said with furiosa who is not only running from joe because she wants to get herself free from his cut throat grip but also to bring every woman into safety back to freedom where they belongmuch of the movie is spent with furious speed chases that goes from end to end of joes subjugated land while also taking surprising twists and turns along the way its like it doesnt know how to stop and if it does thats surely only to allow us breathe and catch up with the next electrifying action setpiece theres an enigmatic style miller has employed to provide distinctions in his fantasy world and it keeps the momentum in tack if not ever progressing the tone of the movie all those vividly dark colors that magically shifts from something to another imparts a drowning experience only its enjoying and looks festive to the eyes this makes every eyesquashing spectacles take mammoth forms of visual extravaganza turning all those burning combustions metal blasts and endless pursuits from mere technical marvels into a hairraising escapadeamid these sanitygrabbing action sequences though is an emotional streak that keeps and furiousas humanity alive this prompts them to survival into carrying out their similar humane causes clinging tightly to their only mission even if they get hurled into the barbaric hostilities of their dystopian society this turns the movie into something visceral cathartic in some ways that probably only a small fraction of the audience could understand it will not be enough to merit this achievement with merely a splurge of superlatives this needs to be experienced felt and forever cherished fury road ignites eternal fire and it will keep burning through the stretches of cinematic history,reality
if you wanna go and see this movie please expect nothing but frustrating dazing predictable outcome action and then just when you think the movie is ending you get an extra 3045 minutes of the same action same explosions same cars and faces doing the same thing they did during the whole first half of the movie do not expect any engaging drama or any plot of any kind but heres the story post apocalypse no water yet there are hundreds of people alive and working no fuel yet they all have it in their vehicles women escaping  women returning back the same day what a plot visually it was stunning but thats all you get,reality
great film so fastpaced it makes every other film out there look slow and oldfashioned wonderful to see george miller back on the australian road where he belongs charlize theron is great tom hardy is not bad but the stunts are really where the film shines its hard to think of a better action road movie it has all the intensity and perversity of the and the road warrior but amped up to new heights of craziness miller is the real star of the film  in some ways technology seems to have finally caught up with his early hyperactive camera style and he takes full advantage of the ability to move wherever he wants however he wants,reality
i saw the original it was violent it had car battles it had minimal character development i had very realistic expectations going into the theater to see this new versionnever have i been more disappointed with a movie the acting on both leads parts was mediocre at best with the male lead switching from being well spoken to being capable of nothing but grunting the story line seems to have been written and edited by remedial english students the characters are unbelievable and seriously lack any character development it has horrible motorcycle stunts and guys bouncing back and forth on poles of all thingsand come on a flamethrowing guitar and fat women being milked for no explained reason to trade for gasoline to power the flame throwing guitar its full of shitty clichs badly cut scenes and lots of explosions save your money see anything else and you will be better off,reality
this must be one of the worst movies of all time 2 hours of shootings and blasts there is a lot of action but it is the same through the hole movie people left the theater before the movie ended there is no story its a chase for 2 hours where the main character should be has a role as a sidekick the movie title should have been furiousa has only a few lines and after each sentence he growls the movie starts of well but after 15 min it is downhill with silly conversation normally a good action movie should be entertaining and you would leave the theater with a smile but not here then in the middle we have a lot of fire shootings and blasts and a lot of stuntanimated scenes but it does not have any power its just the same over and over again the end has a brief rise but again ends poorly and foreseen the old movies starring mel gibson had power and lines with humor and bite maybe they are going for a new story in this moviebut there is none to be found crap,reality
first of all  i am not fond of writing reviews pertaining to movies but this movie reluctantly compelled me to write a review for the first time so lets starti had been desperately waiting for this movie since long and today i got a chance to watch it and after watching it i was left agape with incredulity that how a movie like this is being applauded by the masses  seriously it had nothing except for extraordinary nonsense action this movie is devoid of a sane story but in fact according to me it neither have a story nor a plot and regretfully i have to say that this is the worst movie i have seen in recent history fury road is highly overrated and is mocking other movies which have ratings between 8 and 87 albeit i am a huge fan of tom hardy and chalize therone but their acting could not save it from becoming a complete ruin i am giving it a one point and seriously if there had been an option to rate a movie below one point then i would have given it much lower points its also a suggestion to imdb developers that they should ameliorate the movie rating algorithm and incorporate an option that can rate movies below the current lowest mark so that people should rate according to their aspirations finally i am exhorting that do not watch this movie its a detestable and a ridiculous movie,reality
i will be honest with readers i only really watched the first 30 minutes of this hollywood blockbuster what i did do before i settled down to watch it was look at the rating on imdb 86 out of 10 this must be great like many other reviewers i believe my low rating is a reaction to the absolute travesty that many movies are being rated so highly the original movies had a young and charismatic unknown australian actor called mel gibson in them they had some plot and believability this had so much money thrown at it supposedly around 150 million that the whole world view of was gone hundreds of vehicles driving around in the desert a community of thousands with clearly no problem with water or food even though the baddie turns on the water and lets in pour into the sand and then turns it off and tells his people not to become addicted to water  words are failing me to describe how badly i feel any young people out there reading this should watch 12 skip the hollywood version thunderdome honestly once again left speechless with the true awfulness of this film,reality
complicated hero who is easy to latch onto fantastic plot that is plausible in this environment terrifying nemesis horrifying and relentless nonstop action and brilliant stunt sequences that will make you cringe this movie will have you feeling parched and gritty usually not a fan of 3d  however it works perfectly here this movie has managed to honor the previous films without being clunky about it if you love mutant vehicles art cars burning man etc you will be satisfied a few scenes that were taking place in cobbled together 1000 hp vehicles at 50mph where it was quieter inside than a modern cadillac  the absence of the din of machinery for the sake of dialogue was the only thing that bothered me,reality
it is almost hard too put into words how bad this movie was the plot was virtually nonexistent  most of the acting bar hardy and theoren was absolutely diabolical the script was like a ten year old wrote it and oh my god what was with that guy and the flaming guitarbefore you assume that i hate action films and that i am only giving this movie a bad review because i hate action films your wrong action is my favorite movie genre  and i was so excited to see this movie  but during the film i actually found myself checking my watch every five or ten minutes because it dragged on for so long  and for what  absolutely nothingthis is probably one of the worst action films i have ever seen in my entire life and i do not recommend it too anybody the only really good thing about this movie was the visual effects  which where greatfinal verdict  310,reality
the engines start roaring and without warning youve fallen into this completely demented and absurd world  over the top and ridiculous  in fury road madness reigns the shock is so great that even if youre familiar with the universe it may take you a while to swallow everything to get all the visual clues to try to understand what is happening and how you can believe and embrace such a ludicrous world but once you do and you will fury road takes you in an exhilarating ridewith a minimal plot and as little dialog as possible is a triumph on visual storytelling supported by the most epically constructed action scenes in years or ever and by unmatched imagination or insanity this twohour car chase proves to be a lot more than a loud quest for gasoline youll be stunned by the action but ultimately left wondering what it all means  and suddenly fury road doesnt look that anymoreultimately the most surprising thing about fury road is that is still there as silent as ever but its furiosa beautifully played by charlize theron who owns this brutal and glorious extravaganza,reality

years for this thing my hype was high i wasnt sure it would live up to my expectations well i am here to tell you that it did it lived up to the hype and then some this movie is absolutely 1000 insane what you saw in the trailers wasnt even close to the level of crazy that goes down in this movie you know this movie is pretty much just all out balls to the wall action so if you think the trailers maybe showed off a little too much you couldnt be more wrongthe stunt work is choreographed and directed to perfection it is the most well crafted and stunning movie ive ever seen and will probably ever see which is kind of the norm and what to expect with a george miller movie theres explosions going off everywhere cars blowing up left right and center people being killed and blown to shreds but none of it is convoluted it all streams together perfectly you know what is happening when it happens the fact that pretty much 90 of this movie is all practical effects and all stunt work is mind blowing the cars that explode thats happening people bouncing from one side to the other on long poles at 60mph picking people up and flying then back across thats going down too too many blockbusters these days are filled with cgi and even with limitless amounts of stuff you can do with all of that none of it even is even comparable to the action in this movie the crap that goes down here other movies couldnt even dream to aspire towards such a spectaclepeople complain that theres not much of a story they wanted more well i gotta tell you the story is just what it needs for something to be great it doesnt need to be a vibrant cohesive piece of art the story is very simple and the simplicity of it is what makes it great theres enough story to keep you paying attention to it and not just going in for explosions not to mention that its not driven through its narrative or its dialog its driven by its characters and its action to which people also said they were underdeveloped and werent written very well from my stand point they absolutely werethe character of nux nicholas hoult was developed amazingly well i didnt really expect to see much from him but he really became his own in this movie he was developed enough to make you care he was written to be understandable in his actions and he was by far for me one of the best things about the movie furiosa was also developed just enough to make you feel something for her character shes one of the only good left in a world full of bad what miller does in this movie is make characters that not only do you are for but are also incredibly likable and super bad ass wasnt developed as much as some of the others but lets face it if youve watched the older ones which i recommend you do there really isnt much to him hes a man thats had everything taken from him and he has nothing left to lose all he wants is to be left in peace thats all hes every been and thats all he wants to carry on beingwhat i also love about this movie is that the lead character is a woman hollywood these days are always depicting women who need a man take care of them that they cant live without men that is definitely not the case with this movie furiosa is fierce shes skilled shes unpredictable and shes all out bad ass this is a testosterone filled movie but its not the testosterone that takes chargeaction movies these days arent normally as good as one of the reasons being is that the hero is never really in any really danger if hes never in danger or near death how can you possible expect to have your audience on the edge of their seats pondering what if the inevitable happened was in peril so many times in this film there was at least 10 times where i thought this is the end hes going to die then he miraculously gets out of it but its not the clich type when someone luckily comes along at the last moment and saves him believe me there arent many if any clichs in this movie he fights his way out of these death defying situations furiosa out other lead is also in life threatening situations throughout this movie many times where we wouldnt know if she would make itif you dont see fury road in the theaters then you are missing out i went in iand i can tell you it was worth every goddamn penny papa want a sequel,reality
i was so amped for after seeing the average review was high wtf is it mob mentality or is it crafty advertising because this movie was not good no character arcs except for nux and his was so contrived and abrupt that it shouldnt count the basic story was very lame the plot was goofy all the 2d character villains with their bizarre mutations the hovering babyman this movie had shades of total recall 12 year old boys should like this movie  when furiosa walked sadly into the desert and took off her robot arm that was very poorly done i wanted to scoff out loud but i didnt because i was in a theater but im sure many there would have appreciated it i see in the user review section that there are a significant number of equally bad reviews thank you to those intelligent members of the imdb community for the support so i dont think im insane as too for not liking a popular movie ill investigate the user reviews here more closely next time so i dont get burned again i still hope to see some awesome furiosa cosplayers in the future so that adds a few stars,reality
i believe this to be one of the first reviews i ever wrote about a movie on imdb but i just cannot understand what all the hype about this movie is about seriously 30 in the top250  are you all kidding me1 this has got to be one of the worst movies ive seen in a very very long time i love action movies so this is not coming from a the notebook kind of guy but seriously there is nothing nothing good about this movie its borderline if not fullon ridiculous a chained guy playing a flame throwing guitar does it look cool yes but in a very jokelike kind of way they seriously cant expect to be taken seriously or expect anyone to think that in whatever postapocalyptic scenario the world turns to that is ever going to happen so it is obviously to be taken as a joke pretty much like 50 of the whole movie ohhh and talking about 50 of the whole movie yeah where did that go cos i could swear that they played the movie halfway through and then just rewinded it back to the beginning what a stupid movie they spend half to movie trying to get somewhere and when they get there only to be greeted by the bad ass grannys again not ridiculous at all they come to the conclusion that they have to go back to where they came from and you get to see the exact same stuff you had just seen 30 minutes before what a pathetic excuse for a movie i mean half a movie there is not even an attempt of a storyline ohh and all these pseudo intellectual movie reviewers will try and convince you that it is a master piece because there are no pauses in the action to spoon feed you the information or storyline what storyline save yourself 10 and here is for you the whole movie silent hardydefinitely not appears on screen and tells us about his bad ass life in this postapocalyptic world i wonder how he survived this far since he is captured 5 minutes into the movie and taken to this badguys headquarter mountians where he is to be drained of his blood to feed some even weirder baddies hoult then furiosa theron is supposed to go on this whatever fuel run for this outlaw ruler immortal joe and flees with his pet girlfriends so all of the bad guys in the whole world decide to chase them they spend half the movie running from them in this busted down truck always dragging with them this huge ass semitrailer that apparently is filled with breast milk mothers milk seriously they get stuck in mud and all sorts of disasters but god forbid they would ever just unhook the semitrailer for whatever reason that is they finally get to where they are going to be greeted by 80 year old amazon fighters lol that somehow have survived for soo long is this god forsaken world they tell furiosa that the greenlands are gone so they decided to go back to where they came from since all the baddies were on the road chasing them and there was no one left holding the fort so they start making theyre way back through all the baddies again on her way back to where they were in the beginning of the movie in the return sector you see the exact same movie that you have just seen for the first half the get there with the dead body of immortal joe yep he died and become the ruler i guess of these mountains that miraculously has tons of water that no one has any clue where it comes from leaves the pathetic end,reality
let me start by saying this this movie is the title was not lying this film was exactly what one wants from a summer blockbuster george miller has come out publicly and said that this is neither really a reboot or a sequel this is simply another story following rockatansky in this story we see being captured by immortan joe and his band of war boys once he escapes he comes upon imperator furiosa who is attempting to rescue the wives from the oppression of immortan joe cue action i love how sometimes simple plots like this can set up an entire world of action in the action genre we dont need very convoluted and intricate plots that keep taking unexpected twists and turns in fury roads case the simpler the betternow on to what everyone is wondering about the action and yes the stunts and music when its all going down is some of the best action ever put to screen by the time the climactic chase rolls around the action is even more jawdropping and breath taking than before because the stakes continue to be raised this movie is a two hour chase that never has a dull momentas for the characters they were all spectacular especially furiosa played beautifully by charlize theron though she is a badass she never upstages hardy as being the emotional core of the film playing furiosa was one of the harder tasks to correctly perform and theron knocked it out of the park for tom hardy as he was just as great as theron having minimal dialog and mainly using grunts to show emotion hardy gave a surprising amount of depth though still not nearly as much as furiosa this is not a bad thing however since was never a truly deep character he was an action star who kicked a lot of ass and of course he does that in this film the rest of the characters were played great as well especially nux played by nicholas hoult who brought even more emotional depth thisoverall this is a gleefully insane film the relentless pace never holds back on the audience and it always has them glued to the edges of their seats if you can i highly recommend everyone does themselves a favor and witness this masterclass action phenomenon that will arguably go down as one of the finest action films ever made,reality
anyone that gives this a bad review just doesnt enjoy movies intense action interesting characters and bloody good fun an all around great summer movie the people that complain about there being no plot and need to be more informed about the world of fire and blood that is are insane and need to watch the first three for a little background i was impressed with the depth of this movie with vibrant characters and in camera visuals 80 done in camera and very little cgi miller adds more depth to his apocalyptic world in a way never before seen he makes you feel the pain these people are going through it is one of those movies that are few and far between and should be seen as the amazing goose bump riddled spectacle that it truly is nonstop over the top edge of your seat fun the production is over the top and every scene is filled to the brim with eye candy dont listen to these people spouting crappy reviews they are the same people who wouldnt know a great movie if it sat on their face and wiggled around and they loved glitter make it your summer goal to go see this film in the theater you will not be left wanting anything but a sequel oh what a lovely day and an even better movie,reality

there is no way to review this movie without spoiling itso spoiler warning has been issuedthe scenes are not built up in any way and the characters have no depth in them this is not the weve familiar withthe entire film consists of two scenes first they drive one way and then they drive back the endlots of explosions and weird looking vehicles taking part in a road war on a post apocalyptic world absolutely boring and unrelated to the earlier moviesthere is no reasoning behind the actions the characters are making everything they do is either purely mindless or just plain stupiddespite the obvious flaws in the script tom hardy is excellent as he is tormented strong and intriguing i really would have hoped for a more meaningful story for him to go with,reality
to be honest i went into watching this film with a negative mind anyway as i had heard that it was just crazy people driving round a desert they were not wrong it was terrible tom hardy just grunts most of the time and it is called but it is barely about him he doesnt do much in it it is just people driving through the desert with unexplained things happening in it and then when i finally had a feeling of relief because i thought the film had ended it hadnt they pick up some old ladies and turn back round and go down the same way they just came from to have very similar fights in the same places with the same people except the old ladies they pick up die so its just pointless but rubbish fighting all the way through with big cars lots of fire and no good story this is a typical boys film i normally love action films with cars and fights but this was just repetitive and boringit didnt excite me make me laugh shock me or make me want to know what was going to happen next waste of two hours of my life,reality
overall rating 45 stars cinematic value 45 stars big questions value 4 stars family value 2 stars this film has a mature rating due to the violence take this into consideration before viewingwe have not seen rockastansky tom hardy on movie screens in 30 years this is a welcome return to and the crazy postapocalyptic world of george miller babe lives an existence of sheer survival as a former police officer and family man he is now a tortured shell of the man of justice he used to be and merely wants to survive after being captured by the leading cult forces of this futuristic wasteland he finds himself in the middle of a pursuit of furiosa charlize theron and the wives of the masked immortan joe hugh keyesbyrne becomes the pivotal force to assist in furiosas escape and redemption fury road becomes a race for life redemption and hope shot in the barren desert of namibia the fight for life becomes an adrenaline charged chess match that in making the wrong move will cost you your life no summary can do the action justice except to say to is a new visual standard that needs to be experienced fury road is a lesson in conveying depth with minimal dialogue george miller delivers a masters class in story telling and stunt driven effects that successfully convey back story cultural nuance and the justification of these desperate acts of disobedience and violence even as the fourth outing for this character we are given a fresh storyline and wealth of new characters for a new generation it is not necessary to see the original films to enjoy this chapter in adventures but it might be worth going back to watch the first two films in this anthology the cast is captivating and effective in their roles but they have to take a back seat to the energetic stunt work and effects this world seems to be a maniacal and messy existence but becomes an enjoyable orchestrated primal experience who would have thought that through the franchise miller would be able to convey his cinematic brilliance and deliver this visceral masterpiece not to dismiss the acting hardy is brilliant as the tortured lead character and delivering a believable portrait of his desire to survive the present while mentally enduring his past he is given minimal dialogue but is able to become the heart of this postapocalyptic tale interestingly hardy is not the primary lead in the film that bears his name charlie therons shining portrayal of furiosa is the literal and figurative driver of the film she manages to redefine feminine heroism for film makers she has strength purpose and a sacrificial depth that presses the story beyond a mindless chase scene in a genre that tends to victimise or sexualise the female leads miller portrays a strong female led without any unnecessary feminist underpinnings in masking her natural beauty theron is allowed to develop her strengths and vulnerabilities without making a political statement both hardy and theron are supported by an excellent supporting cast that moves this experience from a mere adrenaline rush to a story of fighting for your right to live seeing that sacrifice is part of freedom and ultimately for the hope for redemption on many levels miller seems to realise that action without reason loses its purpose in adding a spiritual component to fury road he allows for a narrative depth in the script immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne is the cult leader in this dark twisted world his character delivers a dark and demented message of the need for effective leadership and that leaders need to provide people with purpose for their sacrifice even if it is misplaced this story shows that there is basic need for something beyond our material needs that gives society drive and direction also the flower on this desert wasteland is hope even the jaded heart of is turned and assists in getting those under his charge to their promised land and in giving them hope in the bleakest of moments this is an essential cinematic vehicle when placed against the backdrop of the depravity of mankind miller manages to capture this element and allows for the story to consider the realities of mankinds history and future if the film does have a weakness it would be in the conclusion in all that they desire to achieve and find through this film makers journey the finality has an empty satisfaction after watching a film like  fury road it might be worth reading through revelation fortunately with the god of the bible there is more we can hope for in the futurereel dialogue what are some of the bigger questions to consider from this film 1 where is real hope found deuteronomy 316 romans 525 2 can we find true redemption psalm 1119 1 corinthians 130 3 can we exist without others proverbs 181 1 corinthians 1214written by russell matthews based on a five star rating system  russelling reviews russellingreviews madfuryroad,reality
fury road is a stunningly beautiful and highly charged kinetic thrill ride it is brilliantly filmed with amazing and well suited bombastic soundtrack the star of the film is its direction by george miller showing generation mtv how to direct moving action without getting lost in its mayhem almost every shot is moving similar to a james cameron action sequence as mentioned before the film has not got much of a plot other then a giant chase the first half of the film is great and the second half starts to loose steam due to what has come before it chalize theron is great and adds presence to the film it is one of her best performances tom hardy gives a solid performance but i found his performance somewhat lacking he does not have much to work with and is limited to a handful of dialogue i preferred mel gibsons the film suffers when it eventually slows down in pace but when it is going full throttle there are not many films that can complete with it is it an action classic as a chase film  yes i would say it is along with set design and stunt work involved but the lack of any real story and small plot holes stop me giving this film a 10 not much is explained in the film the ending seems sudden and could of done with some more depth to it especially the character it is still a wonderful and refreshingly directed film to add to the cannon of films,reality
2 hrs of wasted time nothing but chasing at least the original at the time was worth watching and at least had a story line im so tired of someone trying to remake a movie just for the money i guess they forget about the people who have seen the original and try to impress the new comers who dont know what the hell theyre watching but a stupid action flick wake up directors i could make a better movie than you 98 really way to push people to watch a awful movie hopefully there will be a better remake of this movie one day hollywood needs to stop with the remakes and come out with some original story lines,reality
i hated this movie i never got into the world or the characters perhaps it was the of old and my nostalgia for that world but this was so different and less real than the world of the original was leaden he seemed almost irrelevant and i couldnt care for him furiousa was better and brought some interest to the adventure nux was just nicholas hoult in bad makeup i dont generally like movies with endless fight and action scenes and this pushed that genre to the extreme in the end it was plot free character free nonsensebut i can understand the appeal both to the action fan and to wider cinema audiences the visuals were stunning the world was unique and the pace and intensity was startling immerse yourself in the world and the action and i could understand this could reach 10 out of 10 proportions i never got there and sadly hated every minute just a personal view,reality
it was saddening to watch the movie no matter how much i try to put it in words i fail to describe how bad it isthere is a dominant warrior heroine charlize theron and totally out of place beauties who do not belong to that world ms theron is utterly beautiful herself but she was not depicted as such in the movie we have no idea about what happened to the world neither about why we have a mix of 40s80s cars 18th century to 19th century weapons and tech that we do not know as of yetcg was outdated action was bad and reasons why certain actions have been taken and their consequences were also very disappointingi would say do not even bother watching this originals were ok this is just a waste of time,reality
after this any action movie is nothing dont waste your time after now trying to watch any action movie because after this i think no more action the best action movie of all time but its so weird that you will never imagine your self the hero of the movie  this movie makes you feel how beautiful life we are living now i think the movie have a hidden massage in it and makes you know that hope is not for living with hope is also for dieing with it takes you from the first to the end and i think tom hardy is the best choice to be the new after i go home i cant stop thinking of it and from now am waiting for the next amazing am sure there will be another part of this george miller this is a masterpiece,reality
first i loved the original films ok thunderdome was a bit iffy but it was ok this has to be the worst film i have seen this year and i was so looking forward to it i have seen others call it a masterpiece or work or genius i dont know what planet they are living on no real story and tom hardy who is a great actor only spoke about 25 lines in the whole movie the actions scenes are great and the whole film is action scenes but we know nothing about the characters most of the film seems to be a rehash of the chase at the end of 2 but with 2 there was a character build upthis is one film i will not be adding to my dvd collection if i had paid to see this i would be knocking down the door for a refund,reality
wow as a fan of the original trilogy this film nearly delivered on all fronts the tone is dark but the film never takes itself too seriously and has an insane sense of selfawareness some of the concepts are so insane outlandish and stylish you cant help but laugh and enjoy the ridethe visuals are utterly unforgettable creating some of the most memorable images that i have ever seen in a film in addition to the beautiful desert landscape like i previously mentioned the film takes its ideas and multiplies them to the nth degree some of the smaller scenes that have barely any significance to the story i remember because of the smallest visual detail that is presented in them even if that scene in the long run really holds no significance and is never mentioned againtom hardy is great in the role of keeping the mysteriousness and the likability of the protagonist in full force whats fantastic about too is that his past is never revealed in a exposition like scenario rather it is told cleverly through visuals a display that director george miller respects the intelligence of the audience and doesnt want to spell everything out for them charlize theron however absolutely stole the show her acting is excellent perfectly conveying her character and the emotions that are being dealt with some scenes she was in actually had me in near tears her performance was so good the exposition of her unlike is conveyed through dialog but it doesnt feel forced we dont get some long monologue from her about her past rather it feels like a casual mention it expertly tells us about her while keeping just the right amount of exposition left out allowing us to connect the dots with other pieces of dialog or other visual details that reveal more about her simply put she might be one of the best leading female protagonists put to the screen in a whilethe characters are always given time to develop even the smallest of characters the film has the perfect blend of action and character driven moments allowing the audience to take a breather every now and then and just soak in the characters of this world i forgot to mention the action is amazing because the film has the perfect plot that pretty much lends itself to action it never stops moving and gains so much kinetic energy you wonder if itll ever stop and sometimes that can be a negative too much action at once can leave the viewer restless but thankfully this doesnt become much of an issue until the end it helps that in the action scenes you can actually see whats going on and the film doesnt over utilize shaky cami was really surprised by how much substance the narrative and the characters had dealing much with themes of redemption and attempting to rid of a dark past this is an action movie that isnt only a popcorn movie this is likely something that you can analyze and find hidden meanings in because of this people who are more into the artistic side of film like myself will enjoy it as wellthis is the best film released all year and the best summer movie since the likes of inception actually in many aspects it might be better than inception it very well be the best action film so far this decade and that is no exaggeration,reality
the action genre has always been mixed ranging from trashy profit searching rubbish to thrilling adrenaline fuelling epics see terminator 2 and aliensfury road thankfully fits into the latter category but it is fundamentally and wonderfully different out goes the usual cgi explained back story and lack of enough good characters and in comes a truly insane thrill ride that somehow manages to make 2 hours of following a truck one of the most enjoyable things to watch in recent timeslets go over the one thing that i disliked about this film and honestly dislike is a fairly strong word in this case the exposition or rather lack of it the extreme pace of the film results in details seemingly whistling by meaning it can leave you wondering whats going on but then again the actual story foundations for the film are so small that really it doesnt matter that everything isnt explained so long as we know the names of the characters and where theyre heading to next nothing else really matterswhat it chooses to focus on is an excellent cast lovely cinematography and wondrous wondrous carnage practical effects take the lead role here with amazing vehicles well timed explosions and constant tension and thrill the benefits of this are best seen with the big crashes and the huge fuel tanker explosion towards the end of the film it ends up looking stunning the polecats really make the most of this adding an extra layer of danger while cementing the realism that the film thrives off ofi also particularly loved the sheer attention to detail every car is different and exceptionally well designed sound work is equally amazing with the soundtrack being entwined with vast array of engine noises explosions and in the case of the doof wagon which im now calling one of the coolest things ive ever seen in a movie ever live rock music performances from the cast are excellent tom hardys is very much the usual gritty rock solid hero that gibson portrayed all those years ago charlize therons furiosa isnt that just the best name youve ever heard really stands out for me balancing out hardys character with a strong and bold performance and for once its a female action hero who hasnt been raised or taught by other men  shes a real self empowered super lady nicholas hoults character is also a personal favorite while the brides and the many mothers created an ensemble of female characters that dont get wasted like they so often do in other action flicks everyone gives an enthusiastic performance and it only adds to the quality of them filmtheres plenty more to praise here but ill highlight some of my personal favorite aspects from the film the makeup and costume departments did an incredible job here giving us a massive range of extras that really diversify the entire film there are plenty of great names and phrases used in the film including bloodbag immortan joe the organic mechanic and the bullet farmer the film seemed to obey the laws of physics for the most part and was especially good at ridding any infiniteammo guns or strangely enough unnecessary explosionsin conclusion i cant say anything that is inherently negative about fury road its fresh bold and so well made that you cant help but be enthralled by its insanity on the face of it its nothing more than a overly long car chase and yet it isnt it adds just enough complexity right where its needed  the characters vehicles and action combined with the great array of characters sheer attention to detail and wonderful cinematography its actually unusually diverse and its humane undertones only help to differ it from normal action films and in that respect its one of the best films in recent history,reality
fury road is a nonstop concerto of clanking iron broken bones and splattering blood while fire squirts from all cylinders its absolutely glorious as far as scifi world goes director george miller creates a remorseless realm with every bit of nastiness present the two leading actors tom hardy and charlize theron are utterly convincing so much so audience would believe they are actual occupants of the unapologetic postapocalyptic worldtom hardy is a survivor in a barren wasteland hes about to cross path with totalitarian clan war boys led by a dictator as luck would have it he meets with imperator furiosa charlize theron as situation escalates rapidly and they must fight for their survival tom hardy looks physically menacing and exhausted by the burden he carries on the desolate landscape he is more of an antihero who prioritizes his safety in the expense of his moralitycharlize theron is utterly splendid with short hair and one arm she still manages to look beautiful and presentably strong she seems cold yet also rigidly determines to her cause this is a real rendition of a powerful female character not a model shoehorned into the wilderness nicholas hoult as nux one of the war boys is a chameleon his character might have the most development as a lowly peon who gradually discovers the true nature of his clanproduction value is exceptionally well done from vehicles makeup and even prosthetic limbs all of them look as though they have wear and tear from the dusty world strange contraptions and weapons are aplenty explosive spears are thrown with reckless abandon as large tank mounted with electric guitar rumbles in the background its brazenly unworldly and overthetop spectacle there is no such thing as too much herevisual is all shades of tangerine the vistas look dry and dirty yet still can be lively or solemn as the filter regularly changes the soundtracks blast rock metal and techno vibe with each scene it truly doesnt let up riding the momentum from start to finish though its not just mindless explosion its characters are identifiable audience would be fascinated and cheer for them between each explosionsnever a murky world ridden with death and destruction seems so irresistibly invitingly as the characters ride through the carnage the film is an achievement in action and destruction,reality
fury road follows a determined man named rockatansky to wander the postapocalyptic wasteland alone surely joins furiosa a fugitive imperator and her band who are all trying to escape a savage warlord and are trying to get to a safe haven i really cant describe how in awe i was with this film i was extremely impressed the stunts the makeup the action  the camera shots were all so deadon and did not fail to impress one thing that kinda upsets me is that when the film ended and everyone was walking out i overheard things like that was garbage or what a piece of sht film that really angered me a little because i know that a lot was put into this film and they think they can do better unbelievable anyway this didnt dissatisfy me at all and lets talk about why it did even though this is supposed to be a action film they added some slow moments just to emphasize more character and fondness toward each person which was fantastic george miller did such a satisfactory job with that the action dont let me forget about the action this is what made the film so much more engaging to watch and i mean that with each insane character given it made the action more fun and insane to watch the score was unbelievable ill just leave it at that because you know it was tom hardy had some pretty big shoes to fill but yet he knocked it right out of the park with given so little dialogue to say he still manages to be a complete badass same goes for charlize theron she played such a cool character with some great sympathy for herself and the people shes protecting and yet she does have some sweet skills and the prosthetic arm was a nice touch also for nicholas hoult he plays such a basket case that will do anything to impress immortan joe and yet he starts to become a very likable character i swear the makeup in this was was so spoton that i really believed that these were actually mental people and also i thought that half of the people in this looked like albinos which added more effect to the mental aspect of them the camera angles in this were flawless it was unbelievable even with so much going on at the same time george really managed to get a lot of what we had to see wait i mean we needed to see hugh keays byrne did such a menacing job as immortan joe he played the role as such a character that doesnt let anything get in his way and always gets what he wants but yet so insane yes there was a lot of disturbing images in this that can probably make you gag a little its truly a sight for sore eyes of what i had to see in this but hey were talking about a film here the costume design was very odd as well which looked so deserted and worn that them fit so well each character my favorite part of the film would have to be the beginning scene george proved he really knows how to work a camera and really made the atmosphere of the situation was faced with more exciting and intoxicating overall i might of exaggerated in this review but who cares it was worth it and i meant every word of it and this film might possibly be a modern day masterpiece with a 2 hour runtime this film really seems to go by fast but yet whos worried about that when youre distracted by such insanity please guys go see this action packed pulse pounding  off the wall thrill ride to fury road with the man himself,reality
i loved this crazy actionpacked and violent everything a film should beoh also theres some boobs lovable characters and the new actor for matches up to mel gibson in my mindif you were thinking about seeing this please do i would recommend following the age guideline of 15 though because of blood gore violence anda certain unmaskingif you see it you will know what i meanseriously though best film ive seen this year amazing 1010 also one of the best apocalyptic films of all time in my opinion,reality
when talking about remarkable action movies a few titles come to mind movies like die hard terminator judgment day the matrix and the dark knight are great examples of it and if youre into this kind of film congratulations youve just won another golden ticket to the chocolate factoryfury road opens this summer as one of the best movies i have seen in the past decade i have recently re watched the first three movies of the franchise to dive into this world once again after i was done with it i came to the same realization that i did a few years back i did not like them at all and as a consequence i had no hope for this one in my mind it was going to be as mediocre as the others fortunately i couldnt be more wrong after three decades trying george miller has finally got it that postapocalyptic world he created 36 years ago is bigger better and crazier than everif you are looking for a word to describe fury road insane it is it is visually stunning and packed with exhilarating action scenes the execution is so impressive that you get yourself smiling in the middle of a gory scene you can feel the effort and passion put into making this movie through the silver screen the actors job in constructing the characters is so effective that you dive into this world almost instantaneously props to hardy and hoult who conducted their characters with talent each one in their own crazy way but specially to theron for creating such an extraordinary and strong female character furiosa is simply amazinghard to be pleased by this kind of movie i was blown away it has been a while since i walked out from a movie theater with this amount of satisfaction fury road can be disgusting and beautiful at the same time it is unique it has reached and stepped on the same ground as some of our beloved blockbusters from the past but not only this it has marked itself as a milestone in the action film history,reality
water is a scarce resource so when it is dispensed and made available to the populace it is by opening a valve of some sort that allows it to cascade from a cliff face and down onto an arid dry dessert floor bed some people have cups mugs and buckets to catch it in so hey its not a total waste we see some water in the film but no sign of food apart from the two headed mutant lizard stamps on and eats there really isnt any implication of how anyone gets a meal in a dessert with no water and the occasional lizard or bug despite this there is a demigod like figure who is worshipped by a populace of thousands not really the every man for himself dog eat dog world of the future one may have been expecting thenand as for where the gasoline is coming from well what does that matter even though oil was the principle cause for conflict in all previous films as it was the most valuable commodity its not even an issue here even though its the stuff that sustains the films entire action sequencethe flashbacks imply past we see them at the beginning when hes being pursued by some sort of dance troupe in make up or the bad guys what the dessert lacks in water is compensated by a tremendous amount of white powder and dark eyeliner but really the film just becomes very monotonous and even giving the film this amount of attention is quite undeserving of the film itself,reality
what a waste of time this crap movie was if you want to see acrobats on stick driving through a desert with lots of explosions and no reason to do so this is your movie if you go to this movie expecting something as good as the original do not bother just a boring peace of crap with no back story no character development nothing the whole cast could have died on the end and i wouldnt give a rats ass the acting of charlize was great tom hardy did the same as he did in the drop the dark knight and all his other movies the movie setting was great and there was something with water and people driving around getting away from stuff and returning to it oh and something with woman and mothers milk horrible piece of crap,reality
warning this review is full of spoilers here it is the future consists of a whole bunch of really ugly people some feeding on breast milk others on live reptiles and bugs driving ugly souped up trucks that spit flames while play drums and guitar and chasing and shooting at each other some are looking for a place that does not exist the others are trying to kill them because they were supposed to deliver gasoline to another bunch really ugly people with nothing else to do than blowing up rocks if they dont get their gasoline it is between a rednecks dream and plain redneck hell could it be both yes it certainly could so what does this movie have a 87 rating on imdb well im asking you whoever it is that knows the answer somethings got to be wrong somewhere ratings are usually pretty accurate but in my opinion it is way off base for this particular movie oh i forgot of course there is no apparent plot nothing is said about why anything is happening why the characters are where they are why they doing whatever they seem to be doing not even funny just plain ugly violent senseless aimless rolling junk i want my two hours back,reality
way to go america stuff up another good yarn absolute rubbish there is no story no acting and it is an altogether pathetic attempt at entertainmentthe main actors have submitted an incredibly wooden performance with tom hardy doing a merely token bit part that seems to require nothing but stupid looks and constant confusion and charlize theron attempting to unsuccessfully convey some semblance of acting abilitygood grief who are they aiming this rubbish attwo year olds ps and the halfwits that are waxing lyrical about it should take the time to wipe their collective chin,reality
theres little point in rehashing what others have said about this film to do so would require more effort than the producers expended its mindless careless utterly disposable drivel give me five minutes with any scene if they can properly be called scenes and ill give you vastly superior results not because im an expert film maker but simply because i care i care about great titles from my younger years i care about the craft of movie making  good acting and inspired casting with quotable dialog that involves the audience and makes them feel for the protagonists and despise the villains i care about smart story with detail that paints a vibrant picture of another world one that helps us understand our own i care about dramatic tension and pacing plot twists and strategies and fresh ideas that show me something i havent seen beforenone of those elements can be found in fury road its simply a long action reel with superficial theming video games have better plot george miller clearly doesnt care anymore or has simply lost what talent he hadthe only interesting thing here for me is the wild and unprecedented disparity between ratings one star or ten are you kidding me sample the writing from praisers and notice the slick marketing language and textbook film school speak are these people who cant discern packaging from product a la unboxing videos was a substantial portion of the budget spent on an army of film industry shills i dont know but perhaps imdbs review and rating system has been compromised trust me those of you who think you honestly liked this movie  it will be forgotten in a year and you wont be coming back to it in five fifteen or thirty years theres nothing to come back to even thunderdome is a masterpiece compared to this abomination im just glad i didnt actually have to pay to be insulted,reality
pros this was not the worst movie ive seen if it hadnt been called a film id have given it a 3 or 4 so a 3 points for deceptioncons this is not a film his character is entirely irrelevant he plays no role in the development of the plot such as it is none of the male characters are really relevant except the archvillain and his role is very limited the central character is charlizes furiosa the acting is generally very unconvincing there is no real story being told here it is without a doubt the worst of the lineup if you even count it as being a film i dont at no point did i reach the level needed for voluntary suspension of disbelief this is a very silly movie and not in a good way like willy wonka there were numerous other issues too ill leave off them so as to avoid any spoilers for those who plan to see itbottom line i walked away from the film feeling as if i had duped i went to see a film and got furiosa girl power i recommend renting and viewing 1 or 2 again and giving this one a pass,reality
5 min into this movie and i was fighting the urge to stick a needle in my eyei forced myself through this steaming pile of dog  just to make sure i wasnt jumping the conclusions and i wasnt fury road tries so desperately to be madly violent and grotesque bloody and hardcore but fails miserably  script is just stupid and feels like its written by five year old story line and all these so called special effects with obscene scenes made me feel like the director and writer maybe all crew was trippin on lsd needless to say there was no acting whatsoever oh and since when the kamikazes are going to valhalla after they die,reality
george miller has proved you dont need to actually make a movie in order to make money making movies you see movies typically have certain key features such as a plot dialogue and character development all of which are absent here and is george miller now just frank miller with a different hatanyone who was satisfied by this mindless smashemup dystopian mess should be ashamed and go do their homework on some ozploitaion you know the kind of movies that inspired quentin tarantino to make death proof a far more satisfying car movie and let me be clear without exaggeration that fury road has the handsdown dumbest scenes ive ever seen in a movie the ones where we see the large music truck with the drummers and the idiotic electric guitar player who inexplicably joins the soundtrack with solos and flameshandsdown dumbest ever worse than jarjarwe really only get a halfmovie because the first half is stuff driving one way then they turn around and do everything again in the opposite direction leading to an ending so triumphant that all it lacked was a golden unicorn shooting rainbows out of its flaming ass it is surely not a great feminist statement worthy of mens rights hateradethe climactic line im and then tom hardy nods approval as if to reassure himself that he is an actor and really can memorize such inane dialoguei dont care if the action scenes looked cool the movie is just plain stupid so stupid it makes me want to huff some silver spray paint and go to valhalla,reality
fury road review just had the chance to watch this movie isnt so much a remake but rather a continuation of the story it starts of with already in the post apocalyptic world where as 1 was a prelude with still having some law enforcement in the world and the rest of the series is set after all of the chaos breaks out fury road is set in the same universethe story is fairly simple but still enjoyable and loyal to the universe furiosa helps young women escape immorten joe and is headed for her childhood home through actions of one of the war boys to tag along with him they end up on the war machine of furiosa and end up trying to help become freethe acting for most part wasnt bad i do feel that tom hardy wasnt the best choice as i never really felt that he was like mel he actually reminded me and my friends of his portrayal of bane his accent and voice were very close to the one he did in bane he also had very limited number of lines and that just made it more like bane not to mention that he carried himself as big guy with muscles even though the whole time his body was covered you felt his size in the filmpacing is what i loved the most from the film it had the perfect amount of actions separated with suspense moments to draw you back in before unloading more fast paced action right from the start we start of with some chases which dont just stop but actually slow down for you to be able to enjoy them a lot and then the director uses the sense of character waiting and reaction shots to tell the story of action as to not over bore you with it but most importantly the actions scenes are never the same and vary a lot so that you dont have that feel oh its the same fight as before in the movie this is a very solid movie i give two thumbs up to the director for actually making the film very well paced much better then avengers age of ultron and all of the transformer films they both can take a lot away from his style 8510,reality
if you hate awe inspiring action sequences little dialog and post apocalyptic salvation movies you should watch this you will if you love those cinematic styling already then you should watch this you will even more see it in 3d it is the type of experience that develops in its own world with its own identity separate from the previous installments and in plain enough terms for anyone to relate to the inevitable visions actors placed in the right situations and ability to be long enough to tell the perfect time line but not grow stale make it a trip worth taking take it there are no pointless moments or dead space it utilizes every second to fill your quivering eyes with dazzle,reality
ive seen a lot of action movies probably seen them all but nothing quite like this one fastpaced entertaining beautiful fit between the desert ambiance the action scenes and the visual effects it has got the non stop action and movement of crank the speed car chasing of fast  furious michael bay type of explosions and dynamic scenes but shot in a christofer nolan way what a perfect opener it will blow you away from the start to the finish a guarantied two hours never stopping entertainment roaring engines speed shootings fire rust dust really a must see anything else would be waste of words just go and see it,reality
george millers masterpiece fury road will definitely create tension and will leave on on the theater sweating and with no words as how epic this film was is shaping up to be as much a unique experience for longtime fans as it will be for those whove never before visited millers vision of a sunscorched hellish post apocalyptic world populated largely by violent maniacs so dont worry if you havent seen the older movies there is absolutely no need to 120 minutes of vehicular carnage and craziness this movie has all aspects it needed to befury road is a beautifully realized vision of the postapocalyptic future filmed in namibia but looking like it was another world and almost no cgi was used it felt like it was real as of how amazing cinematography was this is why it will leave many other movies behind tom hardy as gives a wonderful performance as replacing mel gibson the main character of the older movies also the other heroine charlize theron plays furiosa really good as well having to cut her hair and giving her best indicates she is really into the roll of furiosa feminine form outside but masculine form inside in addition the movie also had a good but simple plot but it definitely didnt need a deep plot having not much dialog also helps other people from different countries to enjoy it as they may not have subtitles the music was phenomenal only one time watching the movie is enough to enjoy and get it into your head even some of the action is synchronized with the music so i greatly recommend you to go and join this crazy ride specially in 3d as miller uses chucking arrows bones and parts of cars and bodies at you what a lovely day indeedi give this movie a 1010 and im looking forward to see it again,reality
wow my initial reaction absolutely incredible this was a blast from the past and a brand new experience all at the same time and i loved every second of it from beginning to end this is a visceral and vicious film that any action film fan will enjoy in a postapocalyptic world where oil is the desire of immortan joe evil comes to life from hugh keaysbyrne but water holds the real power embodied perfectly by tom hardy and furiosa exquisitely played by charlize theron must team up to escape nux a surprising performance by nicholas hoult is a great addition to the teamif you enjoy action movies this is right up your alley this is the best action movie of the year if not the decade it could even be the best action movie of all time it was fun nuanced and amazing you think in seeing an action film the character development wont be there but george miller brings you into the world perfectly and allows characters to say only the things which are absolutely needed to tell the story in an interview tom hardy was quoted saying that you can fit all my dialogue on one page initially i scoffed at this statement but after seeing the film i cant argue with it its a rare moment when its funny because its true he has so few lines that his time on screen heavily depends on his actual acting ability and he doesnt disappointnot only is the acting on all accounts fantastic charlize theron brings it home once again but the way this was filmed blows my mind every stunt was done in real time and was not cgi this might not sound that impressive but once you see the film you will go insane trying to think of all the planning money and skill that went into every single shot stunt or intense moment of the filmthroughout the movie i was cheering laughing and clapping probably to the dismay of others in the theater but i was so invested and involved in the story that i didnt care many others were doing the same it was that much fun but more often than that i found myself staring in awe of some of the incredible beautifully composed shots during this actionpacked adventure the poster above is a part of the opening shot of the film and it pulls you into the world both literally and figurativelyone last note i think this has been the absolute best use of 3d that ive ever seen fury road proves that 3d can still be exciting and add to a storyline as opposed to just being a flash in the pan coughcough avatar never forget the importance of water in this world or rockatansky will find you and make you regret your incompetenceif you like action films go see fury road now,reality
whilst the landscape and population are interesting the film lacks any real story as such tom hardy has the charisma and depth of a mouldy pair of underpants charlize theron has one arm for some reason which is never really justified although it does add something to her character which would have been put to better use with the main villain immortan joe is on of the better characters albeit a rehashed version of bane with don kings hair he seemingly has two sons one who is very small and disabled and the other who is a giant beast of a man yet again this is something the film makes no attempt to explain which is a shame as it would add to the very thin plotthe vehicle design is outstanding and credit must be given to the engineers who put them together assuming they arent all cgito summarise the film they spend 50 of the runtime escaping the main villain and his henchmen only to turn back in the opposite direction to finish where they started,reality
this starts of very quickly with little ceremony and gets straight into the action and this is an action film with a capital a the expected components are there raiders apocalyptic locations cross bows etc but the film is essentially one massive car chasebut i wouldnt let that put you off the action is constant and relentless the clever use of minimal cgi means everything looks fantasticit stays true to the theme with an element of cheesiness which is vital for this kind of movie to stay brutal but stop it getting too darkthere are strange contraptions men on poles mutated clich characters preserved from the old world the vehicles are wacky interesting and varied i personally loved what can only be described as the worlds most improbable morale boosting device the only two gripes i have is the cgi for the flash backs is very poor along with the obligatory 3d scenes of steering wheels hurtling out the screen they are even more annoying when you choose to watch in 2d and the story is a little insulated you are either in the big rig or chasing the big rig  i would have liked to see a dash more of the ruined worldbut there is an awful lot to love about this some may find it a little simplistic some a little too camp but i think it would have been difficult to win all hearts and minds with this one,reality
i will be quite simple with that this is a rather simple movie after all im not a fan of all of the superhero genre people ask me why and no its not that i dont like it because its a comic book at all but its just that the films tend to be just cgi filled and lack any interesting atmosphere i wont even talk about characters hereso unlike those films fury road does it all right instead of cgifilled action sequences we have actual stunts this obviously whether if consciously or unconsciously make the action look far better also unlike all those other modern action movies we actually know whats happening its not just focusing on character each time and basically confusing us and not showing the entire battlefield so it may have the feel it is an actual fight sequence no this film actually makes us know constantly whats on our back sides and frontof course i need to also address the unique postapocalyptic atmosphere in this film the music also fits rather perfectly the ways those apocalyptic people fight with strange gadgets on top of their vehicles is also very entertaining to watchso i would definitely recommend this film it is no citizen kane i mean it isnt something deep nor it should be in fact i would say this is what a summer blockbuster should be it may be not very philosophical or heart warming but it is very entertaining and a lot of fun and even memorable something we barely hear about in todays action filmsso go watch it recommended 910,reality
who hasnt watched any of the movies he can be ashamed of himself because those are one of the most lovable action pieces of all time ive been waiting for this movie for a long time and what motivated me even more for this movie is the lack of good quality action movies in these modern timesmovie starts in medias res there we have who is in the middle of a conflict between a gang and furiosa and there we have our plot for 25 thirds of this masterpiece george miller describes this postapocalyptic world just as i have imagined it everything is dry there is lack of water and carelessness of people for its nature got people to a conflict between themselvestom hardy gives an alphamale badass looking performance that reminded me of one in lawless where he didnt need a lot of words to speak but he was charismatic props to hardy but furiousa steals the show for me on many moments it seemed to me but it actually is that she was the main character of the movie she is that character that we can relate to she is that character that we feel for and that is where charlize theron did a great job inpicture of this whole movie is amazing it is all executed very well and to think that there is very little amount of green screen gives an enormous plus to the movie action doesnt stop it is all paced and just when you think that action stopped it is just so audience can take a moment of rest just so it can take a adrenaline rush few seconds lateri have absolutely nothing else to add i have enjoyed this film very much and i hope that many directors will look up on george millers style of shooting a movie which is not just a fun way to take but also very interesting and attractive this movie excels in every way possible it has interesting plot lovable characters and memorable action it is a mustsee modern masterpiece,reality
fury road the newest from george miller was a film i never had much interest in i havent really seen the others in the franchise i say havent really because i have seen about half of the original but to be honest it isnt really nesscessary im not sure if this is a prequel or sequel but whatever it is doesnt really matter as this is quite possibly the action film of the year and has some of the best action sequences of the decade in factif i were to explain plot here it would seem very thin because in terms of plot there isnt a huge deal of it although this isnt really a bad thing it follows as played by tom hardy who does do a great job following the footsteps of mel gibson as well as rebel furiosa played by charlize theron at the top of her game the two go on a journey to i guess restore order to the postapocalyptic world we are introduced to from the start of the film everybody in this film does a really good job tom hardys australian accent wasnt the best i have heard but he doesnt say a great deal most of the dialogue does come from therons furiosa and she really adds a moral contrast to his performance and they play well of each other in fact this as much her film as it is hardys which i was worried about being called and all but it doesnt bring the film down by a single notchnow earlier on i mentioned that the films plot isnt a very strong one the reason this isnt a problem because the film is pretty much one huge action set piece from the beginning to the very end the action does not stop it is very much a road movie but not a stereotypical road trip movie it is a road movie where cars explode at every given moment and blood is splattered around with no remorse i found out 80 of the films effects are practical and this does not surprise me at all because i had an extremely hard job pinpointing what is cgi and what isnt with the exception of the prosthetic arm used by therons character the real stand out for me was nicolas hult as nux who is a character that you never know whether he is a villain or not at first he seems insane like our villain immortal joe not the toecutter but you do get to know him and you do in fact feel for his character and even have sympathy for him and want him to succeed at pointsby the end of the film all the non stop action sequences that are thrown at us might seem too much but they really arent tom hardy is as badass if not more than mel gibson like i said though i havent seem all the films and charlize theron with the rest of the supporting cast do this film justice you hear a lot about long overdue sequels spoiling what was once a great franchise but fury road just improves it i hope that jurrassic world and even terminator genysis can take a leaf out of this films book fury road deserves all the praise it is getting and is definitely one to get on bluray see this film and you will have a lovely day as nux would say plus the flamethrower guitar dude was awesome look out for him,reality

before i even talk about the plot or the actors i would just like to say that this films visual effectscinematography were incredible no not mind boggling cgi just flat out great camera work and practical effects the costume and make up designers need to sweep the awards this year for their work i walked out of the film and only hours later did i realize how good they were reason being because nothing was wrong with it the camera work and effects were so smooth i couldnt appreciate how good they were because they actually complemented the plot instead of distracting the viewer from it that being said oh my goodness best looking movie of all time imo 1110 from the looks of it only the new star wars film even comes close but we will see when the actual movie roles okay that was just my review on the visuals of the film lets talk aboot that plot eh plot 810 it is what is an actionpost apocalyptic film can only have so good of a plot story before it gets too cluttered this film does the best with what it has a cool setting cool characters and really cool cars the third part of the movie where they find charlizes old biker clan is the weakest part of the plot yet at the same time it was necessary thats the main strength of this plot everything was necessary no extra back storyflashbacks were handed to us no unnecessary expostion we were left to interpret based off of brief dialogue and voices in head as to what has lead to these characters acting the way they did this should be the way every action movie models its plot after nothing too deep yet just enough to make us understand and care similar to the plot of taken in that we dont need information on how the villains came to be or how our hero came to be so heroic we are left to think a wonderful tool in these types of films acting 910 acting wise i was surprised with the exception of the breeders everyone was fit really well in their parts never have been a huge hardy fan but surprisingly roles where he talks less makes his performances better although he only has around 20 lines in the movie the ones he mumbles out either made me laugh or made me realize he was disturbed charlize played a strong female lead who was kickass and is not over the top at the same time with the exception of the part where she reunites with her old clan all of her lines were necessary the villains were awesome for the most part my only complaint would be that we only really got to spend time with two of them the third one the fat one was more of a side piece none the less great acting across the boardpacing 910 start your engines make sure you have enough gas to last for two hours because this one does not let up from the opening scene of the movie till the canyon scene towards the end you will be thrown into an atmospheric fast paced film that is both exhilarating and memorable although not every great action film is paced like this it just works in this one with every thing being so over the top from the insane guitar creep to the unbreakable bones of our hero i dont know it just freaking works visuals 1010go see it,reality
this is supremely surrealdali absolutely fascinating even this one like the first 3 films we get to suspend disbelief as the movie projects thrusting us into the postapocalyptic world with anthropological and sociological elements we could believe it dont get me wrong this movie is the best of the series the unforgivable and the road warrior were convincing in its tribalism brutality and uncompromising violence im sure is true is burned into my survivalist memory im not a hater but massive dune buggies rock playing mutants and an oxygen breathing madman no way miller you messed up bad what happened to a shell of a man who hasnt quite lost his humanity only long forgotten and buried it in this way this movie pisses me off in the same way the phantom menace did and yet 9 out of 10 miller your awesome,reality
finally hope that high quality action movies are back this movie takes you on a nonstop action packed ride from start to finish the stunt work is phenomenal and the cinematography is breathtakingly stunning its so relieving to see an action movie that doesnt rely on cgi to tell the story because this movie barely has any and it was hard to notice any at all besides this one scene tom hardy is on the fast track to becoming the big budget acting star hollywood has longed looked for because he can actually act speaking of which charlize theron delivers an amazing performance that should get her several award nods do yourself a favor and go see this on the big screen i highly recommend paying the extra money to see it in 3d as well the only bad thing i can say is it was a disappointment went it was over cant wait to see the next installments in this franchise,reality
after finally renting fury road online im completely baffled by the positive reviews its gotten three elements made the original movies work the supercharged car and chase scenes the shocking stunts often done with practical real effects and mel gibsons portrayal of a postapocalypse antihero who is hard and cynical and the ultimate survivorthe first movie introduced this world still in a society we knew but in the middle of a collapse into anarchy and we see when he was a cop before he lost his family the second movie took this world further where there was nothing left but roving gangs and the infamous battle down the highway with a few surprisingly deep philosophical questions the third movie is where it jumped the shark the car is gone and instead the vehicles and people are like something out of a comic book is guardian to a group of children and campy humor replaces cynical realityfury road is essentially beyond thunderdome remade on a huge budget the supercharged pursuit interceptor is literally in it for maybe 510 seconds and shows up briefly in a chase scene laterabsolutely nothing works the action scenes appear to be deliberately sped up by probably 20 over normal film speed and the result is it feels like a hyped up and amateur martial arts movie the spectacle is huge but so overblown your mind doesnt think its real as an example of how silly it gets in the earlier movies they had nitrous now someone literally climbs onto the hood and spits fuel into the intake for some reason the pale albino foot soldiers have a thing for spraying their mouths with silver paint before doing something suicidali can remember in the road warrior when the female love interest is pulled off of the truck and literally steps out of the door at speed and dispatches the bad guy with a shotgun blast through the windshield here so many flying bodies and explosions happen it all runs togetherguns were rare and often unreliable in the earlier movies this made the idea of marauders doing battle with darts arrows and thrown weapons more plausible but also brought the action scenes into close up intensity now everyone has a firearm there isnt a single paved road yet somehow the societies can keep high octane vehicles runningthe producers went into overkill on outdoing each idea with a bigger or more bizarre one one car has tank treads for some reason the main villain has rows of pregnant women hooked up to milking machines one bad guy is a portly businessman in a suit with a club foot and a prosthetic nose yet holes cut in his clothing to expose his nipples many of the vehicles have the style of 23 car bodes stacked on top of each other one of the bad guys is a blind guitarist on a rig that is like a giant sound system the guitar doubling as a flamethrower whatevermuch has been made about the feminist aspect of this movie but its not really brought into focus just another random idea tossed into the mix furiosa is passable and seems more like than tom hardy the entire gist of the story is the villain immortan joe is chasing her to get his prize harem back which he calls his property furiosa has some sort of dark past behind her but its never explained and late in the movie she finds home which is a pack of motorcycle riding grandmother snipers thats it no message or depth beyond thatand finally tom hardy as we see over and over hints that he is tormented by the loss of a child and spouse but its also never explained tom is quite literally just there with none of the brutal vindictiveness that gibsons version was capable ofoverall i dont think ive seen such a mess of a movie since waterworld,reality
lets make one thing clear there is no way to say this movie was greatfrom the first second you are put right into a hostile environment where without any argument a man gets attacked it stays unclear why because it stays unclear why the half living needs its blood that half living seems fine without it the rest of the film though that isnt why i grade this movie so extremely low the thing is that there is nothing more to the film than chasing each other till some key figure dies every moment i was watching for something new and impressive butt even the guitardrum car was not loud enough to be that the bomb sticks are immensely overrated and multiple armies cant take out one single truck loaded with water there i named another point of annoyance the amount of water they keep with them in a car chase who takes a truck full of water to a chase they could at least have dumped some to be a bit lighterso there is now way you can call this a good movie it was a boring slow and monotonous action movie that does not deserve a rating above 4 stars its a shame that even todays critics call this a good movie,reality
i dont normally say that about a movie even my favorite films have flaws that i recognize and humbly admit to even still that doesnt mean i love them any less fury road is that rare example of a film that understands what it is so well that it forgoes flaws this is a perfect movienow i understand thats a bold statement and i also know its only my opinion but its something i thought long and hard about after walking out of the theater still recovering from the 2 hour thrill ride i had just been on there was not a single moment during fury road that i a checked my watch b thought something was out of place c got bored with the actionthe characters the music the action the direction  its all top level stuff no fluffy words in this review i am simply stunned at millers execution of this very simple plot i love how miller allows the expressions of the characters to speak for themselves i love how he doesnt dwell on supposed important character moments because he understands exactly what to show and when to get back to the action the music may the key ingredients in the mix as junkie xl delivers a soundtrack full of thundering drums epic violins and shredding electric guitar a soundtrack that had my heart racing a million miles an hour and gazing at the screen in disbelief as cars and bodies flew through a sandstorm in slow motionthe fact that cgi was kept to a minimum makes the film feel even more satisfying like we payed to see high octane action where cars crash into one another and people perform death defying stunts and we get what we pay for as close to 90 of what youre seeing is reali could gush over this film for hours but id like to say that if nothing else fury road gave me the feeling of being a kid again and seeing a blockbuster for the first time in an age of bloated cgifilled summer movies its nice to see a simple streamlined real film in the mix welcome back dont keep us waiting to long for the next one,reality
george millers fury road i dont even know where to begin first of all forget avengers forget furious 7 this is the movie to see this summer and perhaps this decade it is a nitrous injected chrome plated masterpiece of savage beauty and reckless juggernaut aerobatics that has to be seen to be believed miller has taken the core elements of what made his road warrior so special and beloved and kicked them into high gear for a revisionist take on the ages old post apocalyptic punk warrior desert chase film tom hardy is hysterical as a brooding bruised hearted grump who just wants to be left alone until hes dragged literally into a deranged odyssey through the badlands charlize theron is all rock solid tough as imperator furiosa who hijacks the five breeding wives of tyrannical terrifying warlord immortan joe hugh keayes byrne toecutter from the first film and flees into the desert to find a greener place away from the madness miller strips away any unnecessary dialogue or clichd getting to know you scenes and streamlines the film into one sleek forward surging force of nature with not a moment wasted and not a line of dialogue or glare of the eyes that isnt somehow in service of the constant go go go mantra of the story such pacing is the genius of what makes it such a thrill also amazing is the imagination and world building miller uses an anthropologists eye to look at what the human mind and civilization would evolve to in a situation like this resulting in every character having a realistic thought through vernacular and some truly phenomenal lived in style set pieces that are truly eye popping such attention and care is rare in this genre miller and team have outdone themselves with this absolutely exhilarating film technically proficient in every way and filled to the brim with the kind of love for films and telling stories that its predecessors revels in back then,reality
reasons to never see this movie 1 there were so many explosions that had i walked out of the theater and into a car bombing i probably would not have noticed 2 was a bumbling idiot that did almost nothing useful or productive in the entire movie one or two small things yes but he spends the entire first 14 of the movie as a total spectator which brings me to 3 this movie could have been made without ever including it had nothing to do with as mentioned above he did nothing really useful and he was almost the flattest and most emotionless character in the story 4 it has little to do with reality or frankly physics at one point there is a dustthundertornadolightningdarkness storm that has no apparent cause except to make the interminable chase seen different for a couple of minutes 5 the villain an overweight dude with no physical presence dressed in clear plastic armour and with a serious breathing issue its like if darth vader had lived to 150 and brutally interrogated a million donuts he has no personality and basically no lines worth noting if he had been silent the entire time it would have been better 6 it makes no reference to the previous three movies at all was this a reboot why even include then since didnt have any actual impact oh right the franchise so george miller made this movie trying to draw on his fan base for success i dont know but this is the truth 7 i am a fan of the first three movies but my support of this franchise ends there like aliens 3 and terminator 3 there is nothing worth seeing here unless you want two hours of explosion and nothing nothing else,reality
i just didnt like the movie from the start and wanted to stop watching it immediately it was just unexplained action from the beginning with no plot at all i dont know how people can like these types of geeky movies with all the science fiction bs it would have been decent if it had an actual plot and not just over the top action,reality
this is my first review on this site and wanted to do it mostly to thank all the people involved in making this great movie a truly classic masterpiece with over the top action and one of my favorite movies all time,reality
i see a lot of negative reviews for this movie popping up people complaining that there is a lack of story and character development and too much action too much action really have these people never seen a movie before how is that a bad thing in a movie fury road feels like an 80s action movie with a preposterously large budget and it is glorious this movie was an epic ride so many awesome set pieces incredible car designs twisted and bizarre costumes and characters and a lot of really strong warrior women as wellive also heard it said that this movie contains a lot of feminism strong female characters that kick butt is not feminism people theres no antimen message here just a cast which is dominated by more women than men and about time for a change charlize theron is my new favorite actress after this it used to be sigourney weaver and linda hamilton she really takes the spotlight and that is about the only criticism i can think of with this movie its not so much about but about road warriors in general and specifically therons character i didnt think tom hardy was quite as good as as mel gibson was but he wasnt terrible he just didnt lend enough presence to his character in this movie which may be a hard thing to do when the movie does not focus on special mention should also be given to all the side characters the villains are enjoyably menacing especially hugh keaysbyrne as immortan joe john howard as the people eater richard carter as the bullet farmer and i also loved melissa jaffer as the leader of a gang of elderly motor ladiesgo see this movie if you like ,reality
didnt rate this film at all this was the only film ive ever walked out of in the cinema and i wasnt the only person to walk out yes there is loads of action but there is no storyline these two factors combined makes the movie drag i walked out after 90 minutes which felt like 25 hours it was basically one big action sequence if you are not bothered about story lines and love pure action then you would probably like it if not then i would steer clear if you have to see it for yourself i would probably rent or download it and save yourself the price of a cinema ticket such a shame as the trailer made it look so good but if you were to watch the trailer for 2 hours theres probably no difference from the actual movie,reality
after watching fury road i can safely conclude that not only will the film be welcomed by a majority of people craving a good action packed popcorn flick this new movie will effectively change the actionadventure game for the betterthe story begins with hardy being chased by a group of crazed goons across the desert in his signature interceptor car the vehicle crashes spectacularly and hes immediately captured were introduced to a host of characters warped by the landscape and made crazy by their circumstance immortan joe keaysbyrne sits atop of the social spectra a violent disfigured dictator who has hijacked not only the worlds most needed resource water but the worlds most precious the future he has taken the most beautiful brides among his dirtpile civilization and forces them into a harem where he rapes them to birth a normal untarnished heir that is until furiosa theron a trusted marauder takes the harem and escapes in her war rig with a mission to take them to the green place with war parties in fast pursuit is forced to be a feral warriors blood bag until fate allows him the chance for escape and possible redemption from the thoughts that haunt himafter a fifteen minute setup the entire movie boils down to one big long explosive exciting pulsepounding chase through the desert each action setpiece is a masters course in chaotic beauty and mayhem lest you think youve seen it all watch the first extended chase between the war rig and the war partiesthen wait another five minutes because the expectations you just set for yourself will be blown to smithereens george miller decided to film in the otherworldly desert of namibia instead of the australian outback the hues of the rock and sands of namibia make for some austere beauty and intensifies the desperation of the world of no longer are their paved roads only basins of flat unforgiving dirt remain trekked by those most craven and those most crazedthrough all the absurd chaos characters emerge not through dialogue or longwinded explanations but through action everyone we meet is stripped to their essence and pitted against each other the number one goal for our beleaguered protagonists survival its that simple in particular has quite a complex character arc given the movies structure he is reintroduced in our psyche as a man who once had a moral compass now reduced to an animal wild and instinctual he lost those he loved most and is haunted by their memories by the end of the movie his purpose is molded beyond simply survival his resourcefulness and pragmatism follows a logical train that ends with becoming a restorer of hope a rebirth of the dark antihero we once loved and all with little to no dialoguenow a gamechanging movie like this is not without its controversy mens rights activists have been crying foul ever since this movies been released claiming the movie is feminist propaganda masquerading as a shootemup noted chauvinist blogger and blatherskite aaron clarey even initiated a boycott over its perceived feminist agenda men in america and around the world are going to be duped by explosions fire tornadoes and desert raiders into seeing what is guaranteed to be nothing more than feminist propaganda while at the same time being insulted and tricked into viewing a piece of american culture ruined and rewritten right in front of their very eyeswith as much respect as i can give people with rudimentary understanding of discrimination knock it off having physically and emotionally strong female characters is not propaganda nor is making an enemy out of a thoroughly disgusting human who in no way represents the male gender or the patriarchy as it exists today if anything the warped society that exists in fury road is an exaggerated view of patriarchy therefore categorizing the political elements of as satire even to claim the film has a feminist agenda of any kind is suspect not all feminists believe the same thing but a majority believe portraying women in media in the mold of a traditional male sans male genitalia is not the best way to empower women not to discount therons performance but her furiosa does fit that billmy only real complaint is less about the movie and more about hollywoods insistence that 3d is the way to go dazzling sequences of real stunt driving and explosions that would put the fast and furious franchise to shame are interrupted by obvious frames where 3d is injected for the sake of being injected in one almost delirious moment of cliwe see obvious computer generated twisted metal synchronized to look like a jackinthebox it was distracting flaw but not a fatal flawfury road is not just a spectacular action film its an action film that truly raises the bar those who have never seen the original films wont be lost nor will they be disappointed through frenetic editing solid smooth camera work strong acting brawny metalmeetsmuscle action sequences and minimalist story every action movie the foreseeable future is going to wish it was httpwwwtheyservepopcorninhellblogspotcom,reality
do not go into this movie with the thought that this is going to be a direct follow on from the last movie its not its nothing like it but its been 30 years since the last was released  so what do you expect in saying that  i thought this movie was fantastic the new and improved uses everything that modern day technology allows it is a visual masterpiece to the people saying it lacked storyline and was just constant action have you seen a film before theyre all a bit like that even though i said that the new is nothing like the old it helps to have a bit of a knowledge on the old storyline because truthfully the storyline doesnt give you much of an introduction it just expects you to know why  whats going on in the world from the storyline of the last onesthe action the stunts the cars the rigs the weapons the sets  theyre all amazing if nothing else  see this movie for the pure visual playground i personally hated the first movies mostly because through no fault of their own the time it was filmed watching 80s movies now is cringeworthy the lack of funding for good props and effects and probably because it was the start of his career mel gibsons terrible acting ability so i really didnt expect to like this movie all too much but because of the advertisements i thought id give it a go because it looked visually interesting and it had a 100000 better cast tom hardy is a great the war boys are fantastic too furiousa is amazing and the wives are all quite wonderful actresses so that alone improved this moviefor those concerned that this is a feminist movie like some other reviews have stated that is such bullsht there are strong male and female characters and in a world ruled by men where women are nothing but baby makers  of course theyve got to stand up for themselves someones got to just because it wasnt a man swooping in to save them from the castle doesnt mean its a feminist movie and in saying that  and the war boy help save the women too so i really cant understand where all this feminist finger pointing is coming from overall  go see it if you havent seen the old  just do a little bit of a read up as to the storyline of the apocalyptic setting and war for fuel it will help you grasp the storyline if you have seen the old  dont expect this to be like the old ones they had a ton more funding and tried to make this as epic as possible and succeeded  something im sure they would have loved to do with the first but didnt have access to the funds or technology this movie is a fun visual masterpiece leaves you on the edge of your seat once or twice and overall is a great film,reality

what to say about a movie like this one its easy if you expect a difficult dramatic story then you are not going to like it but if you expect an action movie about a whole lot of modified vehicles trying to take over a big modified truck in the middle of nowhere with creepy looking humans then you are going to love it and thats what i was going to expect i like movies like this one where you just relax and let the action come to you not all the time but sometimes i do enjoy a movie like the amateurs of steam punk will also like this one because almost everybody in this movie is strangely looking the filming itself was good the script is like i said what it is it should not have been difficult to write that script the actors all did their job like they should charlize theron and tom hardy are the main characters and they are good actors nice action movie if you are into stuff like that otherwise just pass on this movie and watch something else,reality
the theatrical preview for had my hopes skyhigh i was expecting avant garde postapocalyptic poetry on screenthe plot is thin the dialogue severely uninteresting and the special effects mostly a long repetitive car chase through a desert there could have been so much more story telling and character development but the film forces you to do the work of filling in those blanks with your own imaginationnothing groundbreaking to see here is the kind of movie you watch because it was on the good parts are quite good but it still struggles with a bgrade script,reality
fury road is another movie in the series it is not a reboot it is a continuation of stories this one takes place between the road warrior and beyond the thunderdome first off this movie is beautiful every single shot looks fantastic it looks like a painting the visuals in this are also so beautiful almost the whole movie is practical effects and you can see in the action scenes that this real like the old ones there isnt much dialogue just pure action the acting is great tom hardy plays a great of course mel gibson well always be the best but tom does a great of carrying that character the one character who steals every scene is charlize therons character imperator furiosa every scene shes in shes just kills it the action is unbelievable george miller knows how to shoot old school action and he does not disappoint even we theres 50 cars on the screen you can see perfectly whats happen this movie is worth paying the ticket for i3d this makes george miller a mastermind and the whole movie a masterpiece overall fury road was was a crazy fun nonstop action movie with great character development defiantly a movie that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible if your a fan of or just a fan of action movies you need to see this,reality
ok this movie is so bad  i dont know how the rating is so high in the movie they just play hide and seekdont listen to any of the critics who say it is a masterpiece this is not better than aliens terminator 2 die hard predator and even the matrix the most positive thing that i can say is the first half hour was so so i was hoping it would get better but the movie dies after that each character is underdeveloped and a waste all of the actors are wasted the special effects are good but not much else it just misses the mark on what i expected to be a this is one of the most overrated action films that ive seen in years this will never stand the test of time like the ones mentioned before it will be forgotten years later,reality
i grew up watching master pieces like the franchise and i absolutely loved them to bits which is why this new installment felt like taking a unwarranted blow to the nether regionseverything that the previous installments great was missing from this one no real storyline is relegated to the background most of the movie its just one big pile of disappointing excrementit seems like they were too lazy to actually write a story for the movie so they just picked a bunch of characters kinda suitable to the theme and put them in a nice action packed chase scene and thought it a done dealeveryone that worked on this socalled movie should be ashamed of themselves for ruining such a great movie franchise,reality
movie was so bad that some people left the cinema in the middle wish i could unseen this moviei have to believe that the initial reviews are fake especially since there are so many using the same verbiage  like the word master piece this film is very very far from a masterpiece in fact i think the word garbage would be more appropriateeven though most of the action is done practically it doesnt mean anything because you dont care about the characters one of the strong points of the old movies is how they slowed down to give you a chance to take in the world you was in and get to know the characters it doesnt happen herealso when this movie does use cgi its laughably bad and from start to finish the movie looks way too polished and cartoonliketom hardy is terrible laughably bad mel gibson should be very thankful he stayed away from this stinkergeorge miller screwed what could have been a good movie,reality
its a good thing we only paid 5 per person because it wasnt worth 2 i nearly left after 20 minutes and stayed just to see if there was something worth taking away with me i was so wrong i wouldnt even watch it again on free tv cant believe the actors got paid for this piece of dribble the landscape is about as interesting as the dialog im sure the movie was written by someone under the age of 20 and should be watched by juveniles younger than 15 the sound was far too loud couldnt under stand the english  it was english wasnt it there were a few phrases that were captioned but that was because a foreign language was being usedthat part i understood,reality
not going to put spoilers in but this movie was terriblethe screen play for this absolutely made no sense i am a movie goer but this has to be one of the worst movies i have seen in a few years the only thing positive i can say i liked was it had limited cgi in it compared to most movies coming out and the designs of the cars in it were creative other than that it was a horribly produced movie this coming from a fan of the previous movies i dont see how this is getting 87 other than it would make sense for the production to pay people to give it a high review everyone walked out saying this was terrible dont waste you money on this if you are short on cash and seeking entertainment you will feel like you wasted money,reality
this is a desert world where they pump thousands of gallons of water out of giant pipes basically the most inefficient delivery system possible so that the vast majority of it is lost and soaks uselessly into the groundthis is a world where heroes get their hands on weapons and fire rounds into the ground for no apparent reason despite the fact that in such a world every single bullet would be immensely valuable its a world with seemingly no food and yet the ability to feed hundreds or thousands of people who power everything through musclethis is a world where the technology is so limited that they have to use human beings on giant hamster wheels for power and yet they are able to determine random peoples blood types and rig up complicated blood transfusion systems this is a world where a woman falls in love with some random ass pasty white guy for absolutely no apparent reason other than that hes there towards the end of the movie one of the women makes a statement i thought he wasnt crazy anymore despite the fact that no one in that group could have any idea of history mental state or the scene that had just taken place inside his head there is zero reason for her to make that statement and yet she made it the feminist metaphor is so cartoonish that the women might as well have walked around with signs around their neck reading feminist metaphoroh and gasolinediesel is extremely hard to come by in your world hey no problem fuel a giant freaking truck for no other purpose than to act as a mobile stage for an electric guitarist and a bunch of drummersyou know because in a world where resources are rare youve got all the fuel in the world to do such a thing this movie is great so long as you dont think it moves very fast with lots of explosions and inexplicable visuals so you could conceivably watch the whole thing without ever stopping to think about how most of it makes no goddamn sense this is indeed what must have happened i can think of no other reason how people could watch this and call it smart things move so fast that you never get to know any of the characters in any meaningful way is the stereotypical psychologically scarred loner gibson was able to give that character depth in past movies partly due to his acting but also partly due to the fact that the movies stopped to breathe long enough at times to get to know him the writing is terrible throwing in some feminism doesnt change that i am completely dumbfounded at the enthusiastic response to this mindless stream of dreck,reality
this movie was a total waste of 10 and 120 minutes of my life they could have condensed the whole thing into 15 minutes i loved the first movies but this one was just lame swell fx but grossly overkill maybe im just getting old but i cant think of calling this movie anything but a waste best part was artful vehicles otherwise just a waste the mel gibson ones were much better acting 0 shame on you charlise plot lame fx fine but way overdone 3d  ok lots of stuff flying at you my rating 3 for the 3d on a scale of 1 to 100 i voted it 1 only because there was no zero if this is the best hollywood has to offer ill be staying home a lot this summer,reality

i love post apocalyptic fiction  john wyndham and john christopher are amongst my favourite authors  they weave compelling stories of average everymen surround by a hostile landscape where its every man for himself and only the cruelest and most heartless survive  george millers films are an extention of this  low brow cinematic spectacle but fair as entertainment goes  and lets not forget hugely influential as well  sadly the films influence found itself being transplanted in nearly every post apocalypse story for the next 20 years where a brooding loner  a man of few words  drives through a desert landscape doing his best to survive in a hostile world against scavengers  influntial but rather unimaginative and the movies probably did the subgenre more harm than good  this reboot did capture my imagination via the trailers and so decided to give the film a chance  not least because as soon as it was released it shot to number 25 on the imdb top 250 if nothing else the film gets off with a bang with the eponymous filling us in via voice over that the world has destroyed itself and man has to fight to stay alive against his fellow man and just to prove this is more difficult than it sounds were treated to a high octane chase sequence replete with fast camera action and editing  have i mentioned the opening title credits havent appeared yet  this sets up the rest of the film that continues in mainly the same way in short if you liked 2 youre going to love this one because this is 2 on a fatal cocaine overdose which is a great thing or a disappointing thing depending on how you look on it  sadly im in the second camp because i wanted more meat on the story and theres not much narrative here  gets used as a gimp on the front of a vehicle  manages to escape during an epic stunt sequence  teams up with some fair nymphet maidens and protects them from the baddies and thats it as far as plot goes  the first half of the film is basically one elongated noisy chase sequence full of stunts  car crashes  pyrotechnics  is brash  noisy and spectacular  so much so that i actually felt myself getting rather bored by all this noise and bluster  eventually the film does settle down a bit and has characters talking in normal tones without the explosions in the background but the dialogue is just basic as are the performances  certainly fury road will be up for a few oscar noms next year but only for the technical aspects and im slightly surprised my imdb peers rate it so highly,reality
i felt like loosing 2 hours from my life and i felt at last the movie ended continuous story less madness without any motive and irritating to the fullest furiosa is handicapped and drives a big modified truck or war vehicle illogical foolish movie making dont watch it unless you want to loose your money and is a funny goat who shows style in all kind of fools around only thing to see are the cars  the movie starts with running and remembering his kids or wife who are lucky that they died and did not have to bear this pain that we as a crowd had to bear while watching the same the music will burn your headthe actions are repetitivegirlfriends will leave if you take her to this movie,reality
being new to the world of i went in to the theatre with an open mind only knowing to expect cars and explosions which i briefly saw from snippets of trailersin the end thats all i got just explosions cars violence and no story whatsoever due to the fact that action sequences drag on for such an inexplicable amount of time theres no room to breathe and incorporate morsels of a plot together the plot if thats what you want to call it and introduction to this world is so vague that it seems that the filmmakers just wanted to skim over the unimportant aspects of a film like a good plot and interesting characters and just get straight to the high octane action which quickly loses its novelty and thrill good choice there mates this film is so bad that you cant even spoil ittheres not much that i can praise about the film other than the nice and insane visuals the use of vibrant blue and orange tones and the barren landscapes its difficult to even pick out anything good about the cast tom hardy who plays the titular character has such a small role and just mumbles his way throughout the film so unsure of himself speaking of mumbling is meant to be set in australia yet theres an overwhelming earful of british and american accents that are all painfully and conspicuously dubbed in the adr process of the movie and even then some of the dialogue is just unintelligible again the focal point of the film seems to be the action sequences which go on for almost an hour straight if i can remember correctly though i dont want to remember anything about at allsmaller aspects of the film are difficult to just gloss over and ignore such as the fact that characters endure tough and dangerous road trips for days without food or water and still have the strength to fight speak stand leap from car to car etc this film is praised for its likely representation of a postapocalyptic world yet there are just no tinges of realism to be found hereit saddens me that audiences are responding to fury road so positively and enthusiastically with a current 87 rating on imdb and 98 score on rotten tomatoes as of late may 2015 are films so bad nowadays that the average moviegoer is just rendered completely susceptible and hypersensitive to mindless highoctane action and plots that are barely held together by underdeveloped characters for anyone serious about goodquality films avoid as best as you can even if it means you have to drive far out into the australian outback to isolate yourself from another one of hollywoods finest,reality
i grew up with and the road warrior and i apologize for thunderdome i was 13 when it came out so i was clearly a target demographic but that one was to save the kids and now were saving the chicksyes i heard all the uproar when it came out and it concerned me i also remember watching the previews with an arched eyebrow and all of those fears came true the flamethrower guitar is ridiculous and pointless just dumb mounting your blooddonor to the front of your car and then using nitro seriously hogtie him and throw him in the backseat or the trunk isnt it important that you keep him alive if he is giving you a constant blood transfusion but it looks cooler if you strap him to the hood and dont put any eye protection on its just a desert no rocks or dust or anythingevery single time a woman bit it there was a stop in action to reflect on the loss each time when the preggo chick fell it affected every cast member in the movie it was tragic to lose a woman but dudes were getting offed a mile a minute and their clothes stayed amazingly pure and white throughout the movie every male in the movie is either horribly flawed and evil or exists to serve the women and the kid are the only good ones at the end the benevolent women turn on the water for everyone  in what has got to be the worst waterdistribution system in existence id like to believe that joe was actually rationing a limited supply of water and now these silly binks have just made the worlds largest mud puddle for a weekthis movie did not remind me of the first two at all yeah they had the doublebarreled shotgun with the dead shell whoopie did that onearmed chick really hold a guy by his leg for a couple of minutes while crushing a speeding car between her rig and another mmmkay he weighs what 200 pounds and shes going to onearm it with her robot arm that is strapped on wowi am very glad that i refused to see this in the theaters this is not something that i would have liked to contribute to thanks bittorrent because i would have been irritated to have paid for this crap i did notice that the commercials for it stopped pretty much as soon as it came out that usually means its all promotion hype and that usually means a mediocre experience at best i was so bored and uninterested at times i put it on pause and went and did other things i was never glued to my couch and i felt that i was struggling to finish itcraptastic on  just about every level should have been titled  chopped  screwedhttpsyoutube6sk5iuijr1et50,reality
unless you are a brainless person theres no way that you can even come close to enjoy this movie movie was so bad that some people left the cinema in the middle you cant really trust the other reviews here its just a bunch on explosions and ridiculous fighting scenes i can only imagine that people are getting paid to write good reviews here the whole plot of the movie fits in a single tweet and still leaves space for some facepalm emojis lets escape lets go back the end facepalm facepalm facepalm,reality
as a die hard fan i was looking forward to the 4th installment of tom hardy seemed like a fantastic choice for the role and charlize theron as furiosa seemed like a good fit little did i know the story was beyond weak and tom hardy would get little chance of portraying the entire movie seemed to focus on furiosa which is fine if i went to see a furiosa movie the budget seemed sufficient to recreate the essence of the we all love however the writerdirector seemed to really have no interest in allowing to do his thing this was nothing more than a betrayal of fans to promote furiosa and perhaps her upcoming furiosa trilogy what a waste becomes because tom hardy is one of the best actors on the planet and could have done justice to the role as ,reality
as a big fan of installments 1 and 2 of the films i was keen to see the latest offering i went with low expectations which were confirmed and didnt change through the film it did not seem to have much of a story line other than the never ending car chase across the desertfor me it was really charlize therons movie with tom hardy costaring as it was a flat performance that i was glad to see the end ofit was good to see a scattering of australian actors in the cast and some of the old cars unfortunately not enough of the ford coupe made famous in movies 1 and 2the car chases were well done and ive read that there was very little cgi used which makes them all the more impressive good photography let down by the script,reality
first of all id like to clear a few things out 1 i have never written another review on imdb the fact that this movie urged me to do so speaks volumes 2 i have not watched the original with mel gibson therefore i cannot condemn the whole series i will only be judging this movie 3 i love adventurefantasydystopian movies im literally a junkie i have watched pretty much every one out there so i am not a hater of the genre that being said i will continue with my first genuine reaction to this film in quotes  what the f did i just watch these are 120 minutes of my life that i will never ever get back thank the lord i didnt go to the movies to watch it with my friends when they asked me to cause apart from my time id also be crying over my money now yes in my non professional opinion as a humble viewer this piece of sh that i wasted my time watching was absolutely horrific what do i even start with the absolutely ridiculous  nonexistent plota stupid bunch consisting of a lunatic a bald chief on the verge of schizophrenia and a few hot girls just because decide to run off to the sunset to find a nonexistent promise land and are chased by another crazy bunch of ugly beasts and brainwashed slaves for absolutely no freaking reason oh and as if that was not stupid enough half way the decide they were wrong and turn the f around so they continue being chased by the same idiots who end up not catching them after all and then they releasewaterand they all live happily ever after hooray wtf if there was some interest in the history and setting of this dystopian world it eluded me  since no one freaking bothered to explore it a little further all we get is that these people are pretty much dying of thirst due to a lack of water but every time their ugly leader wakes up in a good mood he releases a freaking waterfall and wastes half their water supplies by spilling it all over the place not to mention this literally character who decides to pretty much have himself killed in a ruthless road trip gonebad even though he doesnt really give a sh why on earth other than the obvious reason of earning some shamefull but necessary moneywould wonderful actors like charlize theron and tom hardy whom i dont particularly love but in all honesty i havent exactly followed so far in his career agree to be part of this sh excuse of a film i have no idea all i can say is that it took me three days to watch the damn thing because i was so freaking bored that i d literally stop it every 15 minutes or so to go find something interesting to do with my life but i am a compulsive nerd who just had to finish what she started so i went through 120 endless minutes of torture and boredom only to come out of it with so much anger that i had to come in here and write a review to release part of it and go to bed sodo not watch do not watch it watch 50 shades of gray instead its a sh movie as well but if you happen to be a 50 year old pervert with 0 love life you might actually enjoy it more or better yet go find something else to do with your life anything really reading the back label of your clothes detergent would be more educational useful interesting and entertaining i give it a 10,reality
actors that mumble their lines dialogue that means next to nothing and a plot that goes nowhere complete waste of a decent cast like tom hardy and charlize theronthe original movie is currently at 62 marketing ploy has this one at 87 imdb needs to start removing the advertisers if you must watch it bring your own soundtrack at least by the time you get bored youll have some entertainmenton second thought watch another movie please seriously lets not reward this gamification of ranking system with more money to feed the machine,reality
im really disappointed to see how highly rated this movie is there was a time when great movies achieved that status by presenting a new perspective of life by feeding you new thoughts and emotions by showing the limits of human conditionmovies used or at least tried to resemble good books not anymore it seems now it has become over the top action with shallow characters superheroes in a nutshell who have little to do with our lives sheer entertainment is acceptable but rating it as a masterpiece is the epitome of mediocrity and it reinforces a dangerous trend where movies become a complete escape from reality instead of a different take on itwhat makes us human more than anything is our curiosity our desire for knowledge this movie and other highly rated movies like the avengers are a step backwards how could it be otherwise when visual stimulation replaced brain stimulation hopefully foreign movies wont follow the same steps,reality
i would say 80 of this movie is insane no cgi action its brutal visually stunning masterpiece backed with sound of constant wardrumming and heavy metal guitar plot is minimalistic but decent fitting well wide desert setting i had feeling i was watching war movie where people would easily go insane in chaos of battle there is no oscar winning acting here for sure but every actor deliver pretty good there was no boring moments here every character was unique in its own way i was not fan of the first three movies so i had no any hype for this one a must watch movie cant really compare it to anything similar,reality
must see if you are a action movie loverto hardy rocks 1010 tom hardy and charlize theron are two wonderful forces of nature bringing to life and into a hellish universe two characters who become classics from the beginning mel gibson gave us the first interpretation of the role but it took revisiting the material and finding a new actor to truly present what is all about hardy is a jaded creation who exists to survive he has that hard look driven and with all of his priorities set to survival mode he recognizes that you cant sit still here and there is no sense in worrying if you want to livehe finds himself prisoner of a set deviantsmutants that plan on killing him for sport soon finds himself in the middle of a car chase that will eclipse anything else you have seen before at first he observes everything around him as he is on the hood of vehicle which is the stuff nightmares are made of in the opening scenes he manages to go through something that could be describe as the place where hell touched earth with lighting storms sand storms wind storms and just about anything else that can be thrown at him he pulls through in what many less ambitious directors would have saved fr the final frames but in fury road this is just the beginning and in the hands of george miller a man who is around 70 years old we get what was just a promise in the previous filmsthe universe is fully developed with just about every hellish detail up on the screen every element coming together in almost a magical way for not much is spoken to allow a skilled director to extract emotions reactions and powerful images from what his camera captures a much impressive achievement when one considers the amount of spectacular moments throughout the entire film as i said before the opening scenes only serve as the launching pad of what will be recognized as many as unbelievable breathtaking and utterly satisfyingin this film vehicles will burn crash tumble fly and spit fire continuously and the drivers are not just ridicule caricatures like those in a recent release there is power disgust hate hunger envy and almost anything else you can think of emanating from everyone on the screen even the angelic wivesprisoners are not empty shells one can feel every emotion by letting millers sirens seduce and leads into total shock and admiration not believing that what we have seen is possible here cgi doesnt overpower and sterilize the content many action films suffer from a mismanagement of resources here miller works with what he knows best but he still uses cgi to increase the power of what one sees in this movie very little looks fake and nothing is sacrificing to reckless waste of moneymiller has given us a film that captures the magic of moviemaking the realization of its power this is the masterpiece many dream of where nothing and no one is spared every penny is showcased one way or another there are no egos to satisfy just goals to achieve and these are accomplished miller should like others before him clean his favorite space at home in order to display whatever type of recognition he seriously deserves much has been made of a gimmicks recently birdman tried to blend the mania of a troubled mind with harsh realityand it sorely failed here is film which entertains never bores and certainly is able to mix intelligence the hells which some beings carry in their souls and the possibility that a future like might not be that distant the film is not fantasy its the type of science fiction which shows the almost certain possibility of what might be comingi never understood why some films had a certainly look but they lacked vision charm or anything remotely intelligent and the disappointment hurt no one will walk away from fury road because miller respects the audience understand that unless some is real and we are able to somehow relate the experience will be meaningless fury road combines the best of acting and craftsmanship its pure powerful and it delivers a visceral punch making the best use of everyone of our senses giving us an experience that feels fresh and visionary miller hasnt copied anyone instead he has set the bar high for many and maybe he will be that inspiration that will give many an idea of what it takes to make an almost perfect film something with much imagination and power something that is quite remarkable considering how hollywood has started cannibalizing its own classics andor surrendering to the desire to just mass produce movies here is a film that proves that its possible to dream even if the images are those who will make you wonder if hell is here on earth,reality
im glad that there are actually people who hated this piece of trash i would even go as far to say that it could possibly be worse than the piece of trash that is called iron man 3 and that is saying something ironically this film alone must have depleted enough of our remaining oil reserves that it will create an exact replica of the world which it depictstom hardy does a poor rendition of the antihero even jeanclaude van damme would have done a better job than him in this movie charlize theron is an ok actress but her flaws are exemplified by the lack of character depth in this movie no proper introduction rubbish ending id choose to watch waterworld any day of the week over this piece of trash,reality
the trailer alone  a 2 12minute thrill ride of flying vehicles and fiery skies  screams with visceral images that sear into your brain and suggest that this must be a masculine and muscular cinematic extravaganza typical of the season so what a lovely surprise it was on this lovely day to find that fury road is a fiercely feminist declaration of independence  pure hearted passionate and full of beautifully realized moments of poignancy yes its as badass as youve heard powerful yet fluid gritty yet crisp sublime in the daring originality of its action sequences and flatout gorgeous to watch just when you think that miller as director and cowriter has topped himself with a grand and gripping set piece he goes even more gloriously over the top with the next believe all the hype this movie will melt your face off see it on the biggest screen you can possibly find with the best possible sound because this is a complete sensory experience theres one image that was so vividly gnarly it made me jump out of my seat and grab the shoulder of the friend sitting next to me sorry amy and yet it conveys an underlying humanity in exquisite and convincing ways perhaps this stands out even more because it exists in such an outlandish wasteland fury road is a movie in which men initially seem to dominate but eventually it reveals that its truly about strong women fighting for each other fighting for survival fighting for the future hardy as becomes a passenger both literally and figuratively this is truly charlize therons film as the fearless and unflappable imperator furiosa theron has given us a supreme action heroine for the ages with her shaved head greased face a steam punkinspired mechanical arm and an endless arsenal within the war rig she drives shes an intimidating and resourceful protector theron has shirked her gorgeous looks previously in her oscar winning performance in monster and shes dared to play truly unlikable characters in young adult and snow white and the huntsman here theres a beauty to her ferocity a regalness to her statuesque demeanor and  ultimately  a tenderness and vulnerability which are heartbreaking its no hyperbole to say shes right up there with sigourney weaver in the alien franchise and linda hamilton in the terminator films although the film is told from perspective in the script from miller brendan mccarthy and nico lathouris furiosa is the one whos truly driving the story in myriad ways this isnt really a sequel to the three previous movies  the lowbudget 1979 the hugely influential 2 the road warrior 1981 and the tina turnertastic beyond thunderdome 1985  nor is it a remake you could call it a reboot but that makes it sound reheated fury road fits squarely within the series mythology but its wildly vibrant and a true original former police officer rockatansky is running from his past from both the living and the dead as he says in a low rumbling voiceover from the first richly over saturated images of surveying the unforgiving desert landscape that lies before him  oscarwinner john seale is responsible for the stunning cinematography  his sense of isolation is palpable but this ultimate loner and rebel finds himself an unwitting pawn at the citadel a fortress carved out of the side of a mountain where the grotesque tyrant immortan joe rules completely through a twisted cult of personality in a neat bit of casting the actor playing joe is hugh keaysbyrne who played the villainous motorcycle gang leader the toecutter in the original hes still creepy as hell all these years later in case you were wondering when joes most trusted driver therons furiosa veers off course and goes rogue during a routine run to gas town the chase is on and the imprisoned is right in the thick of it hes strapped to the grill of a car driven by the jackedup and thoroughly unstable nux nicholas hoult a war boy who foolishly believes his loyalty to the sadistic joe will land him a spot in valhalla shaved and painted a blinding white like the rest of joes minions the usually handsome hoult is a frightening sight to behold but his appearance also suggests an innocence  an infancy almost  which makes him an unexpectedly sympathetic figure lesley vanderwalt was in charge of the inspired hair and makeup design meanwhile oscar winner and multiple nominee jenny beavan provided the artfully roughhewn costume design which couldnt be farther away from the clothes she made her name on in classic merchant ivory films like a room with a view and howards end actually calling what nux is driving a car suggests something youve seen before these are the remnants of society slapped together and souped up for survival in dystopia muscle cars on top of tanks vintage cars on top of oil rigs and things that look like killer porcupines with wheels underneath them the level of detail is dazzling over and over again and the tactile thrill of practical effects provides great joy and a real connection  especially during blockbuster season when so much of what we see is the product of glossy cgi and thats basically the entire plot one big long chase across the desert what happens along the way is awesome frightening deeply strange and darkly funny but its never less than jawdropping and its constantly surprising a sequence that takes place entirely within a wall of swirling dirt and piercing lighting will leave you breathless a quieter moment amid barren trees and blue moonlight provides an unshakable melancholy the score from tom holkenborg aka junkie xl provides just the right tone each time propulsive here introspective there,reality
at the small cinema i went the popcorn sold really fast and i was told to come back for it when it was ready few minutes after the movie starts it was the middle of the movie already and i couldnt stay away from the continuous action from this great movieall the details of the vehicles the impeccable sets and awesomely introduced characters with perfect costumes and accessories were keeping my eyes stuck to the screenat this point i decided that no popcorn in the world would drag me out of the visual festival that captivated my attentionimpeccable action movie great writing great effects,reality
holy this was a pure joy to watch it was entertaining from beginning to end with its craziness and i think this movie just set a new milestone in the action moviegenre unbelievable stunts cool cars great sound and image quality great wide shots not in your face shaky shots and a great soundtracktom hardy had really big shoes to fill after mel gibson but i think he succeed big time the big star in this movie however was furiosa played by charlize theron i think we must go back to alien and ripley to find an equally bad ass woman character1010,reality
i will make this short no spoilers for the people that are a bit on the fence about the movie it is completely different than all the action movies of the last couple of years is it a good thing yes because it does it differently in all the right ways the movie rides a fine line between extremes gritty action sequences with very good humor a desolated waste land with the beauty of the wives action from start to finish but with well placed and extremely well timed character development sequences and all of this is accompanied by a cool soundtrack literally the movie feels like it was in the works for 15 years which from what i read it actually was nothing is rushed and every detail is well taken into accounta beauty of a film  hands down,reality
a game cinematic or a visual show but not a good movie like a very long movie trailer with lots of explosions and action  and then more explosions fighting and action  you can feel like watching somebody playing a 2 hour arcade videogametheres no anywhere the plot and the story are too basic but who needs more this days it looks that you cant make a good movie that make people use their brains 1even classic action movies had twists and keep you interested in the story but even a new movie has to be so basicpeople is used to this kind of movies and see them as normal sadly go and watch a car crash show alive and you will have a better time,reality
the story line is nonexistent as in so many blockbuster movies todayits all explosions and fast and over styled cars it starts of with some guy you have no inkling about who is being capturedthan he escapes and while hes on the run in the capturers compound he has hallucinations about what i think is supposed to be the boy with the boomerang from the original road warriorand the old man than he gets captured againthan theres a scene with the main bad guy involving waterwhich i didnt quite grasp the point off followed by endless car chases and a really poorly choreographed hand to hand fightbetween charlize and tom hardy and some white dude that looks like a cross between a zombie and a vampire the problem with the movie isby the time all this has happened you are almost halfway into the filmand yet you dont really care about any of the characters theres nothing there that give you any basis to root or care for any of themthe story line that makes you loose yourself into the movie just isnt there the whole plot with fuel being scarce is gonethere seem to be plenty off it considering all the cars they use in this movie i get the impression water is the thing that is sparse here but you get no real indication of itso it comes off more as a subploti think the main story is suppose to be charlize saving some models from being babymakers for the main bad guy but that part drown in the endless car crashes and explosionsthe acting is way below subpar tooand thats goes for all of the cast theres also something with a silver spray to the mouth that you dont get explained eitheror maybe it passed me by,reality
last night was playing in the cinema and i thought maybe ill regret not seeing it on the big screen how wrong can a person beabsence of plot cringe worthy oneliners awful acting continuity errors such a awful filmhow can all of ye rate it so highly like this film was so badnot profound enough to be thought provoking or silly enough to be funny and mm had a wee beak of a mouth an incredibly old mel gibson would have been the jobeven though there was the benefits of watching hot girls motorbikes and engines it was still terrible dont waste your money on watching it i wouldnt even waste my time streaming it or even pirate baying it it was really that bad,reality
rule number 22 from the ultmate rules of film criticism dont worry if you cant find the book  i only printed 7 copies says quite clearly where there is an attempt to reimagine or recreate a classic and the attempt is made by the creator of the original no blame shall accrue if the new effort is of less quality than the original so as i critic i am a little hamstrung by that rule and wish i had never written iti saw the original in a theatre which sort of dates me and i remember mel gibson when he was the next big thing which definitely dates me and i had always respected miller for going from the end of the world to talking pigs without even pausing to catch his breathbut for this film george and i have a problem as indeed i would have with anyone who gives this film a 10 and wonders why they are always getting carded when they try to order alcoholthe original was an attempt to impose humanistic values on a postapocalyptic world it had characters plot dialog acting common sense and a bunch of other things that most of us used to take for granted before the arrival of this filmif you want nonstop action go to a hockey gameif you want to see what happens when one man has many wives go to utahif you want great special effects watch the matrix series againif you want to see a fine film built around a tough hero watch chronicles of riddick which really is a 10 i do not overstate my case when i say that if we reach a postapocalyptic world in my lifetime it will be because of the people whose sense of values considered this film to be high artthis is a very scary film not because of what is in it simply because it exists,reality
i cant believe this movie is got high ratings on virtually every movie rating body its just plain boring right from the start with meaningless explosions to get the crowd think they are enjoying a movie i couldnt care if the whole characters died in the movie nothing was just believable they tried so hard to make you feel for the characters with stupid sound tracks to try to trick us a scene is touching i bet the only audience that would enjoy this are blackdeath metal fans not to say metal fans are unintelligent but they may be the only ones to find it interestingits a total waste of 2hrs take a nap watch a street fight i promise youll feel better,reality
we were looking forward to this one and even kicked out the few extra bucks to see it in 3d what a waste the 3d wasnt really utilized in any way shape or form it was just a shameless upsell for something that wasnt there that was just the beginningas far as the actual movie i went in psyched to see it and ended up trying to stay awake through it for an hour i finally gave up and did a 10 min nap wifey woke me up i thought she was asleep too so i actually did stay awake for the big finale not because it was good more like because at that point i was enraged that anyone could make a movie so badly this was the biggest waste of 2 hours of my lifezero character development kept reminding me of robin following around batman ie the real protagonist of the film ine thats not the characters real name but nobody really cares anyway was no doubt the protagonist was her loyal sidekick god it was lamethe plot was not even present i didnt really follow the whole blood transfusion woman milking bullet farming wtf its not like they really invested any time explaining anything they had too many cars to blow up and thats way more important than telling a storyi tried and tried to find something anything likable about this movie why should i give it a 2 over a 1 where is that extra digit coming from well there isnt an extra digit because i couldnt find one redeeming quality about ineit was just a full blown rip off a miserable failure on every level there wasnt one scene character piece of dialogue stunt or anything that sticks out in my mind as being memorableworst movie of the year by faranother reheated turd to lump on the pile of other reheated turd remakes,reality
i saw the original on vhs around 1983 i was 12 and it affected me profoundly the portrayal of familiar civilization in slow decline humans already descended into chaos and of course the last of the v8 interceptorsthe road warrior took me further to a world where surviving each day was the best you could hope for but for what to spend another day hunted and haunted by a world forever lost but still there was speed the pulse of the v8 the tarmac winding on into nothingi didnt love thunderdome no car no pavement and perhaps a too uncomfortable insight into where humanity might be headedand then i waited 30 years for this film fury roadits hard to not get caught up in the hype when youve waited so long for more of a story that captured your imagination as a child george miller leaves alone and lost at the end of each of the three earlier movies and so you wait hoping there will be some peace for him or that at the very least he will continue to survivefury road is not truly a continuation it is more of a distillation of the elements that defined the earlier movies spiked with the magic available to the modern movie maker miller seems to be a fan of his own earlier work such is his understanding of the essential appeal of ordealthis movie then is not a redux nor is it a hybrid of previous pictures more it is an evolution an elegant simplification and a beautiful terrible translation of simple desire horror and hope into moving picturesdont wait for downtime in your two hours on fury road there is no respite from the constant raw inundation of incredible imagery the viewer is thrown as though a passenger in one of the films insane wonderful vehicles from scenes of brutal mechanical destruction to vistas of such grandeur menace and beauty that you find yourself wishing a longer moment to absorb before the next overdose of visual stimuli presents itselfthere is dialogue but i suspect you could watch the movie with the volume turned down and cranked speed metal in its place and not find yourself missing the point and the point in question is this we are creatures that are wired to survive and hope is an emotional manifestation of some vital genetic imperative that brought humanity down from the trees and into speeding metal vehicles but we also have an element of our nature that makes less sense a fascination with chaos with smashing burning bleeding destruction fury road will trick you into having hope and then reward you with chaos and chaos and chaoswhy 10 out of 10 i nearly dropped it to a 9 because of a few seconds of jaws 3desque visual buffoonery youll know the moment when you reach it but everything else was so good such unbridled spectacular colourful murderous fun fans must love it newcomers will perhaps recoil at first but will surely be seducedi suspect it will reward frequent rewatching i aim to find out,reality
this isnt a film its a road trip film that focuses heavily on charlize therons character furiousa appears essentially as a tag along side character he does nothing risqu or extreme and has little more than 5 lines throughout the first two thirds of the film you could literally replace the character of with any other supporting actor and it would not change the film in fact this film feels as though it was intended to be a styled film called furious furiousa and they wanted to cash in on the franchise and avoid being accused of ripping off actual filmswhat this is is a piece of pro feminism garbage and one like most that completely misses the point of what gender equality is really about all male characters arguably with the exception of the 2 defectors are portrayed as violent oppressive warmongers all clan leaders and all warriors are male and violentthe women are the oppressed baby makers and between them theron and a rag tag female only clan of pensioners its only them who can bring about justice and save the planetstrong female characters are fine and this worked for the first hour or so until they really forced the feminist angle a strong female or male black asian gay for that matter character should not be noticeable a film with a solid minority lead stands out as great film making not because they use a minority but because the minority character works without you consciously noticing it alien tomb raider flight plan silence of the lambs texas chainsaw massacre kill bill the wizard of oz all fantastic films without forcing gender bias on the audience no one watches rush hour and thinks hey wheres the white guybut this film doesnt just lose points for that no on the film itself it is competently shot crisp sharp and well produced however the cgi can look clearly false this could be intentional and there is little to absolute zero character development  i could name maybe 4 characters and 2 of those were because i looked up the cast listing whilst watchingas a whole the film comes across as a two hour car chase finale very little happens outside of the vehicle and this leads to a monotonous viewing experience with a less than impressive final acti watch many films time and again i would not watch fury road again,reality
i saw around a month and a half ago went in expecting something considering tom hardy is in it wasnt expecting a lot though as it is after all and a story within such a movie is hard to find i didnt love any of the films but the first was interestingalmost the moment it started i hated the movie the only thing good was the intro i was trying to find a story who everyone was what was supposed to be happening nothing is explained as if the movie was supposed to continue directly from a previous film it doesnt though it just throws in characters to give there a point for those characters to be killed isnt at all nothing like mel gibsonall i got out of it was there was an evil ruler only giving people water the odd time yet they are alive somehow he sends out to trade fuel they bugger off and finds his way into the situation they go only so far fighting off guys on poles and a flaming guitar dude who is apparently aiding the situation with a guitar they find the other women turn back and kill the bad guys in the process and give everyone the water i honestly dont remember the names of anyone there was nothing at all memorable about any of the characters it could have been captain ahab riding around on moby dick in the desert for all i care any story could have been made into 20 minutes get the truck breaks free and fight everyone right in that one area instead of driving to timbuktu for over an hour of the film and then turning around in another hour or however long it was clearly if they were able to kill everyone with only a few people and a armored truck they didnt need to drive around to do so,reality
first of all i must say that ive had the pleasure to see the first 3 movies i know that this  fury road was not meant to be neither a prequel nor a sequel of the original ones so i write this review with that in mind summarizing my opinion this movie was dreadful so bad that i couldnt believe it was the same movie that got me so psyched when i saw the trailer last year its a non stop of crazy cars explosions and cgi supported stunts that will definitely please those that like cars and action movies but whose plot makes no sense at all now i could be here telling you about the visions that has from beginning until the end which lacks explaining or about the fact that they begin a journey from a to b just to find out they must return to a but if they had stayed there all along the movie would be 7 minutes long or even to the fact that they meet a bunch of women that live in the middle of nowhere but surprisingly one of them was waiting barenaked on top of an electric pole waiting for whoever would ever turn there if it took 5 minutes or 200 years instead ill only complaint that apart from the fast driving and explosion filled footage this has no story at all the quest begins with a purpose but that purpose is faulty and character is relutant to join any group but quickly changes his mind hes rogue but hes nice furiosa is a powerful woman but is eager to accept that man she knows nothing of to join their getaway posse its all so senseless that almost made me cry build some hot rods add some blasts create some funky looking characters and forget any story because we have a movie oh and could someone tell me what the f are some guys doing playing drums and a guitar that shoots fire in the middle of a high speed pursuit i mean i know its badass but come on,reality
george millers original films might have broken too much ground since every other barren landscape within a postapocalyptic action vehicle is compared to the source  and heres a reboot by the man himself perhaps bringing something fresh to the dilapidated tablewell the action scenes are done all right and the direction is quick and tense but the characters including himself cursed with sudden flashbacks to partially explain his brutelike mannerisms and charlize therons imperator furiosa equally bad ass and a far better driver are about as important as avatars controlled on a noisy video gamethe score seems intentionally melodramatic encapsulating a grandiose old school epic vibe trying way too hard for genuine cult status  treating our heroes like theyve earned their thick skin without being fleshed out beyond cool weaponry and nostalgic roots  fury road actually feels more like a second film following a proper introduction meanwhile the tyrannical main villain looks straight out of a heman cartoon and the only hint of a plot evolves around beautiful slaves being protected from his banal wrathtechnically a road is a particular section of a larger area that takes you down one specific lane but fury has too much open space where everything is going on while absolutely nothing happens back and forth in either direction,reality
remember the big finale of 2 titled the road warrior in the us where the tanker is chased across the desert basically the first half of fury road is that chase on steroidsi made it 56 minutes into the film before deciding enough was enough and giving upnow im a huge fan of the first two films with the third beyond thunderdome being the one i can take or leave but the complete lack of depth and substance in fury road manages in comparison to make thunderdome look like a shakespearean epic in fact after suffering fury road my level of appreciation for thunderdome has rocketed skywardsin a nutshell if the only parts you liked of the previous films were the chase scenes fury road will be the ultimate treatfury road is gloriously filmed that much is positive but as part of the canon or even as a film with a worthwhile story told in an engaging fashion its a dead fish sprinkled with glitterputting aside the obvious financial benefits of the brand i honestly can not figure out why this film was madei wish imdb offered the option for minusstar reviews,reality
this film has received very positive receptions from critics this i find quite baffling why so because this film follows basically the same approach that michael bays films do it minimizes dialogue plot characterization and imizes action special effects etc in order to be able to appeal to a broader international audience primarily in asia unfortunately for this film unlike the transformers who will have some cultural clout in asian markets i do not expect this approach will work as well as they hoped it wouldin addition to stripping this film down to the bare minimum of dialogue the bare minimum of plot almost no lines an essentially supporting role for who cant even get his accent right or consistent or deliver any lines in anything like a sensible way this film tries to resurrect its ability to recoup its budget by appealing to the political left and its intolerance of anyone saying anything negative about whatever its sacred cow might be at the momentunfortunately this film isnt actually political if this film were in fact a deep political statement about feminism communism racism the environment or really about any kind of left wing political perspective whatsoever in any kind of thought through coherent way it would be an infinitely superior film but it isnt it depicts men as brutal beastly vicious and often unnecessary or hindrances but this is not a political statement there are some shocking visuals the milk scenes the attempted baby extraction some scenes of women being aggressive violent or being subjects of the same but this does not amount to a feminist filmhowever by marketing this film as a feminist film it becomes the duty of any good left wing hack on the internet to defend it because since the film depicts or claims to depict or is claimed to depict left wing values to criticize it in any way would be to concede the baselessness of their views or to lose face or something honestly i have no way why anyone gets as vehement about politics as these people do this includes the reverse type conservative lunatics charlize theron is the star of this film and had she been given more to work with she could have done great things with it unfortunately the script which i have heard was depicted in a series of pictures and only later transferred from these images to a written form has nothing for anyone even someone as talented as theron to work with because special effects are essentially a given with a budget the size miller was working with and further these special effects were not put to any use to convey a story principle politics or really well anything it follows that i have no regard for them art in order to be art must have a message do not be fooled this film has none the emperor has no clothesbecause of this total poverty of story you might even argue that this film is covertly a conservative film it strips down the art of filmmaking to simply reproducible factors special effects targeted at certain markets the american left international markets for limited or no english and it uses the media as a tool of propaganda to disguise its only real aim point purpose or raison dtre to make money to further the global capitalist agenda marketed for liberals made for the benefit of neocons now with 95 less fury road now with 95 more road less story less fattening buy now,reality
as a fan of the original three movies ive been eagerly awaiting this movie for a long time i knew from the first few scenes i was going to be trapped for two hours in a world that summarizes modern day action movies this movie should be called charlie because ms theron dominates most of the screen for this movie you might like this movie ifyou dont enjoy depth in plot or character development or learning the names of half of the characters you wear flatbilled hats and sag with skinny jeans are a 12 year old boy you think that transformers is the greatest movie of all time you like looking a computer generated effects for 120 minutes have never seen the original movies and all of the above,reality
i almost never write a review but i have to since the rating for this movie is 84 really i am guessing it is the children who are rating this movie spoiler alert the first half of the movie is a bunch of people are running away in search of paradise needless to say there is constant fighting along the way then they realize paradise is where they were before so they decide to go back you guessed it all the same fighting now done in reverse i just told you the whole story as the story is extremely shorti realize its just a movie but how do you drive in the desert for days and days without ever refueling if the entire planet is a desert wasteland then where does the food come from which is probably why you dont see them eating ever other than an occasional bug or lizard but they all look well fed and with well saloon quality hair stylesthe character had virtually no lines presumably producers do not have much faith in his actingi wasted two hours watching this sorry excuse for a movie,reality
i never care to write reviews and i am wasting my time writing a review coz this shty movie wasted my money and it has 89 rotten tomatoes rating who the fk is messed up enough to not rate this anything but 10 out of 10 yes i gave this movie a negative rating  its that bad fked up story utter irrationality and bhiti dont have words for this reviewi guess something was good the pop corn that i didnt have at the theatrehalf way thererest of the half just breezing through the review kinda like this terrible movieall i can say is dont waste you 230 hours life in this shitty movie it leads right back where it started with a nonsensical end and yes i missspelled the words on purposeridiculous,reality
this movie loses me from the very beginning the flamboyant costumes and ridiculous story line just leave me confused and annoyed why would they be dressed like eddie izzard at a pride parade i dont get it and i cant get over it the creepiness of the costumes and the complete lack of a commonsensical story makes it unwatchableif you can get past the ridiculous story characters and costumes there is a general formula in the action bad guys get close to good guysthen something bad happens to them and they are no longer close its about the most mind numbing action movie ever created the bad guys have all these blown v8s but they cant catch a 5 ton truck pulling multiple trailers they have weapons but none which can disable a big rig in summary if you can suspend disbelief and not question why dont they do this why dont they do that i commend you for those of us with half a brain this movie is total garbage,reality
and itd still be incredibly bad and meaninglessthis movie takes place in a postapocalyptic desert landscape and begins with some people fighting over petrol i believe while driving  or driving while fighting i forgot which one it was then after some 30 minutes the first proper dialogue begins and this dialoguefrequency is maintained throughout the movie in between the dialogues said people eventually turn around and drive back to where they came from while still trying to kill each other there is also a guy standing on top one of the cars playing a flame throwing electric guitarthe end,reality
the cars and costumes and whatever are pretty cool its fun looking at all that for about five minutes or maybe ten if you try really hard the stuff about resources makes little sense and is not introduced in a way which creates any sort of plot or dramatic tension to care about the characters are twodimensional and the very limited script is so poor that its actually embarrassing when the actors mumble or shout their lines which are often fairly incomprehensible anyway since its consequently impossible to care about anyone in the film or what theyre doing lets drive all the way to some remote place for no apparent reason then turn around and go all the way back again for no apparent reason  wow the action just becomes a tedious parade of inconsequential noise and flashing lights as another reviewer on here said its like someone took the action sequence at the end of 2 threw away all the stuff before it which actually explained what was happening and why you should care about it then just stretched it out for two hours thats all it is  a very very very long action sequence utterly mindnumbing id have walked out after an hour or sooner if i hadnt been there with a friend the irony is that it turned out afterwards he was feeling the same way about it and if wed both known then we could have left and spent an hour doing something interesting instead of watching the second tedious half of this rubbish there are a thousand silly b movies which are infinitely more enjoyable than this its boring miserable and exhausting theres no chemistry between characters no humour no spark of any kind its just mindless noisy spectacle which goes on far too long shame they turned it into a film it would have made a superb fiveminute pop videoall the reviewers whove been hyping this up as something amazing should be utterly ashamed of themselves im really quite angry at having been so misled into spending money on it,reality
if your going to see a film you would expect the storyline your about to watch be something close to a man with a car alone in the world surviving against all odds biker gangs trying to find gas and food without any law in sight this movie was about a truck and a few sex slaves in duress i expected to be training others or another story of heroism instead im left to watch a movie that really doesnt tie into the storyline i came to see the lone wolf not a joker wannabe with a harem what where you thinking guys i dont know if it was to hard to have a good end days action film for this director but i hope he feels that this time he has failed to keep an epic movie series alive i wouldnt pay to go to another for sure,reality
movie is full of flawsto begin with the action scenes are just bursting down other truckcars and gun shoots in which the enemy hardly score a shot but the heroes does it in every shot talk about practicality no strategy at all i would have expected some strategy to trap and outsmart the enemy but it just chasing and defending the whole timethe story on top of it is bull sh absolute nonsenselogic was totally destroyed when the pregnant girl pulled out the stunt to climb out of war truck after her water broke and gun shot on her leg i mean common u idiots dont u watch your own movie after making it y waste your and our time with this full of crapy the hell it has so high rating the documentary on world war 12 was 1000 times better than thisdont watch this movie just save your time,reality
say no more say no morenudge nudgeyou know what i mean you know what i meanthe wives lensed through a feminist perspective more like fetishist softcore pornography all wet with the good old water hose of many a soap and car wash porn seqmore like dumb and dumber not tom hardys fault though  he had a numbnut of a director nondirecting himgeorge miller is a clown pulling the wool over everyones eyes make it cool or ill kill you thats what director george miller told colin gibson the production designer hummmmm doesnt get any more superficial than that georgie boy i could never imagine a director like ridley scott telling his production designer that  say on a film like blade runner etcin fact fury road as well as beyond thunderdrome  really feels like boy george was in the directors chairbyron kennedy oh how you must be turning in your grave,reality
ok first let me comment on the original trilogy was decent road warrior was amazing thunderdome sucked now to fury road omg was this movie horrible its not worth even your time to see it let alone your money it makes thunderdome look like a work of geniusnow many people have complained about the obvious feminist pandering in this film however this movie is horrible even without addressing the kitsch feminist schlock for exampleepic failures 1 they kill off the v8 interceptor in the first scene of the movie what why no reason just so that can be conveniently captured2 some warboy converts the v8 interceptor into his car and then kamikazes inside of it at the end of the movie thats all we get of the iconic car wow3 cant shoot handing a sniperrifle to a one armed woman why not have usain bolt let a onelegged pirate sprint for him run blackbeard run4 immortan joe basically a cheap mestizo rip off of bane darth vader and of course the far more interesting lord humungus5 eating lizards rearry6 prosthetic arm who are you furiosa skywalker7 way too much cgi and unrealistic explosions8 why is the sidekick in a movie called 9 this is a nuclear apocalypse why does everyone have machine guns and gasoline but no water consistency bro it matters10 warrior grannies what11 naked tower woman who somehow manages to escape sunburn oh and they cover up her breasts with her hair way to suck out any sexual stimulation at all 12 zero meaningful character development 13 boring14 all the toadies who will inevitably defend this movie what a puny plan its garbage just like the dark knight rises15 never actually shoots his iconic shotgun furiosa just bitch slaps his beta ass around with it16 fat girl breast milk hoses why i can never unsee that its not even good in a bbw porn kind of way17 guzzoline shut your whore mouthconclusion just walk away and there will be an end to the horror just walk away,reality
omg this just was so badjust so bad there is no story at all nor is there any good acting and it looks fake as hell it felt like i watched a video game and the player got stuck in the same stupid level the whole plot repeated itself continuously truck get attacked engine gives up engine gets repaired and again just so boring and so bad i started watching with my brother and sister my sister walked out when she saw this weird rockstar on a truck joining the war my brother walked out a few minutes later i thought to give it a shot till end because of the good reviews here well i can tell that it was such a bad decision if you dont want to waste your time i definitely do not recommend this movie,reality
i went to this movie with my daughter 15 and we both walked out of there convinced this is one of the worse movies wed seen in years save your money and go see anything elsegiven the disparity of years culture values etc it is a bit surprising that one of us didnt like this movie even just a little in fact the only reason this doesnt get a zero stars is that well there is no zeros available and some of the cars were kinda cool everything else the crappy predicable acting the crappy predictable storyline the crappy predictable and sophmoronic writing was crappy predictable and sometimes sophmoronic yes i did just make that word up this is a movie that suffered from too much money 140 million budget i read elsewhere they must have used it on the cars too much ambition i also read that one of the ambitions was to make it more feminist a la the vagina dialogues writers and too little imagination halfway through i started rooting for the bad guys as they seemed the only hope for ending this thingso the problem this film had was mundaneness i didnt think hardys character was heroic or very interesting so i didnt care much about his fate i thought therons character was supposed to be dark except that she only seemed to be broken maybe as much as hardys this left the movie without a real lead which is ok if there is an ensemble cast with multiple story linesbut this wasnt that it was just one long car chase into the dessert and then turn around and go back making the bad guys a bunch of weak suicidal wannabe vikings didnt add a lot dimension to the plot either and turning their leaders into caricatures might have appealed to the antitough crowd that likes to make tough guys kinda clownish and seriously flawed but it didnt help the storyline much oh wait what storyline so if you have extra money that you want to donate to an unworthy cause buy a ticket and send a message that this is good enough to pay for if your ac is out and you need a cool place to hide and this is the only thing playing spend a couple of hours in the back where you can catch a few zzzzzzzzs the avengers show was so full that we couldnt find two seats together so we went to this instead where there was plenty of room that makes it our fault for not getting to the theatre earlier and lesson learned nobody should go through that kind of thing twice,reality
this movie felt like it was a sequel to a first film starring tom hardy that initially set up the character and the world he survives in other than quick narration and flashbacks thus the bombardment of nonstop action would make more sense in a sequel than a reboot of a franchise from a really long time ago that some people halfremember and others dont know of at alland charlize theron would be the one character brought into the sequel to make it different from the original where hardy was the main character thus fury road felt like a cannonball flying without the fuse ever being lit playing out like a sequel of itself more than a reboot of something elseoriginal franchise director george miller took this rebooted world seriously a video game meshed into a melodramatic graphic novel where anything goes so therefore audiences got into the sheer craziness and epic style road rage there just wasnt anything behind all the noise but more and more noise,reality
before watching this movie i had quite some expectations because of the high rating and the positive reviews that i read after seeing it myself i can say i am very very disappointed what has happened with hollywood this is a film with nonstop action and a story that could be thought of be a 5 year oldthere are quite some roles that add nothing to the story like a crazy guy playing a guitar with flames and the son of the leader which has about 3 lines and does not deliver on any of them then there is this interesting endless gasoline which only seems to run out for the cliff keepers on bikes since they seem to need an extra tank desperately the rest of all the vehicles seem to be able to travel the whole movie without any refills quite oddi think it is always nice to see rosie in a movie ex victoria secret model she just looks amazing but the way she suddenly dies after not to long does not grip me either then there is tom hardy ive seen better work from him but i think it is mainly because he does not get the right tools to work with in this film if he would have a better story he might perform betteri still gave 4 stars because i dont want dont burn down tom hardy completely and the graphics i must say they are very nicely donethis is such a typical hollywood story that i dont understand why people liked it this much i mean is this really what most film are going to be like a ridiculous story with nice graphicswould be nice if hollywood takes a closer look at how christopher nolan makes his movies he creates things that want to make you go to the cinema this movie only want to make me watch more tv shows instead of movies,reality
so for one this movie was crap zero character development terrible dialogue and just plain boring at timescomparable to war of the worlds with tom cruise the entire movie is just a long car chase and at the end its just kind of over with no real ending to sum it up car chase 2 min break car chase 2 min break car chase repeat boringthe only reason it is not a 1 star is because i didnt feel it deserved to be lumped into the same group as the worst movies out there because it did have some good qualities for instance the setting was beautifuland the chicks were pretty hot but super spoilerthe hottest one dies right away so its like whats the point after thatall in all if your 12 and you like stupid weapons metal hot chicks no hint of substance and cheesy explosions this movie is for youif not you will be easily bored watch the first half and youve pretty much seen the second,reality
this is all my own opinion and it will contain spoilers since last week my brother older than me has been nagging about how much he would like to see the film the trailer itself as a video ad did not get any attention and got skipped as soon as possible i knew it was not worth it yet we eventually went to see it as we did not have anything else to do from playing around with umbilical cords of a dead woman and a now dead baby to the creepy deformed talking pile of flesh that i think was supposed to resemble a child yet had a beard this fkfest had it all using 150 million dollars to show what the world would be like without water seems rather excessive not only that how about we add every single dumb idea that comes into mind and call it a film including killing grannies shooting bullets at the eyes of grannies having a human as a blood bank connected to the driver of the car and my personal favorite driving over a pregnant woman then slicing the woman open to check if the baby is all right dont get me wrong the scenery was wonderful especially the canyons but all of it is completely destroyed by the modernization of a film that had none of the brilliant ideas that were described earlier the cast have also made a significant change in the good way as they played their role perfectly but that was not enough to cover up the tornado of horrible horrible ideas thrown into the film in general this film is a typical hollywood production with a completely ruined sense of entertainment and if no one is going to say it it will only get worse by all means if you want to throw your money into a puddle hah get it go see the film if you actually value your time go and spend some time researching actual problems about droughts and everything instead of wasting it watching people getting trampled over by cars,reality
this movie is an utter garbage nothing about art nothing about acting nothing about a decent plot and nothing about logic the fact that it is being liked by younger audience is a solid proof how pathetic film watchers have become and crashing a few fancy toys in an absolutely lunatic way is enough to make people bite their ears and go cooooooolllllll as years go by i am simply disgusted how a great audience of adult children were formed how film makers are abusing and farming this heads on and there arent simply enough people with brains left to form a decent population to show that this wont work or it isnt right there was a time in past where film makers felt the responsibility of educating and leading the people not farming them like a herd of cattle,reality

i dont understand folks 5 star reviews galore and why i barely give this 1 out of 10 im giving it 1 for all the hard work which went into it because it shows but im sorry this is an awful relentless flawed with nonsense film ive seen in a very very long time i really liked 1 but not 2 so that probably answers some of the mystery in itself because this is more like mm2 my wife and i both disliked this film and we almost walked out of the theatre 3 times expecting it to improve at any moment it didnt the makeup looked cheap the story was basic and poor and it wasnt even filmed in australia that is just plain wrong for the saga sorry but i just dont know why this simple and annoying comic book style story received such glowing reviews bizarre,reality
how is this movie even mentioned together with the word oscars at first i thought it was just the movie goers who went crazy and failed to see the true mess that this movie truly was but now im being told that this movie is nominated for 10 oscars is the academy trying to insult viewers as stupid actionscene consumers who dont seek any depth in a movie this one page script has no depth at all and consists of just two scenes a bunch of vehicles going from location a to location b while fighting each other you know what happens when they get to location b they decide to go back to location a immediately and so the second half of the movie starts which is again just a bunch of vehicles moving in the same direction while fighting each other am i the only one who sees this movie as the insulting actionpacked thing that it is did i miss something in this movie how is it nominated for best director even further best picture its not that is its the committee and the viewers but on the other hand i do give my respects to the producer who managed to make 3758 million usd out of this crap if you can sell this man i would go into any business with you even if it is just selling pieces of wood you are a genius man,reality
before watching this movie i had been told that there was very little in the way of story or characters in this movie and that the main draw of the film was the action scenes i found that limited the potential of the movie so that at best it would be ok however the low expectations i had were gravely disappointed the story was non existent and the character were more like caricatures so that left only the action to make it an okish movie if the action was really superb but even that disappointed me the action felt both too fast and too long from the very first action scene i thought that my computer was playing the movie at a quickened pace but nope the action is portrayed in a slightly sped up manner the stylization of the action scenes was boring besides some lovely colourscheming and the cool vehicles look like what a 6 year old would want out of a movie so in summary no characters no plot too much rushed action and not enough cool one of the worst films ive seen recently,reality
initially i didnt want to see this movie but it got such rave reviews i changed my mind i saw thunderdome 30 years ago and i was unimpressed perhaps that underlies the problem this is a movie for those who know and love the genrei dont know anything about the back story it takes place in a postapocalyptic dystopia where water has become so precious that you resent it the population of survivors have all evolved to a point of no longer needing hydrationcars and trucks are vital however and its important when driving really fast to have a blind guitarist play heavy metal music from a flame throwing instrument while chasing other carsat the start of the movie the main character furiosa is tasked to drive to another city to steal gasoline half way there she suddenly turns east because she wants to take five girls to a green place she once saw as a child there is a chase and a sandstorm after which the five girls find it imperative to wash themselves off in the middle of the desert with a whole bunch of water the guy with a rake for a face resents this and points a gun at themthere is a fight and suddenly the bald crazy guy who is chained to to the other guy giving him blood suddenly switches sides because he sees a pretty girl with red hairmore fast driving getting stuck and then unstuck and then realizing that a motorcycle actually can ride for a 160 days without refuelling but then instead deciding to go back to exactly where the movie started again as fast as they left with more explosions and fast drivingthen the main character appears to be mortally wounded so the blood bag offers the most cathartic and poignant dialogue of the entire movie when he says my name is seriously luckily postapocalyptic survivors have also developed kick ass immune systems as whole blood transfusions with dirty needles and used tubing apparently dont cause fatal sepsis but instead return you to lifewhat the actual  i have no idea what this movie was about or was supposed to be about there is absolutely no story or character development the film presupposes and actually requires that you are familiar with the previous films despite the fact that the last one was 30 years ago and some of us may not have seen iti wanted to like this film i just cant currently its rated 23 on the all time list and i just cant let that stand without a review,reality
do yourself a huge favor go watch the first 1015 mins of the road warrior after the narrator part and think about what makes it so compelling ill give you a big hint its because they used to actually practice the craft of storytelling in movies instead of just special effects after just 15 mins of the road warrior you know all you need to know to be completely hooked into the story more importantly we meet and through just a few scenes we get to know both as the requisite underdog badass character but also as a man with compassion in his heart witness the bond with his dog or the music box that he gives to the little kid when we know characters in this way we care about them we identify with them we root for them we love them and become completely immersed in their world thats what makes a good movie no amount of special effects explosions or hot chicks in skimpy outfits can supplant that simple fact and thats the big problem with fury road the characters are onedimensional cardboard cutouts that we dont care about after watching the first 20 mins of this steaming pile of crap i still didnt know who any of the main characters really were and i certainly didnt care if they lived or died yes it has gorgeous action sequences cool weapons and explosions oh my but its completely bereft of anything that draws you in emotionally and that makes it a huge failure add to that a story arc that doesnt make a helluva lot of sense and a baffling disregard for the value of oil they waste it with abandon even though its scarcity is why they are fighting in the first place unfortunately blockbusters like this are increasingly becoming the norm from hollywood i fear well get to a point in the not so distant future where nobody even remembers what a good action movie is like,reality
if you want to know what hell is like then watch this filmits a two hour action film with a pointless and meaningless story it was actually painful to watch because it was so relentless in its attempt to shock and freak out the audience to sum up the film its a 2 hour car chase with boring characters its predictable and ridiculous at times i found myself laughing at certain points the quote at the end was as laughable as the film itself i actually laughed after leaving the cinema because i was in shock over what id just witnessedi have no idea why this film is so highly rated the art of story telling and movie making seems to be slowly dying a death,reality
the trilogy was amazing and thunderdome was a masterpiece compared to this one nothing in it is memorable characters are not developed at all they just exist the universe is stale and absurdly useless defies logic in a numbing manner mostly action low quality one and what a shocker certain secondary good characters die in stupid ways felt like they had more depth than the main ones hardy was on crack vacation charlize has faded and i do not want to see her again there is also a forced scene of emotional garbage when the music tried to make the viewer more like targeting retarded audience feel some empathy it achieved the exact opposite apathy boredom disgust insult thankfully it partially erased this moment with the next action moments or did it by the end of it you wish you did not waste so much life time on this film explosions and sand and some driving and i already forgot if you want to see then remember mel gibson in any or all those three performances otherwise you do not miss a thing trust me the promo is all youll ever need,reality
i liked 1 i loved 2 left me cold and fury road was just an amalgamation of all previous versions high speed crazy looking vehicles all chasing the truck that is driving i would have thought that george miller would have come up up with a different approach after so many years but alas it was not to be i give the action sequences and cinematography top marks also the make up department that can make someone as beautiful as charlize theron look so ordinary i have to write a few more words to comply with the 10 line rule that imdb has issued ill try this now no still not enough one more thing id like to say is that to me mel gibson will always be the real ,reality
i regret going to see this it is in my opinion the worst film i have ever seen in my life the only reason it has one out of ten is that imdb wouldnt let me rate it as zeroi have no idea how this managed to get 87 out of ten i find this rating a disappointing indictment of mankindthe film starts off quite well but runs out of ideas fast  or rather it has lots of ideas but each seems to be a clich  and ones which are so overused as to be threadbare its almost like someone interviewed 8 to 12 year old boys leaving cinemas over the course of about 1000 films wrote down a list of clichs that the audience found entertaining and then spent all of ten minutes in an attempt to transform the research into a scriptim not sure how much i would have to drink to reach the point where i was able to sustain the level of suspension of disbelief to overlook the many holes and contradictions in the plot but would fear that liver failure would hit me before i reached the required level of inebriationthe phrase scraping the bottom of the barrel doesnt seem to apply here almost all of the characters seem shockingly two dimensional the dialogue is appalling the special effects are good but the overall level of ridiculousness reduces the impact of the stunts to circus levelsome films are so bad they are good this film doesnt seem to make any effort to support the stunts and special effects  and its that lack of effort that makes this film in my humble opinion so bad that its not worth watching on television,reality
this must be worst attempt at doing a remake ever no character definition no plot explanation nothing i dont get me started on the dialogue not only did it not help in establishing plot characters etc but the actors should all go back to acting school and learn how to pronounce their wordsall this movie is is a showcase of prop designers who looked at who could come up with the weirdest post apocalyptic vehicle design oh and dont forget the pyrotechnics without these two elements the movie would have scored zeroto the director writer and producer next time please watch the original movies to understand who and what actually isthis was the biggest waste of 2 hours of my life to this day i still dont know what the producers tried to achieve with this they failed completely and insulted the legacy of ,reality
is minus in this film and gets outplayed easily by charlize theron and i guess the director was so glad to have her that shes by far the most interesting character of this action only flick the story only serves to connect the action sequences which are abundant but after a while you sort of get numb to everything that is displayed before your eyes this becomes even more clear when they turn around and do the whole thing over again stretching the film even longer and adding absolutely nothing it had some interesting ideas but all of that never gets of the ground and the realness is lost because the genuine gritty australian actors of the first 3 installments are replaced by americans who seem to have no connection with the dystopian desert theyre living in also the rough straight up violence is changed to a chinese circus version making everything feel really choreographed and there for fake so you dont feel the tension that was done so well in the original trilogy the cgi dust storm was the point i should have hit the stop button but i was somewhat hoping things would get better when hardy gets freed from the mouthpiece stuck to his facebut sadly it didnttheron brings some weight to this but the other characters are so laughable which made it all just some what painful to watch i simply can not understand that a director who made these masterpieces before now goes out in this way and kills his own creation i strongly suggest his next film should be a parody titled ine blurry road which is the road the writers were on when they wrote this abomination,reality
i am not going to go into this movie much as anyone who takes this movie seriously with that ridiculous car with the guitarist and speakers needs to go and watch the far superior originalthe action sequences are ok but is there a plot other than chase chase chase chase the original bad guys were mean the bad guys in this play guitars this film also provides one of the worst villains everwas all about the car too we got 1 and 34 of movie before his car was destroyed and it did not get even five minutes in this movie i really do not know how this movie is rated so highly on here ive lost 20 and two hours of my life i have had enough of remakes but this movie would have been a lot better following the original,reality
start by saying im a fan of the original trilogy of filmsso i went in to watch this with eager eyes but sadly by the end my neck was sore from shaking it so muchjust terrible on all aspects plotdialoguecgiactionsoundtrack so so badput it this way they could have made the entire film and removed character and still ended up with the same filmhis part in the film wasnt even the lead charlize theron could have solod it with out which is not the worst thing i can think of to say about the story writer for this mess suppose to be a film but tom hardy had no chance with this script how many lines did he even have no character to connect with nothing to make me accept him as replacement for mel gibsons version charlize therons character had it all story and purpose but hardys was basically a passenger along for the ride the whole concept of them escaping then actually escape to then u turn back for a suicide mission so we can have a action packed ending is beyond crap writing the dialogue was terrible an example would be poor giant nathan jones telling me 3 times that theyre trying to use the sand storm to lose themyeah yeah we get it big storm coming and theyre driving towards it hmmm wonder whats going on here duh no need to help sherlockwhy does hollywood writers insist on spelling things out unless they accept that the only people that enjoy this stuff are out theyre minds on drugs like the writers clearlyaction in this mess well yeah the vehicles were inventive ill give them that but theres only so much of them blowing up you can take before you become immune and start going oh yeah there goes another one yawn its way too repetitive especially in a 2 hour movie which is 34s blowing cartrucksbikesbuggys upsoundtrack was well laughablesome of the scenes where theyre trying and failing to set some sense of mood and this music playing hahahait was bad i struggle to even describe it what were they thinkinglike they realised there was no story or connection to the actors so they turned the melodramatic sounds up to 11i have no idea the guitar guy on the truck was fun though abit over the top but yeah he was goodbad guy the main bad dude was erm no ideano idea why he was in charge no idea why he wore a mask no idea what the hell was going on with him just no idea oh and his ending was meh forgettablei generally like post apocalypse type of movies theres been a load made but this is one of the worst b movies are made betterstraight to tv do betterthis has been way too over hyped and people want to like it so they walk out going yeah that was proper crazyloved it but really deep down theyl forget it and probably not watch it againi disliked it so much that if i was offered money to sit through it again i would struggle to accept the cashits a case of what could have been sadlyscript terrible  story terrible  shite movie,reality
like many 1 star rate reviews i just dont understand why people speak so highly of this movie yes good action movie but nothing more than any hollywood commercial movie that with no depth at allspoiler i was really amazed at the first one and half hour some of the pictures are weird yet making me feel beauty and tranquility untildoes the director really had to end the movie with a happy ending to reensure me that this is a hollywood movie i am fine with the movie it is good honestly i just cannot bear people hurray for a superficial story of several heroesheroin save people from the hell how does that have any meaning in depthspoiler it is so funny that reviews suggested this movie is showing feminism really feminism by showing those super model yet weak subordinating wives firuosa is a great character without these burdens but maybe maybe this is really feminism for the hollywood industry huh and nux had to make up his mind to search a life by falling in love with one of the wives so people cannot find the meaning of life by themselves you just have to add clich to a movie which could taking about a greater journey,reality
i am just old enough to remember the original films perhaps i remember them through rose tinted specs but the latest copy pales in comparison it is a 2hr car chase with explosions if thats what you want to see then go see this film for me i considered leaving the cinema there is very little in character back story there is very little explanation of anything like why are people spraying their mouths silver before they die in one scene the villain of the film cant walk unaided then later he can shout a speech and drive a monster truck and tom hardy puts on a stupid voice trying to sound more tough it was 2 hours i wont get back one saving grace is the effects were quite good,reality
this movie was absolutely deplorable sure no sex or swearing but it paled in comparison to the original road warrior and where was the dog and gyro man when you really needed them the acting if you can call it acting was limited to 10 word utterances hardy was godawful with his aussie accent if you can call it that in fact the accent changed towards the end of the flick his role was sidekick to theron this is not the rockatansky we know from previous films it was really a charlize theron movie with as second fiddle to draw an audience charlize theron and some of the action sequences were the only redeeming features to this moviebut while it was loaded with action so much of the film was speeded up to supposedly heighten the action which it did not the plot was so thin as well all in all a total waste of time of true affectionados you will be so disappointed if you waste your time watching it i want those two hours of my life back,reality
i cant believe that so much viewers think this is a good movie are you on some drugs like george miller probably was when he created a plot for this movie stupid plot i couldnt even watch it till the end first part with mel gibson was further better that this shame for 21st century beside for all the explosions and cool cars i didnt like anything else i could write you so much more about movie and describe what i didnt like but i suppose that this review probably will not be displayed im so glad that i didnt make it to see it in the cinema because ill probably stand up and walk away in the middle of the movie im disappointed because i really like tom hardy and charlize theron and by my opinion this is their worst movie,reality
an incessant car chase movie written by people who obviously have no understanding of vehicles engines physics or anything related to entertainment they werent even talented enough to write much dialog to offer up any trace of a story theres very little speaking and complete sentences are downright rare i cant believe this mess gets any good reviews at all let alone the amazingly high imdb ratings it enjoys the only place i can see it belonging is saturday afternoon on the syfy channel along with all their other dreadful ultralow budget crap hollywood seems to have entered an age where the quality of a screenplay no longer matters endless special or notsospecial in this case effects are supposed to substitute for an engaging story and characters with depth i mourn the loss of creativity  it must be very depressing to work in the film industry,reality
but alas ive been cursed with an iq that is apparently at a level that gets offended when a conglomerate with an iq around 40 write a script and expect me to go along with iti dont even know where to start lets see if you drive for 180 days and average a speed of even 17 miles an hr you would go around the circumference of the earth three times or 53 miles an hour for 8 hrs each day so the whole premise of the movie plot is null and void right there in this futuristic world there is no water and no rain but apparently our group of antagonists have copious amounts of water bestowed on them from on high or rather from the movie makers if we see it then it must be so saith the movie makers the the location of their limitless reservoir is just plain physically impossible i needed a reason for that much man power and mechanized weaponry not being able to stop a single semi and i was never given one just lots of eye candy i needed to know how so many people could live and survive when there were no plants and no water i need to know how so many vehicles could have unlimited gasoline and be in top running order under these conditions but all i got were more explosions  i wanted a well written script instead of two hrs of explosionsat the end of the day i guess explosions are a lot lot cheaper and easier than a well written script coming out of hollywood,reality
i went into this viewing all excited thinking it was a remake of the original which i love i also really like tom hardy and charlize theron box i was crushed when i realized its a remakespin off of the road warrior which i dislike almost as much as i detest beyond thunderdome but i wanted to give it a chance hoping they would redeem the original sequel uh no they took all the cheesiest elements of the original road warrior and put them on steroids dumbed down the dialog amped up the special effects spat out the worst script ive seen in years put them all in a cocktail shaker and let fly i love love love a good action flick but this movie is pure drivel and not saved by all the stunts in the world thrown togetherif you actually like the original road warrior you might enjoy this i liked road warrior when it came out i was about 18 or 19 and in the 80s it seemed pretty cool i cannot watch it anymore though at least road warrior had national flavor and it was somewhat innovative for its time for me watching this spin off was like being forced to eat cardboard when i was looking forward to a great steak tom hardy turns his normally stoic but palpable screen presence into a painfully wooden caricature of himself charlize who is incredibly talented is mostly wasted,reality
oh my god is this movie terrible or am i just getting oldactionaction action and wait for it more action no real plot what story there is is ridiculous seriously ok weve just run through an amazingly savage gauntlet that killed most of us we cant go this way lets turn back around and run back through it with pretty ladiesseriously i weep for the youth of the world who actually think this garbage basically 2 hours of nonstop shooting and cgi is entertainmentthe basic philosophy seems to be if we explode enough stuff its good more stuff even better whats character development and pacing ew,reality
the best thing about fury road is that mel gibson chose not to repeat his role as and if you have some spare time and decide to waste a couple of hours on this socalled movie youd understand why his decision was rightthe story of fury road fits one simple sentence sortof introduction action sequence the end however if you measure the movies success by its box office performance this is clearly a masterpieceif you believe that everything happens for a reason then how this crappy scenario got this kind of budget my best guess is that it addresses the audience that grew up on action movies in the past ten years or so that implies almost nonexistent script zero character development and focus on action or as some film critic aptly put it eruptions of craziness,reality
well no i really dont get all the excitement regarding this movie it begins rather pretentious with the inner turmoils of but thats the deep part what follows is a few great ideas wasted in a bad script i like great action i like steam punkmetal riggedvehicle based stuff the premise the society after the destroyed world the weirdo things like the guitar rigbut not in this concoctionmake a choice then go for that the action is great but the rest falls flat like the characters isnt the lead character and feels like a stupid ox the development of his character isnt there to support his actions later on furiosa is the main character and has some spirit the evil guy is just that and the boy is to recognizable as that guy that plays it whats his namethe action in this movie is great the chase intense but that all stops when they get to the mothersoh my from then on the scriptwriters must have thought well lets put some emotion in here and that is the failure i think they wanted action story and emotional developmentattachment the last failed miserably the story is hidden somewhere beneath rubble and the action doesnt hold because of the first fail sadlyso great ideas nice pictures but bad execution,reality
explosion after deafening explosion like sitting too close to the speakers at a concert some cool visuals and battle tactics but thats it on the good sidedisappointed in this result while the original was spare in dialog also it was able to convey mood emotion and a sense of the charactersthe hero here has his face covered for the first third of the picture and makes it difficult to connect with himhad been looking forward to this this picture will not stand the test of time cant recommend you see it but will give them some points for the attempt,reality
only halfway through the film i wanted it to end i didnt know there were other films i didnt watch the trailer for the fury road so i was confused the whole movie i didnt understand character he wasnt even i didnt know furiosas story maybe see the other films firsteven after reading about the other and having a better understanding i still didnt like the moviethe storyline was impossible two people fighting against hundreds across the world and back and surviveugh what a wastethis makes me think about how much money we waste on making movies and then the more money wasted from the people watching them and the actors i did not like for the role tom hardy all i could think about was this means war 2012 and nicholas hoult oh god the other thing i had in mind was warm bodies 2013i cannot believe this has an 8610 rating,reality
awful1 out of 10 a script that offends in every way expresslywritten to be politicallycorrect bar none wrapped with a bunch of special effects explosions its still politicallycorrect propaganda garbageno strong male leads those are expressly reserved for females so obviously and entirely sexist was this film the only males were 1 crazy 2 deformed 3 unbelievable 4 cruel 5 stupid or any combination of those five points the women could donowrong using their powers of deception acting is professional lying after all to fool the stupid and cruel male prodigal son of the deformed unbelievable cruel warlord characterwas reduced to a supporting role to the pc amputee main lead played by modelliar actress charlize and to a bunch of likewise models off the runway their roles were completely empty and vacuous all they had to do was be pretty facesthe script was all about how wrong the world is because men run it which is the intended impression of the current state of affairs the plagiarists that write this psychological propaganda want to imbue upon the consciousness of the mostly young male viewers this film is designed to attract the formula is simple take a welltreaded films main character and some of the environment and pastiche it onto an agenda that is repeated time and time again in hollywood cinema the writers stole from the existing propaganda line and they stole from the original merely wending them together there wasnt actually any original material at allso my recommendation is to hand your 1050 or however much inflated a ticket price to the next charity you pass goodwill salvation army or some local homeless shelter but dont waste a penny  or your time  on this filthy piece of garbage,reality
this movie was horrible from the beginning till the very end it gave me a terrible headache mindless a complete waste of my time the story line was a nightmare the acting was unbearable i love charlize she is amazing but this movie was just a complete disaster i guess i had high expectations as a friend of mine told me how brilliant it is and after watching it i am starting to doubt my friends iq the action the loud sounds the exaggerated costumes skulls everywhere was all senseless and rather disturbing the movie is awful and so is everything else that came with it i am however looking forward to charlizes upcoming movies as i truly love her acting it is just unfortunate she was part of this mess of a movie,reality
i have no idea what they thought when made this films but i sure as hell was not entertained mindles action no story no character backgrounds nothing just a bunch of crazy people driving back and forth on a dirt road doing crazy stuff the movie was plain crazy crazier than a bag of cats to the point that many people that i know who watched it actually fell asleep why because too much action without anything else is boring i know as my missus fell asleep next to me and when i asked her about the film and her falling asleep she responded i dont care didnt understand anything what a bunch of rubbish didnt care about any of the characters i am old enough to have watched the originals and boy how disappointing i was with this faker all they did was to make a movie that has nothing to do with franchise another over the top reboot where more money than sense was thrown at it i have started buying or going through my old old collection of pre 2000 1990 and 1980 movies as 1 in about 10 movies these days is complete and utter rubbish they sure as hell dont make them like they sued to with all the money and special effects such a shameat times i felt like the movie was some kind of tragic opera attempt maybe the director wanted over the top artistic photoemotional moments without any reason why just for the heck of iti have no idea how people rated this movie so high did they watch the same film were they intoxicated or under some kind of drugs says a lot about our society and acceptance or submediocre entertainmentdont get me wrong i am not someone that enjoys over dramatic and clever movies i actually love to see something that is fun and entertaining i really dont like clever movies that give me too much to think for example white house down pacific rim any of the marvel movies fast furious series fun revenge movies such as taken or taken like movies but this what the hell was this,reality
i feel like i am the only person on planet earth who didnt like fury road it is basically a movie about a guy making a uturn ill admit the visuals are great but ive seen most of george millers films and he has an eye but just because the movie looks pretty doesnt make it a good movie it needs a real story this is a 2 hour car chase and it gets boring after 30 minutes because it is literally the same crap over and over again in a way the action is wasted on the film because it has nothing but action i cant be the only person who thinks this what is wrong with you people this isnt art stop pretending to be film snobs for like 5 minutes and just go with what your gut tells you about the film just because most of the film critics are calling this a highbrow art house film doesnt mean you have to go against your better judgement and pretend to like this piece of waste 90 of the critics are paid off even the ones on youtube think for yourself people will respect you more,reality
this movie doesnt dawdle it gets straight to the nitty gritty in no time within 5 minutes you will be sitting on a 2hour roller coaster ride and gripping to your armrest until the movie endswith technology being so hot these days movies have taken on an antiseptic polish and we see more robots and spaceships in controlled monitored environments than any of us can recall even chaos such as in ex machina is carefully confined in modern computerized buildings as its algorithms slowly go out of control everything is just sohigh techis a refreshing break from shiny plastic and metal veneers and postmodernist architecture and decor its dirty lowtech filled with modified monster trucks and amazing stunts that real people could do and the few lucky ones survive i didnt detect any sort of awkward animation or cgiin short its set a new standard for the action film,reality
lets make another movie tom hardy  hardly credible as but thats not bad when you recap the movie one damn long and hell of a boring chase there is absolutely no reasonable plot whatsoever the characters are uninterestingaverage score of 84 is mockery for every good movie there is rated less than that and mockery for all those that are rated only slightly bettersure there is the characteristic franchise visual theme dark postapocalyptic world ok we already have seen this over and over again and again whats the catch this movie and its rating really shows how degenerate people have become this is like watching ice fishing as a sport,reality
the movie seems to be pretty polarizing which i see no reason for some make it to be the masterpiece of the century other lable it as a trainwrecki think most fitting is something in the middle cause overall the stunts scenery and effects were pretty nice the movie has its strong points obviously in the action department i think theron did a pretty good job at portraying a tough girl in apocalyptic times and steals the show of hardy that was somewhat lacking a chance to shine a fine actor was wasted on a role that could have been played just as well by any 90s action movie hero  van damme stalone dudikoff arnoldmy main critique will be the failed world building i get that this is an action movie but from what i know about the other movies this just doesnt cut it you get zero information or background about anythingwhat about the different tribeswhat are these ghost vision sees aboutwhere do the breeding women come fromwhat is the back story of the different areas they pass through salt flats swampwho killed the world yeah whowhat about the blood transfusion and tatoos on backthe list is so long they could have cut some action and throw in some scene where they are just driving and tell each other something or pass on some information for the girls and the audiance or some old dude just narrates it whatever as mentioned by many other negative reviews the whole idea to turn around came a bit sudden and their plan is to trap the main forces and take the city evading a fight instead they just run straight into them what kind of a dumb plan is thati really love the post apocalyptic scenario but i have yet to find a film that can fill it with life most of the time you just get a very small glimpse at the world and what happened damn i want information how the rest of the world is doing how the whole situation came to be how people survived and managed to build up a new society this might be the worst movie in that regard in that genre with such a big budget,reality
throughout the entirety of this movie i was bewildered to find that i had been lied to despite all the explosions car chases and fight scenes to the death never got he gets captured by bandits scoffs quietly he gets tied to the front of a car heading into a fierytornado death storm coughs a little bit gets shot at and flaming guitars get flung his way still nothing this man has the temperament of a 90 year old in a rec league shuffleboard match why go to the trouble of casting bane they were better off casting mr bean,reality
fury road is hands down one of the best action movies ive ever seen it doesnt take its own sweet time with exposition with dialogue or with establishment its just raw action from start to finish it takes viewers on what is literally a nonstop ride through the desert racing all the way to the endi havent watched any other movies but theres no need to watch the other three before watching fury road everything still makes sense the story follows tom hardy as he finds himself helping a driver of a war rig furiosa charlize thereon and her cargo of five women make their way through the desert but theres a mob of in upwards of fifty vehicles behind them hunting them down led by the sinister imortan joeaction movies are often slowed down by exposition and dialogue and its here that fury road excels it doesnt waste its time on exposition not one bit whats valhalla why do the halfchilds need blood sacks doesnt waste its time trying to explain every little detail and it doesnt need to the viewers just accept the absurdity of whats going on letting us focus on the action and thats the thing the absurdity of everything is just so genius why is there a man playing a guitar on a truck who cares just enjoy the movieand the movie doesnt waste its time on dialogue either this review is already longer than all the words says in the movie combined its just plain genius is just this raw action hero and we dont need his wild backstory with him talking every second we get to just watch this movie without the normal incessant dialogue of an action flickthats where this movie definitely cements itself as one of the best action movies of all time never before do i think ive seen a movie that just has such nonstop action from the start to the beginning the film must have a grand total of three static scenes where the protagonists just talk with one another everything else is just raw action unfolding so quickly the trucks chasing the war rig down are always in the horizon and were reminded of it just enough to remember the imminent threat posed to furiosa and everyone on the war rig the actual action itself is so good theres just so much and the combat methods of both the attackers and defenders is so uniquethe thing with fury road is that itll probably be the most unique action film you ever see right from the getgo the director throws us headfirst into a dystopian world forcing us to just accept this and let the movie unfolds and thats fine who cares how absurd everything might seem just enjoy the actionfury road is an amazing action movie i recommend it to just about anyone and especially to action diehards you wont regret it,reality
the terms awful utter rubbish monumental bore and waste of celluloid do not even begin to describe this shockingly bad thing i do not dare call it a moviei frankly think that whoever gave 10 stars or more than 1 really to whatever this is have been either paid by someone or are on very powerful psychotropic drugsi watched the film review on bbc the other night and this guy kept repeating how much he loved this drivel and i realised that they spent 140 big ones on this and they cannot lose all this dosh so they invest more in bribing people into saying this is good please do a favour to yourself and forget this ever existed and watch road warrior movies instead 1 and 2 my favs mel gibsonanyway to all of you out there making money writing good reviews about this crap and others please stop and find a real job creating value for humanity and not destroying it thank you,reality
i mean sure as far as summer blockbusters go we have had a bit of a dry spell this year at least in my opinion however to call this the best movie of the year or a masterpiece thats kinda stretching it isnt it seriously whats so great about this movie were the critics watching a different movie from the one than i did originally i wasnt going to write a review for this movie but after seeing so many raving reviews for this film on the internet and seeing the absurdly high rating this movie has here on imdb i felt that i had to say something even if my hopes of knocking this movie down a point or two are completely moot then at least i wouldve accomplished something by saying how much i hated this film and add my voice to the small minority of people on this site that believe that this movie is nothing more than an overhyped overrated snorefest while watching this movie i fell asleep yes this movie with its thrilling action scenes and provocative visuals actually put me to sleep i would go into the plot now but i dont think this movie has one at least not while i was awake furthermore the supposed main character in this film has no reason for even being in the film why call this film fury road if himself has no motivations or stake into whats going on and for that matter why even use the character of at all if you were gonna go that way with it why not have mel gibson appear in a 1015 minute cameo as an older from what i saw there was nothing good about this movie i probably wouldve been more entertained staring at a wall for two hours congratulations george miller youve accomplished something that only rob zombie and m night shyamalan have been able to do cure my insomnia i present to you your awards my middle finger and a long loud raspberry bravo ahole,reality
the movie earth girls are easy with jeff goldblum and geena davis conveys the feeling it may have been made by jeff and geena with gear borrowed from the industry the first was like that the odd camera angles choppy edits confused plot lines road warrior was the crowning achievement in the epic of beyond thunderdomefelt so contrived and overwritten it was hard to watch not even tina turner could save itroad warrior ended on a cautious upbeat note the narrator remembers him clearly and it looks as though the community may succeed in moving to safer landsthe overall appearance of the film is rabid excesses in costumes sets scenes and vehicles it overwhelms the senses with crash after crash fire and more fire and tragic misfortunes for individualshaving seen this hideous chapter in life leaves me terrified about the upcoming remake of blade runner theyll ruin that one too and make the first great edition of the film suffer along with iti hate doovers and voiceovers they suck,reality
i am a fan of the original movies and as you can see this has nothing in common with the originals remakes has not to be exact copies of the originals but this got too far from the story is just a prop here he barely talks or shoot a bullet at least any important word or bullet i wish this never came out or at least i hadnt wasted 2 hours of my life in this fast and furiouson the sand ridiculousness watch it on your own risk and expect nothing so you will be not disappointed i hope they respect the legacy in the future so we will not be forced to watch our movie profanation i was not happy hearing that tom hardy was playing role but he didnt he just shoot a pair of bullets and said a pair of words nothing changed at the end and the story showed they were expecting this to end here ill never go to theater to watch this garbage again and ill never rent iteven for free,reality
if someone asks me to review in one wordi would say disaster i dont understand why it is highly rated on imdb and rotten tomatoes and why it is being appreciated by the critics i saw the review and went to watch the movie with my friendsas the movie was suggested by me they nearly killed me after watching the movie watching the movie was real headache i felt like i wasted my lifes precious 120 minutes i didnt understood what was that guitar man doing in the moviei mean there is lot of action going on around and that man was playing guitarlol the movie had no story acting was average action sequences were good but way too long the one star that i have given for the movie is for the vfx only if you have nothing to watch then also dont watch this movie,reality
i am a huge fan of the original movie for me it is about the struggle to stay human in an inhuman world to preserve that tiny bit of dignity that differentiates us from the beasts that inhabit the desertsfury road takes everything from the franchise and blows it up literally this movie made me squirm in my seat and i was close to leaving the theater the visuals are stunning but there is nothing that ties them together it is like a bucket of special effects of all end time movies stirred together infused with a big budget and poured over the viewer in a meaningless way the feeble attempts to create an artistic look to some of the scenes eg while driving through the wasteland are so random that they are lost on the spectatorthe guiding principle of struggling with being a true survivor and trying to stay human is cut out of fury road there are some hints but for character development this is the weakest evermy biggest problem with the movie is that most action scenes are so over the top that they simply are ridiculous i do appreciate the wasteland weirdo as any fan would but in fury road they are just so exaggerated that it is too much and i am not even talking about the whole plot being full of logic errorsthis thing is a bmovie with a big budget that cant make up its mind what it wants to be in the first place and then simply turns all the dollars into explosions and that does not compute or entertain,reality
when you make a remake you should not do it completely differently this isnt madits something different and something new the sad part is that they simply use a classic to sell iteven worse instead of saving money and make it simpler they overdone itmore effect more crazyness overdoing everything and everyall just pump in effects pump in more and crazy ideasbut never ever think about writing a smart script or get good actingand thats the hole problem nowadays movies today are too much of action too much of effects to much of dumping money but they are empty they have no soul so they become irrelevant yet even boring despite massive spectacular action scenes which seem to never endthis movie is the best example for that,reality
is this really what hollywood is spending a big budget on all this movie is in summation explosions fire fire exploding wheels coming off from explosions and thats about iti think it was 45 minutes into this movie before a paragraph of dialogue was even spoken no backstory on anything no interaction between anyone to even understand why anything is happening honestly this was the worst movie i have seen in decadesnot years one has to assume those who thought this was a good movie spent most of the time watching it while tweeting or texting on their phones because the only people who could even sit thru this disaster would have to be suffering from severe adhd of some kind im still sitting here shaking my head because i cant believe this even made it past the storyboard phase and the movie industry wonders why its losing its appeal,reality
as said by some others this is a disappointment it had the same vibe of disappointment as the two previous instalments but i found them more entertaining at least the first was a good film and by far the best of the series and this fails to bring any form of to life as throughout the film as tom hardys  good casting call  remained nothing but tame at very best i also felt that for something based in or around a large chase scene it didnt seem to go anywhere throughout the movie it started well but stayed at the same pace throughout the filmto say iam unimpressed is an understatement especially in this day and age especially with all the money that was put into this and the cast with what they had did play a good partnothing special at all,reality
this is the worst movie i watched lately i usually enjoy action movies but this movie is a 2 hour long set of action scenes one after another it sums up to something like this fighting  high speed chasing  shooting  explosions  lot of blood  some almost naked chicks  more fighting  more chasing  more shooting  a scene of sex  another round of fighting chasing shooting  a big bang  the end  it is just booooring to watch and it has nothing to do with the original except name and i might say although the original isnt the best movie i ever watched it was a masterpiece compared to this one it had a story some interesting characters some comic elements some romance etc and this movie lacks all of that it is such a disappointment to see how low the hollywood has dropped all that modern technology but out of good ideas,reality
this movie was about a woman named furiosa she outmatched the character they named in every aspect fighting shooting etc he doesnt do anything for the plot its about her and her revengeetc this movie should have been named ine because thats what moneywood did the original script was probably for a woman lead and they knew it wouldnt draw so write in a character and have him sit by the side and freak out every 34 minutesanother hollyweird attempt to take our male heroes and castrate them what is up with that want to watch a real movie go back to the original 3this review needed more lines so ill just say also bad acting bad story booooorrrrrrinnngggg waste of ,reality
if what youre hearing about fury road is that it is one big explosion filled car chase thats absolutely true which is okay in a strange michael bay fashion its got some impressive moments but the insanely high review scores will simply not stand the test of time as a fan of the series i dont believe the film insults or dilutes the universe i was most disappointed in the way it failed to capitalize on it such a perfect world to mold a story out of and bring to life in the way the video game industry has with the borderlands and fallout series over recent years they fail making the universe interesting and deep and desperate it never suspended my belief like a great movie should this couldve been any desert full of bandits it seemed to be loosely inspired by if not a flat out off brand version of a movie instead of a story in the realm of they tryed to go with a balls out action movie which once again is fine but they wait an hour to try to add artificial drama an hour not that theron acted her part poorly by any means she doesnt have to prove herself at this point in her career clearly her few dramatic lines and courageous intent come wayyyyy too late in the movie to care almost as if somebody was like wow we need to add this ingredient to the hollywood formula because thats what our investors demand its out of place and nearly makes you roll your eyes it came of as so forced and phony it almost wrecked the entire thing for mealso i feel like cinematic direction and results didnt match much of the movie didnt have that flair that i felt it was nearly achieving i guess the only example i could transfer to written word is during the dustnadodust storm scene it looks as though they were going for the 300 type filter which by the way had they pulled it off wouldve been perfect but it kind of came out as a very budget version of that aesthetic also the white body paint didnt do any favors throughout the film they didnt look like blockbuster cool body makeup they just looked like normal people going to a football gamemy end game is they failed to really cement the viewer in the world forced some very unneeded drama and honestly many of the action scenes never felt as intense as they shouldve beeneither budget or ability ate into the final result hard to tell which,reality
i really wanted to like this movie i read the glowing reviews and eagerly went to see the movie this afternoon i sat in the theatre and kept waiting to be moved by the action or the plot and felt absolutely nothing but boredom and sadnessi am a fan of and road warrior thunderdome was garbage and although this wasnt garbage it was far from good i mean did they really need a mutant midget did they really need a blind mutant guitarist on the front of a truck in a post apocalyptic world are we really going to see that many women that look as if theyve just stepped off a models runway besides all the things that are just preposterous or dont make sense there is absolutely no character development and the characters do not make any sort of connections themselves what we get is a lot of car chase with a lot of things blowing up around some very attractive visuals but little plot or any real reason to care about the characters or the movie itself i for one am really disappointed,reality
this movie is simply not a movie its a music video without the music big images of impossible landscapes characters that are caricatures without an inch of depth i left the theater after an hour the street outside was more interestingit didnt start well i tire of the superherotype with eyes that can see behind his back and the sensory equipment of a feline then it got worse the impossible landscapes that looked so good in avatar or star wars seem completely out of place in the postapocalyptic world of i mean the road warrior that felt real a world with people fighting for petrol and survival  fury road is way off the reality chart whoever came up with the world must have come straight out the video game industry the visual effects are unbelievable literally they look fake some scenes inside the truck look so off that its impossible to get caught by the story or its absence in this occurrence if you want to see an impossible crazy movie with no story at all but depth of characters try jan kounens dobermann at least the characters are interesting well here stops the bashing spending more time on it would be an either greater waste of the time ive spent on this movie cheers and good luck watching it if you dodid anybody else found the dude with the electric guitar completely out of place,reality
avoid this very disappointing typical violent dude flick nothing new of plot same old same old storyline this is another one of the long line of violent same old storyline movies i am getting so tired of seeing the same storyline rehashed in 80 of what comes out these days i guess maybe im one of the only few here that can see nobody has any more unique ideas i sure wish hollywood and investors would take a chance and come out with more original quality movies it seems every movie is all about the blood violence and same old special effects come on people wake up and move forward theres so many more original ideas out there for new awesome movie concepts if you just open your minds to it,reality
first off im old enough to have seen the original movie i find it sad that the hollywood elites cant come up with anything new and just have to keep rehashing sequel after sequel after remake after remake now that ive seen the new my first impression was this is so bad its almost good destined to be a cult hit ive reconsideredthis is just pathetic how in the world this waste of electricity payroll and all the other expenses that go into a movienot that this really qualifies for that category i will never understand i guess some executives somewhere china most likely are sitting around thinking remember that australian flick with the guy and the dog lets rip that one throw in some politically correct themes well have a blockbusterive enjoyed tom hardy in his past work and charlize ive enjoyed too but in this case not exactly resume enhancing oscar materialthat being said if you loved the original mel gibson franchise youll be sadly disappointed if youve never seen the original films and like lots of shiny flashy things with nothing inside them then please knock yourself out for myselfthis movie was 2 hours and some seconds of my life lost that i can never get back,reality
what happened to the retro action movies this film is totally disgusting and boring a lot of people look for a post apocalyptic punk world and get a totally senseless plot with characters without any goal or real deepcharacters spend 90 per cent of the time chasing or being chased this way and that this guys spend million of dollars to crash cars and make a movie without any other real criticism about humankind they waste the opportunity to have a huge audience engaged on the screen and miss the chance to leave a real message about friendship resources and cooperation they make a stupid commercial semicomedy about funny decadent worldthe most surprising thing is that there is some people that say this movie is awesome and this movie has a score in imdb about 8 the problem is not only the creators of movies like this the real problem is that there are a lot of ignorance in the audience to enjoy a real movie that shows virtue real abstract and moral issues water divas guitar flamer mute what happened to the original creators of this movie needs to be called mess,reality
i tried to sit through the entire movie tried it thrice and failed each time it is a boring movie the action sequence are over the top who cares about physics the coloring is horrid in 300 we saw how a tint can enhance a movie in this movie we get an example of headache inducing color palettethe lead stars are boring and mostly grunt rather than speaka half baked storyline and characters is all i got i understand that some people may get adrenaline rush from seeing outlandish vehicles i am not one of those just because a vehicle has some goofy looking add on does not excite or interest meif this was an action movie then sorry i have seen better if it was a futuristic  alternate future story sorry i have seen way way better onesall in all a movie to avoid,reality
a nonstop adrenaline rush featuring cars explosions bullets and the most badass woman in movie history george miller returns after three decades to to deliver a masterpiece of mayhem and destruction while also creating a rare action movie that refuses to sexualize women and instead brings them to the forefront of the action as charlize theron stars as furiosa a rebel from an oppressive regime who kicks ass like no other while also being a very emotionally grounded and empathetic character tom hardy takes on mel gibsons mantle as fantastically showing the will to survive despite the impossible odds nicholas hoult and rosie huntingtonwhiteley also give considerable depth to the movie proving it not to be a mindless barrage of explosions the visuals consist almost entirely of practical effects with minimal animation to provide a real experience that resonates with the viewer at an instinctual level and excites to the very core,reality
im gonna keep it real witchu this movie straight action from the first 5 minutes it takes a break by the green place but its actually just slow action action never really stops car chases fire lots of fire hot babes even more hot babes really good stunts nothing is wrong with this movie i love movies i go every weekend when i can this movie blew my head off and i even took my mom to see it the next weekend i saw fury road twice already i live i die i live again i recommend this movie straight up nothing else to say about it go watch it and then buy the blue ray and just chill at your pad and watch it with some bomb ass snacks and remember how amazing movies can be dloved it 10 out 10 and that is not easy for me to say thanks for reading my brain,reality
if youre reading this and youve not yet witnessed the truly spectacular fury road film then i highly recommend you pay that little bit extra and view in i3d go go gofor the first time i left the cinema with an abundance of excitement  adrenaline pumping furiously through my veins this is a relentless movie that immediately captures your attention  refuses to let go until the final credits the imaginative action sequences are executed with aplomb tied in with fantastic direction creative camera shots  extraordinary pace not only that but the soundtrack is just unbelievable and becomes so powerful that it feels like another character shaped within this cruel and unforgiving world most postapocalyptic movies use drained bland colours to reflect the new world but mmfr bucks that trend and is a visual delight i genuinely feel that this was the most enjoyable movie of the last decade and possibly the greatest cinematic experience in history watching fury road is like being shot in the face with a paintball gun strapped precariously onto the front of japans bullet train and laced with cocaine speed  red bull,reality
thats it this film is not even beautiful its repetitive and not beautiful stop it visual ideas are completely childish and in 20 minutes you are totally resigned about the storyline even if they find an eden or any thing theyre looking for but what is not my big surprise when i see them simply assuming the cynical idea of turning back sir screenwriter i dont care who you are its cynical its obscene i felt incredibly mediocre being enticed to alienation that carcass runs more than a motorcycle the rock path gets clean before the glorious turning back they dont get shot nothing here gets saved not even experimentalism theyll say experimentalism audience is a lame gods sake why do i still get surprised but let me say youve really gone to far with idolatry this time not one zero,reality
one can only assume the title of this review is accurate because the notion that this film warrants an 82 out of 10 score is utterly laughable according to imdb voters this film is better than sicario lets just digest that for a momentso liboresque rigging of votes aside theres lots of action but no real story and some of the theatrics by the baddies like the flaming guitar thing are just awful and pointless theres nothing more to say really  it doesnt get any better as the film goes onthose giving it anything above 5 either work for hollywood or are mentally defunctavoid avoid avoid,reality
this movie reminds me of a line from annie hall when woody allen says how much he hates doing comedy for college studentsthey are all high on marijuana and laugh at anything the endless hype of reviews for this movie are very similar the movie uses the same pathetic formula that most sequels do take the good edgy stuff from the original and massively exaggerate it and this is supposed to be a better movie it happened with alien the original movie thrived on the idea of one relentlessly hostile indestructible enemy and superb dramatic acting sequels had them being blown up like paper mache godzillas what made the original road warrior so effective was how stark and raw everything was so primitive in fury road they seem to have developed elaborate technology for building elaborate domains i thought they were in a battle of survival for the last drop of gasoline the raw horror of the original has been replaced by endless gruesome special effects the entire movie is just one stupid chase so so overrated,reality
the only reason it gets 2 stars is for the visual effects  and i very nearly deducted another point for the waste of 150m on themthe whole movie is pointless action  no plot or story line acting is barely passable although to be fair they werent given much to work with ridiculous waste of resources that are supposedly scarce think waterworld pointless violence and continual unrealistic feats make this one of the biggest flops of all time given the budgetthis movies adds nothing to the original trilogy in fact even the worst of those movies  thunderdome  had 10 times the charm of this tripewatch if all you like is constant visual effects and car chases if not steer well clear and watch one of the originals instead,reality
i enjoy a lot 2 and i was willing to see the new one tom hardy and charlize theron are great actors and everything pointed to be more than right it shouldnt be difficulthowever this film is more or the same commercial trash effects explosions and many violence i regret for spending money in it it doesnt worth it at all the film is a big deception has a secondary role and he is just a silly beast meanwhile furiosa is the main character she is fine but nobody goes to the cinema looking for her and the models that dont contribute anythingthere is no script plot or characters but accelerated scenes explosions and noise our life is too fast and noisy to add more why the accelerated scenes like in the old moviesthe purpose of this film seems to make us dumber i feel pity for the complicity of the critics money rules but bad cinema is bad always i feel very sorry it could have been something good it wasnt difficult but it follows the same guidelines than the other stupid and commercial filmsdont spend money or time in this failure humans are born intelligent for something better than this,reality
film industry is totally screwed up as this really bad piece of crap got 6 oscars unbelievable really unbelievable shift  delete it and you wont regret it everything about it was wrong from the twohead lizard and bear grylls style eating to making the mother milk it seems that everything here is a terrible mix bad acting lack of ideas faulty cgis its troubling that a movie can be singularly focused on loud explosions and violence with no plot dialogue or character development yet receive widespread critical acclaim this is the first film ive ever seen that actually reminded me of the type the populace in idiocracy would find enthralling,reality
i voted this a 1 star as there is no option for zero stars god awful film with seemingly zero ties to i can only assume that they used the name in the title to attempt to make money at the box office visually there were some nice looking bits of cgi that is literally the only thing that was remotely entertaining theyd have been better off trying to get mel gibson back in on the action to make yet another lackluster sequelthis was the worst film i saw last year id put it on par with the woman which was beyond dire nothing of any interest happens in that either,reality
i dont know how to describe this movie oh my god it is so great so incredible so too many so to describe this unimaginable movie since the second episode 2 the road warrior released i had been the biggest fan of this great series movies and after 34 years waiting i finally redeemed by the original director of this series this is the greatest movie in the movie history even the terminator aliens the matrix the lord of the rings trilogy can not be compared to this masterpiece of the movie history james cameron had always been my first adoring director of the hollywood but after this movie released cameron becomes the second greatest director to me george miller now is the no1ps i went to watch this masterpiece 185 and since then the images and music stayed in my head just couldnt stop just like drug addicition or alcoholic so i went to watch it three times in four days and i still feel hungry to watch it again i dont know how many times i will go to the theater since i watch the terminator 13 times in 1984 this is the only movie that make me go to the theater over 2 times,reality
is set in a great story  a post apocalyptic future filled with craziness and explosions unfortunately george miller botched the story completely regardless of what some people might think in our politically correct world 130 lb females do not beat up large aggressive males charlize theron is escaping an evil warlord who treats his women brutally but unfortunately in a postapocalyptic future that brutal environment would likely happen especially to beautiful women these women would not be ordering men around or fighting them in handtohand combat i do not say this because i think that the story should only have submissive women but think of game of thrones and cersei lannister she works toward her own ends using her womanly wiles in a realistic environment though the action sequences are amazing i thing that george miller did a net horrible job with fury road,reality
it was strange that in the midst of an environmental disaster and resource wars everybody drives these gas guzzling vehicles oil was obviously not in short supply i suppose the pyrotechnics would have been limited if everybody was on push bikes also there were no nonwhites in the cast as far as i could see under the dusty and pasty faces was there any reason for this apart from appealing to adolescent white males who are into heavy metal culture and there was no sex no nudity no kissing just violence the wouldbe censors might have to revise the sex  violence meme plenty of body fluids though  blood spit breast milk  but strangely enough no semen there was a caesarian birth but the actual scene was not shown  i guess some things were a step too far for its target audience the umbilical cord twirling doctor was the obviously token gay character in the film,reality
as a fan of the series i had high hopes for this film but ive left the theater disappointed it can be best summed up as someone saying the last act of the road warrior was so great so lets make that into a whole film theyve done that and as a result we get a film thats really lacking a story is too busy and doesnt make sensei think most of its problems are down to being made to appeal to focus groups rather than being a true film the uk rating for it is a 15 and it shows the few times it attempts to do something gruesome or violent its always out of the scene and to compensate for the lack of blood the explosions are over the top and add to the busy and distracting feelall the theatrics flaming guitar pole vaulting guys give you a lot to look at but when you actually think about what is happening theres very little actually going on and youre left wondering why are there so many cars simply driving for no reason other than to follow the handful of cars actually doing something what is the point to the guy playing random rubbish on his guitar other than to serve as a distraction on the screeni like tom hardy but in the film he has very little to say for having so much screen time and often it feels more like hes doing his impression of a lawn ornament rather than being charlize theron is barely any better you could easily take both of their characters out and very little would change about the filmwithout spoiling it i feel there are few wtf moments that at least border on being major plot holes if not actually being plot holesits a great film if youve never realized there were other films or you thought it would be great if they made a film you could take your children older children that is toif youre a fan of the series theres not much here for you even beyond thunderdome had more substance than this film and even with its awful bits with the children it still holds up better than fury roadeven the title fury road feels wrong as no one ever feels that angry let along furious,reality
this is slaying of another franchise this author of this movie must have some kind of brain cancerit starts off mediocre some white pale skin warboys is out for and seeking death in combat thus entering valhalla in this useless movie the bad guys seems to have unlimited resources whilst having an almost perfect society with working order unlimited supply of fresh water mechanized grow yards and much more not at all the previous movies where raiders were primitive yet only pillaging and unable to achieve anything by themselves in this movie madis out to destroy their working society conscripting matriarchal motor gang for the task and the old hags are killing war boys in a japanese style killing spree how this movie ever got above 4 in score is a mystery did the staff at imdb get bribed database got hacked its a disaster acting is awful and all actionsceenes have been seen before i really loath this movie and if i could give it minus i would,reality
i really enjoy good action movies but this movie is terrible and dont see it i dont see how anyone would recommend this movie or think it should win an awardthe movie was full of wtf moments that arent probable in some future dystopian world the movie is just a long explosion filled chase scene without a plotproblems with the movie which contains some spoilers many years after some terrible war yet there is an endless supply of bullets people cant live without water but the movie has people wanting and fighting for the smallest amounts of water endless supply of muscle bound men where did they get the food water and exercise huge mechanical contraptions that were built with what it makes the pyramids look like something anyone could build they were repairing cars but where in the hell did they get the supplies the bad guy was so predictable they had to make sure you hate him by putting an ugly mask over his face why do you need a huge car with drummers banging on the back of it speakers in the front and a blind guitar player stupid the big crash scene has wheels and car parts flying at the screen just for the 3d audience stupidwatch the original again and skip this stupid reboot,reality
im wondering if people giving this film high marks have somehow watched the original and thought that was the film they were reviewingseriously if you want to watch a film with little dialogue dreadful acting and a storyline written by an eight year old then this is the film for youif however you want to watch i suggest you stick to the original one for a more coherent storyline a tad more dialogue and a bit of a plot to the movie something sadly missing from fury roadthe only bright spot to this entire film and what made me watch this dross to the end was the regular appearance of the delectable zoe kravits wearing a delightful little number,reality
its getting harder and harder to find an original movie these days and so we get an endless supply of re boots with that in mind it was good to see that this movie was not a reboot but a sort of follow on and while i thought it was an ok movie it should have been just that an ok movie under a new name as it was nothing like the originals yes there were links like it was set in post apocalyptic australia and yes didnt speak much but seriously  instead we have the brand name that relys on the older generation telling the young ones how great the originals were classics cult movies and so we get this tripe using the name of to sell an action film that could just as well be called  the desert road of death and should have its just my opinion but as an avid fan i thought sold out to hollywood and pushed it a bit but this is a disgrace to the franchise as an action film its ok 610 nothing ive not seen before but trying to fill such big boots makes it a dying shame and i hope they stop here rename this move to have nothing to do with just happens to have a star called and it would work a lot better you cant just tell this story because the younger generation wont know the story and wont watch the originals because they are not full of modern effects cgi and so on and the older generation will see that tom hardy as good an actor as he is does not get the character right sorry to drone on but i loved 12 and 3 this one i would sooner forget,reality
at first the film starts very claustrophobic but then soon has one nice shot after the other yet with such a contract between dullness and unrealistic scenes make this more of a cartoonish depiction as a universe i had expectedwhile many reviewers complain about the feminism universe the movie just displays a society fueled by war and sitting on resources with everyone a particular role from birth with a few leaders connected by a loyalty that isnt explained or shown with another society of women and a loner who is yet on another vibe but comes in contact with both and path cross with a seemingly feeling out of place person in this society in itself the idea is well translated and reflects on some segments of our societyhis origin story in this movie is completely lost while there is one moment youd feel with as he decides to return  you dont get a sense he goes out of his way or has anything else to do or to go to he also constantly is bitching about his car yet he hasnt been seen in it enough to associate it into his personaused to exist when the world went into war gulf war overoil in a world where we imagine clean and reusable energy a post apocalyptic world around cars the original there was shortage of oil and hence the wars in this version there was no such thing the resources they do sit on isnt showing agony the people shot of suffering people isnt convincing and doesnt resonate or isnt displayed in a way youd sympathize or thing that this world is suffering and it is a dog eat dog worldvisually the film is enjoyable there is an attempt to show the power of love some philosophical ideas are suggested but it isnt followed through  and traded for the graphics while anything other as the blazing and over the top unrealistic actionshots looks like its filmed in the same 40 square feet making it rather a mockery of the classics with a genuite vibego see this film for some graphical sequences but dont go into it with much expectations the story is lacking many good ideas have been put it but never worked out or followed through and traded it for claustrophobic flashing imagery and little real contenti wished i hadnt spent the money,reality
the former policeman tom hardy is captured by the war boys tribe commanded by the immortal joe hugh keaysbyrne and assigned to be blood donor for the wat boy nux nicholas hoult that is sick meanwhile imperator furiosa charlize theron drives a tank truck to collect gasoline for joe however her truly intention is to flee from the tyrannic joe with his five women selected to breed hidden in the truck to her homeland immortal joe commands a party to hunt down furiosa and is chained to nuxs car furiosa heads the truck to a sand storm but nux continues to pursuit her after the storm succeeds to release from the car and brings nux chained with him he sees furiosa and the five wives and decides to flee in their truck but there is a secret to operate the truck and he teams up with furiosa leaving nux on the desert when joes gang arrives they retrieve nux and follow furiosa will and she succeed to escape from joes gang fury road is a terrible and overrated sequel of the franchise from the late 70s and 80s the plot and characters are poorly developed and despite the action the movie is totally forgettable tom hardy is not charismatic and cannot be compared to the ironic mel gibson my vote is fivetitle brazil estrada da fria fury road,reality
fury road currently has an imdb score of 82 stars and a rotten tomatoes score of 97 it was in the running last night for a golden globe award for best picture but it didnt win the fact that it didnt win was no surprise the fact that it was even nominated was a huge surprise if you read actual user reviews including this one you will see that a great many people thought this movie was awful the films only redeeming quality was the cinematography which i will admit was gorgeous beyond that there was nothing to keep my interest i actually purchased the movie when it became available for digital download and i couldnt get past 1 hour mark and i tried three different timesi liked the original movie but it wasnt my favorite dystopian film i like tom hardy charlize theron and nocholas hoult but that doesnt really matter here i like dystopian action  adventure and chase scenes still doesnt matter there was just no way for me to suspend my disbelief enough to get into this story there really wasnt much of a story and what little there was was was entirely too stupid and disjointed to believe even in a movie maybe i could have tolerated more than one hour if there was no dialogue at all it was just too damn nonsensical and stupid,reality
the mel gibson trilogy is a classic it is set in a seemingly realistic world though thunderdome takes it to a stretch but this movie is just absurd i guess im a thinking man  minored in film and media studies does it make any sense at all about the  mothers milk or the most absurd thing they live in a world with little gasoline but find it acceptable to build a massive chariot with enormous speakers that consume vast power coupled with jets of fire that spew out of the guitar stage this film should win a razzie if you grew up with the original gibson realistic trilogy this is a sham cash grab on the formerly good name of how much of a dullard to you have to be to think this is either a believable world or good filmmaking,reality
anyone who loved this movie is immature period if you skip through this movie and watch only 30 seconds out of every 10 minutes you will get the whole plot there is none and you will get to see some of the cool special effects this movie is a total waste of good actors there are no scenes in this movie which require a talented actor and there really isnt any dialogue worth mentioning the dystopian society is not fleshed out or explored at all 2 the road warrior is a far more intriguing and exciting movie with a better lead i love tom hardy but this movie could have starred anyone with the same effect better villains and waaaaaayyyyy better stunts310 stars for good visual effects and some decent action scenes although in a movie this fake you cant really get excited for action scenes since you know its all cgi and bs,reality
its a lot of action i can assure you that but the movie and the character of madare nothing near the level of the old movies the actual story line is thin to be nice about it and the whole setup is all about effects and shots the movie is entertaining but also a one timer i wouldnt wanna see it again at some point you realize what the story is about but still you are wondering if things are even remotely logic or convenient to fill up the time the cars are like the old madmovies but for me the comparison ends for me the movie was a huge disappointment and im writing this review because i cant believe people giving a 10 for this movie or even higher then 6 for that matter especially when you saw the old movies and have even a harder time believing those scores if you want to see a entertaining movie please go ahead and watch if you are looking for a really good movie you better skip this,reality
i am unsure where the rave reviews for this movie are coming from certainly the film does not deserve its current position in the imdb top 250the film supposedly takes place between 2 and 3 immediately robbing the audience of any sense of jeopardy for there isnt much of a plot  and some sources claim that the film didnt even have a script  just a long desert chase which gets repetitive very quicklywe are given a new actor in the role of rockatansky tom hardy sadly hardy is less than stellar in the charisma department and his performance is ineffectual in addition the film sidelines in order to showcase other characters and reduces him to an ineffectual character on the rare occasions when he is given something to docharlize theron is furiosa the real star of the movie her performance is better but despite a cascade of social media claims to the contrary the idea of a warrior woman is an old and tired one even for the franchisethe film is mainly a seemingly interminable drive through the desert pacing is terrible and i wasnt engaged by the charactersthe saving grace is the cinematography which is beautiful but not enough to redeem the film as a whole,reality
i really wish that i visited this page and found some helpful reviews from objective people before i went to cinema and i would probably save some money for some better moviemasterpiece movie of the year are you serious people wont say this movie is total failure but its not far away from that either no story no dialogs many things left unanswered is not even main character here and furiosa somehow took that role this is just a bunch of visuals effects and road action im gonna forget about as soon if you looking for road action then this one is for you but if you looking for something more than this movie is not worthy of your time and money and two hours of your life,reality
i guarantee that this is a film that will stand the test of time to become a classic character development and plot lines are quickly developed by putting the characters in one bizarre predicament after another the themes of environmentalism political theory and philosophy lurk just beneath the surface but they are never actually discussed it is a tribute to the skill and talent of everyone involved in this film that they can say so much while saying so little it is affirming to know that you can still go to the movies and have your expectations not only exceeded but absolutely blown away the filmgoer needs an open mind and a willingness to mentally go to this other world this is a world that is a horrifying depiction of a path the world may have chosen for itself offers both a vision of hell but also of the divine the divine comes in the form of a rag tag group of strangers that accept each other quickly care about one another and then gain strength and confidence in following a shared vision a hope for a better world the depiction of the power of hope is moving and one leaves this film with a positive belief in humanity one of the best movies to come along in a long long time,reality
fury road is directed by none other than george miller its the first movie in 30 years which replaces cult icon mel gibson with uprising star tom hardy it also stars charlize theron and nicholas hoult you know these days where you just want to go to a movie have fun and at the same time be impressed by the movies quality fury road is exactly that just 10 times betteri cant find words how to describe this movie its everything an action fan dreams of and wants its the kind of movie that only comes along every 10 years or so its something else something unique its pure adrenaline balls to wall fuel kicked craziness and its everything i want from an action movie while the movie is crazy it is also grounded with characters that feel real and tormented by this gruesome world where survival is the number one priority furiousa and have great chemistry together and you want to learn more from their characters everyone in this movie does a fantastic job nicholas hoult especially was very surprising as one of the war boys he really had fun with the role and you can see it in the movie the plot is fairly simple this is not a problem because it has been established as a movie where the main goal is to capture the audience with the mesmerizing action scenes fury road is a prime example that a great movie doesnt need a complex story to be good gravity is also a prime example to showcase this while the story here is simple it fits the movie perfectly now the number one reason you want to watch this movie is the visual extravaganza miller has brought on screen trust me when i say this you have never seen action scenes on the big screen like the ones in this movie the things you see on screen are 80 practical and every time you think about that your mouth drops even more there is some really mind boggling stuff in the action scenes and it is all executed perfectly miller has created an action movie where the action is not only well made it is also beautiful to look at something that other action movies almost never archive like the previously released action blockbusters avengers aou and furious 7 this movie puts both of them to shame and i wouldnt really understand why anyone would say otherwise george miller has done a movie so beautiful in shot composition and cinematography one could say this movie was directed by van gogh there is some abstract scenery and imagery which is wonderful to look at every shot in this movie feels new vivid exciting and is just jaw dropping at times miller takes full advantage of the medium and of his tools to create a movie that will be remembered in the years to come the reviews for this movie have all been amazing and they are all well deserved fury road is the kind of movie movie fanatics love to watch this movie shows that even big budget studio movies can be artistically powerful fury road is simply put one of the best action movies ever made dont miss this movie on the big screen,reality
was that even a movie it seemed to be one long action sequence i wasnt even 100 sure who was until the end of the movie when he says my name is who was the actor i have never seen or heard of him before he seemed just another scruffy male lead with a brit accent that they stick in these films either because all the old standard actors are too played out or wont lower themselves to these nonsensical remakes of classics that should be left as they are if this is a great movie then film is dead clearly this is some new genre of entertainment an art form  i dont know i dont think so more like pointless nonsense i wanted to get up and leave but i kept hoping it would turn into a movie the kid nub was the best part of the film and he was far from fully developed in fact the 2 high points of the film were where brought him the boot and where nux sacrificed himself for the girls as for furiousa  lame why why even bother with her what was her motivation again who was she sure i enjoyed the little homages to the original the music box the boomerang otherwise it had zero relation to the road warrior and let me get this straight hes out in the wasteland surviving unsurvivable situations 6 times over and yet he finds a bunch of hot runway models in the desert who would have been way safer staying where they were and where exactly was fury road  i never saw a road of any kind what was the refinery in the distance that resembled oz  dumb dumb dumb  dreck the whole mess ,reality
having seen the original movies i get a sad feeling that reminds me the actual hollywood disease that has become the search to address all sorts of public in order to go mainstream and killing the actual soul of histories and directors this movie for saying shortly is a castrated one original movies were not certainly appealing for everybody many people enjoyed and elevated them to cult status for what they were a crude vision of a possible future the air of melancholy and grief not to mention the desperate anxiety you experienced has gone completely the intents to express that and resemble the original essence of the series are ridiculous and lost when the hands of advisers and marketing teams are destroying what could be possible vestiges of art here totally gone in favor of a caricaturization of done to be friendly for aged 10 to 16,reality
wow just got back from seeing fury road what an absolutely in yourface relentlessly actionpacked flick this is ive been a fan of the original and road warrior movies since they came out and let me tell you other fans of these movies you will not be disappointed the acting was excellent the story was solid the action was breathtaking the characters were over the top the cars trucks and motorcycles were all appropriately decked out in spikes and guns oh and of course the obligatory bizarre contraptions and weapons for imum damage to the enemy awesome i may have to go see it againloved it loved it loved it,reality
this movie has a good story with interesting characters but the director or the producers has chosen to follow the micheal bay style and to remove dialogues story and character development to create a movie that is a 2 hours action sequence full of digital video effects and explosionsthe people eater the bullet farmer rictus are character that with a few lines could be really interestingalso the story and the dynamics of the citadel could be deepened a bit to give some more depth to the movieif you like brainless action movies maybe this is the best movie you can see these days,reality
charlize therons character furiosa drives to a different route with immortans five wives and some collected gasoline so she could go to this green place a place where she was born in she tells she was taken when she was just a child and furiosa run into this clan of women called vuvalini and for some stupid reason they recognized furiosa how she was taken by immortan when she was just a child how were they able to recognize her when furiosa is now fully grown and they had not seen furiosa for many years eventually tells furiosa that the place immortan controls which is citadel has clean water and shlt like that and furiosa changes her mind about the green place since i guess it was destroyed or whatever and they all decide to go back to citadelwtf are you fvcking kidding me that has got to be the dumbest writing i have ever heard of so youre telling me furiosa went through all of that trouble and she nearly got killed multiple times because she wanted to escape from citadel and go to this green place but when she found out this green place was gone she decided to go back to citadel even though thats where she fvcking came from why is furiosa acting all surprised when she finds out citadel has clean water and shlt she came from there she worked for immortan had that war rig and she took immortans five wives so the whole time she knew and worked for immortan she never knew citadel had clean water that means everything she went through to escape from citadel was for nothing what was the point of all of those chasing shooting exploding and dodging when furiosa is just going to change her mind and go back to citadel jesus the story is stupid and what was the point of dead daughter or whoever she was what purpose did that little girl serve flashbacks of his daughter did nothing for the plot it was completely pointlessonly reasons why im giving this 610 stars are the action scenes were fun to watch and charlize theron looked and acted awesome in this film even though her character was stupid,reality
where to start two hours of special effects bad acting no story driving in the desert the end the movie can we really call it thatas nothing to offer is boring and just a opportunity so sell tickets to iand 3d and big screen tvs the story what story there is none really no exaggeration vehicles driving in the desert occupy about 80 of the two hours the rest is even horse at least when they are driving they dont speak but at least it could have nice driving battles but no some vehicles are fast as hell and catch the good guys very fast other times they are in the horizon and never get close then they get some turbo and catch them and then cant overtake them what the hell sometimes bad guys shoot at everything others just passively watch really this is a complete car wreck just another sequel massacre tv shows are getting better and better movies are getting worse and worse explosions special effects and nothing else,reality
i was a fan of all the older movies this one disappointed me it didnt make me feel anything towards the characters in the movie it had decent action to the movie hardly any getting to know the characters it had pauses in it like a commercial was coming on which should not be anywhere in a movieif i would have know it was this bad i would have waited until it came out on dvd or minimum the dollar moviesso disappointingif you enjoyed the mel gibson movies be warned you probably will not enjoy this movie i would save my money and not go see this movie in theatres as to me it was a flop not worth the concessions prices,reality
typical hollywood big budget trash i found nothing to like about this movie i was hoping that making a film without the great emoter mel gibson would be an improvement i was wrong really wrong this movie is not worth losing 2 hours of your life to watch there was more ham in the acting than youll find in new york deli some scenes did seem to be inspired by the alltime great post apocalypse movie a boy and his dog by inspired i mean damn near plagiarized the movie tries to make up for its lack of depth with over the top special effects this is so typical of hollywood efforts if you want to watch a great post apocalypse movie then watch the classic a boy and his dog instead,reality
its difficult to believe how bad this movie was were talking beyond matrix revolutions level of bad here some nice cinematography cannot save a movie that lacks any degree of character development and a story line that centers around one big dull car chase yes the story is literally a big dull car chase scene explosions and gunfire fill the screen and for the first five minutes it seems like a great way to start the movie but then it keeps going and going before any break is taken youve sat through a full half hour of generic car chase scene and the movie continues like that until the end again throughout this chase there is no meaningful dialogue between the characters not the mention the jarring australian to american accent there is nothing this movie is junk this is mild ,reality
warning stupid spoiler ahead really i rented this piece of crap for six bucks but at least it was better than the force mistaken barelythe only way this movie could have been worse is if adam driver was cast as the lead villain and jj abrams directedthe story or lack thereof was brutal just sucked theres hardly any dialogue in the movie shoot em up blow stuff up is all charlize theron has one arm or hand grodythey fight the crazies of fury road until they reach who cares where and magically theres a bunch of fresh water waiting for them in an otherwise post apocalyptic wastelandwatching familiar titles with these crappy directors and horrible story lines has convinced me that i should stop wasting money on them even ridley scott is turning out crap nowadays,reality
im a fan stating that first right now so its out of the way yet i must stress that even if you have not seen any of the previous movies this stands on its own and actually surpasses the originals so enjoy new comers yet if you crave more please give 2 road warrior a viewingat its heart movies are action survivor chase films with the science fiction premise filling up the setting nothing new in a way the second instalment was all of this though and at very high production and filmed with grand skill and is thus considered to be one the finest action films ever made also has whats considered to be the greatest chase scene ever filmed as for fury road well no spoilers everything can be put into one sentence its all what 2 is and much much morethis should be hands down a best picture contender beautiful madness a rush from start to finish see this marvel on the big screen before its to late,reality
when director george miller created back in 1979 he couldnt have foreseen the impact the microbudget film wouldve had on the action genre not only did it launch mel gibson into an a list star its gritty postapocalyptic style set a precedent for action movies and had a major influence on many directors for the next two decades two sequels arrived in the years following and then nothing the series ended rumours have persisted since 2000 of another sequel but it wasnt until 2011 when the same director miller decided it was time to raise the bar once again and got to work on 4 the wait has been worth it replacing gibson with british actor tom hardy fury road begins with a voice over my name is the world is fire and blood its harder to know who was more crazy me or everyone else we then launch straight into a chase scene over the desert plains of a post apocalyptic desert where is captured by a group of cannibals elsewhere we are introduced to furiosa a pumped up charlize theron who has been tasked by local gang leader immotan joe with driving an armoured rig full of nowscarce water across land in exchange for gasoline instead she rebels and heads for her homeland along with freeing and immortan joes five wives two of which are pregnant and then all hell breaks loose what follows is simply a breathtaking display of action cinema from here on fury road is effectively one long chase as immortan joes enormous army of lunatics pursue furiosa across the endless desert the film slows down briefly to introduce furiosas relatives but the pursuit swiftly continues the action is simply relentless as supped up cars motorbikes trucks and tankers crash flip and explode as they attempt to halt the rig with stuntmen literally flying everywhere the stunts are simply astonishing all the more so that miller insisted that the majority of the action be filmed practically without the reliance on cgi  how no one was killed in the making of the movie is all the more astonishing director miller now 70 is at the top of his game and handles the action brilliantly the locations are suitably apocalyptic filmed on location in namibia and suit the movie perfectly the plot itself is simple and although you dont get much in the way of characterisation it really doesnt matter there are enough glimpses of past to fill in the gaps for anyone who hasnt seen the original movies hardy is a fitting replacement for gibson and does a fine job as however the real standout is theron  shaved head and as far from the gorgeous blonde we know so well she plays the role of furiosa amazingly not only does fury road raise the bar for action movies it smashes the bar entirely sit back switch your brain off and youll have a blast,reality
i have always loved the franchise  and the risk is that an addition many years later could be a real flop not here fury road is everything stands for and more  all laid upon a vast canvas with a rock operatic pulsing score dont get me wrong  if you dont like insatiable action  car chases and madness  they you will hate this film my girlfriend who has never seen a film didnt really think it was great so be warned if this is not your type of film  then the fury road experience will be hours of annoying sound and car crashes for the fans of this genre  it reaches amazing new heights  with finally a director understanding that cgi is a tool that adds to the grandeur  does not replace it performances are solid from the entire case  and set production and makeup are just  well  if you are debating 3d or not i saw it in 3d and would say it adds very little  i think iwould be the best experience as it is so vast as a film if you dont have i then i would skip 3d and go to a good hd cinema with the best sound system in a long list of franchise add ons  miller deserves credit for bringing something even better than the original enjoy,reality
the plot is apocalyptic clichthe villain is unintentionally funny childish and stupidfeminism propaganda is all over the film and is not as important as furiosathe whole film is a ride through a desert and then they turn around and ride back and eventually win in the end yay happy endingits intentionally fast forward and artificial to a degree that laws of physics dont matter anymoreits a great film for teen gamers who love shiny trailers but for me its a waste of time and moneyand yes we cannot trust rottentomatoes or metacritic anymore,reality
its hard to believe there is such a thing as a boring action movie but this is it the movie is 2 hours of car crashes mixed in with a bit of fighting there is no plot no interest in characters no given reason for the fighting this could of been a great landscape if laid out and described better i really had no idea where they were or why earth was the way it was it was tough to choose a side and root for one over the other as neither side was properly laid out for the audience as far as i know both sides were bad and they were fighting over gas and water control a little bit of back story would of been great i love movies that have a distinct before and after taste to them we really had no glimpse into the life of the villain and what made him the bad guy he had the perfect look and voice of a villain but really didnt shine in that role very much i was expecting something amazing and left with a bad taste in my mouth 2 out of 5 of us fell asleep during the movie and i couldnt wait for it to be over one hour long car chase is enough didnt need to see them turn around and go back for another hour,reality
even there are some quite interesting action scenes this movie didnt worth the title madat all i have watched the first two sequels soo many years ago and i do believe that they are superior to this the movie was boring and without a meaning without a purpose with far from logical reality scenes it represented a big nothing to the real madand his purpose survival this film is produced with raw brutality in mind and everything comes second it really failed to make me wonder what comes next the protagonist is such a common like the man next door lacking every characters aspect that previous movies introduced my 12 year boy didnt want to watch it fail sorry,reality
maybe one of the worst movies ive watched a movie with no plot just action and violence without purpose and lame dialogues were talking about dystopia future of diminished oil and water resources and yet both are being wasted with no purpose through the whole film if it was written as a book it should contain no more than 10 pages following the classical action movies recipe the movie contains punches kicks gunsexplosions and awfully bad ass leading actors i guess this one was made for brainless kids and people with no taste for cinema tom hardy acts like a fool i dont understand why he plays like this or why theyve created such a lame character its a pity for charlize theron thoughmovie people spend a lot of money on such rubbish these days and its a real shame while other really interesting plots remain in their creators drawers,reality
every action movie needs to use this film as its blueprint this movie will age well and live on the oscar wins and nominations speak for themselves as they pay tribute to the overall success of how well this movie was created and executedthe first 45 minutes of the movie feels like drinking a red bull the whole time right from the get go we see a car get blown over nearly escaping multiple times a guitar shooting flames and a massive sandstorm and that is just the beginning more amazing wellchoreographed scenes follow with a straightforward story that is easy to followthis movie will age well because it used minimal cgi the endeavor to plan out complex scenes of multiple moving vehicles shows and is rewardinggeorge miller was great with being consistent with characters and their nuances everything from their names clothing to mannerisms all were unique to who they werethis movie is one hell of a ride and will go down as one of the greatest action movies of all time,reality
this is my first review on here i just had to write a review for this awful movie i cant believe this movie has such a high rating the story is just insulting the good guys run away from the bad guys their car breaks down they fix the car they keep running this is the whole movie theres no point to this plot it it so stupid acting wise no stand out performances pretty mediocre the cgi is really bad at times and the ending it just proves that the movie is completely pointless and you have wasted hours watching this garbage i dont mind action movies that just try to entertain with a weak story but theres no entertainment to be found here i could rant all day about this piece of crap please do not watch it if love yourself even just a little bit,reality
i really like the second movie its pretty interesting and the atmosphere is unique i am a fan of that movie road fury its just 2 on the highway chase scene but augmented if it were just this road fury would just be a passable and forgettable action movie but director george miller had the sad idea of transforming a series of action films with male focus in a propagandist feminist product not that i have anything against feminists but its wrong for you to turn something that your fans like and turn into something different any defense that this movie may have falls to the ground the defenders of this film generally claim that the film no longer makes any political comment to the feminist side and the film goes on to value that both sexes are equal at the beginning of the third act since and furious and the other women work together to get saved from the pursuit of immortan joe it would be true but the way it is done its too simple and execution is not good enough considering also the size of stupid things which happens near the end of this movie in which ill speak closer to the end of the text miller just put it in the film to save face if miller had the courage and the quality he would have developed it from the beginning of the film itself to culminate in a quality ending but miller had other interests such interests to win awards and recognition  instead of doing something of quality with this miller may have won some awards from the academy after all when the car chase scenes begin and that awful song begins you begin to visualize the wind heads in the academy awards jumping off the couch and starting dancing and jumping like crazy  and they begin to rave how the world is evil and the fault lies with men the academy has ceased to be relevant since the late 1950s when it began to take political positionsstupid i know if you do not belong to the rebel age group 16 years26 years old and youre not delighted with bad and second rate music then road fury is just a mediocre action movie with 3 scenes of car chases passable and forgettable not to mention miller had the sad idea of leaving the third act of the film with the characters coming back the same way they did in the first and second acts amateuri do not forget the lousy acting of the film with the exception of charlize theron no one knows how to act especially the women of immortan joe who have most quickly stepped off the walkways of a victorias secret event eg rosie huntingtonwhiteley and from acting these ladies do not know anything for sure or the 6070 with a body with only 130lb yearsold ladies coming back with and furious in the third act who begin to beat men in their 30s and 40s with 310lb of muscle easily or jumping from truck to truck or from vehicle to vehicle like rabbits defying the laws of physics even as an action movie this movie is patheticstupid movie no doubt,reality
i hadnt seen a movie before so i saw this movie with thinking this is probably a great movie seeing the high scores so far and usually the public is right but boy is this movie far from great the beginning it was quite ok for me but cmon a 2hour long car chase that is completely the same from start to finish movie has no depth no story just a 2hour long action packed car chase that gets boring after 30min main characters are bullet proof the truck they drove in is bullet proof explosion proof but all the other cars and characterswell you know how it goes right i assume the review scores will go down quickly right now its full with overhyped fanboys rating it 1010 without taking the flaws into consideration,reality
never watched anything so bad and senseless than this horror movie no story just a bunch of people a part must have been escaped of apocalypto before getting extinguished chasing each other through a desert in fancy cars after some girls or for fuel or i dont know what whos oh thats the guy who escaped armageddon to rescue the poor girls which had nothing to wear its all mixed up their are scenes you think your are in the middle of the temple of doom oh no its getting worst lets not forget furiosa well i didnt actually knew that she can drive so good amazing well i have to stop writing because it doesnt make more sense than the whole movie what a mess honestly are you out of your mind any crap is better than that seriously guys this aint worth a staroops to late i already gave one6 oscars well they are definitely out of their mindwell forget the oscars theyve gone anything but this,reality
some people would say that i have no good taste for a masterpiece of art i must agree with this good sound photography and nothing else ok beautiful girls in distress i heard direction come on if i were the director the first thing i would have done ask for another scriptthis is like a bad joke compared with the strength and the whole package of the first movie even with some deficit in the performance of the villains in that movie and much less fx by the way has no charisma in this new filmthey tried scare us with this new postapocalyptic world a funny guy playing the guitar in a truck that was funny really funny at some moment i thought that duffy or bugs bunny could be playing a mandolin next to him by far i am still more scared with the raw cruelty and reality of the vision in the first movie of because is more near about how will look the world in the future for a lot of uswhat happened to miller,reality
i couldnt believe how awful this movie was i had been told to expect a reboot on a par with jj abrams star trek or the daniel craig bonds what a joke fury road is pathetic i dont often write reviews on imdb but in this instance i feel a duty to warn people do not spend money on this film i dont only watch oscar nominated big budget hollywood movies i also watch a lot of b movies and low budget films and generally enjoy them all  provided the film makers are making an effort despite the recommendation i did not have high expectations for fury road because but it did not even come up to my low expectations i honestly cant remember the last time i saw such an awful awful filmhere comes the spoiler bitit looks like george miller took a 30 second snippet of a chase scene out of 2 and played it in a loop to stretch it out to a 2 hour movie i was constantly on the verge of falling asleep none of it made any sense miller should be ashamed of himself try harder try a lot harderrubbish hated it i sometimes rewatch bad movies just to make sure they are actually bad and i wasnt just in a bad mood for the first viewing in this instance i wont bother it was crap,reality
most confusing movie i have ever seendoes not make sense from the begging i had no idea what was going on for a whole hour and i had to stop watching it i recommend it to my friend and he said it looked bad and it was really bad  would not recommend this movie if you dont like grossboring and things that dont make sense movies but this is just one out of the many opinions of many people so read other reviews and compare dont blame if it is a good movie i just think its a horrible movie and nobody under the age of 16 should watch thisso this movie sucks a lot and is horrible like stale chips so dont watch this movie,reality
is insane nonstop destructive action from start to finish and its a hell of a ride tom hardy plays the tough man of few words very well the cast overall fills in the gaps of brilliant action packed acting great special effects great execution and very well made i wont lie it is a bit unusual and somewhat disturbing but we expect that from movies today especially movies like this this movie showed hardys true talent and potential hes gonna be scoring a lot more roles now with this movie and others such as the dark knight rises and layer cake being the driving force behind him overall excellent movie great action acting script and directing,reality
guys its simple fury road is a masterpiece not only does this movie have great action it has amazing characters dialog and heart this movie features great fx that are all practical about 90 of the explosions and action are all practical and makes you enjoy the movie much more the movie is set in a post apocalyptic world and it does a good job at setting a dark tone and world you really feel the characters motivation because of the world the movie is set in the cinematography is also fantastic there is no shaky cam its all marvelously shot the acting is perfect tom hardy as was perfect in fact i think he was better then mel gibson the villain and characters are great also obviously you have but the stand out characters are the villain and the character named furiosia some of the best action includes these characters in the end fury road is a high octane action joyride it has great characters acting story setting and of course brilliant action this is definitely one of the best movies of the year,reality
greetings from lithuaniafury road 2015 is like no other mainstream action movie out there saw it last night in 3d  its a helluva entertainment the crazy high metacritic score and praises from critics werent just an empty thing  this movie is truly great fury road takes place somewhere in between 2 and 3 movie of the franchise but if you havent seen previous movies dont worry this movie stands on its own but its better for you to watch previous parts especially road warrior to get straight to the point fury road is a blast from start till finish its hands down the best action movie i saw in quite long time it has insane stunts terrificly directed and choreographed action scenes crazy twisted and take you right there settings solid acting tight and very simple script amazing  gorgeous cinematography and very good music all these parts are combined together in not very traditional and at the same time masterfully good way this movie feels unique it has lots of explosions but strangely enough we do care and kinda feel every single of it even if characters or bad guys were on screen for just a second there are some truly visionary scenes in this picture which you wont see in a big budget mainstream movies like the one at night in burned land the ending is terrific with a last scene just begging for this movie to be seen again  terrific ending which sort off reminded me of the dark knigh risesoverall fury road is incredible picture it has the crazy spirit of previous movies and if you like this kinda stuff you will be in nirvana watching fury road,reality
this movie is basically like water world meets twisted metal only on dry land and more artistically done without an overly elaborate plotthis movie is very primitive gritty and real and gets to the point yet it does so without selling on excessive gore or other typical sellout ploys theres not a lot of character development or very forgiving moments yet it still shows just a hint of compassion on the surface on occasion deaths are very unpredictable and countless people dying the photography was amazing fight scenes are done oldschool meaning they dont take 6 different camera angles to show a 2second punch scene its done in longer takes so its easy to follow with the eyes yet some some scenes move really fast like its simulating the effects of adrenaline or drug induced viewpoints the film style was unique kinda like a quentin tarantino movie yet not nearly the same very artistic yet raw the music is also like an orchestra going along with the movie the whole time adds to the dramathe custom vehicles in this movie are flatout impressive i guarantee you they must have dumped some serious cash to build them tons of fabrication not 3d effects or prop magicthese cars look like the real deal just a great masterpiece on a sick scale,reality
fury road is such a movie that leaves you spellbound and dumbstruck at the same time it keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire film it maintains the harmony between mayhem and destruction so well that you end up finding it incomparable unimaginable unseen and exclusive george miller has made more than just a masterpiece there would be no better replacement of mel gibson than tom hardy if i have to talk about charlize theron the first thing comes in my mind is her intensity she is way too brilliant in this movie she actually overshadows the rest nicholas hoult as expected  phenomenal and the warlord played by the same guy from the first movie  terrifying character this movie has dozens of brutal action sequences you could hardy even imagine theres a scene a guy shoots fire from an electric guitar will blow your mind this movie is a landmark of action film making calling it an outstanding film would be an understatement you dont wanna miss the best movie of 2015 and perhaps the best action movie of this decade,reality
i watched 30 minutes of this stupid movie hateful violence from the getgo nothing relates to actual behaviour of humans as is typical of many australian movies i cant believe anyone would like this filthy bloodfest you would have to have a mental illness to enjoy it i must say that even before it was made i could easily predict the quality of it charlize shame on you for being sucked in to playing a part of the biggest load of crap i have ever had the misfortune of watching a small part of oh i need more lines to get this review out there what else can i say the first was acceptable but they have become progressively sillier and detached with each boring effort for a new audience please let this be the last ,reality
the first thing to note about the film is that is almost a spectator in his own film practically everyone else gets more action and importancei realize watching a movie for the plot is like going to a strip club for the fine dining butthese idjits didnt even try were gonna to run away and then realize theres nowhere to run to and then come back thats the whole plot of the movietwo hours of car chase and explosions for one sentence of plot and its a retarded sentence the entire premise of this world is that everything is fubar no water no food no gas no nuthin not that anyone seems interested in fighting for any of these missing resources nope they just want to run across the desert for 6 months hoping to stumble across a paradise no one else has found riiiiight roll then there was the standard hollywood made up religion atheists who cant comprehend the faithful mindset try to reproduce halfremembered stories but with a twist it fails as always proving the lack of imagination empathy or even basic consideration of their fellow man that plagues the cesspool that is the entertainment industrysure the colors are pretty the action is almost on par with the other movies made over 3 decades ago which just shows how little an accomplishment that is they managed to seed the movie with endless inside jokes that anyone whos seen the first trilogy would see but only a very select sense of humor would find funny mostly it was just sad and pathetic i wanted to see what this movie could do not be repeatedly reminded of how ineptly it compared to the originalsto call and furioso onedimensional would be generous and they sadly are the most fleshedout characters in the whole film everyone else is just the makeup department being given actors and told to create freaks yawn theres 3 reality shows on scifi where complete amateurs do a better job to win an internshiptheron is continuing her trend of terrible roles that fail to use her proved abilities the male lead who was so irrelevant to the film that i didnt even bother to learn his name spoke mostly in grunts honestly i cared more about nox the red shirt sidekick than i did about then theres the bunch of girls in bed sheets that were supposed to believe is some kind of grrl empowerment according to the latest feminazi bs stupid pretty sluts good only for sex slaves running away while a big strong man protects them gee how could i miss the grrl power message there for all the bs about great music especially guitar guy what little i could actually hear was simplistic riffs jimi hendrix it aint heck guitar hero on difficult it aint the only really impressive part was that when the dude hit the whammy bar it shot flames thats on the pyro crew not the musicianand then worst of all the circ de sole pole stunts that were supposed to be a fight scene that was sad lame and pathetic and then when you start to look into the actual physics braindead fktards should be beaten for that bitthe bottom line is that i pirated this and i still paid more than it was worth,reality
there are very few movies which deliver exactly what they promise and fury road is one of those few this is dark tiring brutal and a very serious movie but it is visually brilliant and there is no complication when it comes to the storyline the movie is nothing like the mel gibson starred but a unique theron hardy show as many of the futuristic movies this is also set on an apolcalyptic world where there is scarcity of basic elements it is ruled by immortal joe who is considered to be immortal by those below him but only few like furiosa theron who knew the truth takes on him by trying to take his many wives away from him into a better place a prisoner of immortal joe who is on neither side happens to be in the midst of this chaos ends up teaming up with furiosa to reveal the truth to the peoplethe film is packed with ruthless action some epic bgm by junkie xl who got us that pump up feeling in 300 rise of an empire as well it is a bit tiring to watch the first 2025 minutes but once you start getting the hang of the story it gets us involved very soon tom hardy hardly speaks in the movie and charlize theron has a very important role nicholas hoult is brilliant a very unique role for him other hot girls like rosie huntington whitley are for the pleasant sight at times if you are a fan of action genre this is a movie you must not miss all credit to the director for the grand presentation of the simple storyline,reality
not much of a wasteland  as far from desolate as you can get there was no consequence to anything  virtually nobody ever died or was shown to be injured  thus any fighting was about as exciting as watching other people playing a sport captain america had more gore with its vaporizing guns than this movie had after 2 hours of nonstop shooting of real guns it felt like a nerf war like the old gi joe cartoon where everyone magically has a parachute like they were glaringly going for pg13 and failed since there was no consequence it was hard to care about any of the characters motivations multiple occasions were clearly made to please the superpoliticallycorrect sjw feminist crowd further weakening the impactthere was no remaining reason for me to be spectating this movie other than to look at pretty imagery and other elements of the film i didnt care about anyone  factions chasing somehow had me rooting for them more than and crewif the movie did one thing very well it was making everything look real and not cg  i havent seen this level of effects realism since the 90s if it did two things well it didnt shy away at showing disturbing things milking csection drug spray paint biological issues of all types except injury but it bizarrely avoided death and injury altogether  jarringly pulling me out of the movie continuously as mentioned above not even dehydration was allowed as everyone magically survived on scraps of waterthis movie was not filmed in 3d and should not have been brought to 3d the disgusting editing resulted in scenes often changing perspective several times per second completely jarring the viewer as they have to refocus every time it was transformersesque in its action it felt like the entire movie was the cliof an action scene  very well done if it had been 10 seconds long turning the cliof an action scene into an entire movie was exhausting after about 1 minute and was torture after 5 minutes i should have been paid 9 to sit through this crap not the other way aroundreservation withheld for 2d version especially if uncut and extended,reality
well the hype machine was running on pure nitro for this one one long road chase no real story characters had no real character and the actors looked boredembarrassed to be there none of the charm of the original this was a pitiful excuse of a remake of road warrior although the film makers deny this if you want to watch roaring cars driving through the desert whilst assorted petrol bombs and bullets fly by then youre going to enjoy this if youre looking for something with a bit more substance then youll have more luck sticking to your hot dog because that will have much more than this film contained i really thought this film was going to be a let down but i made the mistake of believing the extraordinary high score on imdb was an indication that i may be wrong on seeing the film i now know i should have stuck with my initial feelings,reality
i have to believe that the initial reviews are fake especially since there are so many using the same verbiage  like the word masterpiece this film is very very far from a masterpiece in fact i think the word garbage would be more appropriatethe film opens and closes without giving a back story or any character development im guessing were supposed to remember the previous films from 30 years ago but besides that it is nothing more than cheesy cgi effects and over the top action using a lot of stop motion camera work that makes it look cartoonishi once googled why american films have become so bad and the links that came up explained that because much of the film industry money is now made overseas films have to have very little dialogue and lots of action  so that they translate to other cultures well this movie succeeds at that but as far as any discernible plot or concern for the characters  it fails on every level,reality
i must commit that jack daniels was my friend tonight but viewing this movie it came to my mind that you  the director the producer the cast  might need helpso if you just want to talk call 49 201 820500  i dont bitejesus loves youlove ron ps this movie gives the word artificial a new meaning previous episodes were funny junk this movie leaves you with the impression that all the scenes were filmed with expensive notebook cams and then have been put together cut and filtered through approx 2000 advanced finalcut and motion plugins the plot and screenplay have been jotted down in a text editor and the dialogs were written by antman himself all ideas scenes and pictures were stolen from old sf comic books that nowadays nobody knows anymore and charlize has only one armhahaexcuse me but let die please make something new,reality
what a load of hot garbage i watched the original movies and i cant believe im saying this those movies had some class this is just straight trailer trash this is set up for the wwe fanacting horrific acting other than the main characterstoryline there was none just a bunch of crazy looking freaks running around and blowing stuff uptakeaways it is typical hollywood cgi all action no contenteffects effects were descent but there was a bunch of freaks running around in a desert how difficult were the effects filming nice camera angles original camera switching fast pace action shots close ups,reality
this is the first review i have left on this site but i was so shocked with this film i will say this is right up there with some of the worst movies i have watched i am very cynical with people who have had gushing 1010 reviews on this site how can this film rate so highly with so many 110 reviews actually the most i have ever seen nothing in this movie is explained due to the almost non existent dialogue from all the characters you are meant to just guess at the visual meaning of everything the plot did not make sense and it was just one endless car chase scenario all seemingly without any refuelling required no one in this film required sleep or food it seems there were many attempted throwbacks to the previous movies but they fell flat and were soon forgotten in amongst all the meaningless violence that was slapping you in the face i could continue on an on but many before me have already expressed similar findings so i will stop here at least i know now why friends recommended not to see this movie and i can understand why people got up and left the theatre during this two hours of mindless rubbish,reality
glad i only saw a pirated version of this trash and didnt pay a dime to see it yes it is that bad i was hoping for a toughguyagainsttheforcesofevil action flick one where the main character is tough cunning resilient and merciless to those who would try to exalt tyranny and destroy the right of freedom but instead got a movie about a guy chained to the proverbial dog leash actually was on a leash in the beginning other than some grunts and one or two word responses from this movie was focused on charlize therons character which was glorified to the pun firmly intended and shown to be almost super human to the point of accomplishing stunts acrobatics and feats of strength that a man would never be able to do let alone a woman was reduced to being one step up from a caveman and clueless for the most part as to what was going on tom hardy should be ashamed for taking the role this is truly an example of overrated mainstream celluloid garbage fed to the unsuspecting sheep that are todays movie goers,reality
ok no real spoilers here except if you actually like the real movies you will find nothing of any value with this waste of celluloid well this movie was so bad it was all probably recorded on some cheap digital crap anyways in the real movies there is a fight for freedom gas food and basic survival in this pathetic try of a remake there is no real plot no real characters no explanation of anything no conversations that actually make you want to like or understand any of the characters and the battles are so long and boring that you actually hope you have to go to the bathroom so you can miss some of the movie i actually started my imdb account just so i could rant on how bad this was,reality
this is an another perfect example of beautifully photographed and masterfully directed piece of writing garbage except for a nonsense farfetched story there is also almost no acting no jokes and no laughs everything is accomplished through design makeup sfx and cameradirection good casting made no point here tom hardy is not especially if you remember gibson the same goes for other characters mr miller should have left the sleeping dogs lay after 30 years this attempt to reboot fails in most aspects no story no emotions no drama no crazy  yes  no and so on as the title says hollow worth a look though for comparison with previous sequels this movie has no soul,reality
what made strong is the cinematography and the complexity of its action mechanics all of crushing car ware real i even cant get it how the hell miller design all those cars crushing up and down also the stunts were real decent people nowadays whose usually watching cgi style movies will never understand how hard the stunt actions in this movie were for examples  when a biker cross the war rig below it between the wheel when a bikers jumping off the ground up and down when people climbing on the long rod on the car i forget the name it was all real for beep sake those were all hard work in to do my mind beside the actions the cinematography and artdirection were no sht miller was capable of shoting the packs of war cars with beauty and tense he chose set decoration in the desert which really match for the theme itself runaways with strong lead females the other thing that makes me amaze was the scene in the night where they met old friends granma miller using a freaking beauty of lighting and camera shot using a pure candle style in the darkness of desert seriously if we compare this to saving private ryan this movie stand a chance to compete in its actions but from the storyline saving private ryan is much better and of course more realistic to watch mark my words if saving private ryan is a movie which made in this generation it will be a beep disaster because people nowadays have really bad taste of movie only cgi that they thing cool,reality
ive never reviewed a movie on imdb before but this movie was so good that it literally forced me to review itthis is hands down one of the most incredible action movies ever made probably the best one ive witnessed the action sequences along with the booming soundtrack are nothing short of mesmerizing i cannot remember the number of times my jaw kept dropping over the course of the movie the stunts are simply incredible cgi is kept to a minimum which makes it so much better the plot is surprisingly engaging and the character development is exceptional the human angle is at the forefront of this film which only makes the action sequences so much more edgytom hardy and charlize theron are incredible as and furiosa but its theron who just about pips hardy as the bigger influence on the proceedings george miller spent decades working on this film and saying that it was worth the wait is about the bare minimum you can say about this simply put its one of the all time great action action movies and one that will change this genre forever cannot wait for the next one,reality
tom hardy and charlize theron are two wonderful forces of nature bringing to life and into a hellish universe two characters who become classics from the beginning mel gibson gave us the first interpretation of the role but it took revisiting the material and finding a new actor to truly present what is all about hardy is a jaded creation who exists to survive he has that hard look driven and with all of his priorities set to survival mode he recognizes that you cant sit still here and there is no sense in worrying if you want to livehe finds himself prisoner of a set deviantsmutants that plan on killing him for sport soon finds himself in the middle of a car chase that will eclipse anything else you have seen before at first he observes everything around him as he is on the hood of vehicle which is the stuff nightmares are made of in the opening scenes he manages to go through something that could be describe as the place where hell touched earth with lighting storms sand storms wind storms and just about anything else that can be thrown at him he pulls through in what many less ambitious directors would have saved fr the final frames but in fury road this is just the beginning and in the hands of george miller a man who is around 70 years old we get what was just a promise in the previous filmsthe universe is fully developed with just about every hellish detail up on the screen every element coming together in almost a magical way for not much is spoken to allow a skilled director to extract emotions reactions and powerful images from what his camera captures a much impressive achievement when one considers the amount of spectacular moments throughout the entire film as i said before the opening scenes only serve as the launching pad of what will be recognized as many as unbelievable breathtaking and utterly satisfyingin this film vehicles will burn crash tumble fly and spit fire continuously and the drivers are not just ridicule caricatures like those in a recent release there is power disgust hate hunger envy and almost anything else you can think of emanating from everyone on the screen even the angelic wivesprisoners are not empty shells one can feel every emotion by letting millers sirens seduce and leads into total shock and admiration not believing that what we have seen is possible here cgi doesnt overpower and sterilize the content many action films suffer from a mismanagement of resources here miller works with what he knows best but he still uses cgi to increase the power of what one sees in this movie very little looks fake and nothing is sacrificing to reckless waste of moneymiller has given us a film that captures the magic of moviemaking the realization of its power this is the masterpiece many dream of where nothing and no one is spared every penny is showcased one way or another there are no egos to satisfy just goals to achieve and these are accomplished miller should like others before him clean his favorite space at home in order to display whatever type of recognition he seriously deserves much has been made of a gimmicks recently birdman tried to blend the mania of a troubled mind with harsh realityand it sorely failed here is film which entertains never bores and certainly is able to mix intelligence the hells which some beings carry in their souls and the possibility that a future like might not be that distant the film is not fantasy its the type of science fiction which shows the almost certain possibility of what might be comingi never understood why some films had a certainly look but they lacked vision charm or anything remotely intelligent and the disappointment hurt no one will walk away from fury road because miller respects the audience understand that unless some is real and we are able to somehow relate the experience will be meaningless fury road combines the best of acting and craftsmanship its pure powerful and it delivers a visceral punch making the best use of everyone of our senses giving us an experience that feels fresh and visionary miller hasnt copied anyone instead he has set the bar high for many and maybe he will be that inspiration that will give many an idea of what it takes to make an almost perfect film something with much imagination and power something that is quite remarkable considering how hollywood has started cannibalizing its own classics andor surrendering to the desire to just mass produce movies here is a film that proves that its possible to dream even if the images are those who will make you wonder if hell is here on earth,reality
fury road wow it shook me it thrilled me it took me to valhallathis movie gives the people what they want and what they want is something they have never seen before a high octane romp filled with violence that is both exquisite and remarkablei was so enthralled by the movie i could barely reflect on my experience whilst walking out of the cinema i have never seen a plot be stitched so masterfully into the blood lust and furymy only qualm is that i wanted more tom hardy he did great but the strong silent hero could have had more linesgo and see this movie and see it on the biggest 3d screen you can find,reality
im at a loss to explain what movie the rest of the world is seeing halfway through this film i turned to my wife and said surely this is almost over then it proceeded to go all the way back to the beginning in reverse not certain this can even be called a movie a movie has a theme a plot a story characterization this has incredible car mashups that explode beautifully an inexplicable mobile drum quartet fronted by the largest unpowered speaker array seen anywhere and an inexplicable flameshooting guitar playerthats a sequence of scenes not a movie every time the music came up to accentuate the drama i laughed uncontrollably didnt even bother to stay for the credits wanted to save people we know the embarrassment of being associated in our minds with this film,reality
in my opinion a good film requires these elements at a minimum an engaging scriptstory good character development believable acting and complimentary cinematographysound i dont think this film has any of these elements yes there were lots of shocking and elaborate visuals however these were in lieu of the other important film elements not compliments thereto granted characters in a dystopian future wont be particularly relatable but they should have some depth the characters in this film have none i have no idea what those praising the film were watching perhaps this film is an example of a studio marketing machine on steroids,reality
forget the terrible replacement for mel gibson or that it doesnt blend with the seines heres the entire moviescene desertelaborate car chase without any context or dialogueroll end credits if you want to watch a truck drive through the desert for two hours this movie is for you if you like a plot or dialogue or something interesting then you should skip this movie ps its impossible to have a spoiler for this movie theres literally nothing to spoil you need a plot and a script to have spoilers this movie had neither,reality
if you are thinking about seeing this movie because of the high rating let me save you some time by passing on this film unless you enjoy very long car chases with no story this is not for you this mindless action flick is barely entertaining and didnt even seem like a film i like action films but this was so repetitive and ridiculousmade me laugh at times because of this i didnt care about any of the characters because we dont know anything about them the whole premise got me as well what happened to gas being precious and valuable they seem to have unlimited gas throughout the movie never needing to fill up if you enjoy movies without a plot this is the film for you,reality
well i just had to see this one after seeing it snag 6 technical oscars costume and production design makeup editing sound sound mixing i figured wow this must be really good it did beat out star wars the force awakens in a couple of those categories after all so of course my first step was to imdb it and see what the general consensus was and i was never more confused the first thing i saw was a 90 metacritic score and the second was a bline of 1 star ratings coupled with brutal reviews from users hmm alright now i never saw the original films shame on me i know going into this movie completely blind i just didnt get it yeah lots of action right from the get go but it took forever to even know what was going on postapocalyptic world guy gets visions of a haunted past gets kidnapped ok old guy villain with a messed up face thousands of followers obsessed with breeding tyrannical got it thats the first 5 minutes then characters in cars more like dune buggies and a tank leave go rogue get chased by the bad guys just mentioned meet up with the main character through a series of events and dozens of people commence to die in the next hour and 45 minutes of the film during what seems to be just an endless car chase that winds up ending in the exact same place it started wait i get it the people that like this movie also like nascar that had to be it since i fell asleep about the same amount of times during this movie as i do during a nascar race on the rare occasion its actually on my tv however anything being discussed during all of this action between characters was just meaningless as by this point after a good amount of intense carchasing action and explosions were just thrown in my face i just didnt care about any of these characters was the action pretty sweet to watch actually yes everything looked cool but thats not enough id say 2 maybe 3 of those 6 oscars were actually deserved 410 for good action and looking cool meh acting but not much else earning points also big points taken away for being more recognized by the academy than star wars this year,reality
noisy flashy jazzy inescapably visceral and ultimately vacuous george miller more or less remade his own 2 thirtyfive years later with zillions of dollars bigger budget and nought heart there is not a single original idea which is not from the early es nothing makes sense even within the rules of its own universe where insects are the only source of protein but orthodontistry is state of the art tom hardy is reliable as ever and charlize theron is magnificent but even they cant save this ickily camp two hour long car crash which is destined to bring in more gold than an overworked midas,reality
i enjoyed the old movies with mel gibson so i looked forward to this new iteration it had so much potential special effects are better these days and it had a good cast that being said i went in with an open mind there is a some good in this movie but there is so much bad that it is greatly disappointing ridiculous moments include water is in short supply and precious yet when it is doled out by the local kingpin it is wasted with most pouring onto the ground a rock guitarist in red long johns in the desert on the speaker filled truck a nipple chained corpulent character spray painting mouths to be chrome bumper like as an exit statement before dying lighting a road flare inside a gas filled car with no explosion gas aint water folks and on and on my friends and i spent more time laughing then enjoying just like john carter they did not think this through some tighter editing and elimination of silliness would have made a better movie the best part of the movie was charlize theron,reality
i really cannot comprehend how people are rating this film so highly it is just another boring action with with minimal plot the only slight saving grace with this film was the effects if it wasnt for that the film would score a 1 from me i do understand that everyone has different opinions and two of my friends i went with did enjoy it however it really was not my sort of thing if you are into films that have no story then this will be for you but personally i like films with a good story that are enjoyable to watch i could not wait for this film to finish i would defiantly not watch any more of these films it was rubbish the best part of this film was when the end credits came up ive never been so relieved at a film finishing,reality
for the past half a year ive waited with excitement for what i was sure would be the best and biggest summer blockbuster and tonight after over two hours of explosions and carnage when the credits finally rolled i was left with one thoughtis that it at first i thought this was an instance of overhyping the movie but then i realized thats not it i was excited to see and instead what i got was furiosa now before you assume that this is one of those antifeminism reviews i assure you it is quite the opposite i genuinely enjoyed the film and furiosas role as a strong independent female lead had the movie been entitled furiosa or simply fury road i would have given it 1010 stars unfortunately however it was titled tricking fans into seeing a movie that hardly featured the so called hero of the story i refuse to call him the main character at this point on the note of sexism and sexist notions for which the movie is under fire i will say that i was slightly offended at the theme throughout the movie of all men are evil except a few of them who are forced into being good and all women should not trust them if you cant see that in the film then you are really trying to avoid it that is not however in my reasoning towards the low rating as i said before the producers of this film lied to me about what it was i hope if there is a sequel that it will actually feature the road warrior as promised i enjoyed furiosa the movie but please george miller dont lie to us again you may have swindled me out of my 12 dollars this time but i dont think ill trust your work again,reality
i wasnt sold on the movie from the trailers but i had a couple of friends that said they loved it so i decided to give it a shot i went with an objective viewpoint that way i could give it as much credit as possible the best part about the movie is the lack of cgi which i do give them credit for but the story line was horrible and it was not stop action they probably could have made this really good but they feel way short on that i think if they had put more time into the story and less into the action it would have been good and i like action movies im glad i went to the matine showing because this will not be one i watch again i just want my two hours back,reality
this movie have script right out of how to speak pidgin english give or take a few parts this movie make little or no sense this movie full of violence this movie maybe funny in places this movie have low iq this movie make lots of noise this movie have charlize theron charlize anywaythis movie take place in desert and asks the question who broke the world i wonder the movie go on too long this movie make me thirsty this movie i wont see again i got stuck seeing this moviehey thats a cool off road vehicle well there had to be something good in itthis movie had audience surprisingly comprised of older adults  this movie was probably the strangest piece of big studio filmmaking thats ever been created and it made planet of the apes look like an intelligent movie well i didnt think pota had much going for it mel gibson not in this moviewhich was probably a smart move on his part,reality
george miller successfully manages to portray destruction and a vast wasteland in such a way as to make it appear artistically beautiful he takes the absurdity and destructiveness of mankinds postapocalyptic behaviour and depicts in a way that keeps not only your attention but also keeps you on the edge of your seat although there is a minimal use of dialogue in this two hour extravanganza this helps to add to the film as opposed to leaving essential elements out of it the lack of dialogue has been utilized as a tool to build up to colossal chase scenes with dangling men massive explosions and crazy stuntsdue to its stark nature there is a strange beauty in the entire film and with the few beautiful women in the film each time they make an appearance they stand out like an oasis in the desert this movie has promise to have a sequel however  and this makes it unique in many of todays blockbusters  this movie doesnt lead intentionally into a sequel and works brilliantly as a stand alone filmit is hard to say that this film has anything wrong with it its a brilliant art piece unlike any movie i have watched,reality
character development story dialogue acting nopethis is a diabolical film a content less vacuum it is difficult to get 10 lines of review out of a film that basically involves unrealistic cgi cars chasing one another across a desert for 2 hours the repetition becomes trying after just a few minutes the spectacular set pieces lack originality an understanding of physics and any attempt to develop story the occasional attempts to create empathy or develop character are obvious and mawkishas a huge post apocalyptic car champion contributor to an online car wars type game and massive fan of the original i hoped for so much from this film it is sad that this was possibly the worst film i have ever watchedit is sharknado in cars only without the sharksit would have been better with sharks,reality
honestly it is the worst film ive ever watched what made it worse was that the trailer sold me a dream expected a top quality action movie however all it was is complete action it was a bit comical really if you ever get down to watching it keep an eye out for someone with a guitar how bad it actually was throughout the entire movie there is probably up to 20 minutes of actual dialogue and conversation other than that just ball busting driving through dead lands fighting shooting chasingif you really want to watch it fair enough go ahead enjoy but if youre looking for something interestinggood just save yourself please,reality
this film doesnt live up to its heritage the earlier films has characters and dialogue this one didntapart from spectacular scenery there is nothing to praise in this film the postapocalyptic culture was incoherent and it could have been so much more effective the dialogue was a mess and the storyline was moronic there were some good special effects during the car chases but what was the point without a plot good effects are just lipstick on a pigi found myself wondering why actors with talent would embarrass themselves so is it just the money i walked out before the film finished perhaps there was a brilliant ending if there was it was unconnected to what went before,reality
im a big fan of the previous trilogy i saw both the road warrior and beyond thunderdome at the theater when they were new while i had eagerly anticipated any further movies once i started seeing brief trailers for this one i had my doubtsunfortunately i was right fury road is just another modern action movie that i despise it piles the impossible and improbable on top of the illogical and expects you to still believe it it lacks significant plot character development and dialog between characters it relies solely on action explosions fights and crashes to carry virtually any part of the story i mentally turned off about 45 minutes into the movie i checked my watch at 60 minutes in hopes that maybe theyll get realistic and give me a reason to care they didnt the only three aspects i did like 1some of the landscape visuals are good but if youve seen the dakar rally its the same and its real 2all vehicles built for the movie should be on the car show circuit then put into museums theyre really interesting and outrageous 3there were a few good moments and fun lines if you want to see a great action movie see any other of the movies or see the bourne identity terminator 1984 sorcerer 1977 or speed sadly i will never need to see a bit of this one ever again,reality
this is not a bad movie but it wasnt great im gonna give the movie 4 out of 10 because get ready i yawned more times than i care to count it was completely dull oh boy was it dull i mean i loved the first and the second because they were gritty merciless and crazy fury road is gritty merciless crazy and adventurous the adventurous part really turned me off i didnt feel any excitement or arousal or anything for that matter it just didnt get me excited because of the adventurous feel it felt lighthearted instead of tight and fast also it had too many concepts making the movie feel rushed also unfinished concepts are unfinished leading to i feel it is rushedit had interesting themes like survival like all movies tyranny fuel crisis water crisis existential crisis but the themes seem more like excuses to set out the thin plot all movies have thin plots that makes them great except this one we never got that deep into the themes like we did with and the road warrior they just seem to me they were thrown in to fill the gaps because of the lack of sense of exploring the themes but of course the survival theme and tyranny theme is explored but it cant be said the same about the rest of the themes but thats just meit had some humorous parts but they did not make me laugh also although i like tom hardy i didnt think of him as i didnt find him convincing as hughkeays byrne was great as immortan joe but his presence in the movie wasnt enough to make me think this wasnt a boring movie i felt that the rest of the actors were overacting but i might be wrong but i just didnt find them convincing i mostly found the oneliners annoying i would have preferred no oneliners at all and just stares whats with the way is portrayed we know he is and he is haunted by his past but it was annoying with those flashbacks and the way he had to be manic this one was left better for the viewers imagination also the problem i have with it is it is too comfortable to watch it just runs too smoothly it never really got tense or as in i dont care how crazy it is it did not feel like a movie it felt like a disney movie although it looked like a movie ive been looking forward to this movie since last summer because it was except it isnt the stunts were great but it had some awful cgieffects and it was easy to tell what was done for real and what wasnt done for real considering the budget the cgi effects could have been better but anyway it was the directors intention the beauty of the first two movies were no cgi it was all stunt and practical effects that made them awesome this one is one long bore one big dull harmless action movie and we have more on the way i can assure you im not gonna watch the future movies so you dont have to read reviews like this one i also dont want to see this movie again because it is boring,reality
this is the first movie in 4 years that compelled me to make an account just so i could write a reviewbeing a fan of the movies and seeing how this movie was getting such good critics i was looking forward to this movie but now words cannot describe how disappointed i am this actually might be the movie the movie that makes me stop watching movies at least for a while i need to catch some breath at some point i needed to take a break from the movie or i couldnt have finished watching i just had to finish it because i loved the series and couldnt believe what i was seeing i falsely hoped that the movie could get better it is so stupid and superficial i dont even know how to explain its that dumb if i wanted to see stunts id go to a stunt show i watch a movie to be entertained or touched not bored i give this movie a 2 out of 10 the visuals easily make this movie a 7 or 8 but i have to retract points because the story line is very bad i cant believe how bad the story is in this movie and solely relies on visuals there were plenty of moments i was grossed out by all the cheesiness or events that didnt had any meaning or made sense whatsoever i dont know what is more surprising the bad story line or that people think this is the best movie of the year or even this decade and calling it legendary  maybe if this movie had an appropriate rating like 45 then i wouldnt be so disappointed and therefore write a negative review thanks for ruining but at least mass hype works and hollywood earned lots of money,reality
this is a film that leaves the audience with more questions than answers its just an okay film but nothing spectacular that leaves you wanting more it feels like its a cross between the postman  death race with the post apocalyptic world with a bloke seeking redemption and freedom  the very long drawn out car chaseafter watching it has taken me to read the synopsis to at least have some idea on whats happened in the entire film which really means i shouldve just read the synopsis and saved my self 10 there is more holes than there are in swiss cheese in the story line and character archs that go unanswered where subplots get started but are never understood properly or briefly touched upon but not elaborated the film starts off interestingly with being captured and trying to escape but from then on its downhill the portrayals of the characters were the most pleasing part of the film but thats as far as my compliments get for yet again the the 3d is pointless as it adds as much to the film as mustard does to a cup of tea with every so often a grenade or a random guitar comes flying at you so this is a film if you like just explosions and a very long car chase this film is perfect for you if you like a good plot and fully rounded characters then this film is certainly not for you,reality
awesome movie people jumping around on cars going crazy pure insanity that is all i have to say,reality
fury road is george millers latest installment to the franchise i would give it an a for how entertaining it was and how well the story was madefury road is the most badass best picture nominee since martin scorseses 2006 crime movie the departed when i watched fury road the first time i had no idea that it was nominated for best picture this movie was nominated for best picture that is insane i mean out of all the movies they nominated that was one of them i am not in fact i love the fact that george miller gets another shot at an academy award this is the best movie according to everyone in the general population and to myselfwhat i think is nice about the academy nominating fury road is that if you are anything like me and your goal is to watch all the best picture nominees then you know that all you are watching are super depressing dramas and every now and then a dramedy  but remember that a dramedy is still a drama so it is nice to take a one movie break and watch a movie that is filled with violence and gore and scenes of intense action so when they nominate a war film  that is rated r it is nice because half the time it is just people killing other people it is entertainingthere was nothing in fury road that i really hated the acting in it is good it is well done and it is entertaining as hell what is there not to like i will say that there is not excessive amounts of violence in it so if you go in expecting that you will be disappointed but all the violence in it is bad enough that parents wouldnt take the family to it i will tell you it is nothing like beyond thunderdomefury road reminds me of literally every fast and furious movie and i think you can understand why it also reminds me of 2017s crime drama action movie baby driver i think you can see why  yet againto recap i think this is the most badass best picture since ever i give fury road an a for how it was entertaining as hell and how well done the story was,reality
fantastic film probably the closest to being a perfect action movie than any other the black  chrome edition does enhance some scenes but is overall inferior to the regular edition the scenes where the image is sharp is better looking in bc edition while the rest of the movie looks better in color because the image is softer i think the softer images are the product of using software to artificially reduce the shaking this isnt noticeable in the regular edition because of high contrast color on the other hand instances where the images are sharp dont look as good in color because the extremely sharp images with high contrast are distracting  this isnt a problem in bc edition,reality
bonne dieuwhy did you make even encounter thisit was the most shallow gross dumb fullofclichs movie i have ever watched and thankfully it was only 5 minutesplease george miller do babe 2 3  4 5 rather than something like this you make me sad really really sadplusit got 81 from imdb users i lost all faith in human kindi hope we will be replaced by butterflies,reality

washes out all the stank left over from these subversive ricer douchebagcustom car cliques the fast furious movies have spawned that is allon a side note i dont know how george miller was able to get away with half of the stuff he got away with in this movie but he really pushes the envelope as far as the ultra violence goes the only gripe i do have about this movie is how relentless it is it does not let you breathe from one excellently crafted action sequence to the other i wouldve left this review at the first sentence but too bad imdb has a 10 line criteria,reality
fury road is absolutely insane like even if you go in expecting to have your head blown off you will be surprised how forceful the decapitation process is wow george miller you guys this man has recaptured the magic of and given us an updated version of the story that topples all of its predecessors the fact that most of the action was filmed using practical effects just blows my mind even further howcharlize theron dominates her role as furiosa this is truly her movie and she is amazing in it but hey the is back tom hardy is perfect has the road warrior dealing with horrors from his past and being dragged along for an insane car chase through the middle of a post apocalyptic wasteland these two have great chemistry and work well off of one anotherthe overall scope of this film is just incredible while it seems like an empty hallow world there are so many regions and places you can travel the world george miller created is nasty gritty and just plain disgusting at times i was so sucked in to the world and all the characters involved with it i cant wait for more of these i just wanna go backoverall fury road is a breathtaking experience filled with amazing action sequences and some of the best looking visual effects i have ever seen if any film in 2015 unseats as my favorite film of the year we are in for quite a year is incredible awesomeness,reality
as the world fell it was hard to know who was more crazy me or everyone elseto describe george millers fourth postapocalyptic film as crazy would be an understatement because it is one of those rare over the top and unique action films that keeps you at the edge of your seat during its entire runtime with fantastic car chases and inventive fighting scenes that feel like a breath of fresh air in an era dominated by cgi effects the visuals absolutely stun you and millers amazing vision of this apocalyptic wasteland is beautifully captured through the camera it may have taken 30 years for this sequel to be released but it is a huge improvement over beyond thunderdome and it manages to build on what the road warrior had achieved by introducing a much more chaotic world and colorful characters fury road works both ways as either a sequel or a reboot and it erases most of the problems i had with character in the previous film this is a return to what miller had done in the road warrior but with a much higher budget to work with and that allowed his vision to be fully fulfilled here three more films are already in the talks and i cant wait to embark with on his next adventures this is going to be a very difficult film to top and so far its the best 2015 has to offerin fury road tom hardy replaces mel gibson for the lead role of a wondering warrior whos still coping with the loss of his wife and son as he travels through the postapocalyptic deserted wasteland the film begins with a group of bandits chasing who eventually capture him and take him to the citadel where a ruthless leader named immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne controls the water supply for the masses that have gathered below the heights of the mountain where he is based joe doesnt just control the water supply he also has a large army of war boys who he has trained to sacrifice themselves willingly for his service farming women who breed their breast milk and even several beautiful wives to give him children joe has created quite an empire and has been enslaved to serve as a blood donor for the injured war boys we are introduced to this crazy place and its rules as joe sends his trusted lieutenant imperator furiosa charlize theron on a local errand with her fuel filled rig to gasland however she decides to take another route and her intentions are soon revealed she is helping some of joes wives escape from their enslavement promising to lead them to the green lands when joe discovers that she has betrayed him he sends all his boys out on a desperate chase and that includes nux nicholas hoult one of the war boys who is using as his personal blood bag nux chains to the front of his vehicle and brings him along the desperate and nonstop chase that ensues for the next two hours fury road is basically one extensive chase that will get the entire audiences blood pumping ive praised millers vision and his direction as well as the spectacular action set pieces he has crafted but it wouldnt do this film justice if the cast didnt receive its share of praise as well it isnt easy to fill the shoes of such an iconic character like but tom hardy pulled it off in a very convincing matter as much as i like mel gibson i have to give hardy a lot of praise for delivering such an entertaining performance he is one of my favorite actors working today it was also great to see hugh keaysbyrne back in a film playing a different character this time but he absolutely nailed the menacing role of joe nicholas hoult was also a pleasant surprise but perhaps the greatest addition to this franchise was charlize therons furiosa who injects the film with a very much needed feminist tone theron delivers perhaps the strongest and most memorable role in the movie and she is one kickass action star it helped that she got a lot of action scenes where she actually got to do something instead of being the damsel in distress the look of the film is also breathtaking and the way that miller envisions this world is simply fantastic the cool vehicles are built from all sorts of scrappy metals and materials youd collect in the wasteland everything about this film is simply fantastic and the action scenes dont disappoint one bit you will feel the rush from the very opening scene and it will continue long after the credits begin to roll fury road is the best film of the franchise httpestebueno10blogspotcom,reality
i saw the movie yesterday and it was great great actors great atmosphere  im still in this world composed of dust fire pain and v8 engines    george miller the director also made the old movies  and this is a good thingactually there is no big storyline  but there is no need about it  the movie confidents because of its atmosphere pure action and artful images especially charlize theron as furiosa was perfect  hope she get an oscar for this  miller could call the movie furiosa too  she made it  tom hardy as was good too  he interprets his character a little bit different to mel gibson  more primitive and animal  a silent warrior  also the villains are really badass  i wish many joy and fun to watch it  and now start your v8 engines and drive to the next cinema  ,reality
this movie starts with no explanations and ends with none it took the fun weirdness of the original and made you wish you had seriously saved your money the director tried way to hard to push a weird image that he forgot to even think of a plot i am a big fan of the original films so i understand the dialog that belongs to it and this was not it completely lazy writing with a combination of a just dumb story plot made for an overall awful experience the only redeeming quality of this film was tom hardys mannerisms which of course he did well but they should have never even been able to call it in the first place since he wasnt even the main character i could have went to pitch perfect if i wanted to feel guilty for being a man please be advised save your money and your time,reality
you know how you go to any amusement park and theres always that really cool stunt show it could be waterworld at universal studios or the indiana jones stunt show at hollywood studios disney world any of those theres a short little story loosely based on a deeper film plot a good guy and a bad guy both after something they do some choreographed fighting they jump onto speciallymade contraptions some areas are rigged with pyrotechnics and water splashes people are running all over set maybe even cars are spinning around and chasing each other for 1020 minutes its a cool live show and a great opportunity to take a break from the long lines and the rides at the amusement parknow imagine george miller decided he wanted to film one of these shows edit his footage with some colorful touchups and compile two hoursworth of said footage into a film that is fury roadi decided to write this review after actually watching the first and the road warrior so i can understand the backstory of my initial opinion of fury road still stands i really tried to like this film after seeing all of the critics and fans reviews i watched the film twice to see if i was maybe tired the first time i still felt nothingi agree that the action is quite something all of the stunts feel real and noncgi which is particularly rare for films nowadays but so what as real as it was the action felt drivel repetitive and boring i particularly love action films but this action did not do it for me even with the high speed chases that lasted the entire film the deckedout cars the flamethrowing guitars the explosions i didnt feel the adrenaline kick in as i had hoped nor did i ever feel i was viewing a spectacle there were some action sequences i felt were interesting such as the chained fight but they only lasted a few minutes out of the entire film and were mild at bestit had everything so what was the problem what the film lacked was directing the camerawork and direction dont do anything to help place the audience into the action to feel it all i get are either 1 overhead crane shots that show how large the groups are and what surrounding action is taking place 2 long shots to emphasize distance and 3 close shots to show whats going on the camera is only documenting the stunt show that is this film at times where the film takes a short pause in action and progresses its story miller attempts to develop some emotional depth in the story but in the end it only comes off as trying too hard to appear deep and emotional the character development was not there to help the audience understand the emotional momentsfor my personal tastes i didnt find the films theme or look appealing nor unappealing it didnt click with me the cinematography was beautiful and emphasized the contrast in a beautiful naturalistic postapocalyptic world but the costume and prop design i didnt get and at times found it bizarre and gross and oftentimes flatout ridiculous minimal leather gear in the desert mothers basically wearing bikinis and makeup i didnt get itoverall dont expect any plot or character development in this film while this is a sequel and thus does not require deep character development the original series didnt have much depth and development in them in the first place that said you can start off with fury road and figure out what minimal backstory is from there the action is real and unique and yeah its cool to watch live for 20 minutes at an amusement park but two hours no thanks,reality
this movie sets a new low in film making it may hard to believe but any normal person would rather watch 10 x repeats of waterworld rather than watch this movie once i set out with a positive view imagining that it would be somewhere between the original mixed with some modern whiz bang action and a touch of star wars fantasy thrown in i was horribly disappointed for a while i thought it might be a reasonable take off of an action movie with its ridiculous script and bizarre attempts at humour but to no avail in reality there is no story the acting is generally abysmal the script is inane the scenery boring and the action comedic at best it is very difficult to find any redeeming qualities at all,reality
spoiler alert fury road this movie is among the worst movies ive ever seen and that says a lot i am so surprised about the rating this move received both from critics and from people who as i went to see it in cinemas i remember the movies with good ol mel gibson and the era they were made in the story is that some lone ranger who lost his family gets caught by some far out cavemen gangs members with a strange leader then we have another 3 gangs or whatever we should call the our hero is caught and tries to escape and is caught again he is then made into a blood bag and by some coincidence drawn into a chase as a mobile blood bag the chase is all about catching  and possibly killing charlize and her followers who is birth machines of the leader the chase is better than the catch  mterhead is not true when it comes to this movie is teaming up with charlize and they try to escape all of the gangs and eventually meets up with onearmed charlizes old gang  or should we call them a tribe the destination of their escape has turned from green meadows into some wasteland and charlize cries they now team up with the old tribe of charlize and drive back to the evil gang tribes hq to gain control of the evil dictators tribe  gang and give freedom to allfor the love of god the story the plot and the actors are all in all an insult to every human beings intellect there is absolutely no reason to spend 2 hours watching this pile of doodoo not even the action sequences or the effects makes any positive impression whatsoever i watched it with my oldest son  dont tell anyone hes 12 years old and he likes stuff such as grownups 1 and 2 insurgent divergent hunger games even bolt and is basically very easy to entertain through movies and he likes a large variety of genres he looked at me a couple of times and once he asked me  why are they spraying silver lack paint on their mouth i couldnt come up with any other reply besides  well they have to do something he did ask me some questions once in a while during the movie but when we were done watching it he said to me that this was by far the most horrible movie he has ever seen and he is 12 i concurredi remember the cows that delivers milk for the tribe cows being rather voluptuous women i remember spraying silver lack  paint in their mouth before going on a suicide mission i remember wasting 2 hours of my life i will recommend everybody to spend 2 hours doing something completely different  either seeing another movie or simply starring out the window this is 2 hours you will never get back again,reality
100 car porn tons of very cool welded togetherand odd looking vehicles that the gear heads will love other than that a predictable and boring action extravaganza basic story our heroes leave camp in a crazy car and are chased by lots of other people in crazy cars resulting in numerous crashes and explosions the heroes get to some random point in the desert at which point they turn around while being chased by lots of other people in crazy cars resulting in numerous crashes and explosions end of story there are some cool action scenes and they gratuitously added some quasiromance to attract the few females who would waste their time watching the testosterone fest that is fury road a waste of 12,reality
wtf this movie is so bad  i dont know what the rating is so high in the movie they just play hide and seek and is the the key man if the movie without him i think is ok plot in a stark desert landscape where humanity is broken two rebels just might be able to restore order a man of action and of few words and furiosa a woman of action who is looking to make it back to her childhood homelanddont listen to any of the critics who say it is a masterpiece this is not better than aliens terminator 2 die hard predator and even the matrix the most positive thing that i can say is the first hour was amazing but the movie dies after that each character is underdeveloped and a waste all of the actors are wasted except for charlize theron the cinematography is also great but thats itthis is one of the most overrated action films that ive seen in years this will never stand the test of time like the ones mentioned before it will be forgotten years later,reality
to be honest i grew up on the original trilogy and i love it to this day when i heard that a new is in the making i was really ecstatic about it but when i heard that mel gibson wont be well after waiting for so many years for a forth movie i was extremely disappointed to say the least and it got even worst when i heard that the lead went to a limited actor  i am using the word actor in the most loose way i can here who lack charisma and ability to lead a movie like hardy especially when you consider the budget of this film they could have gotten a real star to play the part russell crowe hugh jackman anyonethe rest of the cast didnt add any optimism charlize ill make you movie as long as your check clears theron zo my mom and dad fixed my career kravitz the list goes oni was really not looking for this movie to come out yet i decided to watch it with a non biased opinion so this movie didnt really need a first degree actors mainly because the acting characters and story line comes second to the visual effects if gibson was here it wouldnt make a difference so if you like the 3d movies this one is for you however if you expected to see a continuation to thunderdome well bad luck buddy this movie was made as a reboot to attract new audience and not for the old ones in road warrior and thunderdome you got a pattern the movie starts give you a good build up that leads to the chase at the end it seems that in this one miller told himself wait a sec why wait the entire movie for a chase lets just start the movie with a chase and forget the rest and thats how it goes 5 minutes into the movie the chase starts and only ends 2 minutes before the credits if youve watched road warrior and thunderdome enough times you would see a lot and i mean a lot of scenes from these two movies that looked like they were copied and paste over and over again such as the famous truck crash to the vehicle in front and so on the story is also a big mash mainly from thunderdome instead of tomorrow morrow land here they are going to that green place and as for well he doesnt say much he is supposed to be insane thats what they tell us at least but mainly he acts like a person that suffers from some degree of retardedness even in the fighting scene he doesnt do much mainly runs but nothing more the real stars of this movie are the vehicles and the effects so if you are a fan of the transformers movies this one would be right up your ally however if you are a fan of the original trilogy you wont get much from this movie it adds nothing to the original trilogy story its just an average action movie for our time with little to no story and lots of shiny lights the fact that even if they would have change the entire cast it wouldnt have made any different pretty much explains itself but oh well for us true fans well always have 1 to 3,reality
well this is coming from a girl who loves playing games like resident evil call of duty and dead space so i wouldnt consider myself a girly girl the movie reminded me a lot of ghosts of mars and death race both of which i liked marginally better the guitar guy needed to be the first one to die because he was giving me a headache the plot could be summed up in one sentence i wont give spoilers i love action movies but this movie had maybe 3 minutes of hand to hand combat this scene wasnt even very good and the rest was a car chase one long car chase at least furious 7 had nice looking cars these cars were dirty and ugly which pretty much describes the every character and costume in the movie the scenery wasnt pretty either just wasteland if im going to watch something with no plot it needs to be pretty mind blowing otherwise the action in it wasnt even intense just lots of vehicles blowing up like throwing exploding spears into adjacent vehicles i was bored of exploding vehicles 15min into the action no real intense moments remember furious 7 when paul walker was hanging out of the back of a truck that was hanging off a cliff and he had to run up and jump onto lettis carthat was intensethe main character had maybe 50 words for the whole movie there were also a lot of eew gross moments which were pretty unnecessary like the mothers milk what the heck was that all about hubby didnt like the movie either and this is a guy who thinks mortal kombat heavy metal and the rocky horror picture show are the best movies ever made i usually go by imdb user ratings when i go watch a show and this is the first time ive disagreed with the rest of the users for a movie to get over 810 it has to be captivating to virtually all viewers eg lord of the rings trilogy we went as a group of 2 males and 2 females and none of us liked it,reality
the movie had lots of action with carsmotorcycles etc but had a really loose plot and little character development this made the movie quite boring to watch as i fell asleep and zoned out a couple of times generally it was a disappointing movie and not enjoyable at all as there really wasnt anything special about the movie the ending of the movie was a bit unrealistic in my point of view but at least the acting in general was okay i definitely do not recommend anyone to watch the movie in theater unless you want to hear 2 hrs of loud motors and electric guitars although the movie might be better for those who have watched the franchise unfortunately as a member of generation y i have not seen the franchise,reality
as many have said this is basically a two hour car chase a very violent yet silly car chase the violence is well done and realistic if youre into that but the world created in this film doesnt stand up to even the slightest scrutiny all of the vehicles run perpetually they never need refueling the villains seem to have a lot of advanced technology yet live like beasts the land is said to be poisoned and barren so how have the old ladies we encounter been surviving all these years i guess they dont need to eat kind of like the vehicles never need a fill up the war rigs tires are shredded and then later they are fine seems to have an unlimited supply of blood says that if they bring as much extra gas as they can carry on a motorcycle they should be able to run for 160 days really i know motorcycles get good mileage but come on again is this a primitive post war apocalyptic world or do they have advanced high mileage technology its all over the map there are many more examples of such silliness but most annoying of all is the relentless feminist subplot that is continually rammed down the viewers throat the high rating of this film baffles some reviewers but that where we are in this country this is what sells,reality
if one expects that this movie is worth seeing after the praise heaped upon it by critics sorry but try something else the plot is silly the characters are paperthin and the premise ludicrous the main actors dont even have to act as the only thing they do during most of the time is grunt i understand that one of the reasons this joke of a film has gained support is because it allegedly presents a feminist angle to a traditionally masculine franchise i guess the definition of feminism for the director and writers of this atrocity is some scantilyclad and extremely beautiful women being saved by a female gi joe the whole movie has the aesthetics of a music video with many explosions motorcycle stunts and the aforementioned scantilyclad women which shows that its main target audience are idiots with short attention spans and voyeurs,reality
this movie was bad because nothing happens except a chase in a desert where there is nothing to look at for some reason this one arm chick decided to steal this crazy leaders wivesaka breedersand is chased in the desert and for some reason most of the crazy leaders followers are pasty white and bald why they dont have a tan in a desert i dont knowany way this guy is tied to the front of a truck chasing the one arm chick and when all vehicles explode he lives and after fighting with the chicks decided to ride with them theyre searching for a green area which doesnt exist so they go back from where they escaped and during all this you just have crazy people chasing them and vehicles exploding but there always seems to be morefinal verdict just a bad movie save your brain cells and skip it,reality
in a world of reboots and sequels fury road embodies the bold and creative vision that many strive forwhen first hearing about this film i was all in im a huge fan of tom hardy and the first trailer sold me on a franchise i hadnt known existed prior to this film however this wasnt the case for a couple of moviegoers that i had a brief exchange with the older gentlemen had arrived early to be the first in line for the film and what they said intrigued me quite a bitive been waiting for this film for 30 yearsthats crazy it has been 30 years since the release of the last film and i can only imagine the excitement of having a favorite movie from three decades ago brought back and re envisioned for contemporary audiences in any case all fans young and old are in for one exciting thrill ride that verges on insanitythe film opens with the initial capture of a wanderer who is running from a dark past he is taken to the citadel and is used as a blood bag because of his universal donor status meanwhile furiosa a servant to the evil immortan joe plans a daring escape and helps the wives of immortan joe along the way upon hearing of this immortan joe calls for his horde of followers to hunt down furiosa and return his property the remainder of the film follows the overthetop car chases and battles between furiosa her fellow slaves and the accompanying george miller the director of the film has been in production for this film for the last 25 years and has been shooting it for the past three years because the film has received so much attention the cinematic experience audiences are in for is nothing short of spectacular the cinematography alone is a beautiful and largerthanlife seasoning to the already intense action sequences speaking of the action sequences can we talk about them miller is a creative genius and it shows in these extremely lethal cars and rigs fury roads car chases feature innovative weapons and overthetop pyrotechnics i mean how can it get any better than a guitar that also serves as a flamethrowersetting aside the grandiose action scenes fury road also impresses with its talented cast of actorsthough tom hardy is most known for being a serious and frightening presence his portrayal of the insane rockatansky is not only scary good but funny at times audiences will be thoroughly satisfied with the balance of breathtaking action sequences and brief moments of laughter while tom hardy comes off as the main character in the trailers he shares quite a bit of screen time with other actors charlize theron his costar does a beautiful job of capturing the complex layers of her character furiosa this is also seen in the films hints of feminismthough i use the word feminism apprehensively because i cant think of another word for it fury road clearly wants to say something about the misogynistic clichs present in many movies and it attempts to flip those clichs on their head for instance one scene finds having a hard time hitting his distant target and only has one bullet left in a major rolereversal furiosa approaches him from behind grabs the gun and finishes the job that couldnt and the obvious example of misogynistic attitudes is found in immortan joes feelings toward is wives he constantly refers to them as his property and treats them as such the women retaliate by fleeing with furiosa in the beginning and write on the wall we are not thingsparents should be wary about taking your young children and teens to this film though the r rating may say it all the film also features brief nudity exposing clothing and disturbing images such as gruesome deaths of people and even an infantundoubtedly fury road exceeds expectations and will prove to be one of the best films of 2015 fury road combines the adrenaline high of furious 7 with the impactive action of captain america the winter soldier need i say more,reality
come on this movie dont need words you had to watch it in theaters best movie i watched since 10 last years nonstop action from first second superb acting bombastic camera sound action dont miss this milestone i am a movie fanatic and expert but i cant never remember i was pressed into the theater chair from begin to end and dont getting air this was first time and i think this will not happen again son respect to all people that made this milestone happen i dident buyed a movie on cd since years but if this come on cd i will buyed because you had to have this movie for watching it again and again i think i will go visit it in theaters one more time until it comes on cd that something i never done too,reality
fury road makes every other action movie made in the 20th century look amateurish in comparison there was a jaw dropping moment at least every three minutes the pace was utterly relentless and the level of invention topped anything since avatar its a masterpiece of the genre that kennedy himself created 35 years ago with the road warrior the postapocalyptic scifi thrillerthis is quite an accomplishment for a film with a powerful feminist driving force indeed miller may have created an entirely new genre the post apocalyptic scifi feminist thriller although the term thriller doesnt really do this film justice maybe enthraller amazer,reality
so i have a new favourite movieand it is most definitely fury roadim a big apocalyptic movie fan and am usually very picky about them and if a movie is good i will simply be satisfied with it and leave it at that however this movie is way beyond that i am simply amazed at the masterpiece that is fury roadwhen i first saw the trailer i gotta say i was quite excited it looked like a relatively enjoyable post apocalyptic movie and it had tom hardy in it which was great no complaints there in no way was i prepared for it though every scene was action packed exploding chaos and to sum it up it was pure brilliance and the strong female characters portrayed in it are wonderful and its very refreshing to see that in an action moviei recommend it to everyone even if action movies post apocalyptic movies thriller movies arent your thing i still recommend it im going to have to go see it at the very least 5 more timesif i could give it a higher rating then i would but unfortunately i cant so 1010 but really should be 2010 thats how good it is,reality
it 10 starsits about time there is a well made movie it feel like grunge dark metal and acdc on steroids movie is 2 solid hours long intense from the beginning to the end movie is not for the faint hearted or children it is violent barbaric dark and no humor it borders on nc17 as a moviehopefully the oscars will elect a new topic for best action film and best action actors category,reality
greetingsi just came back from watching  fury road and i have to say i am exhilaratedit is such an awesome movie with such perfectly made action sequencesfrom the first scene we are made to sit on the edge of our seats  this is one of the most wellpaced movies you will ever watch goes down straight to business directing from george miller was a work of artother action directors should take note the cast and production were sublime tom hardy was superbagain in a movie where he was given limited script he shined with his ability to act without having to speak too much i assure you he will be one of the greatest actors if not the greatest by the end of his careersuch a versatile actornow people say furiosa was the main character in the movieit probably was a little more of her story but i felt the 2 characters were equally important and given their fair share of time on the screen i 100 percent recommend this movie  1010 will watch it again soon ,reality
what is there to say that has not already been said in praise of fr just stepped out of the theater  i am still blown away the superb attention to detail every single action shot was a moneyshot the sound was so superb that you could feel the vibrations  the explosions watched it wo 3d  it was still amazing the trailers generally only show parts of the first act  the surprises just kept coming by the time it was over i was left standing there still absorbing it realizing only once i left that it really didnt feel like a 2 hour movie but one intense ride to the gates of ragnarok truly a once in a lifetime experience dont listen to the hype dont listen to the haters or those spouting this movie is feminist garbage dont even listen to me go  see it for yourself,reality
poor casting and storyline i saw the original it was violent it had car battles it had minimal character development i had very realistic expectations going into the theater to see this new versionnever have i been more disappointed with a movie the acting on both leads parts was mediocre at best with the male lead switching from being well spoken to being capable of nothing but grunting the story line seems to have been written and edited by remedial english students the characters are unbelievable and seriously lack any character development it has horrible motorcycle stunts and guys bouncing back and forth on poles of all thingsand come on a flamethrowing guitar and fat women being milked for no explained reason to trade for gasoline to power the flame throwing guitar its full of shitty clichs badly cut scenes and lots of explosions save your money see anything else and you will be better off,reality
this movie was made for 1 reason and 1 reason only to look really good in 3d take away the 3d and the big screen of the theater and you dont have a movie left you have a bunch of action sequences and special effects thats it i personally cant see 3d and i saw this movie on cable the amount of stuff flying at you in this movie really took me out of the viewing experience seriously everything was just coming at you not in 3d just on the screen to the point where i kept saying to myself this sequence was shot just to be shown in 3d there is no other point there is almost no plot or character development at all its all action not substance after a while its like eating too much sugar you just get sick of it i was bored and annoyed the whole time if i saw it in 3d and in the theater i may have loved it but honestly the true test of an actual movie is if you take those away does it hold up and sadly i can say this does not,reality
absolutely no logic scenario doesnt stand one second the end lasts 1 minute i dont understand the praise around this movie its totally useless winner of utmost ridiculousness in many aspects the guitarist in the middle of a war zone what the heck for waste of time nonstop driving and fighting in the desert the acting isnt great especially for theron who usually is a great actress perhaps the insipidity of her role discouraged her so there is blood no scenario or story driving killing and voil not much more to it watch something else this is a waste of your time there is so many good movies,reality
mindless violent crap nice cinematography lots of loud explosions little that resembles a plot is this what passes for a good movie in mainstream hollywood these daysdespite being skeptical after watching the ads i decided to give this a try after the high ratings and my enjoyment of at least the second film from the early eighties it had wit dialogue and a semblance of plot to go with the violence nothing in this excuse for a movie to resemble road warrior cartoonish characters silly masks nonstop explosions pointless plot some of the scenes were filmed well i guess so theres that but not enough to keep me going through this drivela 14 year old boys movie i guess,reality
when i went to the cinema i knew nothing about this movie except that it has a high score i had my hopes high but ive never been so disappointed ive seen bad movies in my life but at least theyve been somewhat entertaining because theyre kinda funny for being so bad this madness on the other hand wasnt even funny it was dull and boring for half the movie i waited for some kind of story starting to develop but then i realized that this movie has none the mindless driving is all that there iswarning im spoiling the whole movie now fury road lasts exactly 120 minutes but it could have lasted as well 60 minutes because the other half of the movie is an exact copy of the first half only backwards then it would have been a disappointment instead of a double disappointment all in all if you like watching people driving cars for one hour from point a to point b and another hour driving from point b back to point a then this movie is for you otherwise dont bother,reality
definitely my favorite action movie so far it is a simple plot but with the amazing pos apocalyptic world to backup which adds up to the history the action sceneswhole movieis amazing i thought it would get dull to see always the same type of scenes which were cars exploding but it was so well organized and beautiful that you can only get amazed by then never tired the cars were crazy and awesome the movie brings finally a great female character which many do not try actually this brings me to my final point and the only point i did not like tom hardy was definitely overshadowed by furiosacharlize theron i am a big fan of tom hardy and i think that he was perfect for the character although i think that he did not give his best in this job there was a lack of madness on him i cannot blame only him for this as it was impossible not to be overshadowed by charlize theron there to sum up the movie is an instant classic action movie with amazing but a simple plot and great supporting actors and actress i had to hold my self not to applaud the movie at the end and look stupid,reality
understand first where i come from i am a die hard fan of the terminator saga and particularly loved t2 i watched all previous movies and i did like them and i have seen pretty much every postapocalyptic movie and tv show there is because this is how i rollso when i come to see 4 i know what to expect i know its going to be pretty much action everywhere a bit of background story and some character development to keep it all somehow together i do not expect more but i also dont expect less because that is what the franchise has been giving usthen before i get to see this movie i read all sorts of great reviews from everywhere i do not read spoilers and i do not watch trailers but i can feel from all these reviews that this movie seems to have something going for it it even ranked number 1 of 2015 in imdb the very site where i do all my movie reviews so i decided to give it a gounfortunately this is what ive found a benny hillesque type of movie but without trying to be fun also without any character development background story or pretty much anything other than action that gets boring after the first five minutes of itand its not like the story didnt have a change to fill those gaps the main characters give us a hint even sometimes a mysterious indication of things that happened to them and things that they wanted what happened to character xs past that are so present in the movie what sort of accident happened to character y why character z became the big boss of that one tribe unfortunately there seem to be no time to answer any of these questions or any question for that matter nor time for any development or attachment whatsoeverspeaking of time you may argue that there was none for all the questions i had well 4 is a good 2 hours so i tend to disagree with that the movie could easily do without 20 minutes of meaningless vehicle chase and put that time for the audience to learn the bare minimum about the characters so we did not feel we where the audience of some sort of monster truck showto make matters worse the movie dont even have the minimum respect to fundamental physics and nope i am not splitting hairs here i am not going to tell you that a vehicle cannot fly that high or anything like that i am going to stick to the basis humans cannot run as fast as moving vehicles at high speed humans cannot run for miles without panting for at least a couple of minutes pregnant humans on their nine month of pregnancy cannot run as fast as nonpregnant humans and of course if going in a hurry from point a to point b takes x hours going back in the exact same route with the same hurry should take more or less the same time but not in the world of 4 here everything goes because apparently the audience will love the franchise so much that it will justify every single of the many errors of this moviethe funny thing is that for a while it seemed to work i went to watch it with someone not familiar with the franchise and for a while i tried to forgive and explain the movie as in well maybe the vehicle looked like in a hurry but in reality was making 2 miles an hour but at the end my companion and i decided to laugh it off even though the laugh was on us because the investors of these movie were the ones pocketing our cashso my advice to you is the following do not bother wait until it goes for free on your tv or you have a long flight and its on or skip it all together watch again one of the old movies and be done with it,reality
i first saw this movie while at my boyfriends grandparents house and since i didnt have the authority to simply get up and change the channel i had to suffer through this whole entire movie and let me tell you i suffered personally i dont enjoy the genre of action movies as a whole for the most part the whole car chase explosions and demolition concept gets very old very fast however for this movie that is literally all that happened it was one gigantic car chase with no reasoning behind it no character development no plot absolutely nothing i can appreciate that these effects were somewhat hard to create and i give props to the editors but this was just overall absolutely horrendous sitting down for over an hour to watch this made me feel as if i had lost over half of my brain cells and may as well have fallen over and started oozing out of my mouth by the time it was finished unless youre a person obsessed with watching stuff blow up or someone who can somehow suffer through this movie even without any plot whatsoever definitely skip this one i promise you will not be missing out on much of anything,reality
a trash movie which tries to resemble dune and metropolis there is no plot except for a car chase there and back no acting is needed either all the good guys survive all the bad guys die filmed around beautiful desert landscapes with snapshots carefully planned by graphic designers feels like flipping a comics for teenagers or watching someone playing first person shooter or racing video game as usual on imdb the current high rating is due to flow of fans of the earlier movies who would probably be disappointed comics or games i wouldnt recommend it to any serious scifi lover to fill the needed 10 lines the only thing that is worth praise is the stunt team some motorbike shots are excellent graphic designers also did their job quite well but their skills could be put to better use,reality
are reviewers serious about this movie i didnt find anything interesting about it  absolutely nothing the directors created a narrative so viewers who like really loud noise pretty faces playing badass roles and blood can scream bloody genius but seriously it doesnt cut it for me not only it gave me a nasty migraine from all the screaming loud music and engine sounds but its about the worst movie ive ever seen get a grip i am pretty sure even the minions would have been more entertaining the movie is undoubtedly well made from a strict filming perspective some of the images are beautiful the actor are talented the stunts are impressive with that being said those are not the main reasons why i will watch a movie,reality
so as if american sniper and avatar and the countless action scifi adventure movies are made to exaggerate the machismo of the male sex this movie is a very action packed but extremely selfindulgent monstrosity of that concept teetering on illlogic and sense wandering aimlessly between cinematographic brilliance and irrelevance dialog that is so shallow and often headscratching that you would have to fight your sensibilities to continue watching this movie or to end the suffering as these waves of discontent build to a crescendo usually the actors make wonderful choices theron and hardy in roles but even they couldnt safe this one i will say that a positive is the redemptive value women are afforded in this movie even though the general theme of most movies is hypersteroid overtestosteroned men with dysfunctional social tendencies and the submissive subjugated women subjectsthis one offers a bone welcome perspective and i imagine this is the only reason the two actors mentioned took part in this dog,reality
i just dont understand how someone with a brain can praise this movie and write 500 words glorifying this piece of crap i just dont understand it i wont say anything new what has been said before in the negative reviews and i can only agree with everything they said i just wanted to write down my disappointment and here it is in the peek of the movie i went on my phone to download some appsand i downloaded for about 56 min then i started to play some games well then the movie ended i watched some really bad movies and i watched them from beginning to end but this was really boring and predictive like some one else said you can easily go to the bathroom have a shower and come back to the movie and you wont miss a thing acting was non existent the only good thing about it was a few nice camera moments and photography everything else is just simply crapdied in this movie if you ask me give it to michael bay next time at least well have some nice blockbuster action scenesand fewer more lines for the actors or go crazy and give it to terry gillian hell make a crazy movie but at least it will have some message and story no matter how crazyman i wrote to many words for this crap movie,reality
i have decided to spend saturday evening with this movie and this is my second failure since spending money on prometheus yes there was charzile as well  i am not going to say it is completely her fault but accepting screenplays makes her little responsible as wellshort story of this movie road theresomewhere and back  we kill some people and that is it nothing else no story to tell no real explanations  nothing  just to show you effects almost naked beautiful girls and unreasonable dialogs  are we people so dumb to accept this in a movie and give it almost 88 points of 10 in year 2015i give it three stars only because there are worst movies than this,reality
wow this is one of the most boring movies i have ever seen in my life dont get me wrong im a massive action movie fan but this was horrendous ive been a frequent user of imdb but today i specifically created an account just to say how bad this movie was if you liked lethal weapon the terminator or any other decent action film then this will sorely disappoint you the only thing fury road has going for it is the ability to say hey it was 2 hours of nonstop action with no plot and no depth of character development no matter how many explosions there were this movie had me checking my phone and nodding off every 10 minutes ill stick to the original ,reality
this film tells the story of an able fighter in a part apocalyptic world who helps a group of women to escape from the evil and cruel king who controls water supply fury road has really good reviews but it is completely not my cup of tea firstly i wish they discovered other colours other than brown everything is brown from the landscape the vehicles clothes and everything else secondly the whole plot is quite ridiculous if the blood bag is so important who put him in front of the fighter vehicle which is the most vulnerable place in addition there is a guy playing guitar in the battlefield which is ridiculous and spraying the mouth with silver paint is just weird actually the whole film is so ridiculous beyond description i didnt like it at all,reality
is the most insane yet perfectly executed movie i have ever seen fury road is an add on to goerge millers franchise goerge miller also directed this film and gave us one of the most insane yet perfect moviesever the entire length of the film your eyes are glued to the screen and your jaw is glued to the floor the action sequences are brilliant and over the top this movie is practically all one action sequence there isnt much plot but there isnt a need for one the action sequences are executed perfectly the special affects were not only spectacular but also moving every angle the atmosphere the car chases and then there is the storm during a car chase a giant dust storm appearsand the action continues inside the storm lightning explosions and slow motion kills make this one of the best scenes i have ever seen in a movie the characters are all awesome and the acting is great the nemesis is terrifying and so are all the characters chasing after the soundtrack helped give the movie a dark and at the edge of your seat feel this movie is truly a milestone to the action film genre the movie is a masterpiece it is dark yet beautiful at the same time every other action movie pales in comparison to this film this movie raises the bar for action films to come this is a film you must see on the big screen to truly fall madly in love with it,reality
i will keep it short and simpleif you are new to the franchise read about it read the fury road wiki page go watch on a large screen i was amazedi am not a fan of 3d  so i just saw it on a standard large screen not i i will try to see it again on iafter the movie was over  the auditorium was in complete silence awestruckand then came a roaring applausegeorge miller proves he is the best on the desert oh what a movie  cinematic spectacle batman begins avatar fury roadatlanta ga ,reality
you have to open your mind and not to be burden by previous movies with mel gibson to see a movie like this today is so refreshing it is proof that movie action packed like this doesnt have to be stupid and plain like transformers my wife didnt knew nothing about and she put pretty much everything about world it is set in that is also what i liked the most there was no pathetic voiceover who explains everything no drawing of the circumstances they live in it is clear by the simple actions of movie charactersdownside is a bit underuse of tom hardy as he isnt that and he is simply overshined by incredible oscarworthy charlize theron it is amazingly entertaining and fun movie to watch i enjoyed it and when a left the cinema i wanted to stop people on the streets and tell them how good it is,reality
wow now thats a movie worthy of all the hype a non stop roller coaster ride with no brakes from the sounds the visuals the stunts the costumes the cars the girls darth vaders brother and finally to our two protagonists everything just perfectly casted charlize casted as imperator furiosa was brilliant i cant think of any other actress who could have played her part so vigorously and with so much passion she truly stole this film away from who wasnt shy to give away his last bullet coming to who is played by a rising tom hardy is a man seeking to survive in world that has lost all law and order something once upon a time he was very familiar with now just wandering the desert seeking to survive while being haunted by ghosts of his past is quickly thrown into chaos later must choose whether to ride off into the dessert sunset or like his copartner furiosa seek redemption some people have discredited the film for a lack of character development and dialog but when you having a horde of maniac destruction derby fanatics hunting you down the last thing you are going to do is stop for a break sip down on some mothers milk while discussing your life storyyeah i wouldnt either in terms of the film being too feminist who cares after all it was mans fault that caused the world to turn into darkness so whats wrong with having some women turn the switch back on overall it was absolutely brilliant that you might have to take a sleeping pill when you get home,reality
hugely disappointed so loses his car two minutes into the movie and spends almost the rest of the movie driving around the wasteland inside or on top of a tanker with a bunch of supermodels with the lead lady looking like a boy escaping from a bunch of morons with the main freak looking like the predator from that arnold movieyeah yeah the effects are good  lots of cgi explosions and havoc  like in a michael bay movie but since theres no real story here and tom hardy hardly utters a word throughout the movie i am left to wonderhow the  did this get 85 rating on imdbthis movie suffers from really really sloppy storytelling we know that has a backstory because of his flashbacks and that those flashbacks are a cause of his inner pain but they are never explained who was the little girl that he keeps seeing in his dreams and where did all the old women on bikes suddenly come from we never get to learn about anyone in this roadkill besides the furiosa womenbuuuh,reality
from the very start to the very end i felt on edge this movie is so jam packed with action that there was no chance to calm myself down between scenes the storyline was fantastic the action scenes were the best i have seen in a very long time if there was cgi used which i am sure there was it was pretty much seamless this is the kind of movie i want to see more ofcharlize was hypnotic to watch so so well done tom did a great job considering when you think you of course think of mel gibson the bad guys were menacing and the vehicles used in the film were frightening but so well done the people who put them together should be extremely proudits not often you can walk away from a movie and still have exhaustive thoughts about it hours later but this one you just cant get out of your mind soooo much detail i will need to watch it again and againyou must see this movie,reality
i understand why the movie won awards for editing and special effects was excellent in the road battles but in terms of story and character development this movie was awful how does rotten tomatoes rank this movie so high another great example of when not to trust movie critics when nux is the character with the most development that should really speak about the movie himself could have been left out of this whole movie and it would not have made a difference a little less action and some more plot development in the beginning would have benefited this movie i was left at the end of the movie asking myself why did i just sit through thisavoid this movie if possible,reality
what can i say i was expecting to see something at least cinematography was gorgeous i wish i could give the movie more positivesthere was no story to speak of the action scenes were supposedly good because its practical effects but really thats only half true  some of the visuals are still computer generated some of the imagery is so odd like a guitarist on the back of a truck that spews flame for no reasonmost of the scenes with the pathetic savage men are conceptually interesting because they are people who know the world only after the apocalypse but their conversations are so childlike and disconnected from the way we talk in the real world that its really difficult to relate or even understand half of the things they say and even less why they say them many of the things seem to have no rhyme or reason and do ritualistic things like paint their teeth silver with a toxic spray canthis is supposed to be symbolic of religion ideology something it really made very little sensethis is what the whole movie is like just a whole lot of nothing a still frame of it might look good but nothing about the finished movie is worth sitting down for even the sound was completely unremarkable,reality
seriously what happened and the road warrior were gritty uncompromising atmospheric and above all character driven they deserve their status as classic postapocalyptic films fastforward 30 odd years where we have fury road minus mel gibson but george miller still in the directors chair and it is impossible to recognise that this is meant to be linked to the earlier films its a film that is about as subtle as a jackhammer to the headthis is the story and a load of women drive for days in one direction to escape a dictator who pursues them then they turn around to drive back to where they came from that is literally it to say the film is thin on story would be a gross understatement not just that but the whole plot is a device in and of itself theyre making the journey to escape immortal joe and to reach paradise except it turns out that there is no such thing as paradise anymore they are in a postapocalyptic world for heavens sake i think its obvious that anywhere even remotely pleasant would have been long gone to add to the insult is absolutely redundant in this film for one im amazed he agreed to such an absurd idea to begin with hes not stupid and two its not his film you could take him out replace him with another girl and it would make virtually no difference to anything that happens the characters are just weak as we learn nothing about any of them beyond a very simple motivation which is all we get why should we care about any of these onedimensional cardboard cutouts the action can be summed up in one word overkill there is a reason that not many people try to make films that are literally 2 hours of action scenes because it will eventually get tedious and boring which is exactly what happens here on about the third time the truck is attacked i completely lost interest because i knew none of the major players were going to be killed for action to work you need to feel like the characters really are at threat and will lose something which i never felt and as a result it simply didnt work by the halfway mark i was seriously weary because the action sequences just kept banging on there are hardly any slow or character building moments with those that appear literally lasting a minute before quickly moving on to more explosions and cars being flipped over most of the sequences being practical effects is impressive but its nowhere near enough to use it to praise the film to death like so many have as stated youd be totally wrong if you thought we were going to get strong and interesting characters to make up for the other areas everyone said charlize theron gave a great performance but i saw no evidence of that because she resembled an oak tree more often then not all she did was brood or look angry wow thats difficult to do she handled the more emotional moments if you would even go as far as to call them that horribly and with an expression of total boredom tom hardy who is usually solid as a rock is a horrid choice as his expression never changes from confused neanderthal and he delivers the dialogue as if hed just been kicked in the head by a mule not to mention he suffers badly from russell crowe in robin hood syndrome as his accent constantly swings from good day bruce aussie to vaguely cockney to just incoherent mumbling everyone else is barely worth the mention the girls who travel with them not one stood out or had any character beyond angry immortal joe dull as dishwater even nicholas hoult is wasted as an extremely annoying rebelvisually the film is very creative and looks unique which is probably its best feature the world created is colourful and grimy exactly when it needs to be that said i dont think the directing is anything out of the box its simply not as frenzied as other recent action films looking at you michael bay and some of the cgi is ropey when it pops up the are also a few surprisingly funny moments notably the fella with the flare which are a welcomed release from most of the straightfaced nonsense taking place i do think the film is too weird basically just to be weird i mean immortal joes gang have a guitarist whose guitar shoots fire sure it looks cool but it makes no sense yes its a strange world but does it have to be an impractical one too im really not sure why fury road is getting so much acclaim is it because it used practical effects in a time dominated by cgi i actually think it is simply because it has nothing else going for it the story my last trip to the toilet had more of a plot the characters calling them planks of wood would be an insult to planks of wood the action its crash bang wallop for 2 hours nonstop the whole thing of visual storytelling is simply an excuse by brainless people to basically admit that when you think about it there is no story heres a tip to the creators the two key things in a film are story and character when your film severely lacks both then youre already in trouble,reality
fury road is a visually stunning masterpiece by george miller its been 30 years since millers last project the last of the original films starring mel gibson comparisons cannot be made as ive yet to watch them there are no excuses crazy adventure may not take him very far but the world in which he resides is imaginative the vast wasteland surrounding small territories show how bleak everything has become water is sparse and saved for the main cretin and his crew weird cultlike followers with their bald heads white painted bodies and addiction to silvery substance follow his orders theres no sign of any nature only a rumour of a place populated by trees and running water therons barbariclooking furiosa with her metal arm and gigantic tanker thwarts her bosses orders and steals that which is most precious to him immortan joe keaysbyrne gathers his whole force in pursuit what emanates is a fantastically frenzied chase across the desert mmfr is full of insane car chases the cars are a sight to behold in themselves incredible explosions and well thoughtout action the 3d isnt necessary only one part stands out in particular and the story is only strong enough to keep the action expressive hardy with his gruff voice and limited dialogue is secondary to furiosa his serenity and coldness towards others makes him the perfect character to explore flashes of his family from a world once known haunt him constantly fury road isnt just creative and captivating to the very end it sets up potential for expansion after this ride itd be criminal for the film studio not to,reality
in apocalypseland rokatansky finds himself strapped to the front of a vehicle forming part of a convoy crossing the desert in pursuit of a bus which has hijacked the harem of some feudal overlordtype in a mask whose name i didnt catch in fact i didnt catch any name apart from charlize therons character imperator furiosa escapes and after some disagreement ends up helping the brides i was very excited about the original because i love postapocalypse fiction and the first film in the original series actually started by addressing the crumbling of civilisation showing a bridge between familiarity and the new order hindsight shows that what creatordirector george miller really wanted to do was get as soon as possible to a place where is a lone proponent of traditional values in a world which appears to consist entirely of feral gangs victims and sand fair enough but its not postapocalypse is it its an alternate reality fury road is a continuation not a reboot in which an entire subcivilisation has built up in a remarkably short period a cop before the fall is still a young man but the feral youths here have their own mythology and how come in this bleak arid world has the petrol not all evaporated how come people are happy to waste petrol and water both of which have to be scarce resources world makes no sense within the context of its own origin thats why the original series annoyed me and this addition doesnt change thatin terms of eye candy its certainly spectacular there are some phenomenal stunts the effects work is good and the desert locations are dramatic but the story  an extended chase for two hours  is no more than a hook to hang the visuals on the characters are mostly uninteresting and undeveloped not that it matters because this film isnt about character at all and is uncharismatic because tom hardy doesnt get to give an idea of what sort of person he actually isif you like the idea of spending time in the eyecatching interior of a biscuit tin and being violently shaken for a couple hours then i suspect youre going to really enjoy this as for me it tickled my eyes but i would have liked a bit of food for the brain too i have friends who rated it highly i had hoped i would too but im afraid i have to record overall disappointment this is an empty empty film and im not in a hurry to see it again,reality
i hadnt realized how jaded action cinema had become until i watched this ive been joining the lines and buying the tickets for the marvel onslaught since iron man watching the hobbit trilogy with my eyes half open with the sameness of it all i loved the birth of cgi after the abyss and t2 and gasped in wonder at gollum and caeserbut eventually all of the third act of all action movies became saturated with digital everything now comes fury road an analogue testament to practicality and inventive insight into making it visceral now i know there are digital effects in this im not stupid but they are there to enhance polish and assist in the stunt work and vision of the director not to bury the artistic nature with endless repetitions of glinting dangerin road there are characters people who we can identify with and see them change and grow through the shared experience of their struggles you can feel the fear and adrenaline within them you can feel the danger the closeness of death millers created world is dazzling in its realness and the photography is blistering to the eyes i was overwhelmed by the color palette he used and to hear the audience stunned into silence was fascinating the person i was with forgot they had popcorn until the credits rolled maybe those spoiled by being raised in the transformers era can believe in the power of filmmaking for the first time for myself born in the 60s and raised through cinema of the 70s and 80s watching a 70 year old millers cinematic art form on the big screen made me feel young again,reality
there is no context no real story no real explanation for anything the action sequences are jarring and poorly edited as well as being artificially sped up and done poorlythe action sequences are fine i suppose but arent particularly wowthe story what story there is none the movie starts at one point reaches the end then goes back the same way its like they had limited places to shoot in or just couldnt be bothered to go that little bit further to make a good story the dialogue when it ever decides to show up is dubbed and unintelligible because they sped everything else updont even watch this it is boring even worse than dracula untold,reality
just finished watching this movie fury road after praises about its spectacular trailer from my friends i was highly bored to death during this movie after the first 1 hour after that there is nothing to mention about in this movie nil character development zero background on main leads and villain poor screenplay insanely boring huge explosions and flying cars michael bay movies can be relied upon for this cinematography mean machines and bgm are somewhat the saving grace of the movie but these still do not make the movie worthy to be watched give it a miss and you wont miss anything in your life trust me one hell of a highly overrated movie avoid on torrents too,reality
such wasted potential i mean there is no reason tom hardy was cast here and i love tom hardy he does nearly nothing maybe it should have been called ine as charlize theron is the leadif your idea of fun is a two hour action sequence this is your movie how do you suppose this was pitched i cant think of any way to describe this and have even the faintest hope that financiers would say wow how much do you want more pointless spew for the vidiot generationthe bluray extras are actually far better than the movie its a fabulous achievement but this isnt a movie,reality
tom hardy manages to grunt his broody way through this luckily he had his few lines written on the back of a postage stamp to help him remember being a canny lad with a few primo performances under his belt like bronson and the drop he realised that the over reliance on 3d effects would negate the need for him to act so didnt i watched this in lowly 2d yet was still annoyed by all of the effects departments arent we clever 3d moments which came thick and fast to the point of saturation the only real surprise is that no one stuck their finger or face right up to the camera lens the post apocalyptic steam punk world has evolved faster than first portrayed in the originals so the space time paradox starts either that or is getting younger every year as a result of radiation poisoning how can a whole culture including language religion and aristocracy evolve in a decade or two it makes no sense not even east london changes cultures that quickly and its done yiddish cypriot caribbean bangladeshi and ultra cool white media types in less than 60 years the breeders fresh out of modelling school and a beauty salon were the cherry on top bad man wants to breed warrior sons yet chooses the skinniest and ergo the weakest of all the females to do this surely he should have enslaved the butchest toughest and strongest of the women for this purpose its no fun for either party when bonking a butch dike but it will certainly produce warriors but reduce the possibility of appealing to hormone riddled teenagers and sex starved dads in the potential audience no loss of kerching for the sake of believability here eye candy  mucho deniero even in radiation blasted desert wastelandscharlize therons character had some charm and depth  hard for a one armed trucker with a gun role so she is forgiven although we didnt see her map reading or parallel parking skills a legendary problem for all one armed road kings around the world with or without a middle legif youre new to then this is an almost okay good vs evil half road movie  why half because they change their minds and come back again if youre a fan of the original do yourself a favour preserve your admiration for radical australian cinema and dont watch this unless1drunk2high3stupid4currently being tortured in guantanimo bay and want the mental pain to seem lesspainful five minutes of this and youll be begging the cia goons to start up again with the white noise and black hoodtheres a tonne of reviews on here already so i dont think anyone will read this i just had to let it out before the festering hate degenerates and i become a gun wielding nutter that kills his workmates on a whim one sunny day or maybe i could run them down with a barb wire festooned truck mmmmmmmmmm,reality
is back and better than ever i know the road warrior is a classic but im saying that this is the best film to date the reboot is a whirlwind of a thrill ride and keeps viewers on the edge of their seats for the who twohour run time making it the longest film in the seriesfury road finds tom hardy as rockatansky a man burdened by glimpses of the past and a little girl he was unable to protect he is a loner a drifter and a man of very few words after being taken prisoner by a group of warriors who paint themselves white and believe they are working to make it to valhalla escapes during one of the many intense fuelguzzling battles on the fury road and decides to help furiosa played wonderfully by charlize theron and a group of young women who are attempting escape and freedom by immortan joe hugh keays byrne who played the villain in the first installment as well the evil leader of the citizens of the citadel who uses the women as slaves to give birth to his children the performances in the film are nothing short of great and satisfying hardy doesnt say much as and he doesnt have to every gesture and grunt he makes is good enough and he fills the shoes vacated by mel gibson very well theron gives us a strong independent woman warrior in furiosa one of the best characters to appear in the franchise and on screen this year another wonderful addition is nicholas hoult who plays a distraught and anxious warrior who switches to the good side after failing in the eyes of immortan joe the film lives for its action sequences which is fantastic because director george miller is the king of action also this is what the series was practically built on something that was forgotten in the very disappointing beyond thunderdome the audience is given the pleasing feeling we felt while watching the road warrior and then we are given moreand moreand more until we are so filled with excitement that it is hard to sit still the film has a good plot that the action enhances if anything this film is a shoutout to the number of failed modern action films while the first revolutionized the action film in the late 1970s this film sets the bar for modern films of the genre ive heard that the film is eighty percent practical events instead of cgi and that in itself in achievement with this in mind there were numerous times in the film where i wondered just how miller did what he did the seventyyearold director has excelled where a number of young filmmakers have failed and has brought us what might be the best action film in yearsthis seems to be a new start for the franchise the original trilogy was probably good enough but if the upcoming films are this great they can make as many as they want until george miller is unable to continue keep the excellent tom hardy in the lead and keep on amazing us with the unbelievable stunts and action sequences its about time we had an actionadventure franchise film like this take notes michael bay,reality
not since 2008s the dark knight have i seen a film that instantly grabs you from the opening scene until the very end fury road is a nonstop action thrill ride from start to finish that doesnt sacrifice characters or story for the adrenaline rushtom hardy as is spectacular and is definitely on par with gibons original portrayal of the character although hardy is incredible as charlize theron as furiosa steals the show every time she is on screen with her imposing presence and badass persona making her the best female heroine since sigourney weaver as ellen ripleyalong with interesting characters and plot lines the film showcases breathtaking action sequences that are just unbelievable to watch george millers vision of doing as much practical effects as he could in the film worked beautifully unlike most modern day action films ie transformers where the action starts to get tiresome by the end the action in fury road is always inventive always creative and always has your attentioni will say without exaggeration that fury road is not only the best film of 2015 by far but the best action movie of the 21st century miller mixes character moments with hard hitting and grotesque action scenes that may become iconic in the years to come what a cinematic achievement fury road gets a perfect score of 10 out of 10,reality
when it comes to movies i have many loves and few passions fury road is one of those passions and even though i anticipated the film i was still completely blown awayit didnt take long for me to become completely immersed by the films atmosphere in fact you have little choice with a world that is so striking and foreign your only shot at escaping captivation is to walk out of the filmboth the cinematography and sound are staggering they take things you are familiar and turn them into something very alien and viewers are much likened to explorers at points i was beside myself with how amazing the costumes and props were done this film is as close as ive come to culture shock without buying a plane ticketthe jumpcuts while ample are done well in a sense that they keep your brain for lingering too long on one shot and prevent you from predicting what exactly might happen next and when it will happenthe story while simple and nothing new does not lack substance miller chooses to drive home narrative using a camera and visuals instead of longwinded speeches and explicit anecdotes rather mmfr has the viewer considering even the smallest details of the plot and how they might have come to fruitionin short there are few movies that left me as staggered and excited as this film did if film is to be considered a pillar of entertainment and culture for society this film is a foundation for those pillars its plot is nothing revolutionary but its simply some of the most fun ive had watching a movie,reality
imagine a great adventure thriller story told using salvador dali paintings for each frame with background music by beethoven if he was a rockstar imagine a unique action scene thats so well shot it looks animated but you know theres barely any cgi used imagine a movie that doesnt need dialogue to drop atomic bombs of emotion you and doesnt do fast cuts to thrill you widen your eyes and make your blood pump faster for a fight sequencethat imaginary movie doesnt hold a candle light to george millers fury road this film is far more crazy colorful than a dream this film is far better than any other action movie in this generationtom hardy plays the new a character that had been shelved in george millers head for thirty years is reduced to a single instinct as he so simply puts it himself in the opening monologue survival not only from the crazy weirdos who are trying to kill him but also from his own mind which is haunted by his past all those who he couldnt save path of survival crosses with imperator furiosa a kickass woman who is looking to get her friends to a safe place which happens to be where she grew up in before she was taken away they share a crazy awesome and surprisingly madfuryroadtomhardygeorgemiller600x421emotional road to their goals which as different as they are have plenty sparkles of similaritiesevery character small or big has motivations seclusions and destination the characters are so well presented that they seem real in the insane world of this is also one of the best looking movies i have seen its not just the color and the background and the light although they are stunningly crucial its the non stop camera movement that manages to find its direction in a mind blowing way through each shot the camera movements are not unnecessary too as they are in many of the other hollywood thrill rides it can represent vulgarisms change in situations and change in characters relations the great thing is that considering all the art this is still one of the most action packed movies i have ever seen every scene is a climactic one all of them wow you with their awesome thrilling fights chases explosions and the many more crazy stuff that youll only see in a movie this film doesnt sleep a beautiful looking non stopfury road volcanic eruption of spectacular action george miller certainly knows how to get the most he possibly can out of each frame your background tells a story and the foreground moves the story foreword this is an amazing visual fiesta for the eyestheres something very special about the feeling that swallows you whole while youre drowned in a great world created by an artist who knows how to make a great piece that will disconnect you from the earth that youre on after all thats all cinema is aboutoh what a kickass masterpiece,reality
i have never seen previous movies before so i had no idea what to expect going into the movie i usually hate any movies that are even remotely apocalyptic but i am glad to say this movie was purely amazing the storyline was so vaguely explained throughout the film and left just enough room for your own interpretation of it they made the action sequences with a finesse and connected you to all characters during the whole film even during massive fight scenes tom hardy was brilliant as always i did not think that he would be able to pull off this type of movie but as he has proved in past movies he can charlize theron played furiosa beautifully i have never seen her in any movies prior but this was one fantastic role absolutely brilliant 10 out of 10 well done george miller,reality
as of the time of this review posting this movie is carrying an 81 imdb rating why did the reviewers come into this film really needing to root for a character if so were these the character they really wanted to be rooting for if so why the male lead doesnt really say much for 90 minutes and wears a mask for the first 45 minutes why are people rooting for charlize therons character and why am i supposed to naturally dislike the guy with the mask who controls the water i mean he seemed really upset when his favorite redheaded milk machine got killed and his feelings were hurt when charlize theron broke their deal and why are all of these desert dwellers so angry and palethese reviewers would have given this movie high scores no matter who played the characters or what they did in the film for some reason supporting the franchise makes pseudo film critics feel smart well this movie sucks  the setting sucks the writing sucks the story sucks and the franchise sucks its gross its stupid and i dont care waterworld 1995 was a better movie and nick holt will always be tony stonem in this house badrealreview posting scoring criteriaacting  11casting  11directing  11story  01writingscreenplay  051total base score  35modifiers  or believabilityconsistency 1total realreview rating 25 rounded up to 3 reluctantly for imdb,reality
im a huge fan of and the road warrior there is a believability in those two films this is way over the top way too predictable and way too tired now fights like matt damon in bourne identity which is something new and now we have cgi added in the mix which takes away the organic feel of it dont you thinkorganic not a term i like to use but frankly the first two films did feel that way this is way too much way too long and over the top also there arent too many characters to love here and thats a problemlastly this all seems meaningless and stupid go back where you came from after trying so hard to escape it just all seems so dull and tiresome,reality
i am a big fan i own the first three movies and have watched these films many times i even truly liked beyond thunderdome even knowing that many people did not so needless to say ive been anticipating this new movie very much and had been following its development and progress over the internet for years i was ramped up even more by all the wonderful reviews it got here and on rotten tomatoescom howeveri got to say i was disappointed and rank this film 4th out of the 4 films the vehicles effects and sound were awesome the story there wasnt one the dialog weak the portrayal of by tom hardy lacking remember the great humongous feral boy and masterblaster great characters who will you remember from this film,reality
the movie is horrendous dialogue and character development are apparently as scarce as water in these future benighted times this movie is a car chase a tedious car chase through an endless desert nowhere to go no explanation of how anyone got there to begin with no storytelling the precious cargo in this road warriorretread is 4 or 5 dingbat runwaylingerie models breeders bad guys from porcupinecars are getting systematically shot blown up thrown under the wheels of the 18wheeler and all the while were supposed to care that it isnt one of the vapid alberto vargas girls instead absurd this isnt good vs evil it isnt man vs machine it isnt man vs nature it isnt man vs himself i dont even detect any irony here no its just a car chase folks a dumbshow for dumb people and thats what you are if you like it dumb,reality
potential spoilers due to use of character names and the description of a few scenes with some level of detailhollywood seems to have this fascination with rebooting or extending the longevity of a film franchise because well theres money to be made and they are out of fresh ideasthis iteration of nonchalantly delivers all of the bad tripe that hollywood drums up and doesnt do anything to give us a sense of that movie going experience that used to excite us as young adults or children its redundant and uses a worn out formula that needs to be brokeni rated it a 6generousand that was only because of the wonderful scenery and some awesome attention to detail with costumes and vehiclesprops1 its great that they avoided cgi where possible though when they did use it it was noticeable and rather amateurish looking and its not enough to carry the filmyou have to consider if the main praise of a film is that it used real props then clearly the film wasnt that good2 characters are uninteresting unrelatable and entirely one dimensional totally uninspiring mel gibsons was a badass a man of honor in a world gone and a survivor tom hardys is just an invalid himself is not only a mute for 34s of the film hes also feeble  which seems to be a trait of tom hardy more than the character it certainly wasnt the confident we were accustomed to3 story was boring  if i wanted to watch a bunch of dimwitted women escaping into a fantasy landwhether real or mental id just watch an episode of orange is the new black thats all i need to get my nauseating fill of ridiculous femme monologues and even if we buy that is a survivor i dont call what he did really surviving he just played wheel man for a bunch of idiotic mares4 plot is amateur plot twists are obvious moments where bad guy is deterred or detoured by some character that i care nothing for is obvious  such as the splendid angharad opening the door to block immorten joe from shooting furiousa  like right at the perfect moment exposing her belly and child with a smug grin on her face as if daring him to shoot her really who wrote this horesht5 film starts out with one of the two regurgitated film openings with movies these days either you get a five minute this is what happened flashbacks and now lets start the movie or you get central protagonistantagonist reflecting on life choices and some sort of mentalemotional anguish that drives or haunts their days in this film its the latter with the huge cop out that failed some children and hears their screams taunting him6 timing of scenes and dialogue is rough badly edited and makes you wonder why they even paid known actors to deliver a handful of lines that arent even convincing any ways why not let some new actors do it and pay them 14 the wage7 whole parts of the film are irrelevant and only server to waste time the intro to the film is inconsequential we get a half hearted half minute monologue and voice over about some nonsense and then a few back and forth scenes about a capture and escape then the film seems to properly start where it should have with the introduction of immortan joe they could have led in at the point where hes having this weird armor strapped to him and then he walks out to the people below it not only curiously introduces the main villain but also shows a small example of what the world is like when he releases the water and people began fighting over it the only thing in this film that interested me was when splendid angharad got run over a film is bad when the only pleasure i got from it was watching an innocent character get killed by a monster truck buggys tire just goes to show how utterly sht the film was frankly they should be ashamed they bothered to reboot the series or whatever you want to call it people that like this are the same sheep that think the recent string of comic book films are good entertainmenti call it simply crap,reality
i can not understand the hype about this movie the story is really boring and linear they drive away and then they decide to drive back thats all in my opinion there is too much action and not enough deepness for example the reason why furiora is acting the way she does is just superficial the audience doesnt get much deeper in her story just as well the story of you just have to guess the movie is also very brutal and at some points in game of thronesstyle really disgusting the women they want to save are really annoying characters and you just cant feel with them all in all the movie reminds me of the new riddick where you also get disappointed in the middle of the movie about the extent of the story only the character design and the general style are awesome in addition the actors hardy and theron are sympathetic,reality
fury road  first of all it is wrong title main leading role charlize theron as furiosa that supposed movie be named by first leading role theron is impressive as always as tom hardy as supporting main character is not impressive his mediocre acting and lethargic entry do not contribute to total scene i was expecting someone sharp in action like jason statham or splendid actor in recent scene good as ryan gosling at all by the way i dont like storyline too but action is good and constant nux played by nicolas hoult british actor is most controversial character first he was orthodox religion fanatic fascinated by immortal joe and vikings too he believed in valhallanordic paradise and then he turned his life views by 180 and became a member of running party of furiosa furiosa is most stupidest female name for leading female role i dont heard name stupid like that not even in spain or mexico furiosa villains do not look scary like in original 1 or 2 only action is constant but storyline is not impressive furiosa stealing pregnant and virgins than escaping she leading to gasoline city but she dragging another tank with 300 gallons of fuel then leading left to enemy territory and 50 vehicles cant stop one truck why they didnt simple shoot to thires in that case film wouldnt be attractive or interesting that no longer i must admit i am not impressed and i was expecting much more 1 and 2 are much better movies,reality
the first half hour is excellent i was on board and blown away the costumes set design  and those cars  were truly amazing opening action sequence is incredible  until they introduced the ultradramatic violins and sappy orchestra soundtrack absolutely ruined the movie for me soundtrack belonged in pearl harbor not should have been heavy metal or dub step electronic music or even better barely any music at all it just made the movie so cheesy then add lack of plot no character development and subpar acting and you get a somewhat forgettable movie charlize theron who is indeed an amazing actress supposedly gives a stellar performance in this flick i really dont know how that is determined she basically says nothing and just scowls the entire time i totally checked out mentally from this movie about 60 into it i really wanted to leave or start checking email on my phone,reality
dont get me wrong im a huge fan of even this movie had the best cinematography choreography though id argue some of the drama and humor to offset the seriousness of the chase scenesbut the problem is they forgot to hire a writer this is for testosterone junkies who enjoy what is basically a two hour chase scene where they get away an hour in to the movie by which time i was still looking at my watch waiting to see some real plot developments no such luck then they all change their minds and decide to go back to the place they escaped from and take it over which implausible as it sounds takes 30 seconds and is rather anticlimatici could list any of a number of bad movies who got lower rating from critics but had more substance to them than a cup of chicken bullion which is where i would rate just this very movie it didnt have more substance than a cup of chicken bullion when it came to a plot story character development character development that affected the audience through its unfolding or anything other than wild costumes a philosophy of life was said in less than 2 sentences and then back to chasesthis movie is one thing that points out my very frustration with the hollywood system as it is 150m gets thrown at making this while there are a lot of other writers put out much better scripts but cant get noticedjust one more thing im not writing this because ive got a screenplay that blows the one for this one away thats not hard to do with iv i went to watch this honestly thinking it would be my grave as a writer instead i come away feeling gypted and all the more aware of how much talent the hollywood system throws away  and its not just meplease improve your game hollywood were tired of watching comic books brought to the screen then done all over again this sort of stuff just because george miller carries a good rep now retire please  and please pay attention to the real talent that you turn away from your door everyday but if you want to go watch a 2hour motorized chase scene then by all means help yourself,reality
did i watch the same movie as everyone elsesome reviewers on this must be getting paid because this was the worst most over hyped movie ive seen this year there was absolutely no storyline or character development and tom hardy isnt even the lead charlize theron isshe has more screen time and lines than hardyhardys talent was wasted on this movie he literally had about 20 lines in the whole moviethe action scenes were good and thats the only reason i gave it four stars but thats the whole movie one explosion after another i got really bored bye it in the end theres only so many times you can watch a car or truck explodesave your money wish i did,reality
i thought long and hard before writing this review i mean the opinion of 99 of imdb is against me so everyone else must be right right wrongso lets start with the obvious the protagonist of the film is furiosa not because women can be protagonists too okay lets tick that boxso why call the movie why not just set a random plot in a random dystopian future with strong female characters ok lets do it no wait we cant because were scared that the story cant stand alone on its own merits were scared to put out a standalone movie with no character continuity to the filmsthis film is a nonsequitur of a nonsequel assembled by the intellectually bankrupt purely to illustrate a misogynist dystopian future where anything with a penis is to be held in contempt but because its by george miller it must be a sequel to okay lets tick that box did george miller really create this  or did the studio just pay him to put his name to itplot summary ine also starring mumbling in the future there are a lot of bad men and they treat women as chattels and breeding stockfortunately there is a woman a woman who can drive a truck and shoot better than mumbling and can kick mumbling ass with one hand ines a badass  you can tell by the metal arm prosthetics are still available in the future ine comes from a mythical green place to free other women from bondage and bring them back to the mythical green place where the sacred seeds are kept ine and her friends have promised each other never to kill on this most special of roadtrips wounding and maiming is acceptable however oh and a couple of guys happen to help her out and one of them is called and he had to be in the plot because of the title okay lets tick that boxwhats a synonym for furious hah hah i get it thats about the level of wit in this entire unfunny monotonous stinker of a filmthe explosions were good though okay lets tick that box,reality
i graduated with the highest mark possible for english at school but words fail me to describe how bad this movie is please do anything else but see it you will never get those precious minutes backit starts badly and builds to the ridiculous it is initially difficult to fathom why the actors are doing what they are but eventually you gather what the intent is there is an attempt to follow a similar story line to 2 in terms of an over all plot but as a story it fails miserably to head in that direction at allthere is no real story line no real plot and there is little more than a string of poorly produced computer generated vehicle crashes all joined together to fill in the time it should have taken to tell a storymel should be very thankful he stayed away from this stinker,reality
we checked the reviews before booking the tickets rotten tomatoes and this website both had above average rating so we were quite happy that after quite this one promises to be a highly rated action moviesoon after the movie started it became apparent that this was going to be no action movie legend fragmented and pauses between lines stupid storyline and one of the worst pieces of acting ive seen in years including charlize theron i was shocked at how silly and amateurish the whole directing was and then it was the main character i would imagine a 4 year old can put his acting to shame ridiculously childish and unconvincing delivery and we had to put up with 2 hours of it dont want to spend a minute more on it including this review nuff said as they say,reality
i just registered on imdb to lower the rating of this movie really not kidding i cant believe a site as great as this has this movie with an 81 rating really people theres cars bikes and trucks theres a truck exclusively destined to carry drummers and a guitarist with a guitar that spits fire really does that say great movie to you horrible characters why did she want to save the girls why does everyone want to help them why does the bad guy reproduce with women what the hell is everyone and why oh god why does a guitarist from hell apparently were a red bodysuit i watched this with high hopes in a 4k tv because it had such a good rating here and good critics why oh god why please save yourselves,reality
i just found this whole thing bloated and excessive at the expense of any decent story or realismthe original road warrior painted a stark picture of a struggle for survival after the end of the world as we know it this is not like that at alli just felt that the theme was not properly explored here i would have preferred to have seen on his own surviving and then maybe trying to help someone else later on in the filmi didnt expect or want a road warrior remake but i also did not expect or want what this turned out to be,reality
i had high expectations for this movie  seen with gibson just a few years back the first time and really enjoyed it he was the main character however in this latest blockbuster he is just a sidekick to furiosathis wouldnt be the worst part what really bothered me were the following thingsinconsistent sound eg low volume during the high actions scenes but that couldve been just by the setup in my particular theaterspecial effects were great lots of practical effects and explosions but it was very obvious and it made it seem less real and plausible because of speeding the action up in post production i get it you cant really do certain scenes in 100kmh in sand having the main character strapped to the front of the car but it ruined the realism and cgi would probably look better and more believable backstory  none i did care very little about any of the characters though we learned about furiosa and why she was doing what she was doing as someone else mentioned michael bays movies have lot more story than this one and this one is praised and his movies are heavily criticized inconsistent character in the apocalyptic world with no rules and him being a master of his own life not belonging to any ganggroup  why he didnt kill the guy that used him as a blood bag why he left him live even after getting them repeatedly into trouble that seemed very incongruent with his character and name for that matterit was good fun nonetheless but current rating of 88 is highly overrated and im certain itll go down as more people see it,reality
how is it possible to use 150000000 dollars on cgi that is way to noticeable actors that cant say more than 10 words continuously and a script that a 4grader could have written for a school assignment imagine that the good guy isnt the main character in the movie but a kind of sidekick and the bad guy is just the bad guy because hes ugly no story no purpose no background no reason for anything happening in this dreadful waste of time nothing in this movie made sense not even the name of the moviewell its not about him or anything else actually my advice dont waste your time on this mindless crap go see the old instead and hollywood please stop throwing all that money down the drain,reality
what do you get when you cross the undeserved and awkward haughtiness of katherine heigl with the laughable seriousness with which natalie portman conducts herselfcharlize theronwhy do people keep reinforcing this stupid delusion charlize theron has that shes tough 15 shots in a row of her giving a stern look to the camera followed by an ironic panout to demonstrate the character wasnt actually aware of a camera and was just looking in a mirror isnt good filmmaking its laughablebad music video laughablei seriously want to know what demographic keeps charlizes action career going watching another one of these egoboosting pr shoots is almost as painful as sitting through anything with scarlett johansson but at least charlize can act when shes not casting herself as another fierce fresh fearsome heroine du jouractually i have another fword to describe charlizes actionmovie career f awfulit takes more than a shy robotarm and a disgusting boyhair style shaved head to look like a badass fight the patriarchy on your own time charlize dont waste minein any case something must be totally lost in translation between hollywood and normal people these days everything is so imbued with fugly stoners nerdy superhero crap or androgynous hipster fantasy that i dont find anything believable,reality
i recently read a review by a guy who saw the movie 6 timesyes6 times the movie lacks in all major aspects of film making including cinematography dialogue plot character development and originality please allow me to highlight several of the largest failures of the filmcharacter development the film contains exactly zero 0 character development leading you to not give a s who lives and who dies because you dont know who they are in the first place it simply starts immediately with an extended action scene and continues to jump from action scene to action scene without giving the characters personalities or even a legitimate cause dialogue as noted above the film doesnt allow for any character development however whats more is that the film lacks any dialogue of substance at all the characters might say 250 words in total although that is being generous the dialogue that does exist is short and choppy with outofplace camera shots and cheesy dramatic music that implies the audience should be caring about a certain character that they arent familiar with see above plot along with the lack of character development and dialogue the plot is nonexistent for the first 30 minutes of the movie and the audience is left wondering what the hell is going on after the initial cluelessness the audience is left to cling to a plot that is weaker than limp spaghetti and less substantial than empty space and its got more holes than the novel all in all this movie is a pathetic excuse to try and turn a combination of a monster truck race and a demolition derby into a hollywood event from the opening car chase to the closing credits the audience is left feeling dazed confused and the initial excitement  bored from seeing the same chasefight scene over and over and over again the movie is predictable unoriginal and lacks any kind of depth in conclusion i hope that you will save yourself the  and 2 hours of your life and not see this abomination of a movie personally i would rather be dragged naked over a cactus with my mouth over the tailpipe of a greyhound bus than sit through that again,reality
it is the loud crazy insane overwhelming bizarre grotesque and sickening quick cuts version of the original road warrior movie fury road is the road warrior for the 21st century will be nominated for best picture of the year at academy awards time i hope not look if i was a pure action movie fan i would give this movie at 10 out of 10 all the way but im not but you see i also happen to be an up and coming writer myself at least i think i am and i just noticed something theres no story theres no plot only bizarre and nutty scenes being thrown at you at high speed in your face again and again isnt that great isnt that a movie you know reminds me of another movie what movie is that dune you know that boring and nonsensical piece of trash directed by david lynch oh that one i have concluded that fury road is the super high speed version of dune takes the weirdness and sickness of dune and accelerates it to 200 miles an hour hooray isnt that a fantastic and original idea you know george miller the director of should redo dune next i would pay good money to see what george miller would do to dune or has he done it already is really dune in disguise i have to say though was very entertaining but thats it without a plot without a story all i got was a one dimensional roller coaster ride through hell and is that what all these violent and crazy movies are good for are they just roller coaster rides now it seems that they are,reality
this feels like a rob zombie movie this movie has been praised everyone of what a cinematic masterpiece it is i was told that the story characters and pacing was great when the title exploded into flames i started having doubts then i saw the guy playing guitar on a flaming rig the movie tries to be gritty but silly at the same time its too silly to be taken seriously and too gritty to be fun there is little dialog and character interaction mostly its a big long chase to me action gets old very quickly especially when its the same thing over and over again spoiler guys on vehicles shoot at each other people fall off cars crashis a minor character furiosa just isnt that interesting nux is the only person with a real story hes the only one with anything going on other than fleeing or fighting no one else really changeswould be an okay renter where you can pause and do something interesting then come back to it in the theater dont feel bad for having to get up to pee you wont miss anything,reality
this is the modern interpretation of a hitmovie from a few decades ago when this sort of postapocalyptic movies had their peak despite the presence of south african pearl charlize theron the movie remains what it has always been  a b or even c movie with unconvincing and extremely poor characters the dialogs are old fashioned the look of the secondary and supernumerary characters is awful and the directors work is at the expected low level the movie raises a bunch of questions but gives answers to a very few of them tom hardy is doing his best in the character of trying not to say a word until the end of the movie but even his stoicism can not save the day this is the dejavu of an old and having lived his days movie a tragical attempt to resurrect a long dead subject and the past glory of his creator,reality
when i first came out of fury road i wasnt sure what to think nor did i know how the critics would respond to it the critics spokeand were nearly unanimous in their praise but i knew i had to see it again for myself to see if i would be swept up in the chorus of praise or if in sorrow i would have to admit the film i had so longed to see the film so many deemed a masterpiece was in fact unworthy of its laurelsbut you see those ten stars at the top you know how this story endsill say it nowfury road is the best film in at least 18 months and the best summer blockbuster in five years i delighted at george millers mastermind billing in the trailers but it was absolutely justified he draws on aspects of the original trilogy from small touches the little music box for one to primary themesthe damning social critique of the relentless brutality of the road warrior and the postapocalyptic grotesquerie of beyond thunderdome here working with a budget far greater than the budgets of the originals combined he has crafted a film which draws from and in my opinion exceeds themhe and an incredibly talented team have made a masterpiececinematography editing score makeup production designall of the highest order spoton acting perfect direction two full hours and not a wasted moment,reality
just one scene of those imbeciles spraying chrome in their mouths says everything there is to know about this movie it is like watching a pile of trash traveling through the desert only to turn around and finish the movie traveling back the way they came not one thing to care about just a pain to watch one of the worst movies ive ever seen,reality
it seemed to me that few people did not totally love this film and i cannot think of any time on social media or reviews that i saw many negative words about it so i was keen to see it once it came to being released for the home viewing undeniably the film is committed to what it is doing and it seems determined to make this world real simply by the force of its own will as a result there does not seem any excess that is out of place even if for me personally this also worked against the film the simple plot allows the action to be the all and in some ways it is enjoyably metallic  with impacts grinding of parts the smell of grease however on the other side the sense of vaudeville that it has detracts from the actual feeling of tension and violence it should have that it didnt manage to draw me into its creation meant that the constant action felt like a show rather than something with real consequence and riskthat is not to say that it isnt enjoyable because as a show it is often quite the show i am not sure why this contentlight blockbuster got so much praise versus any other blockbuster heavy on action but light on plot but it did visually it is endlessly interesting the crazy nonsense of the vehicles and the action sequences combine with some great cinematography  oversaturating everything and adding to that sense of otherworldly extremes the cast do the same and have that committed approach that the film has  whether their performances make sense or not theron is the most engaging of the piece with a very strong and yet emotive character hardy is a good presence but surprisingly not particularly interesting as a title character hoult is better and the female support characters see good turns from huntington whiteley i know  surprising kravitz eaton and othersit is a film that simply does what it sets out to do and doesnt seem to worry about whether it will work or not in this way it does have strong forward motion and never lack confidence however the sense of performance and show to it does rob it of a hook to draw the viewer in and as such it is always a blockbuster even if the grimy metallic aspects suggest it is more proper than other films doing much the same for a wider audience good for what it is but certainly not worthy of the endless waves of praise hitting it this summer,reality
if i could give it more negative rating i wouldas a fan of the timeless trilogy this should not have been remade especially if they were going to rework the character of who was a selfsufficient survivalist and main characterthis movie would have been better served and a much higher rating and review given if george miller had based it on a female character similar to and possibly involving another mfp cop who becomes her sidekickthis seems to be an attempt by george miller to reboot his career using the material that made him a success,reality
at first i was looking forward to watching this movie with all the hype but then all i got was tom hardy grunting for the whole movie no plot no dialogue the writers must have had a good time and awful acting from good actors why did everyone like it you most certainly cant buy taste i admire some of the creation in it the guitar for example and i commend it for all the effort but i was just bored to death whilst watching it and i was always waiting for the story to be introduced or a sudden plot turn but neither ever happened i do see how it was possibly entertaining and i liked a few of the action sequences but the whole rest of the movie was rubbish  boring pay for it if you dare overall truly terrible but maybe it just wasnt my kind of film,reality
i really really struggled to even give this movie a rating of 3 i did so based solely on the belief that all films are artistic expressions of someones ideas or vision and therefore all have merit to some degreewith that being said i believe that i may have lost a few iq points from watching this movie without question i certainly lost 2 hours of my life that i will never ever be able to recoveralthough i could not stand this films total lack of plot exposition and character development my biggest gripe with this movie is the following regardless of whether you believe mankind has been around for 6000 years or 200000 years fury road encourages us or leads us to believe that the majority of those that remain in this post apocalyptic future are no wiser from all that time mankind has spent on this earthmore simply put in this storys version of a post apocalyptic future mankind has essentially regressed back into neanderthalsamong a mindnumbing amount of grunts and groans from this movies cast throughout the film like the father or mother of a toddler i repeatedly found myself constantly on the verge of saying use your words another thing i find telling though not surprising with the film fury road is how the ratings seem to rise significantly as the age of its viewers decreasei could go further into detail regarding the plethora of reasons as to why i really didnt like this film but quite frankly after already wasting approximately 2 hours of my life ive chosen to stop the bleeding now rather than devoting any more of my time to something thats nowhere near worth sacrificing this worlds all too valuable commodity see what i did there,reality
this movie is being projected as some god level action moviebut i found it a big blunder comedythat guitar guy took my hearti mean come on there is some survival war going on and the best you do is banging over fiery guitarthis movie is as junk as the future shown in the moviebut if you can feel the comedy lying behind the show off you can laugh your ass offi would have given it 1010 if the genre mentioned was comedythis is itthis is the god of comedy,reality
on an objective level both critics and fans dont seem to know what a good movie is anymore fury road may be filled with nearly two hours of breathtaking nonstop action sequences and a couple of great special effects settings or locations and some solid camera and light techniques in the few calmer moments the problem is that there is literally nothing more than this in this reboot of another legendary series there are no real intrigues going on and creativity is literally non existent there are almost no dialogues and the few that are there are quite weak there are no surprising elements or twists and therefor no tension whatsoever in the whole flick the plot is so shallow that even the increasingly bad fast and furious feel like intellectual masterpieces if compared to this laughable excuse of a story one gets introduced to an epic number of characters but none of them has any real depth the biggest problem is the uncharismatic main actor tom hardy and his shallow character that doesnt create any antipathy or sympathy among viewers i rarely cared less about a leading character in any movie than here another problem are the numerous villains that arent fleshed out either it feels as if the characters of the bad guys were randomly borrowed from some of the trashiest action flicks of the seventies and eighties sometimes they appear pretty much out of nowhere and die as randomly a few minutes later the only actress who did a decent job and managed to add some depth to its character is academy award winner charlize theron i feel sad for her to be acting in such a disastrous movieeven two hours of nonstop action end up feeling boring and stretched if there are no truly stunning scenes or any degree of virtuosity in the high amount of exaggerated explosions and endless gunfights even as a homage to the original series or a worthless movie to switch your brains off and have some fun this movie has nearly no merits apart of the few objective positive elements which are basically due to the impertinent budget and some obvious inspirations from the original cult movies and which barely justify my extremely generous rating this film is extremely overrated and not recommendable for anyone,reality
im not the biggest fan of the trilogy but i love the films and despite being the least liked thunderdome is my favourite despite of its flaws to me its the most complex and the one that comes out more as a film and has all the things that makes a film more importantly the story so when the trailers for fury road came out i was super hyped and it was definitely one of my most hyped films to see in 2015 i couldnt stop thinking what miller would do with 150 million and the trailers made it look like an epic non stop action film with classic visuals just pure insane action like no other film then critics and audiences acclaimed it to the point of being an instant classic and is now an oscar contender then the score came out and i loved it so much i couldnt stop listening and it made my expectations even higher so i went to iwith my expectations at an all time high and saw itand i was so disappointed i couldnt stop thinking what was i missing since everyone loves it sure the visuals are insanely good the stunts are breathtaking the score is a killer the performances are great it has originality to spare the production design is an oscar winner its so inventive i mean the cars are insane and the costumes are brilliant but all the rest pales in comparisoni never went expecting a complex story or even much dialogue but i was surprised that there was no story and no dialogue to the point i was a little bit bored one time or two i couldnt stop thinking how this could be an oscar contender with no story or dialogue and how was the film moving along but this wasnt my biggest disappointment at all it was the action because i really went for the action and it was just ok sure it was very realistic and all but the production videos were a lot more realistic and exciting the film had a look that was cool but takes a lot of the realism and excitement and feels weirdi didnt like the choreography it was just so simple and had a weird rhythm there were parts where nothing happened i couldnt find a single piece of action that i truly liked or was excited just things happening and most of the problem was the edition that look also felt like a secondary character just going along that wouldnt be a problem if furiosa was a great character but she wasnt i couldnt relate to any character because they had no story no dialogue they were just insane people with great looks doing insane thingsoverall i cant feel nothing but disappointment and sure the technical parts are almost perfect the cinematography the sound the production design the visuals are insanely good but all the rest pales in comparison no story nothing i could relate to not even the action that is so blunt and simplistic even with its real stunts and all this is the weakest of all films this film is hugely overrated and its another one i cant share the same opinion the world has but since everyone loves it so much i must be the problem im not saying the film isnt good i just cant agree with everyone i just cant see what makes it so great this was one of the most strangest experiences at the movies i ever had,reality
a friend of mine is insisting that im the only one he knows who disliked this movie i was gratified to come here and see the many reviews saying exactly what i feel the road warrior is just about my favorite movie and fury road is the antithesis of that movieall cgi no back story or characterization and simply silly to boot i wouldnt even call it a scifi flick as its more of an inane fantasy the viewer is thrown into a plot which i would describe as a bunch of desert freaks throw crap in your face for two hours it made me think of the many rw ripoffs of the 80s and 90s but with overused cgi and too much money to burnif you are a rw fan id advise you not to bother with this it wont sully your memory or future viewings of rw but it will very likely disappoint i managed to turn my wife the farthest thing from a scifi geek into a rw fan and she too was bitterly disappointed with this and said we needed to watch rw again soon to expunge this abomination from our memoriesdisclaimer we only watched about 3540 minutes before we couldnt take it anymore but we both hated literally every moment we witnessed,reality
ive given 5 out of ten just for the all action scenes the rest is just crap it all seems really funny that there is supposed to be a shortage of fuel and yet this film revolves around tons of vehicles all driving from one direction to another with no one stopping to refuel the plot is quite thin she runs away finds some old people where she thought it was better than where she was and then turns around and goes back from where she was only to kill the leader on the way back and take over why didnt she just kill him in the first place i know i know then there wouldnt be a film about it himself was supposed to be a baddass but in here he grunts quite a lot and doesnt really do much if youve never seen a movie then you might like this one if you have seen all of them then this is a bit disappointing,reality
firstly this is not a film is utterly secondary to charlizes character and the film should have been called furious furiosa is allegedly set in australia but theres such a hodgepodge of accents here that you frankly wonder where it could possibly be set if you can accept that the basic failing of this not being a film you then hit a wall of other failures with this filmthere is absolutely no plot at all here now i regard a plot as an essential ingredient in any film for me there absolutely has to be a point to what is happening this film utterly rips up that notion and laughs at it what you are left with is action only and it fails here too cgi is a great tool for film makers but the instant you notice it it makes any action cartoonlike cgi is very noticeable in many places here and it just destroys any semblance of reality when it appears its a shame because so many of the sequences have been filmed with great action only to have the cgi come along later and ruin them cgi only works when you dont notice itthere is almost no dialogue to the film and as such the characters are not developed in the slightest you develop no feelings for any of them they may as well have just hired stuntmen for the main parts for all the acting that was requested of them the fertile harem ladies are all supermodels why are only the beautiful ones fertile are beauty and fertility linked given that its the strong who survive in this wasteland why is the chief bad guy a pensioneromitting a plot seems to be a recurring hollywood feature these days are there really so many people around who dont require one that this film could possibly be rated at 86 if people really lap this stuff up then well obviously be fed more a depressing thoughtonly watch this if you can stand a pointless film with no plot and dont go to the cinema thinking you are seeing a film better still find something else to watch,reality
this year the academy has made a mockery of itself a nomination for costume design sure makeup and hairstyle why not special effects absolutelybut directing and best movie best movie this was a great 2 hour long showreel for cgi and effects hell i can even understand the nomination for production design sadly there was no movie in there not even a story if you think about it as there was not any noteworthy actingon its own  if you like this kind of spectacle absolutely go see it its got explosions races shooting blood  all the good things for this genrebut who had the bright idea to rank this along real movies like trumbo room joy the martian or the revenant for crying out loud i still hope this is an elaborate joke to promote box office but there is not very much time left until the oscars so they better clear it up soon ps haters are gonna hate fanboys are gonna fret i know feel free if you like to doesnt make it a movie though,reality
this is the most ridiculous annoying most pointless movie ive seen in a long time the fact that it gets an 82 on imdb makes me seriously question the legitimacy of the reviews on here either there are paid shills on here rating the movie high for sales or people have gotten so stupid and dumbed down that they are actually entertained by this utter garbagethere is absolutely no character development there are no likable characters the plot is so simple and boring its basically one long boring unengaging action sequence with some ridiculous cringe inducing things thrown in along the way all they do is drive into the desert for half the movie being chased then when you think the movie is going to pick up and get better the characters decide to drive back the same way they came yeah i kid you not thats the entire plot really you just spent over half the movie driving one way and now youre going to drive back wow unbelievably stupid only in a movie this ridiculous would the characters think to do this and then have it actually work really is that the best you can do for a plot this is somehow deserving of an 82then there is the complete absurdity of some of the things in this movie this is supposed to be post apocalyptic yet you cant even begin to suspend your disbelief or get into because of the absurdity of what they throw in your face if this was truly post apocalyptic resources would be scarce and people would be starving yet somehow they can spare the fuel to have a flame spouting guitar player on the front of one of the trucks chasing after the main characters and this serves what purpose exactly but to annoy the  out of you totally illogical and unbelievable people wasting bullets and gas chasing one truck with a huge convoy this is not gritty post apocalyptic this is just annoying absurd illogical and unbelievable this movie represents the pinnacle of mind numbing mindless entertainment for the dumbed down masses thats the only way i can see this getting an 82 imdb has lost all credibility with me after this,reality
the summary of this film is 1 little dialogues 2 lots of actions via cgi 3 the classic ending of a hero saving the planet again i gave 2 and not 1 only for the fact that there are even worse films than this one nobody can say that the acting can save the film because there are no dialogue except kill him or witness witness the action is present through many explosions and sand dusts the easy way out and the nearlykilled reappearing at the exception of a pregnant woman that is opened up for fun  i dont get it this is absolutely shamefulthe story is in a way similar to what can be found in the first trilogy you have to like it that way however the new version resembles to much the mummy returns the one that should not like the terminator and others in 2045 we will have a new remake unfortunately,reality
so they gave this movie an 84 well the first madwith mel gibson was pretty boring and the second same story the 3rd thunder dome was a bit better and then  this one action action and action explosions driving and more explosions and thats it an old scenario of getting gasoline and water to survive and 1 crazy old man that runs the whole clan same old same old and another thing is why do they have to remake every film that came out a long time ago like conan conan is the same example as this movie they made it again but less story and waaaaaay to much action and explosions cause that is what films do these days it does not matter what kind of story the film tells u as long as it has special effects and explosions hahahaha i say its a 4,reality
as per usual when a big blockbuster comes out some hype part of its viewers scream this is the new ultimate masterpiece that is so good they dont understand why a new religion based on it shouldnt be started immediatelydo not get fooled  george miller has only done what was needed to make his movie ultra popular and in this he has succeeded but as a movie in whole he fails and delivers a quite lame productionim not a big fan of the original series the 1st had its moments the thunderdome was a failure but the road warrior was an excellent movie i watched it again some months ago to show it to my 18 year old daughter and was still amazed by the quality of its production its story its multidimensional characters and its outrageous violence in relation to the era it was released foremost it had a feel of reality that made its postapocalyptic world totally believable  the canned dog food scene the fight for gasoline the bad guys the vehicles etc fury road tries hard to revive this atmosphere and failswhere mel gibson  and others  delivered a complex character chaotic and selfish tom hardy delivers nothing at all as for the other characters that have only a few lines in stock thus as it has been much said by other reviewers its hard to connect with them and in the end we dont care if they live or diewhere the road warrior provided a sense of reality in its everyday world in fury road the gothic designs bring only stupidity and make things laughable  in a world where everything is scarce who would build a car with 2 decks one on top of the other or who would be idiot enough to build a vehicle whose only purpose is to convey a metal guitarist and drummers  in any world who would be stupid enough to warn anybody that being addicted to water is dangerous  must we remind fury roads villain that without water even the baddest guy would die in a matter of 36 hours  what is left of fury road is the usual blockbuster parade  action explosions more action and more explosions in that the movies achieves what it was aimed for  mindless violence for the massesas for me i got bored after the first 30 minutes and while i kept going and despite a honorable realization and editing i couldnt get back into the movie and waited for it to end as soon as possibleconclusion  watch to be able to say youve seen it  and then have enough matter at hand to criticize it  but when its time to watch it again stick to the road warrior,reality
what can i say about feminist road first the film attempts to coast your attention with a two hour car chase while the action is decently brutal the plot has grand room for improvement first and foremost noone tells what to do the idea of is that he is the master of his own fate this film degrades him to just another onedimensional character like all the others again action was decent but there was little to no incentive to care about the characters the plot is a loose string of feminist propaganda in the form of slavery to some postapocalyptic barbarian king that noone is incentivized to care about i laughed as one of the female characters was run over because this movie was just a good action flick pay no attention to the halfbrained monkeys that insinuate that this movie is an epic it is not the plot sucked the characters were lame the action was the only reason to watch this movie,reality
as a cult follower of the original mel gibson series i was really hoping this would just be a remake of the original road warrior movie fury road is also post apocalyptic however with the ability to add even greater effects on screen and possibly a tuneup in writing secondary casting etc i got most of that but unlike the original version it had zero character building and a story line that was so confusing it took a third of the movie to figure out what the heck the plot mission was even about if youre familiar with the original road warrior movie and you liked the chase scene at the end youll love this version within ten minutes the movie is nothing more than a nonstop version of that same chase scene except a grueling 120 minutes long thats it nothing more,reality
caution spoiler alert headed down to see it first day i love charlize theron and tom hardy and all start with the good points good actionset design costumeshot rod type cars and trucks welded and stacked together i cant over state how great this movie looks and the guitar player with the flame thrower on the front of the truck its amazing so it looked cool but it was like a ferrari with a go cart motor i was immediately stuck by the lack of dialog and back story there is very little talkingstory i love action movies lots and lots of them but at least give me a reason to care about the people in the film just a couple minutes would be great but theres no story trucks drive go boom its a one trick pony charlize made me care for her more then anyone but just in skill of acting not story its all graphics which i love but nothing else so turn of your brain off and you may like it it seams like hype and not much more to me ps the artists that did the graphics are amazing in every way,reality
i dont understand the hype about this movie onscreen movements look choppy no plot direction mediocre or even bad acting and some cool action sequences this just isnt a good movie to me and i would love for someone to explain how this movie has a 90 metascore,reality
i was one year old kid when the first version of released i do see very good rating and reviewsdiscussions in message board for all the versions of the but the 2015 movie gave me a huge disappointment ive been watching this trailer since 3 months and i was challenging my colleagues that this could be a huge box office hit in 2015 but after watching first few portion of the movie i realized my challenge is totally wrong imagine a movie with just 2 hours of chasing and characters are not talking muchimagine a movie with great graphics but poor charactersyour mind will blow awayi am wondering how many viewers are giving very high rating to this movie no story no proper characters dont know what the characters are trying to do it gave me huge disappointment i am still in shock,reality
i saw it at the cinema and didnt think much of itthe other night i threw it in with my selection of 6for6 weekly dvds watched half of it and gave upit truly is one terrible excuse for a movie surely the people involved can see how bad it is as theyre making it im scratching my head here all involved in this film are clearly delusionali waited years and years for this film and now i wish they hadnt bothered beyond thunderdome was bad enough but this is a whole new level of badbad bad bad bad badi very much doubt whether i will ever bother with another george miller film,reality
i really wish the grading system would allow negative marks for a movie like this because a 1 out of 10 seems really too generous of a grade charlize theron usually is associated with great projects so i will forgive her this fauxpas as surely the blames lays elsewherei get it though hollywood can not come up with anything original and the classic has a huge cult following so the attraction for a huge payout is the usual mowhat i cannot comprehend is how a movie with such a huge budget can be so horribly boring there isnt much of a story not that i was expecting much but i was owed something much more coherent this plays a recycled theme but other than a huge chase around the desert only to get back to where they started seemed weak and pointless couldnt they have killed the bad guy to begin with proved the point and saved our time the urgency want there seemingly they had endless supplies of gas and ammo just no story i want my money back,reality
the road warrior is easily the finest of the quartet fury road is the worst the reason the road warrior delved however briefly into the character of the fury road deals more with highoctane pedaltothemetal fx himself is literally little more than a hood ornament for the first part of the film is this supposed to be the same character from the first three films his derringdo is undercut by the very cgi that saves him at least the road warrior like say george romeros knightriders featured some truly stunning stuntwork in fury road theres never any doubt that hell pull through as long as programmers at computer terminals have got his back anyway when the action abruptly stops the movie comes to a screeching halt there simply isnt anything in the way of story to keep it interesting for hardcore video gamers only,reality
ill keep it as short as i can music is lacking in the beginning make it odd and making you or me wonder is this for dramatic effect but there was no dramathe beginning action scenes at first seem impressive but looking back on it it was blandcar sucked it was hardly used on top of thatbarely said a word to the point of absurdityit kept blurring for too long as an artistic effect obviouslythe water dumping scenes were nonsense because there was clearly a substantial population who needed water and yet it was dumped in a wasteful way and it appeared hardly anyone was able to fill their baskets or in any decent way why no just pour it out efficiently rather than wastefully the action and fight scenes were cool but the characters were super shallow really hardly anyone said anythingimmortan was supposed to be some sort of mohammed prophet type clearly but in various scenes hes treated more like an angry dad in front of the worshipers how then could they be so passionate about him as they showed in the movie a fun movie but basically godless annoyingly stupid and a whoppingly disappointing end there was no impression i could get that even if furiosa even did make a speech to the people at the end when she won the city that she would have had the strength and she didnt or have been able to say anything impressive like i and here have set you free from this monster who pretended to be god why not just a line like that or why not saying i truly do not know this woman but she and i have slayed a monster for you impostering god now seek true redemption whatever that may be not even shouting it but saying it in his low key way on a microphone it didnt have to be dramatic but at least something to end the movie well but no nothing like a pretty car with an empty gas tank and going no whereit was also hard to understand a lot of what was said and when immortan was killed it was a blur what happened,reality
tom buddy could you not just like be a butler or somethingyou cannot act terrible as bain inaudible in the revenant honestly mate if youre gonna do an accent at least do it so that we understand you average at best in warrior but this this was an absolute mockery of a personal cult favorite of mine yeah tommy boy you are one ugly empty actor but you can only take so much of the blame for this abomination the blame falls squarely on that old prick george miller mate seriously this was your babywhich gibson poured his heart intoand now you churn up assholes like charlize theron and toolless tommy to assist you in completely destroying your earlier work i just wanted this movie to end it had no character studyi mean i could not relate at all to any of them who is who is that bald benoni bimbos character i got absolutely no emotion out of this movie just empty and ridiculous action scenes that never ended the namibian landscape has been scarred for 1000 years at least and this is all you have to show for it a tyrannic turd a sinister stain on the movie industrypeople must be so empty these days to have to resort to mind draining badaction movies as a form of escapism82 you gotta be kidding me 2015 in movies fell asleep in the revenant walked out of the martian and felt personally insulted by notmadatall furry toad,reality
it tries too hard its visually nice but everything is just so bad story wise and acting also why is it rated so high so much characters are thrown at you at once and its like they expect you to care for them i didnt care about any of them not even and i hate how it tries to be old fashion but modern at the same time these old fashion scenes that im talking about almost always happen right before a fade outheres how a random scene in the movie would go show vehicles moving zoom in show a character zoom in show vehicles zoom out show someone die or people dying turn camera a bit then follow up with an explosion now zoom into a character we dont care about and show them trying to give some kind of emotion then continue this formula in a continuous circlewhy they show so many fillers in scenes is astounding do we really have to look at some guy using a guitar that shoots out flames what a joke doesnt help the story one bit one bit oh my gosh and how they try to make us care for by showing his daughter its pointless he barely even talks oh my and i hate how this movie tries to be artsyit was somewhat entertaining to watch because i like tom hardy and charlize theron also why is there so many scenes with these models trying to act we get that youre prize objects and youre trying to better yourselves and leave that wretched place for how you were treated but you do absolutely nothing except no im right you do nothing to really help the storyso this is how the story goes at the starting place being ruled by some dude a person leaves and tries to escape with people ruler follows a lot of fighting person who left to escape wants to go back now ruler realizes and says they know the place is unguarded they are heading back zoom into ruler character and other pointless character then they go back more fighting now they are back to place where they started the endhonestly its worse than that and a waste of time did i mention that i had to watch this movie on a several days it was so bad that i didnt even want to finish it and i knew the ending would be that bad i expected it,reality
i had to watch this twiceok maybe 15 timescouldnt quite get through it the second time the entire movie is so incredibly confusing and nonsensical i almost began to admire it in its confusingness until i realized that it is just one long borefest there is nothing cool going on here no underlying tapestry of cinematic silk the movie looks good but thats about it the desert scenery is really nice the approaching sandstorm scene is really epic it was scenes like that which made me have to try watching it again the problem is that the characters are completely boring then theres this ongoing story about milk and and these girls with chastity beltsreally huh they try and find a land that is green and not desert woah really thats the whole movie then they keep talking about valhalla and theres that silly guy with the guitar that shoots fire lol and these guys keep spraying their face with silver hair sprayis that getting them high i have no idea why anyone would enjoy this movie so silly if you want to a real movie about a post apocalyptic world then watchthe rover,reality
this movie had everything going for it but where is the soul of it its beautifully filmed very cinematic the action is not too shabby cool explosions great cast of actors insane univers etc but to be honest i just dont feel ittom hardy is using his bane character again wearing a weird face mask and using a weird voice againcharlize theron isnt really performing great in this either a bit boring to be honestthat zombieboy i cant remember his name not a great cast for this moviethat big bald guy the evil valhallacrazy boss right hand is overacting like crazy  and hes just too visual in the scenes hes inthe whole womanpowerreunionscene in the desert seems like a bad play where everyone is thinking more about where to stand on the stage than about what they are suppose to portraitthe list could go onto sum it up a great movie potential wastedgive an oscar to the filmcrew its a beautiful and very cinematic filmthe director fire him and kick him out of hollywoodthis movie is hyped so they will still make their money shame on them,reality
this movie is a good one to catch in theater esp in 3d but its not all its cracked up to be fortunately its still better then the movies theyve been putting out at least its watchable lets start with the good its colorful action packed loud full of explosions the costuming and makeup is fabulous it lets itself be quirky which gives it that 80s movie twinkle that looks good on gritty action flicks it could have been a movie without the shameless branding now time for the bad first off the plot is weak and a serious rip off of the movie phoenix the warrior 1988 and then the scenes of the city are obviously ripping off metropolis 1927seriously guys and the wives are weakpoor character development and motivation unrecognizable as a hes so unnecessary for the plot that one of the bad guys seems to be the good guy instead the wives are offensively stereotyped unrelateable and poorly cast the only good acting in the whole movie is from the older women there is no goresplatter and surprisingly little blood or violence for an action flick it all happens off screen people survive car crashes that throw them from the vehicle etc without a scratch at the same time things are stylized giving the movie a childish animated feel like they were seeking a pg13 rating finally technical stuff the lighting on the cg is poor at best the cg is weak when the movie is not in 3d and its full of cringe worthy moments designed for 3d that dont hold up without the audio of the voices and guns are too low compared to the music and sound effects its causes a lot of whats happening moments because you cant tell what someone said or that someone shot a gun etc it doesnt help that everyone is talking in awful put on wwe wrestling voices calling each other brother like hulk hogan and their accents keep changing the dialog is terrible even for an action flick you cant even understand what all the main characters names are they are so poorly presented,reality
great camp  comic book meets video game especially art design action and visuals very simple story line and simplistic allegory for teenagers  again like a comic book  cool visuals though  again like a comic book meets video game yes i know im repeating myself  but why all these reviews as if this movie was the greatest masterpiece of the century did critics lose their mind got paid off or is this just the time of anything goes the initial was a campish b movie which unexpectedly struck a cord with the zeitgeist of the time  this is a soupedup b movie on steroids which works if thats your thing but why these insane critics reviews i guess these people have never read comic books aka graphic novels or they got paid off,reality
this new movie has none of the grit fierceness or reality of the 80s versionthis version of is 3rd best behind the road warrior and beyond thunderdome was a full disgrace to the franchisethe new movie is cool and full of action  but has zero character depth or development i never cared if any characters including lived or died i never felt tension or fear or anything but tired from watching endless explosions that have no effect on the story i never thought i would say it but there was too much battle you need to have the calm quiet lulls between heavy action to really appreciate who the characters are while they navigate the highs and lows of the storyfury road  watered down reboot of original,reality
like few others i must say that this movie is very lameno storyno main ideaonly great visual effects and great acting of my favorite actress charleze theron who takes the lead in the movie till the endin not even the main characterthe whole movie has very little speech lines of all actors togetherthe characters mostly look like freaks or human monsters with very basic needs for survivalthe long road to the green land in the hot desert made without any food or wateronly fueli gave 3 stars for great effects and charlize therons dedicated acting ps if you love to let your brain work while watching the moviethan skip this masterpieceyou wont be sorry,reality
i am 34 so i have grown up with movies i went to cinema with loads of expectations unfortunately it was an standard hollywood action movie there was no there was only charlize theron the accent and the way they speak of the wild savage people was better than todays oxford university students which is ridiculous those people lives in a very hostile place without any education and you do not even expect them to speak at all but they speak like theatre actors this puts me off a lot script was extremely artificial and most of the the as amateur as very cheap tv movie everybody was giving speeches to other all the time maybe action wise it was a good movie but that is all full of clichsthe guy who wrote the script should find a job somewhere else all the time i felt like that the director has lots of money and wants to prove himselfi gave six because of the charlize theron she was the only person who can act in the movieit is very sad to say it was like a theatre with a giant budget i still feel like it is an insult to original seriessorry,reality
yes it is filled with wild explosive madness yes it is filled with emotions because there is a plot yes it is filled with passion see this movie the cast is strong mr hardy may not have much to chew on in this movie but it does not diminish his drive it is not the same but it doesnt really have to be i really expected tina turner to pop out of one of the rocks with that badass hairdo she had in one of the earlier films it was definitely therons move but she had a lot of help with it i just saw it and the theater was packed thomas hardy  always a pleasure charlize theron  hats off iwill see this again and i will quite enjoy it the second time around,reality
car chasespecial effects visual and sound amazing but no story no any artistic value and no meaning at all cars and other vehicles are made like toys they put too much ironsteel more spikes guns and turrets and thats it ok and tires big like my women d mutans looks more like degenerate puppets then real humans with problems of radiation pollution they spend fuelammunition and water like there is no tomorrow d i miss survival instinct and resource fight of post apocalyptic world also there is no memorable characters like bubba zanetti just shallow lines between shooting  kids who didnt watch old will be pleased and amazed by special effects but any serious watcher will be disappointedi am big fan of 12 but this is just 2 hours of action show sorry but i cannot swallow it,reality
if you go into this movie expecting it to be tied to the original trilogy youll be dissappointed  is more of a side character in this movie even his car which was a main character in the first 2 original movies is destroyed early in the movie so im gonna be honest to me it isnt a movie  its more about charleize therons character  also really really really predictable movie,reality
this movie was a serious disservice to the classic series so many things in this movie were just plain stupid the only thing redeemable about this is the original premiseeverything else was intellectually devoid of reason special effects were pretty good and some of the action was good as well unfortunately the dialog and events just didnt mesh because they were just so badso poorly written and executed,reality
a harrowing depiction of postapocalyptic life with amazing scenery staggering amount of detail very brief and succinct dialogue constant shifting of allegiances and a keepyouguessing story line just gives me the impression this was an intricate creative process rather than a moneyspinning exercise by hollywood 2 hours of utter mayhem,reality
wow just wow 81 most superficial film ever the ones who gave low ratings speak the real truth this film really has no characters to really care for and there really is no story at allthe little girl flashbacks was having pointless its just chaserunning away and then they decide to head back and chaserun again seriouslyi guess people dont really care about stories anymore i heard the action was supposed to be impressive but even that wasnt worthy of the hype or praise water world has way better action and is more interesting the pacing is horrible its so repetitive and boring production setvalue alone doesnt make a movie deserve a 810 ridiculous one of the worst most overrated movies ever,reality
it started off good enough however 30 min in nothing has happened an hour into it still the same its sort of a goofy mess half way through it i am still not completely sure whats going on or who these people are the fact that this was talked about during the oscars is just more proof of why the oscars is a complete and utter joke this movie came out at the right time people like myself starving for something thats not typical hollywood garbage you probably like myself sit through this and tell yourself thats its good that tom hardy is cool and this movie is one of the best films of the past few years but its not its just another watered down quick cash grab remakesequel advertised as more but nothing more this movie is not bad its just not what all the hype would have you believe,reality
tom hardy and furiosa charlize theron manage to come together after a massive chase sequence cumulating in them fighting for control eventually they start to see they have the same goal achieve some sort of redemption for their past failures what lacks in story it makes up for with pulsating action sequence in a constant chase fury road is everything waterworld wishes it was except where there was water there is now only sand a dry desolate world where people act like obedient zombies the attachment to religion and blind followers is undeniable taking swings at notions of a womens place is to breed that an act of sacrifice will be reworded in the afterlife and that the preacher is the same as a god the action in the chase sequences is everything fast and the furious wishes it was capturing the stark beauty that the namib desert has to offer in the background golden landscapes and wispy sands empty hot but at night its cold and saturated in the blue dark fury roadreally captured the ghostly southern african desert superbly and the extreme temperatures from day to night without any character making reference to itthe traveling band is just awesome and needs a mentionthe oddest aspect would be hugh keaysbyrnes inability to act through the costume that resembled something similar to a mask tom hardy donned in batman and blew the character out the water swing and a miss for hughnicholas hoult brings a very unexpectedly tender performance to one of the henchmen nuxthe costumes are out of this world not merely the choice in some of the amazing apocalyptic desert couture but the amount of it the scope is epic and the cinematography captures the amount of depth in these massive shots flawlesslyin spite of the lack of character development the action is so poised and beautiful to watch without becoming slow and empty the film is just sick cool fleek whatever prodigious cinema is just sensational,reality
if your reading this review to decide whether you should watch this film or not then stop and just go watch itit would be an injustice to go into the ins and outs of this film  just watch the trailer but if you want to know why a you should watch this then read on remember the hype that the lord of rings film or the matrix created when it was first released this film will probably be described in the same proverbial vernacular as those big blockbustersamazing movies should thrill and grip you from the start to the end and leave you wanting more this is a truly spectacular film  the fact that it made me want to register on imdb and give it a 10 out of 10 rating and write a review should tell you more than anything else ive writtenone for the cinema  watched it in 2d will be watching it in 3d ibefore it goesthis is what cinema is about and all from the same director of haopy feet 1  2 who would have thought,reality
this movie was pointless crapi would go on but this movie doesnt even deserve anymore of my attention or time so dont waste yours either dora the explorer is better than this waste of film whoever made this movie should be shot in the kneecaps if movies are ever banned in the future and some sort of burning of films takes place like book burning in nazi germany this film should be the tinder to start the bonfire if this is the future of movies then there is no hope for the world and that makes me a sad panda do yourself a favor and do not see this mess of a movie and if you were one of the unfortunate people who received this movie as a christmas gift dont even unwrap the plastic take it outside set it on fire then urinate on it to put out the flames,reality
overall i should admit like most hollywood movies these days are waste of time and money i only enjoyed partially i was even generous to give rate 5 the 3d part of it it is sad to see these type of movie with no soul or good story line to follow or to get connected even gets attention and sells in box office even if it draws attention beside 3d it only indicates there is no good movie to compare with basically the monopoly of movie industry will end of making more movies like that and it kills peoples taste in a long run in general if you dont get connected from the beginning by an above average story line you wont get much excited with the fast pace and excitement the director tries to implant in the viewer these type of stories the moment you leave the cinema it is gone from your head nothing to think remember or learn from i know some people specially young generation are into these type of movie  by the way what was the message,reality
i am so frustrated i cant explain myself these good ratings of this movie i can say i am well trained on hardcore horror movies but i could bare only 20 some minutes of this film it was so disgusting so brutal and so meaningless i literally went out of the cinema after 20 minutes  and i can say that horror movies not affecting me at all these 20 minutes burnt into my mind and i just hope i could forget it somehowhow is it possible is the problem with me ,reality
i have no idea how people are describing this movie as a masterpiece half way through i was thinking this movie is crap but at least it started to get better about 23 of the way through as many others have mentioned it is a 2 hour car chase with basically no dialog or plot other than escape to a better life had some flashbacks that were never explained at all and what little dialog the movie had sounded like a 12yearold wrote it yes there were some cool car crashes and action sequences but how that makes this a masterpiece is beyond me i am a fan from back in the day and although i figured this movie wouldnt top it i didnt think it would be this lame either maybe we need jj abrams to direct every movie reboot so they dont suck,reality
how to make a really awful mindnumbing horrid puking cringeworthy hateful silly stupid sick marred subpar flawed blemishful movie make one with no plot with several absolutely out of place looking models with endless rushing and racing with endless violence and with endless explosions add blood add silly costumes add ugly freaks galore add oil spills add sand and add unwanted and unsuitable sexy innuendos this is what you get  awful which leaves a profound shock of wasted time and a feeling of being had by even beautiful models like kershaw or whiley or kravitz even fine actresses like theron could not save this monstrosity from being a whole complete total wholesome flop on all sides this is an example of a horrible totally ugly and unpardonably silly failure which made some cash and was praised i do not dig this sick liking of sick films i do not recommend this awful idiocy to anybody,reality
i dont know what i find more shocking  just how bad fury road is or the fact that it has an average rating of 81 on imdb if you want to spend two hours watching back to back action sequences explosions and car chases without really caring for any sort of story or plot then this is just for youi didnt particularly like the other films but i would watch any of them again over this literally nothing of significance happens during the entire duration of fury road nothing this is easily one of the most boring pointless films ive ever seen in my life and one of my least favourite it has no redeeming qualities at all not oneunless you want to stare at repetitive action sequences and have you ear drums ruined by persistent noise for two hours i suggest you avoid this pathetic excuse of a movie,reality
i found this movie entertainingthe same way i find the sharknado series entertaining i spent the movie laughing at the ridiculous plot and action scenes the tanker full of breast milk just odd the scene with the small man commanding a room of women being milked was the most strange thing i saw in this movie and i really dont know how to explain how i feel i feel lost and that ive wasted two hours of my life on what i thought would be a great movie but ended up being easy to laugh at how ridiculous this movie was very unrealistic even for the scifi world which is hard to do if you enjoy watching utterly pointless trash movies then i highly suggest this i had a lot of good laughs watching this movie i feel bad for whoever paid to watch this though its a real shame,reality
i cannot describe it better no no no it may had passed a couple of months since it was this movies premiere well i havent seen it but i could feel it would be a disappointment however it seemed to appeal so i forced myself to give it a chance before i continue i want to say that i love action movies i grew up watching terminator robocop lord of the rings pirates of the caribbean im a pure late 90s child but people come on this movie didnt even try clich violence without reason so many unneseccary plans excessive scenes etc only the photography tried to save the whole thing but it wasnt enough tom hardy can do a lot better than that just remember child 44 or legend charlize theron was good but still not enough so this can be a message to all those producers and directors make action movies which have something to show us dont just drop sterile action and clich in a pot and pretend you made a movie410ps a well done to the photographers and make up artists who did their job very good,reality
ive rated this movie just above awful how anyone can say this is a great action movie is beyond me  unless its a load of 4 year olds rating it  firstly tom hardy does a poor job of being hes no mel gibson i didnt feel for him i didnt despair for him  he is so bland  boring and has no personality i could hardly make out what he was saying maybe he though he was still blain in the old movies you really got a sense of the desperation how everything was scarce i this movie nothing seems scarce fuel in abundance weapons and ammo in abundance cars with more gadgets than a swiss army knife it just didnt make sensethe plot itself is a joke half the movie they are riding away being chased the other half they return from where they came being chased again i got no feeling for any of the characters  the plot is poor the acting is poor  there is just no dialogue or depth what so everthis movie is just another example of hollywood polishing up old franchises with special effects but adding no depth or story line to them what so ever,reality
i was informed by my scholarly wife that this movie was analyzedpraise for its feminist themes if that was the case it would explain the warped critical acclaim it received for any that did have anything to do with the visual appeal and sound of the movie it is a beautiful looking film a la 300 in a different way neither of these visually stunning films are appealing as dramas if they were to promote a film with a femalefeminist led tone it should have been inside out all the major characters in that film were female had depth and you cared about them that is not the case in this film and all the critics that gave this film such rave reviews did a major disservice to their readers batman vs superman was decent compared to this and that movie subpar at best so much of this film does not make sense from the rolling rock concert in the middle of a life and death battle to the motivation of the characters once their initial plan goes i wonder how many fans who actually like compelling stories with their action felt the sound have said witnessme as the walked into the cinema to see this beautiful but shallow disaster,reality
note this is a text version of my popcorn lobotomy scathing review videohttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvgmcbvidyn3wthe video review is much more funso while youre all salivating like pavarottis dogs yeah pavarottis dogs  i guess dogs drool when they hear the great tenors or something at the prospect of a fury road sequel im left scratching my headi mean how exactly did this movie become such a fan favorite and more to the point how did its popularity end up moving the cigar chomping tophatwearing outoftouch stiffs at the academy to vote for the damned thingmaybe its because im just not into impractically pimped up vehicles or people in wacky childrens facepaint screaming all their lines but i just didnt get much out of fury roadand im sorry i know its popular i know this is probably going to tick you all off but i just dont think one long car chase sequence deserves to be called a movie no matter how well its executed and it certainly doesnt deserve to pick up anything but technical awards at the oscarsnow obviously some of the action is cool and there are some pretty cgi backgrounds  got you dazzled did it  but without the grounding of an post2ndgradelevel story and characters i can vaguely relate to its all as pointless as pointing out that pointlessness is pointless itself seriously who cares if tom hardy gets hit with an exploding spear if we dont even know who he is or why hes driving recklessly around the desert like dodi fayed on a severe acid tripyes theres a basic functioning backstory where wife and kid get their faces mushed at what appears to be a monster truck rally  but you could count the screen time devoted to it in framesand of course thats just none of the other characters even get a few frames of flashback to explain their presence in the story or to motivate us to care about themso paints a dystopic picture of a postapocalyptic world where people seem be willing to go that extra mile to imize the risk of losing an eye but despite all the sharp edges and hard surfaces people drive around like maniacs doing ridiculous stunts and taking really unnecessary risks in a chaotic effort to blow each other up for i dunno reasonsour hero spends much of his time chained up gagged and mounted on the front of a car like some kind of glorified hood ornament and even when he finally manages to break free of his chains he still opts to communicate in gestures and grunts even when hes threatening to shotgun the tits off a bunch of innocent young girls who are just trying to engage in a little wet and wild titillation while in mortal danger of being killed or recaptured by the overweight asthmatic master and his cronies of course its all part of the films decision to tell its story is a purely visual fashion right like the silent films of old and hasnt that garnered respect from critics and audiences alike oh minimal dialog how clever wow regale us some more george miller you maestromaybe while youre here you could explain to me why a movie with minimal dialog makes time to include lines like now we bring home the booty and hes a crazy smeg who eats shlangerand you know i use the term story in the loosest of terms here because is a story about a bunch of people who go somewhere to find something find its not there and go back to where they startedalong the way the most vulnerable and innocent of them including a pregnant girl and a nice old lady are killed by a gang of pole vaulting mimes then again you could well argue that the pregnant girl didnt die because she was being chased by circus freaks but that she slipped to her death because that prick shot her in the leg earlier in the filmhonestly would you even know was the hero if his name wasnt 50 of the titleso now this piece of crap movie i just described has now won some oscars i guess youre all pretty pleased with yourselves are ya changed the face of the oscars and all that pushed through the typical movie snobbery of the academy award voters to get recognition for a fan favorite popcorn flickbut think about it what have you done i hear a lot of people concerned that the deadpool movie will spawn a whole bunch of rrated comic book movies with shoehorned violence profanity and nudity but what about what types of movies will the cigar chomping hollywood execs be emboldened to pursue as a result of its success huhnow its 100 proved that movies dont need story character or subtlety to win awards all you need to do is hire a bunch of olympic pole vaulters and javelinchuckers to bounce around like rejects while you blow stuff up and bring on the oscar gloryso get ready for a sting of inferior sequels and copycats and dont come whining to me when you realize that films have become devoid of story character or a coherent narrative in favor of flashy action and effectsbecause in this life we reap what we sow,reality
i normally dont write reviews but i felt this is a good day to start mainly because i am very frustrated by the positive reviewsthis movie is the definitely the worst that i have ever seen it is totally unoriginal the acting sucks and the overall storyline is very boring also decisions made by the characters make no sense and lots of weird things are left unexplainedi stopped taking this movie seriously after 20 minutes or so when they revealed the destination of their journey the green fields of many mothersi cant believe that this movie has got an 81 imdb ranking this means that lots of people actually liked this movie there even seems to be some consensus on it being the best movie of 20152016 i am therefore reconsidering the value of an imdb rating,reality
if this is entertainment then im clearly not open to this genrebecause  fury road won six oscars for aussie i figured id better see it although i must admit i had severe reservationsthey werent unfounded i guess the oscars were confined to technical aspects of the movie and i suppose one has to acknowledge the skills of those people so recognisedhowever how on earth this movie ever got nominated for best film i have absolutely no idea its not like i dont enjoy fantasy films because the lord of the rings trilogy comprise some of the best films ever madewhat has happened to all the old values,reality
im really hoping someone can enlighten me as to how this film scored over a 40 never mind 82 i found it repetitive pointless and generally quite boringi was a fan of the original movies in the 80s but i have no idea what the writers and directors were trying to bring across with this fury road instalment i just wish they hadnt botheredi appreciate the ethos genre and feel of what the whole film is about i just think it could have been done in 20minutes thus saving themselves a load of money  and the viewers from having to watch the same action scenes over and over again not to mention a very shallow and weak storyline which just seemed to get lost anyway amidst the sand and ott mayhemim not saying fury road is a bad like unwatchable movie i just found that after 20 minutes any originality storyline and excitement had vanished  to the point where i felt i was on my own road to despairwith the amount of hype the film has created no doubt it will certainly be watched but having a score of 82  oh please im giving this one a 4  just never to be seen again,reality
if youre a fan of pure nonstop action flickers then youd probably enjoy this one it only comes up to breath a few times throughout the entire movie it is a god awful film due to the incredibly thin storyline i had no emotional attachment to any of the characters and wasnt fully clued into what was actually happening to be honest with you to give it some credit 90 of the stunts were genuine and the lack of cgi made the visuals at times fairly impressive action junkies will enjoy the vast amount of explosions enough there to entertain a 10 year old me for sure granted i havent seen the previous movies and it wasnt a remake it was following the previous storyline but im guessing for at least a few of the people that havent watched the prequel it was a bit like watching a sequel to a movie youve never seen not having a clue what is happeningoverall it was a very poor film easy to see why it did well in visuals sound and wardrobe but also just as easy to see why it wasnt nominated for best picture,reality
hi and welcome to the big fix  my top ten things wrong with film  1 the support acting was so over the top it nearly made me turn it off  in the first 15 minutes  2 the main cast script was so poor they almost got lost not too sure  why the main actors took these roles  3 the never ending chase man did this seem to go on forever in a  world of fuel shortage  4 was there actually a story alright the genre never had much  of a story but i looked and looked but couldnt find any existence  5 the old peoples home bikers oh come on  6 the one thing that i thought might be ok was the action but it  actually added to the nonsense rather than drag it out of its  mediocrity  7 ok one of the real things that i found bugged me was the lack of  inspiration in the costumes it really appeared as if they had used the  previous costumes also the hair styles was  8 the cinematography set in namibia yes it was not even set in  australia well what can i say one minute it is plodding along the  next all the scenes are speeded up why would you do that it makes it  look like a scene from benny hill  9 there must be some serious money behind a film this bad to  get so many good reviews and then receive so many oscar nominations  it just shows the whole film business is contaminated  10 wrap up i really would grade this movie as a 1 to counter balance  the 82 and sometimes i might do it on principle but it does deserve  a 2 i would highly recommend people to never ever see this movie and  to certainly not waste any money on it if you have just watched the  oscars and seen it win all those oscars this is all just money talking  and please do not be taken in by it this really was one of the worst  films of the year,reality
i really dont get it why people loved it so much sure it was not bad or something but it was just another movie with predictable conversations tons or explosions andcars there are like 50 or so movies like that this yearmaybe i am just stupid i dont understand how genius this move movies like that every year and now its nominated for an oscar for this or maybe a lot of people have lost their mind like seriously that is just an average hollywood moneymaker and nothing more if you are bringing attention to that you should and for other clichs like transformers the new ice cube movie fast and furious and a lot more and the actor werent so great i wasnt really impressed from a single quote or from a expressed emotion only action and action and action thats it i just dont get itthank you for reading,reality
now since my fellow actiondystopianpostapocalyptic movie lovers pointed out clearly in their reviews im not going to actually review this utter disappointment of a movie what i will do is pointing out the reasons why this shameful endeavor gets so high rankings and praises the reasons are twofold1 feminismthis movie is like a textbook of feminismwoman empowerment wrapped up in explosions and car chases and then marketed with a respectable name to hide this very fact its a manifesto an agenda fed to the masses in form of a movie theres enough feminism imagery and symbolism in this very expensive piece of crap that calling it an action movie is laughablefirst we get the evil patriarch ruling an almost allmale society with cruel control and an iron fist complete with him wearing his symbol of power as a codpiece then we have the exploited milk producing females symbolizing male exploitation this dad also comes with his own harem whom he sees as mere objects complete with a vault door and thorned chastity belts he is ugly he is dirty he is evil he is bad he is a man much like almost every other male character in the movieon the opposite front we have females caring model beautiful clean and dashing for the entire movie powerful and on the run from the evil man we also have the amazon woman only promised land of greenery and peace apparently with tribes named after different parts of female genitalsreal classy to round it out we even have the love interest of todays feminists abortion yeah take out that bad mans baby boy out of the sacred mothers body as violently and as disgustingly as you can we get it men are ugly bad evil things women are beautiful good goddesses and thats why in a movie called a pair of bolt cutters get more screen time than the sidekick who strangely bears the name of the movieall this is the major motivation as to why this movie gets so high ratings and nominations a few critics are simply feminists but the majority just wants to ride the band wagon fearing if they not they will be called sexists and their jobs and reputations threatened every movie that has pro feminismgay symbolism beneath an apparently completely different face theme gets the same treatment fear of becoming ostracized has freedom of speech by they balls for shame2 paid reviewsits very simple you dont even need to go out of your way just check the positive 10 10 reviews here in imdb the user names so orderly and genuinelike alone would give them away they are not normal internet users and if thats not enough the ala publicity style back of the box style writings of these socalled reviews should make it obvious enough that almost all of the perfect score reviews here and elsewhere are forgeries not done by simple movielovers but paid for and done by professional marketing people viral marketing at its best and its worst to mislead and distract consumers dishonest and disgustingagain for shame for shame for shame and for shame,reality
so to date its easily more than doubled the 150 million spent to make it and in addition looks like they might have found a replacement for mel whos still the best by far so we can now all be sure well be seeing more of this very worn out series passing off two solid hours of pretty much nothing but constant mindnumbing crashes and explosions is now what we all have to look forward to in the future there was not much acting required for this production because there really was not much of any storyline to tell in this overly bland script but maybe it will make some of the younger generation go back and look at several of the previous works they might not have been as action packed as this monstrosity but they were overall much more consistently interesting viewing,reality
disjointed pointless story with generally poor acting doesnt even say anything for half the film and when he does it is more of a superficial grunt im afraid i think the male lead was weak female lead is decent some interesting bad guys and some good fight scenesspecial effects but none of this is enough to elevate this film above the level of dire in my view they did try to keep some of the charming madness from the original but ultimately whilst they had some success the film is let down by the very poor plot and script and mediocre acting ultimately whilst an action movie you have to connect with and career about the characters at least to some degree but with this film it simply wasnt possible avoid 4  10,reality
the first had a few strong attractions it was overtly australian in a few dimensions which hit a niche of the familiar exotic it was pure science fiction in that it abstracted our world into a future where only the tiniest fragment of what we know was carried over and amplified that fragment revolved around one of our most peculiar social constructions the wild motorcycle gang it is peculiar in being largely a cinematic invention paris being romantic is anotherthe notion of a motorcycle gang originated in california after wwii where returning gis mostly tattooed navy men who had served in the south pacific bought surplus army motorcycles the notion of lawlessness unique to motorcycles is from marlon brando as copied by sonny barger it is a wholly cinematic convention made real like movie gangster talk as adopted by the mafia joined this to an equally unique cinematic convention the chase now this after decades it is still the most pure of science fiction abstractions it is still overly australian more about that in a moment it still takes the chase very seriously but it now employs a reverse irony on the motorcycle gang trope moving it into fast and furious car territory merged with comic heavy metal and pushed into humor the trick with these is to exaggerate enough to make us laugh but not so much that we dont engage with it in its terms among the australian notions is a new one architectural dust most of the stunts were practical but all of the environments were artificial this is the first time i know that a big film used the same effects shop melbournebased iloura for both composites the deserts and cliffs and dust different technologies are required but a similar notion of texture was used and the two are combined in the dust storm near the beginning the result is an astonishing effect of surface become air the cinematographer seems to have been aboard in the way he overexposes and undersaturates especially during the night scenes i dont know of any other film save derzu uzala that attempts this and all kurosawa had was snowi hope other australian productions adopt this technique as it seems both very advanced cinematically and wholly australian when michael jackson advanced the art of using a spatial camera we did see that become common very quickly first through hollywoods use of weta and then other shopsand we did see the world quickly copy the motorcycle gang trope,reality

flash reviewthey used gravedigger the monster truck in this it would have been fun to be part of the vehicle design team as they were all wild mean and powerful looking this movie kept the vibe and atmosphere of the originals dirty grimy gross and vast in landscape to paint a picture of an evil overlord who enslaves people and withholds water in a hopeless desert land during an escape attempt encounters a few women and they begin to team up to escape the wasteland in hopes of reaching the womens homeland like many in this movie series the plot felt thin and a vague and barely enough to contain the wild and spectacular car chase battles this movie did not disappoint with its pure action which was well choreographed elaborate full of dirt blood sweat and fire a lot to visually digest on the screen i wish this story had better character engagement or reward for watching as by the end i just felt dirty and that i needed a bath,reality
although theres not a lot of dialog what is there is very good theres real depth and breath to even the smallest characters shown which makes the viewer just want to know even more about them im not normally interested in this genre if there even is a genre here but even on the small screen this movie was just too damn good to be believed it was almost like 2001 a space odyssey in that its hard to compare to any other movie  including the other movies so  dont be turned off by the nay sayers and by the type of movie it is just watch it twice at least and try to be in that world for a couple of hours this is top class stuff from start to finish and  the music is great too,reality
910 its action packed and well balanced with a story ive never seen a movie that has so greatly balanced the clich of damsels in distress while not making it clich in a way and also evening it out with a story where women rise from actual oppression i think this is for any audience type and can be looked at in any view whether it be a feminist perspective of the rise against the patriarchy or just another save the society from this dystopian nightmare i went into this absolutely hating the style the stupid guitar guy and drum people the whole worlds look characters actions and the slower start introducing and all but i ended up really admiring it this movie also does a survival story gravity in the middle of nowhere and doesnt ruin anything when it has not that much dialogue with barely any talking between the group you sense the bond the have with all their actions facial expressions and etc its great movie even though i still have problems with the lack of some dialogue and all the flashbacks the villain who wasnt even powerful maybe thats the point ey and society but either way its a stunning movie,reality
tldr if youre looking for a movie with fantastic camera work and very little plot to follow give fury road a watch if you want a deep plot move along nothing to see herethe only reason this movie got a 610 from me is because it only had half of what i think makes a good movie fury road has fantastic cinematography quite possibly the best i have ever seen but it has almost no plot the plot is basically how your sixth grade teacher tells you to write a plot main character gets in trouble does a thing problem gets worse does a different thing and the problem is solved thats iton the other hand is a pleasure to watch all the shots are smooth and flow very well from one to the next while still giving you a sense of fast rough action this is something even the matrix has a hard time with yes i just said that has better fight scenes than one of the best fighting movies of all time the effects are over the top and just incredible the portable metal concert seen in the trailer is even better in the moviethis movie inspired me to go back and watch the older movies and the lack of plot kind of makes sense the whole point is that he lost his family in the first movie the world just doesnt make sense anymore and all he sees is mindless violence so the lack of plot can be excused to a point because it was intentional but plot is one of the things i look for most in a movietv showtldr if youre looking for a movie with fantastic camera work and very little plot to follow give fury road a watch if you want a deep plot move along nothing to see here,reality
the movie has no story and is boring so much but the special effects and camera works are fantastic so its very sad that they didnt have a story in the movieafter 1 hour i started dozing off so what ive done is skipping the rest of scenes quickly i think that the next 1 hour of the movie ive reduced into 510 minutes because nothing changed in the movie it was the same thing during 2 hours a truck moving fast here and there the team few hot girls and the poor were fixing it while being chased by groups of amateur actors riding either motorcycles or childish vehicles so dont expect a story at all the only good thing which is very professional are the special effects and camera work but rest of things are missing  no story and some of actors seemed to be hobbyist rather than professionals mainly the guys that were chasing the truck but the hot girls in the truck including were acting fine not bad comparing to other guysive also noticed in some parts of movie a lip sync delay and it bothers to see the unnatural mismatch of some words and lips moving thats the first thing that catches my eyes i believe that any movie must be watched many times in postproduction process in order to avoid such a thing because the production is really very good and very professional i loved the coloring and composition of all the frames and the special effects were wow  so those little mistakes of lip sync delay could be avoided the good parts that it wasnt during all the movie but only in some parts i think in the first 1020 minutesif the movie had a good story then i would rate it 1010 stars  in other words i can say that that production special effects camera work sound and music all deserve 1010 stars but the plot only 110 stars because there was no storyone more thing very important as other reviewer said previously the movie should be called furiosa instead of because it was focused on the character furiosa a woman she was acting very good and most of the time majority of the focus was around her instead of that didnt look as hero at all it seems like furiosa was the leading actor protagonist and was only a supporting actorso naming the movie is misleading because only some elements from the original from the 80s were reused in this new movie such as the vehicles in the desertdont expect to see a person called smashing the bad guys no such a thing the movie from the 80s with mel gibson was way better were it deserved to be named regarding music and sound the music and sound were very good the music is matching the style of movie energetic combined with special effects the sound design was professional very clean and creative but only one little was probably overused and i dont know who is in charge for those ideas the sound technician or the director or both they used a lot of reverb for producing wet sound which is good when its done properly but when overused then it might sound unnatural and artificial for example they were using this trick many time blinding the sound that was produced from the actors with the music for example when an actor was hitting a vehicle then the sound of hitting transitioned into music hitting drums the transition was done so smooth but they have used like this trick many times until it became a predictable thats because recycling the idea over and over becomes something that the viewer isnt excited from then it becomes boring anyway maybe not everyone notice this thing its not a disaster  but its good point that other filmmakers should be aware of dont reuse the same tricks many times in the same movie  surprise the viewer all the timebottom line if you would like to see nice effects blowing vehicles for 2 hours then this is the movie for you but if you are that type of person who must have a story in a movie then beware because you will be bored as hell and very angry for wasting your money,reality
i very rarely write a review usually just giving a rating as the minimum of 10 lines set by imdb annoys me however as a big fan of the original movies the first and second ones i thought the one with tina turner was rubbish i felt the need to add my thoughtswhen i found the page for fury road i expected an average score of around 6 and was flabbergasted to see such a high score the plot is weak there is no acting to speak of and there is way too much cgi this is a movie for kids and easily impressed adults consisting of fighting shooting ad explosions im amazed that george miller had anything to do with it as it is completely lacking in imagination or vision give it a miss and watch the originals instead,reality
i could only stomach the first hour or so of this mindless drivel before i turned it off there is zero story now i know its an action movie and thats not the point of it but my god it should have at least a minimal plot and story its just people i cant understand when they talk riding around the desert this was just an excuse to use a bunch of cgi graphics for some hair brained mindless pointless car stuntsaction sequences ive read reviews that people wrote saying they get right into the action this is true we as viewers just have no idea what they are doing or why i am stunned its up for best picture dont waste your time because you will never get that 2 hours back i regret the one hour i lost,reality
ive been a hardcore fan of since the 1979 film the road warrior was probably one of the greatest sequels ever beyond thunderdome was terribly cheesy in some respects very campy but at least stuck to its guns in portraying as a human beingnow we have fury road oh george miller how you disappoint me and countless other cult fans inspired by your earlier worksin this movie is basically second fiddle to charlize therons character imperator furiosa while they have pretty good synergy doesnt display the kind of humanism which i so admired in the previous films hardy is a rather sterile brutish and though some might disagree i think mel gibson did a far better job in portraying this tortured soul whose loved ones were brutally slain by the toecutter et aldisappointing to say the least lots of action sure but the elements of sweet sweet vengeance that exercised are completely absent from this tawdry action flick,reality
insane captivating frenetic visceral beautifulfury road is a frenetic roller coaster ride unlike any other it was written with minimalist dialogue saturated colour palette and a visceral neck break speed the smooth blend between practical vfx and cgi makes the movie believable and yet feels so otherworldly miller  co directed his movie like fine arts maestros as if it were a motion painting  an artistic expression of art visual sound and motionin fury road we find rockatansky played by tom hardy haunted by his past with strobing flashes of characters from the first movie traversing the bleak desert landscape of a future world where the earth has become almost barren due to nuclear war there he struggles to survive by driving his interceptor car from place to place avoiding marauding gangs and running away from the ghosts of his pastwe find survival skills intact wearing the same jacket from the mel gibsons days complete with his cool interceptor knee harness and shotgun i still miss his dog and it is a pity that the interceptor is destroyed so quickly in the beginning of the movie ive read that the video game builds a back story where you control and trying to build his interceptorthe movie movie is set in a world where food and water are scarce nature and humans have mutated and humanity is enslaved by its own survival instinct in this chapter we get a glimpse of a town ruled by immortan joe a disfigured old tyrant who lives atop a rocky cliff in the caverns of his palace he has adequate water plants and slaves to do his bidding from time to time he would send out his lieutenant imperator furiosa to retrieve oil from one of the last remaining oil rigs near his town the movies plot basically revolves around furiosas plot to safely elope with immortans wives to the green place her childhood birthplacealmost the entire movie is a long string of car chase sequences that needs to be experienced in the cinema its simply a tour de force of the car chase subgenre in a time when we have series like the transporter fast furious and well made postapocalyptic features  its amazing how fury road can stands on its own weight and deliver something fresh and uniquei have to say that compared with gibsons version hardys is slightly and at times feels like he is just a passenger in furiosas story the scenes with the guitarist the custom cars and war rigs fights were thrilling and pure popcorn cinema though the level of violence is not as brutal as 1  2 fury road is still dark and unsettling in some places my wife still finds the movie too violent but nevertheless entertaininggo see it today you owe yourself a speedy treat,reality
few action films have ever displayed such vigorous elegant symphonic understanding of cinema fury road is a true celebration of cinema it is a work of art that is unimaginable in any other mediumif the academy knows anything about filmmaking they should all be writing down george miller in their bracket for best director for the man has showed us what it would be like if vivaldi was alive today making action films rather than composing music the reason i mention vivaldi is because george millers understanding of action cinema reminded me several times of vivaldis of music four seasons comes to mind especially while surely the crew around him have done their job expertly the film really seems like a work of a man with a vision every edit every movement of either camera character or vehicle appear a part of a greater symphony several times does the film seemingly build towards clies before the conductor lowers his baton letting the audience breathe before building all up again the pauses for breathing are few yet all feel perfectly placed and are just far enough apart that the film is allowed to keep a pace making it seem like the usian bolt of filmthe action is absolutely the highlight of this movie extraordinary visually spectacular and quite honestly unlike anything we have seen ever yet it seems miller has also managed to hit the jackpot in his writing though reportedly there was no proper script while shooting the movie never tries to hide what it is the story is simple sometimes distant yet it is handled in a such a way that it creates a quite strong emotional connection with the protagonists the character of is interesting enough in himself and played with an impressively subtle vulnerability by tom hardy yet it with furiosa played by theron expertly so that the story truly lies her quest strangely enough manages to feel relevant to society today with the sadly stillrelevant fight for genderequalitythe film has by some been described as feminist and rightly so in having both male and female character fight together against the patriarchal system it underlines the need for both genders to take part in this struggle that our society still faces with a noble cause being portrayed in such a sympathetic way it is made easy to root for the heroes thus making the already spectacular action even better by having stakes that feel as if they matter,reality
i had heard from someone that this movie was getting great reviews having subjected myself to a painful couple of hours trying to find something in this movie that would give it some redemption i gave up and went home very disappointedi loved the original i thought the sequel was ok but not in the same league beyond thunder dome was appalling and ought to have been the deathnell for the franchise however miller has taken all that made thunder dome a piece of hollywood rubbish and extrapolated this to insult himself as well as movie makers and movie goers alike if someone says they have heard good things about this movie dont believe them find someone who has actually fallen victim to paying good money to see it and ask them what they thoughtthis was the worst movie that i have paid to see by a long shot,reality
as a huge fan like many others ive been eagerly awaiting the next offering from george miller and ive been excited about it for yearsi saw the first two films when i was very young and being something of a petrolhead along with my curious fascination for all things postapocalyptic i found them to be absolutely sensational especially 2 aka the road warrior and back in the day when we used to hire films on a video tape from a shop i became very familiar with all the cheap bargainbucket low budget flicks from the 80s and 90s that 2 clearly inspired and that the various directors of such films totally ripped offand thats the thing right there  fury road felt to me like one of those movies but with a much bigger budget its almost like george miller has created a pastiche of not just those bmovie 2 copies but also of a genre and style which he createdof course im well aware that this is supposed to be a reboot but in many ways its 2 without the realism or the plot i also realise that part of the angle here is storytelling with minimal dialogue and character development but for me it just didnt work at all by the time i was halfway through the film i really couldnt care less about them or what was actually going to happen charlize theron and nicholas hoult turned in a couple of great performances however hugh keaysbyrne another fabulous actor and brilliant as toecutter in the original film was frankly laughable and more like a pantomime villain how on earth his character was supposed to be a credible brutal postapocalyptic warlord is absolutely beyond me he looked like a fat old man with bits of vacuum cleaner stuck to his head christ i find barry scott from the cillet bang adverts far more intimidating but worst of all tom hardy was a major disappointment hes one of my favourite actors and fabulous in everything ive ever seen him inexcept this  and hes not again its like wheels of fire 1985 or exterminators of the year 3000 1983 whereby someone is playing a happyshopper bargain bucket version of rockatansky unfortunately for mr hardy he clearly had very little to work with very little to do really and his performance was stifled somewhat and on top of that he was to all intents and purposes a secondary playerits a film that doesnt predominantly and essentially feature himself and neither does it feature any explanation background structure or plot development regarding past save for the odd weird flashbacknightmare featuring his dead daughter yet it was his infant son who was killed along with his wife in the original butfine  its a reboot  youve got carte blanche lord millerumgous but yeah nice one george  were just automatically supposed to know what those flashbacks mean arent we because we all saw the original filmright despite the fact that this is meant to be a reboot the lovably trendy word in the film industry for recycling something that was great the first time around and turning it into a disappointing pile of rubbish whilst capitalising on the name and reputation of the film to get the paying punters inthats one of the biggest problems with this film  isnt the main character this isnt a movie another crucial piece in the world is his pursuit special v8 interceptor its one of the defining things of the first two movies that in this offering barely means anything barely gets used or is a pivotal part of the film i saw an interview with george miller who stated regarding that the interceptor is back and thats all he has which is precisely how it was in mm2 and yet here it barely gets a look in what we really wanted to see was essentially 15  we wanted to see the transition between the first and second films as fansnow as a very keen carvehiclemachinery enthusiast i can hugely appreciate the incredible time effort design and execution of the vehicles in this film to get that lot together working in one place and choreographed in the action sequences is really quite something but again its like a highbudget pastiche of the original idea regardless of how well theyre designed and put together the vehicles are just way over done and utterly preposterous franklylike i said this just isnt im afraid what it is is a film that cirio h santiago and his coequals would have made if they been given several hundred metric tonnes of cash and the chance to squander it this film could have any title and different character names theres practically nothing that defines it as a film ive watched the original 3 films quite literally hundreds of times ive seen this once  and have no desire to see it again and thus its 510 from me because its average at best and only the stunt work makes it scrape in at that theres a saying in the uk which is fairly self explanatory  all fur coat and no knickers i think that perfectly sums it upive read that tom hardy has signed up for another 3 mm films lets just hope that at least a couple of them will give the fans the sequels or now prequels that they wanted in the first place because while this film may cause a new generation to salivate it leaves the previous one needing a glass of irradiated water hey whats wrong with a little fallout,reality
remember kill bill volume 1 uma thurmans the brideblack mamba wakes up and starts killing people but we dont know completely why because all the story and character development is in volume 2 remember james bond quantum of solace there is a chase in the beginning but we dont know why who or where and its never really made clear i dont remember what happened in that moviethats fury road a critic wrote that action is character i disagree action is not a substitute for character development or storytelling i wanted to know who this new was he was a cop he lost his wife and kid thats all thats revealed we already knew that from 1979s but again thats 1979there are decades separating fury road from and even fury road from beyond thunderdome i dont think using 30 more minutes to establish the setting and the new characters would have hurt i wanted to know what brought about the apocalypse its never made cleari wanted to learn more about the villain joeabout the war boysabout charlize therons imperator furiosaabout the wives i wanted more of their backstory i wanted to see more of their emotions yet they are all onedimensional they are who they are the movie is all about the action and the chasein fury road we have a main character who doesnt say or express all that much and charlize therons character doesnt grow i dont get why the critics loved it the cars and the action scenes were cool though,reality
i was a huge fan of the original and saw it when it first hit us theaters and set mel gibson on a path to super stardom the original seemed a little weird and b grade at the time of its release as it was visionary long before other apocalyptic movies of the genre this movie seems to pay homage with similarities using a gas tanker and other similar vehicles desert backdrop and a music toy used by the feral boy in road warrior many differences though in back story and the group has allied with to escape from the dregs trying to kill them great writing direction casting acting fx locations and musicca luster,reality
dont believe someone could make movie like this absolutely crap,reality
was this supposed to entertain me because it did the complete opposite i actually wanted to sleep through most of it tom hardy is one of my favorite actors and he disappointed me being in this horrible disaster of a movie it literally was a long car ride to nowhere avoid at all costs,reality

clutches the main thing that could give her trust in this vicious worldthe people to come theron does apparently the best work of her vocation here cunningly passing on the drive in furiosas spirit in a way that powers the whole film she accomplishes more with a singing gaze or held jaw than most performers could with a page of discourse furthermore one shouldnt underestimate the strengthening message at the heart of this filmeve ensler creator of the vagina monologues counselled with miller on the scriptwhich proposes that ladies as the makers of new life will intrinsically dependably be

wards starts giving birth and still safeguards herself and her yettobeconceived youngster subsequent to being shot no less its hard not to see fury road as a response to the macho jabber that so frequently characterises the activity class fury road is the most amazing activity stunt youve found in years you truly require just hold up a couple of minutes to see something better this is a film where you continue imagining that its achieved its zenith and afterwards mysteriously that minute is abandoned in the tidy fury road was destined to be sufficiently noteworthy as an unadulterated specialised achievementa film that chuckles despite blockbuster cgi bashes with a portion of the best altering and sound plan the class has ever observedbut then miller goes after an option that is more prominent than specialised ability he holds high up the activity layout that he made with the road warrior and contends that hollywood shouldnt have been replicating it for as long as three decades they ought to have been expanding on it fury road was a test to an entire era of activity producers asking them to take after its nervy way into the class future and similar to miller attempt their hardest to make something new,reality
and 150 million lateris yet another one of those painfully predictable setinthefuture action films where even though its been given a restricted rating its braindead story completely caters to a juvenile mentalitywithin less than 30 minutes  overthetop action sequences of one vehicle crash after another got so annoyingly repetitive that in no time flat it all became too tiresome for wordsthis is definitely one of those pictures where you could easily watch a good part of it in fastforward mode and you know that youre not gonna miss a damn thing of any importanceand yes  as i figured  this pictures story ended on a note that unfortunately had sequeltofollow written all over it yawncity to the ,reality
i think the title of my review sums up pretty well my feelings after watching this movie i believe the universe was a great setting and opportunity for something great building upon the history of the previous movies instead there was minimal exploration and discovery of this post apocalyptic world and its societies which where there only as the background the script was rather monotonous as for the most part this movie is about vehicle chases with fighting even if those scenes took half that much it would still be a bit more than needed the acting was underwhelming to say the least not sure what i was expecting but really now do tom hardy or charlize theron consider this as a highmark of their acting careers the special effects were really were made with the most impressive probably being that huge storm part but at some points it was so much that you just knew you were watching 90 post processing and little real camera work could it be that im looking at this through nostalgiatinted glasses it might be but that doesnt make this movie more interesting or exciting because essentially this is what i feel at the end that i would not spend 2 more hours watching fury road a second time or easily recommend it to anybody lets hope the next one is better,reality
not the film but how it managed to capture awards acclaim and all the noise about what is no more than an action clone with nothing to add nothing new nothing script nothing plot nothing characters simply incredible who do you really remember from the characters how do you relate in your life memories of this story what shots come to mind as something wonderful in the past season entertaining sure if you like it the original set the table for a buffet of similar apocalyptic action films the main character in so got our attention that we all know his story both as character and where that career went from therethese reviews began from a real need to write without the burden of interest in who may read them certainly there is that little niggling hope others will be in some way interested in the words but fortunately it is a very little itch after a stellar month of writing it is with a sad heart and tired thumbs to give over the review business to those who seem better able to comprehend the film genre glad to just watch em and enjoy even gladder that the desire to write reviews has been stilled and made numb,reality
as i previously said in my 2 the road warrior review my expectations were set pretty high for fury road due to all of the praise surrounding it and i would definitely say these expectations were met this is probably one of the better recent action flicks and it reminded me of movies like speed where the action literally could not stop while in my opinion it wasnt better than the road warrior this film was still very fun and felt like it could proudly stand on its own away from the trilogythe film follows and furiosa as they try to steal a tanker from an evil dictator and bring his wives to a fantasylike green place that furiosa was born in unlike the more attached to civilization environments from the original trilogy fury road replaces them with a barren wasteland of dust i liked this choice for the movie because it makes the audience feel like there is no hope left at all a theme the film seemed to be going for to me this film was much more impressive on a technical level than anything else while i was worried that the use of cgi would damage the film i was glad to see that it wasnt over used and when it was used it was used very well the lighting and color scheme was also great as the movie changed from the the bright orange day time to the light teal blue nighttime while teal and orange is defiantly not an original color palette look up teal and orange movie posters i thought it was used very well in this filmto me fury road did not feel like a film it felt like a postapocalyptic action movie that was heavily inspired by the trilogy they changed the character the landscape and the plot structure and while this wasnt a bad choice it made me leave the theater thinking i didnt just watch a movieall in all even though it had its flaws the movie didnt take itself too seriously and was simply fun watch the trailer and if you think it looks like fun then you will like the movie also if you liked this film i would definitely recommend the road warrior because in my opinion it is much better fury road was a lot of fun and the best action movie yet this year,reality
i regret watching this movie nonsensical plot no clever dialogues it a hong kong bmovie is much more interesting than this in my opinion in comparison to this movie mortal kombat 1 and 2 and spawn deserved academy awards charlize theron kicks ass but only too seldom the make up doesnt hide her beauty in this case as it had happened in monster  wouldnt it have been more interesting to see her fight vs those goons as for the goons their makeup reminded me of the mutant species of vampires in blade 2 tom hardy what can we say about him several reviewers wrote he was a promising young actor is it still so after his lame performance  this movie doesnt deserve any star a star is too much i hope no one will think of doing fury road 2 i think itd be a further waste of time and money just to be precise i watched this movie in italian but i think no one can blame the dubbers they simply dubbed nonsensical dialogues thats all,reality
i dont know what i just watched seemed like a long video of car chasing there is no depth no developed story or characters no anything really worthy of watching it is probably only an orgasm for men to watch cars and action but is this where films are going charlize theron was simply a disgrace and pathetic and tom hardy even worse i just cannot believe that it has 82 on imdb when it should be nowhere near that number i dont know if the world has gone crazy or if the people are just stupid enough to find this piece of rubbish worthy of an oscar nomination the whole film seemed as a joke and like a prolonged video of nothing i know that this is a bad oscar year but to nominate this as best picture is beyond everything there is nothing in this film nothing where is the art of filmmaking what happened to telling the story depth in characters without black and white technique i guess i just dont want to believe that i live in a world where this is considered a film,reality
i just dont get the praise for this movie the straight launch into fighting and chasing doesnt let one feel for the characters or identify with them lots of gross creatures chase each other in disgusting vehicles along the endless deserttom hardy hardly gets a chance to act  could have been anyone charlize theron is the star of the show and the only redeeming feature she can do action as convincingly as drama and comedy she is so beautiful its a waste that she is used to play dirty roles in these monstrous ugly scenariosdont bother,reality
as a fan of the dystopic movies i saw the trilogy a couple years ago bc i heard they were shining exemplars of the genre and have great action to boot i came away amused but disappointed by the lack of an interesting plot to complement the overthetop action sequences and the postapocalyptic setting the two sequels in particular so you can imagine my excitement when news came of a new sequel but after hearing rave reviews from friends and critics alike i decided to give the franchise another try expecting somehow this time would be differentapparently the director decided the problem with his three previous attempts was that there wasnt enough adrenaline so he proceeded to make the same mediocre movie but with everything turned up to 11 instead of a mere waste time fury road was a spectacular waste of time i mean this in the literal sense the action sequences were quite the spectacle and allow us a glimpse of the atavistic savagery that lurks beneath our superficial civility and the lead actors very much impressed in the physical acting department but those positives were rendered hollow by a script one which i can only assume was written by a rather talented 13 yearold that offers little character development and a plot that can be adequately summed up as spoiler guy and girl go from point a to point b and back to point a kill bad guys along the way and save the day the chases fights and explosions soon became trite and after two exhausting hours something to be tolerated rather than relished the handful of attempts to humanize the good characters also looked clumsy and forced as incongruous as the brief tender string interludes amidst the nearconstant industrial drumming that filled up most of the soundtrack in the end this movie offers neither hope eg children of men nor despair brazil just the anodyne comfort that the good guys won and all is right with the world again  at least until the next sequel comes along which shouldnt be long as there is a 5th installment on the wayso in conclusion if youre looking for 2 hours of mindless vroom and boom interrupted by an alleged plot this is your flick but if you appreciate even only an ounce of subtlety and intelligence avoid this movie like the plague in fact if you just want to watch tom hardy drive around the whole movie you would find locke a far superior alternative,reality
the only reason i gave this a 2 is because it was visually exciting but that is all it was without a doubt one of the worse films i have ever seen i almost walked out twice but stayed just to see if there was going to be anything worth seeing several people did walk out i should have joined them it was a wasted 2 hours of my life it was i should have rented one of the old films and watched a real movie never really said much he mostly made guttural sounds and grunts it is the epitome of what hollywood has gone to with action films that is a mindless endless onslaught of action that has a pathetic plot and makes little sense so if you are mindless and like action packed crap this is the movie for you,reality
if you like action movies and you dont know anything about this might be your movie good photos and show on the other hand if you know about this is disappointing i saw the trilogy of and i expected a good plot in this new movie and i am still waitingfuriosa taking control people running jumping screaming driving and so on wasnt in that movie at all i saw someone who called himself as i cant imagine m without a good personification as mel gibson did he made this character as good as we imagine taking the control in every situation relaxed but assertive he always ended every movie scene as someone mythologically or as someone memorable he always ends as the last man stands who disappears as a memory in the vast desert iiwatching this movie made me feel that i was watching furiosa and combined with the walking dead weird people and a lot of hollywoods effects and makeup,reality
so to sum up i just wasted two hours of my life it gets one star more than it should because of the visual effects and the whole imagery they just forgot to make a film of it it is like a 2 hour showcase of special fx without a semblance of a plot the action sequences are so long that either1you forget how they started 2you look away for 5 minutes and the same crap is still exploding on the screenand then you wait for something some kind of explanation as to why sht is happening and there is none you kind of get there is a wasteland and water and gas are very important thats mostly it then crap explodesi was thoroughly disappointed because i have good memories of the first movies and the whole theme and subject matter suggests that some movie could have come out of this you see that people cared about it the imagery and visual identity is there just in the end someone cut out the movie parts,reality
when i saw that charlize theron was staring in this movie i thought how bad can it be well my question was answered in about 20mins this movie is really bad theron is a great actress but this movie is way beneath her she must have made a lot of money to get bribed to do a piece of work like this boring plot boring action boring acting boring dialogue etc if you need to fall asleep and are suffering from amnesia this is the movie for you its not even debatable what is remarkable is how many high ratings it got  ive seen lousy movies before but none that got as high a rating as this one must be a lot of paid movie reviews out there to give this one a thumbs up     weird im still dumbfounded that theron took this role  ,reality
like the previous movies this film takes place in a future desert world which has been devastated by a nuclear war what remains of humanity is both primitive and barbaric and those who have survived exist with the most basic of necessities in warlike fortresses where few laws exist that being the case after being taken as a prisoner it is to one of these harsh enclaves that tom hardy is subsequently forced to endure and since life has very little value ends up as nothing more than a human blood bank for one of the militaristic war boys by the name of nux nicholas hoult its at this same time that one of the military leaders named imperator furiosa charlize theron decides to escape from this citadel and she takes with her five wives of the religious leader immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne soon all of the clans in the entire area are summoned to assist in the recapture of imperator furiosa with both nux and his captive in hot pursuit and leading the charge now rather than reveal any more of this movie i will just say that those who enjoy films which feature action from start to finish will really appreciate this picture however it is this strength which also happens to be the films weakness as there is very little room for anything else that said i thought the talents of both tom hardyand in particular charlize theronwere terribly wasted likewise i also believe that the current imdb score of 84 whether by chance or design is extremely inflated as well to that end i would hope that once the initial euphoria has subsided realism will set in and the score will more closely resemble the films actual merits time will tell in any case while i certainly do not believe that this particular film is deserving of scores equal to classics like gone with the wind i also dont consider this to be a bad movie either accordingly while my score may not be popular at this time i have rated this movie as i see it average,reality
in its debut was a terrifying psychological horror deeply disturbing and with a lingering hurt you would be drawn into characters be with them and triumph and suffer with them the experience was pretty complete like the whole body and soul comes along on this devastating experience and what a hero was in his very own lane he was a new prototype antihero as far as i could tellpulled into madness and you knew why you seriously felt itnow whats this ridiculous spectacle of flinging money around like slapping the people in the face who are most groomed to entertain themselves at that level i dont mean that in a degrading way because its not their fault if everyone just took a tiny breather realized that he has easily 2 hours of spare time worth to check out the classics again theyd know too this is nothing would i want this as a video game i thinkyeah i could imagine that but what a waste of resources and phenomenal actors and beautiful people who could put a piece of dense memory for us onto the screen yet its all but some decadent mindless insulting orgy of ratingsensitive softcore brutality like one should only expect from a game really im so not hungry for gore but when that was essentially to the intensity of a movie it should be featured properly like in the original even the sequel had countless times the heartoh yes my summery up therewell i remember distinctly that people voiced their hatred over thunderdome while i just thought it was a silly ride that still offered enough fun to be well entertained sure then already all depth was long lost but the general outrage seemed to have drowned the franchise then oh how we have fallen 8pim not even gonna start thinking about ratings and why the youngest possible ages already have to get dragged into viewing people as cannon fodder if they dont know themincluding some they know i suppose besides that those who got to live in this flick where mostly portrait as nothing but freaks like one should wonder if their continued existence itself is nothing but charity arghah well,reality
ive been evaluating whether to watch at the cinema buy or rent films from the reviews on imdb for quite some time after reading the glowing reviews about this film i was compelled to sign up and write my owna party of 7 watched this movie 2days ago 4 ladies 3 men ages from 21  51we all like the genre the previous episodes and were all really looking forward to this movieafter 30mins one of our group a man uttered a profanity ending in this and walked outabout 10 mins later one of the girls said this is utter rubbishnot her exact words  im gone and also walked outthe remainder of us stayed hoping it would get better  it didnt the lady next to me had to use the loo she didnt rush back  but after twenty minutes  i said whilst you were gone there was more car chase some people who dont matter died er thats it you havent missed anythingduring one quiet romantic moment someone farted  we all laughed and said that sums this film upanyhooactionsceneryspecial effects 810entertainment value 310plot 110emotive value did i care or relate or identify with any of the characters 010overall 310 afterwards we all agreed with varying levels of irritation that this had been a waste of our evening heres my challenge  watch this film  fast forward through any half hour of it and see if it makes any difference whatsoever  it wont we wished wed fast forwarded through 2 hours,reality
george miller did a great job setting up this spectacular world with the desert landscape the post apocalyptic war vehicles and the characters that all seem so unique the shots are great the battle scenes quite intense and the special effects will blow your mind fury roads depiction of the world is visually beautiful bright and so special that can be surely characterized as pure arthowever fury road shouldnt be just that its not all about the action scenes and the special effects all this tense failed to pass to a psychological level fury road could pass a great range of messages but not even tried the movie shows a postapocalyptic world where the earth has been utterly destroyed and people have gone killing each other for water and fuel throughout a vast wasteland and all this madness all this vanity pain and wretchedness fail to touch you and the acting alone couldnt just do the job despite the fact that acting was overly good especially charlize theron is great as furiosa lacked emotion tom hardys dark past didnt seem to affect him as he remained neutral and cold throughout the whole movie his reactions didnt correspond to the shocking images he kept seeing about the people he failed to savein conclusion fury road is an exhilarating action movie with extraordinary artistic cinematography lacking depth but in a movie like that depth is what can make it special,reality
having seen the first generation of movies i was looking forward to something new and exciting after a 30 year hiatus what i got was a 3d rehash of bits of the earlier movies yes there are lots of car chasewar rig bashing and crashing and yes there are explosions and mayhem but there are no new plot twists to speak of and most of the characters are stereotypes or caricaturesif you havent watched the earlier movies then this is a fun action packed good guys beat the system storyif you saw the originals splice a random 2 hours of carnage together and throw in 2 or 3 pretty girls not wearing much and you get fury roadoverall a disappointing reboot,reality
i was literally blown away by how disappointing this movie turned out to be granted this only happened due to the high expectations generated by ratings in places such as the present onei generally tend to find ratings in imdb fairly in tune with my own except when it comes to movies targeted to reach a more specific audience and fury road seems to fit precisely in that drawer it is come to think of it a movie made for a specific audience to no less an extent than your regular chick flickthe movie itself is punk rock all the way through and i am sure this is what miller intended to achieve so well done mate it would have worked brilliantly for me 15 years ago the problem is i started listening to other more intricate stuff in between and punk rock just doesnt cut it anymore dont get me wrong the movie isnt bad its just been diminished to an overly simplified monotonous repetition of the same basic 2 chords disguised by epic keyboard overtones here and there its still punk in all its minimalistic rage and thats why songs last on average 2 minutes and not 2 hoursim alluding here to the general lack of rhythm for the less musical among you rhythm is not pacecadence in this movie which is understandable since the characters have no context and no opportunity for developing it they are but animals on a hellish treadmill going full speed sweating those clichs out like there is no tomorrowthere is one thing that makes this movie shine bright the depiction of this imaginary desert world is absolutely filled with artistic detail and its rendition is flawless in this respect fury road was an absolute delight the steampunk and cyberpunk influences are clear and although one would expect them in a suburban environment it is this very juxtaposition that enriched the conceptual design of this world not surprisingly though this universe had been presented before more notably in beyond thunderdome 1985 only to reach full splendor in this 2015 iterationmuch more could be said in favor and against but ultimately it is what it is the deliverance of a competent entertainment product which seems to be the highest achievement attainable for the movie makers of our days it could have been the defining cinematic opus of our generation they almost made it but they had to want it in the first place,reality
what the comic book movie franchises would do to have in their shallow repertoire of repetitive story lines and awful actingright from the start this piece of movie magic hits you hard and fast and never stops it is relentlessly breathtaking from the very moment the tail disappears down throatthe chase pace and action make anything fast and furious have to offer feel positively slow and tedious which they are anywaythe characters personalities doff their hats to the original hardy and theron as dual leads are brilliant as are the supporting cast the acting style and visual feel leans towards 2 lets face it immortan joe and his warriors are like lord humungus and his band of road warriors wannabes pure and simple but thats a good thing because lord humungus and his followers were a truly great moment in movie evilthe 15 certificate for the uk is a joke my 12 year old daughter who was looking forward to this after seeing the trailer a dozen times loved it start to finish it most definitely is not gory this movie uses the evil deads style perfectly explosions crashes collisions and violence are creatively subtlety but sufficiently over the top so as to not have movie goers becoming irked and repulsed by nonstop blood and guts but fear not because a big chase and large cast make for plenty of ouchieswith one follow on at least to come the thing that makes this movie stands out is its use of practical effects instead of rubbishy cgi and post production visual effects there might be a big lesson for the movie industry to learn here have we moved too far in recent years from the real art of movie making definitely a yes when you see a plethora of unimaginative superhero drudgery and computerized dross being pumped out to a mass audience who are being forcefed cgi because their nintendos and playstations have long since lost their thrill1010 i cannot fault this movie at all i had deliberately avoided the trailer so as not to spoil the event we were not let down my daughter rates this as the best yet high praise indeed from one so youngacting story line action it has the lot,reality
after a few deceptively fluffy and kidfriendly outings george miller returns to the universe 30 years after mel gibson turned in the keys to the tune of tina turners we dont need another hero the question on everyones mind before the first trailer unleashed an internet frenzy was in this age of needless reboots has miller sold out or has he used this opportunity to finally realize his full vision for the famous sagaby now you will know that the latter is true but you might not appreciate to what extent and how little this implies that you are guaranteed to actually like the result miller hasnt just provided an update of or even a reboot in fact this plays like just another episode in the wild life of his antihero relegating back story or origins to one or two short opening lines and brief flashes of past violence its also much more than a modernized take it is early 21st century filmmaking taken to its furthest possible extremesince most blockbusters today are at least partially bathed in michael bays patented orangeteal palette fury road pushes that beyond its aesthetic limits to quasifluorescent territory creating the impression of a very violent tex avery cartoon or at least one viewed while doing some serious drugs plotwise it doesnt get any more streamlined than this or economical and what youre left with is a hellish landscape populated by astonishingly inventive grotesques conflicted heroes our protagonist is arguably not the hero of his own film and a sustained action sequenceif this sounds like something you wouldnt enjoy dont waste your time if the trailer had you hyperventilating though what awaits is pure nirvana the action  most of it the result of practical effects and stunts  sets an unprecedented standard as does the level of perverse originality in the baddies physical and moral decrepitude even in the hallowed company of other entries these are some weird freaks finally the lead duo is pitchperfect most of the attention has fallen on charlize therons fearless furiosa but special mention should go to a very subdued hardy who beautifully anchors the film and gives it an almost calm simmering center whether grumbling at sights of his stolen gear or fighting for his life in one of the meanest brawls in cinematic history he makes us believe in this twisted universe and feel the painthis is a journey through hell dantes inferno without the sanctimoniousness distilled to its essence and spiked with cocaine a wilder ride you will not find this year perhaps even this decade,reality
fury road five stars out of fivegeorge millers bigbudget reboot to his immensely popular postapocalyptic trilogy from the 70s and 80s this one stars tom hardy in the title role replacing mel gibson who played the role in all three previous films it also stars charlize theron and costars nicholas hoult hugh keaysbyrne who also played the villain in the original movie nathan jones rosie huntington whiteley zoe kravitz riley keough abbey lee courtney eaton and josh helman miller directed and coproduced the film as well as co wrote the screenplay with brendan mccarthy and nick lathouris two first time film writers the story revolves around teaming up with another rebellious survivor named furiosa as they try to outrun a crazed cult leader and his army and make it across the desert to furiosas homeland with the cult leaders five wives it was made on a budget of 100 to 150 million but its full of impressive practical effects and old school stunts and a small amount of cgi its the first installment in 30 years and although it takes place after the events of the original trilogy it also reintroduces us to and goes back over his origins as well as the origins of the world he now lives in the film has gotten nothing but rave reviews from critics at an unprecedented level for a genre action flick like this and it could be a possible best picture contender come awards time it should be i absolutely love this moviethe setting is once again that of a distant chaotic future after normal civilization has collapsed and just about everyone has gone crazy rockatansky hardy is still a loner survivalist on the run from his past and the ghosts of his dead family hes kidnapped by cultists called war boys an army under the leadership of a fascist dictator named immortan joe keaysbyrne when a beloved cultist commander of joes named furiosa theron goes rogue and steals his five enslaved wives joe leads his whole army after them in pursuit furiosa is trying to lead the women to the place where she grew up in hopes of a better life she reluctantly teams up with in order to do soi think seeing this film in the theater was one of the greatest cinematic experiences of my life and i plan on doing it again really soon i recommend to all true cinephiles that they see it the same way the visuals are breathtaking and the action is absolutely glorious and nonstop it also has an awesome score by junkie xl its full of extremely bizarre and memorably quirky characters too and it even has a little heart thrown in as well the movie feels like a throwback to the 80s but its also a groundbreaking milestone in film and art in general in its own right miller created an amazingly artistic and disturbingly beautiful world of crazy characters and totally insane and admirably captivating chaos as he did with the road warrior and to a lesser extent and beyond thunderdome the film is like the road warrior times ten though and id rank it among the alltime greatest action movies ever like aliens terminator 2 the dark knight and the empire strikes back its more than an action film though people call it a punk western on wheels which i agree with but it also celebrates uniqueness and being different as well as not conforming to popular society it shows how mental illness can be a good thing how some of the biggest heroes among us are totally believe all the hype its a pure cinematic masterpiecewatch our movie review show movie talk at httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvbp0y3mxfamm,reality
a middle of the road forgettable movie the hype was too big and i can see why gibson turned the movie down years ago what worked tom hardy hits the mark as the silent and tormented the director creates a strong visual rock video feel for fury road the first fifteen minutes grabs my attention what did not work once on the road the pursuit chase scene is way too long a tiresome visual display of c g i i miss the gone in 60 second real car stunts the bad guy characters are cartoonish hard for the viewer to relate and hate characters which are similar to the transformers what saves fury road is the character we all know no matter how hardened has become there still is a heart of gold in the man six out of ten stars nothing special here,reality
went into the movie highly ambitious and excited because i had heard nothing but good things about the movie i saw that it was going to look like book of eli with denzel washington which i highly enjoyed the only similarities is that its in the desert nothing else i found myself half way through the movie with no words spoken from tom hardy i began to think the writers didnt actually write a script for this dont get me wrong i saw the first three and enjoyed them immensely so i sort of knew what i was getting into but a 2 hour car chase can get really boring which made me want to walk out already knowing what was going to happenno twistsno romance no nothing but mind numbing chase for 2 hours leaving me not care about the characters,reality
this film is so bad i felt compelled to register with imdb just to counter all the positive reviews it is getting i saw it once last year and my wife and i instantly thought it was awful but recently we saw it has got loads of oscars nominations so we gave it another viewing so we can say with no question of doubt that this film is utter drivel in time it will be likened to that other postapocalyptic megabudget overhyped turkey that was waterworld it is utter rubbish  crap plot crap acting pointless total waste of money giving it an oscar nomination for anything at all is a total travesty and totally undermines the credibility of the socalled academy i can only think that it is the audience of all that marvel crap that are voting for this,reality
i would rather watch the presidential debate then this low grade movie the characters were beyond boring and some of the scenes made me wonder how much fuel they wasted just to blow something up no wonder gas prices are so high on the west coast i for one wouldnt spend my money on any of the merchandise nor the dvd when it comes out and the guy yelling what a wonderful day in the movie how is it a wonderful day or any day in the hot desert how this movie was given the ok is beyond me this movie is a joke if you want more bang for your buck dont waste it on this movie and if you find this movie at all appealing you should see a doctor for a concussion,reality
im sorry to contradict the various pretentious blackandwhite photograph types whove bandied around such words as glorious and a succulent extravaganza and similar but i felt i had to write a review to warn anyone with an iq over 65this film is just awful the plot summarised pew pew pew boom boom sand boom pew apologies for spoiling the surprisethe acting whos that again whats the point of what theyre doing now why are we supposed to carethe cgi boom boom splatter sandstorm splatter boom growl boomalso i have to mention that the motorcycles and stunts done on said motorcycles ped my biker husband off royally dont waste your time this film is about as as jake gyllenhaal was prince of persia all budget no actual substance of any sort  not even entertainment value really,reality
i just spent twenty minutes recovering my password for a site i havent logged into for a long while and trying to figure out how to post a review on my phone as a movie lover who has never bothered to post a review i hope this will hold a little weigh i would like to state what an absolute pile of crap this movie is if this is what passes for a good movie nowadays cinema is dead the cinematography is horrendous the cgi is often unbearable crap spastic nauseating camera work the acting is awful the audio even sounds like the worst pop artist youve ever heard ran through pro tools this is exactly why people dont pay money for artwork these days if i would have paid money to see this i assure you i would have demanded it back i bet when mel gibson watched this he wanted to crawl up on a cross and nail himself to it,reality
i was looking forward to this movie and thought it had the potential to much better than the first the problems with this movie1 was there a script was there a story if you consider basically 1 hour of attacking a truck to a destination point then taking a 5 minute rest then heading back for another hour of truck attack i will let you decide2 how was the acting not sure sadly never completes one sentence grunts moans and screamspouts yeah well probably needed a script to really comment on that just bad sorry none to very little character development3 special effects reasonable im sure dressing up and speeding along the desert was fun but watching this was just boring after 10 minutes a big budget so a tragic wastepossibly one of the worst movies i have seen in sometime the big question how did this get 83 by imdb,reality

not even the talent of tom hardy or charlize theron could save this movie my mistake for expecting anything beyond recycled garbage from yet one more postapocalyptic done to death plot that offers nothing but a new low in pubescent trash covering every base from drugs to misogyny so many ways this could have been done and miller went with the bottom of the barrel the acting is great what little you see of it but it is wasted in a sea of gratuitous crap only morbid curiosity would make me want to entertain a sequel but the only thing left is a warlord taking a dump on a dune buggy at 110mph if youre a 13yearold boy or wwf fan then by all means knock yourself out,reality
it astounds me that so many critics praise it as much as they do are their minds on a holiday while the action is impressively shot the film in the end is pretty much a borethe filmmakers never wanted to go deep with it so they should have left the drama alone altogether it doesnt have a license for all the emotional moments as the film doesnt have a core with which i mean that its two dimensionalwhat you see on the screen doesnt have to do with anything other than to create action scene after action scene so they just should have done exactly that and they didnt they had to add dramatic moments for the sake of itthis isnt an example of good filmmaking its an example of a halfbaked affair made by misguided filmmakers which is ultimately forgettable,reality
i was left speechlessand deaf when this movie finishedthe movie is a big deception has a supporting role meanwhile furiosa is the main character she is fine but nobody goes to the cinema looking for herespecially shorthaired p this movie has more similarities with clash of the titans that to the mel gibsons desert all the timeshorthaired herothat guitar guy took my heart read hearingi felt for a moment it was an alien planet but not australia p joking asidethe movie has minimum of dialogs the bare minimum of plotalmost no lineswhat to saynothing but shut upwatch 120 minutes chasing cars and listen so much noiseit deserves 610 but i gave 4 just to oppose paid botsfinallyone more time i was cheated by imdb bot scores and movie trailerit wont happen again,reality
wow what a movie for me this was the perfect execution of what fascinated me in the road warrior its like miller managed to extract exactly that then enhanced it multiple times over and made the perfect movie out of itfor a film that basically two hours of nonstop action it it filled to overflowing with all these amazing little details every character no matter how short their lives on screen has quirks they are identified every car is an individual piece of art nothing is explained everything is shown and amongst this perfect storm himself is just a background character fantastic,reality
this film was terrible it was boring with no story line this film was hyped up so much its stupid there is no point in this film its so boring its a wannabe transformers movie never back down is way better they shouldnt of made this film ever it is so dumb i wouldnt recommend watching this film so yes there you go tates dumb for wanting to watch thiswaste of money never watch this seriously just dont i mean it dont seriouslyu dontif you do i will beat you up ten times and make you look like jay this is the end of my rant about how terrible fury road is so im logging off now goodbye and goodnight,reality
for the first 40 minutes or so i felt i was watching someone playing a video gameand i wasnt allowed to play because thats it the only thing that happens for almost 40 minutes is car chase fight car chase explosion fight car chasesecond act car chase explosion car chase  cirque du soleil the only reason i gave this movie 5 stars is because the stunts were amazing and it must have been very hard to filmoh i cant forget about this it seems a 15 years told the director that it would be superverycoolandfullofawesome if there was a masked guy playing a flame throwing electric guitar during the whole chase thus the whole moviei dont know im in for a good action flick but this one had no script,reality
thats the very first time i give 1 to a film thats because its the worst film i have ever seeni didnt even watch the endi was so bored that 30 minutes before the film ends i just stopped it this film its full of nonsensethere is nothing to expectno storyyou dont know what is going ofjust some people running from the bad guy for no reasonit doesnt make sense its just stupid camera effects and sound are cooljust stupid story watch this only if you are under 15 years oldyou might find it good i really hope imdb change this 10 line review thing because its stupid1 line usually for stupid films like that is enoughso i am just writing to fill the 10 lines so imdb will post my post in their post pagewhere all people postabout filmsok too much posts here hope i wrote 10 lines and now i can stop writingsorry for this paragraph d,reality
what a truly dreadful movie quite possibly the worst film ive ever seen certainly the worst this year hardly any script and what there was was mumbled the story line consists of a multi vehicle race to a certain point and then turn around and go back again plenty of action but bugger all else if you havent seen the original movies with mel you wont understand the flash backs this movie is proof that sequels are rarely better than the original i was hoping that this was going to be an updated remake of the original movie but alas no tom hardy is a truly superb actor what in all that is holy possessed him to accept this role,reality
to start of i am a massive tom hardy fan george miller fan and i loved all the original movies most hollywood remakes at least try and justify remaking the earlier films by contributing or at least having similarities to the originals if attempted with fury road there was nothing original about this movie i was hoping for a movie with little character development an average story line and non stop action sequences with great special effects the special effects were pretty good but everything else about failed all tom hardy is allowed to do is grunt and fight a waste of such a big named actor and none of the characters in the movie make you feel any sympathy for them as they get beaten blown up shot or stabbed but dont worry they will still be able to continue fighting on top of a truck at 120km for another hour watching this made me look at my watch every five minutes to hope the ending was near its pretty much just a ninety minute car chase which drags on and on like watching a violent highway patrol from the future dont give your hopes up have extremely low expectation if you wish to watch this movie unfortunately no where near as good as the original,reality
awful after the first 20 horrific minutes of watching this garbage flick i started fast forwarding to get it over with and see where it would go the movie never got better it was all blow em up special effects stupid dialog and a number of the scenes were sped up and looked silly with people moving in fast motion whoever directed this should go to directors school i think tom hardy and charlize theron needed a paycheck worse they probably did not read the scripts before saying yes do not waste your time with this garbage unless you desperately want to see lots of special effects watching the laundry spin in your washing machine if more interesting,reality
why is the rating for this movie so high its honestly complete garbage mostly cool fx though some really obviously badly edited and thats it this movie wasnt even about even if the name was used it was charlize theron furious seriously watching the chronicals of riddick were we and oh makes an appearance too i want the last two and some hours back id have been better off watching paint drywhat a waste of my timebad acting bad effects bad storyan actress like charlize theron deserves better than this,reality
im old enough to remember the first 1979 which despite being low budget was also original enthralling and exciting things started to go off the boil a little with two but by the time the third arrived with a wailing tina turner i assumed the final nail was in the postapocolyptic australian coffin lidso here we are in 2015 and this bewildering feministic camp ridiculous overdramatised and cgidtodeath abomination has arrived the campness first appeared in no 2 but this is has an underlying bdsm theme that im sure many specialist websites could plagiarise the fantasy was stretched well beyond the elastic limit but can somebody please explain to me what that flamethrowing electric guitar player was doing lactating mums chastity belts i could go on but i dont really have the time other reviewers have managed to summon the time and energy and i admire their patience and diligence if you want sequels stick with the godfather,reality
how on earth this movie got an 84 on imdb is just absolutely mind blowing to me this movie is just terrible michael bay would be absolutely proud of this master piece terrible pacing terrible acting clich ideas all thrown into one mess of a movie i cannot believe you voters out there yall must be on some drug im not to think this was a good movie open your eyes people stop being deceived by big explosions the fact that is basically a caveman in everything but looks in this movie ticks me off even more how are you going to get a big name like tom hardy who is an amazing actor in everything he does and give him maybe 10 to 15 lines in this whole movie not only that but most of that is grunting and pointing at things so sad so sad,reality
this was a very disappointing movie the action was good but a 2 hour long chase scene gets old rather quickly even with good special effects the acting is below par because the actors have no plot to work with i was left wondering what the heck was going on from the very beginning very little is explained as to who these people are or how they got where they are or why they are doing what they are doingthe most telling fact for me that this movie left little impression was that as the credits rolled at the end of the movie i only recognized 3 or 4 of the characters names i had no clue who any of these other people in the movie were yet they had names so apparently i should remember who they were its hard to make a memorable dramatic impact when all they do is yell and scream a lot and drive souped up vehicles,reality
why does a movie called barely feature the title character at all this is supposed to be a movie about not about a bunch of strong independent women with shaved heads or whateverwhat do you think gender relations would actually be like in an apocalyptic situation oh wait i forgot anything men can do women can do better etc lol okdont waste your money its bad enough that its completely mindless without the hollywood femtard propaganda if you really want to see it pirate it if they profit from stupid movies like this the next round of them will be even worse,reality
oki would give this movie 5 stars because it deserves it for its cinematography but the super high ratings have to be balancedwhere do i begin this is not a movie this one elongated scene a visual art clip perhaps i have seen more substance in 3 min mtv music videos no background whatsoever on the history of the tribe depicted in the movieno character development for the villain whatsoever and there could be soooo much no explanation about any other characters main hero is not a main hero feels more like a supporting character at best that coupled with a completely ridiculously bad acting makes me wonder why the movie even called dialogue  what dialog there are probably more words in this review than in the movie the good  really cool costumes cars special effects though some of them seem cartoonish i left the theater feeling like my brain was emptied of thoughtthis is how dull in terms of story this movie felt not even dulljust nothingemptinesslike the post apocalyptic desert shown in the movie my advise wait for the dvd if you mustnot worth spending money on cinema tickets for this and definitely not on iunless of course you just like to see stuff blow up and machinery parts flying around,reality
truly one of one of the most overblown overrated films of all time while the casting of tom hardy is enticing he spends nearly all of the first half of the film with a metal harness covering his face and the rest of his role is reduced down to grunting like a cave man was never the loquacious type but gibson had a talent for displaying his character through looks and subtle movements and most importantly he was just cool like clint eastwood as the man with no name in fact a lot of comparisons could be made between the dollars trilogy and the films until now actually fr feels more like an awful spinoff where the character you really want to see is put to side out of everyones way so the filmmakers could make us watch who the film is really aboutsee red sonja one could still get away with this if the other film you were using him to build up were any good but its not oh god its notits strange to think the films title is still almost like they have no confidence in their protagonists appeal at all speaking of furiosa who happens to have a name derived from the films title road shes about as onedimensional and uninteresting as the rest of the film fury road really needed to pick a protagonist or at least let her and be foils for each other so that we can get a little character development there is none of that in fury road the only memorable performance comes from nicholas hoult who strangely enough seems to be the only one who understands what kind of movie hes inand for all those defenders of this film saying that the other films were never his story either let me quell that bullst knownothing argument right now they were his stories because he was always an integral part of them the only one thats not really about him is beyond thunderdome which iswas regarded as the worst of the series and thats mostly because a bunch of kids hijack the film half way through the other characters needed him and though he was always a reluctant hero he always came throughagain he didnt really need to be the focal point of this but since he happens to go along for the entire runtime of this story he should at least contribute something other than a random last minute changeofheart otherwise hes just taking up space just like this film did in every dead brain cell the human headmost of the ideas in this are style over substance for example lots of weird spiky cars blowing up a woman with a robotic arm a strange breastmilking facility a giant safe to keep concubine slavestheyve compared this to the road warrior because supposedly both films are one long chase apparently nobodys seen the road warrior because while there are numerous chases in that film done far better than frs garbage effects by the way the film is first and foremost a western the lone hero wanders into the weak but goodnatured town and must reluctantly save them from various bandits and marauders lurking in the badlands all the films were westerns where the old west was exchanged for a postapocalyptic outback and instead of horse rides and gunfights we were treated to highoctane car chases and makeshift guerrilla warfare in short its not about how many cars you could crash but how much you care about the memorable albeit simplistic characters of his very strange worldanybody who says this film has anything praiseworthy at alleven nearly all the critics we respect has no idea what their talking about either this is a truly strange case of bandwagon fever gone tragically awry or the whole world truly has gone mad,reality
definitely one of the worst movies i have ever seen it makes me wanna cry the fact that nowadays this sht is considered a great movie dont waste your time with it this plot can be compressed in a 2 minutes video with no lost of informationnot only the script everything is awful in this garbage it doesnt even make sense people are running out of gas and because of that they start a endless pursuit on desert with a lot o vehicles just idiot poorly made im wasting my time with this review hoping that i can convince someone not to watch this bullshtagain do not waste your time with it,reality
this movie was technically brilliant and deserved all the technical oscars it woni had not planned to see it because i already saw this movie 30 years ago in the original road warrior why watch it again but then i was surprised to discover that it was nominated for best picture so i decided to watch it on dvdto my dismay it was just a long dull pointless cartruck chase through a generic desert it basically just a remake of road warrior and not as well done technical brilliance asideas to the actors charlize theron was good as fuiosa but i never did buy tom hardy as overall i was disappointed,reality
i wasnt looking forward to it but as most people i thought i have seen them all i might as well see this one tom hardy was terribly unconvincing i have nothing against the guy but some people are just not born to do certain things and this was one of them what ruined it for me were silly things like that guy playing an electric guitarin the middle of the desertplease whats with all those drums is that meant to be funnyscary or just unnecessary and plain idiotic that took the edge for me silliness crept in battle for survival survival and desperation were gone and it was game over for me fair enough visually it was absolutely stunning but rather than making you sit on the edge of your seat it was like a big circus on wheelspink wigs red noses and big shoes everybody it could have been so much better without those circus parts i hope this is the last one but from reading some comments they are threatening to make more of them i think i will give them a miss,reality
having fallen into the 82 rating trap of watching this movie i realised  humanity needed saving humanity  whatever you do do not watch this filmit is utter madness that this film has attracted any kind of attention when in reality it is a imum waste of money and a colossal waste of timeif in the distant future humanity ends up facing oblivion  people will look back and realise that this film is where evolution took a wrong turndo not make this mistake,reality
im not a hater i can objectively admit that its a really welldone polished film but i didnt enjoy it personally its a pretty big achievement for cgi i respect the ambition that the director and the actors had in creating such a grandiose action movie but behind the excellent visuals it feels like a typical action film geared toward the male 1535 demographicits a male power fantasy full of guns fire explosions chainsaws motorbikes and armed trucks the story is generic the characters and world lack depth for that reason im not given much reason to care or understand either most of the movie consists of chase scene after chase scene in the same desert it wouldnt be a stretch to call this avatar in the desert,reality
theres an issue of sorts among australian and to an extent new zealand males about what masculinity is what is means to be tough resilient fearless etc in these postcolonial countries and the complex cant be more feverishly illustrated than in fury roadalso i cant help but feel that the overwhelmingly positive newspaper reviews are more a reaction to the longheld discrimination of sexism in the us as they insist over and over again that the film is brilliant unforgettable and mustsee cinema essentially because theres a baldheaded female warrior on the run from a tribe of barbarians trying to protect females from a clan of deformed repulsive mutants and skinhead freaks with gunsalthough yes that is a noble reason to retool an action franchise it was also done in the mid 80s by sigourney weaver in aliens back when the original trilogy was circulating in video rental stores and actually the chief antagonist in fury road notably resembles the predator from 1987 if you squint a littleso whats all the fuss about not sure really  mmfr has a sense of black comedy to the essentially threatening undertones of the film and some thoroughly awesome cinematography and production design regarding the vehicles but its essentially just a chase movie and theres only so many ways you can frame a punch to the head a wild leap from a moving vehicle or a screaming car crash until you realize the entire movies about trigger happy machismo or whatever the femme equivalent of machismo is and dangerously shot stunts  the film doesnt have any notable dialogue or character development at allapparently if this is the new gold standard for hard boiled action escapism i have to say that its a much better film in 2d than 3d also dvd versions of the release appear to have one or two gross details removed not that it detracts from the nonstop tension and ambitious prop design throughout,reality
apart from providing employment for stunt actors this movie has less going for it than ants at a picnic there is nothing zero zilch of any value in this piece of tripe except just maybe for the most brain dead petrol heads if you enjoyed this movie i suggest you seek treatment immediately while you still have enough brain cells to make the decision its even worse than the previous installment and that is truly saying something 2 was a reasonably good movie in spite of a number of flaws it should have ended thereadd it to the list of destroyed hits like star wars all prequels plus 7 and terminator salvation and genisys,reality
lots of action and cool vehicles and crazy postapocalyptic freaks but flat uninteresting characters no good dialogue and a boring simplistic storythe fatlipped inexpressive tom hardy has absolutely zero charisma compared to gibsons calling him was basically pointless as he was more of a supporting character to furiosa and the film was not really about him the character could have been anyone none of the other characters were very well developed except maybe nux and furiosamy theory is that miller actually looks at this as a reboot with a female imperator furiosa imperator furiosa in this film is far more like the familiar character we know than hardys character miller pulled a real sneaky one hereif you are an adhd suffering video game junkie then i guess this is an amazing movie but if you like stupid useless boring old fashioned stuff in movies like stories fleshed out characters you can identify with and memorable dialogue you will probably be very disappointedwatching this was like playing a video game for two hours or rather watching someone else play the game,reality
i either watch a movie all the way through or decide its crap early and turn it off however this movie was so bad that i actually found myself watching it in stunned disbelief unwilling to turn off in case i missed a bit of the almost entertaining dreadfulness where do i start so a group of randy 13yearold nerds who up to the time they were summoned spent their lives playing violent computer games in their darkened bedrooms get called up by a major hollywood studio to write and direct the new movie so far so good i guess kids basically want to include three things cool cars gory death and seminaked babes they are 13 remember their vocab is limited in situations where their clothes come off a lot and all of this put to screeching deathmetal soundtracks hollywood studio agrees car are designed that look like doodles done during an lsd trip the most overthetop death stunts are cooked up and these kids have lived their lives playing grand theft so theyre good at this bit a bunch of nubile models is recruited and then hosed down a few times to test if their clothes become see through they do good to go theyre only 13 so now comes the tricky part putting this great movie together nah more fun to just throw it up in the air and see what comes downah one nubile semiclad female seems to have ended up playing the role was that intended never mind they plough on yikes no one told us this was a world without water weve got the bestest scene ever of a mountainfull of water being poured out into the sand we want it kept in and the nubile chicks their tshirts need to be hosed down with water too ahhhh dont make us lose the wet tshirt scene lose the rest coherent plot good acting engaging dialogue realistic setting or emotional impact but keep the wet t shirts hollywood studio wonders if recruiting 13yearold to write their movies was such a good idea but agree to the terms plot out wet t shirts in huh people are fooled money rolls in so onto the next big budget franchise movie anyone know any 10 yearolds,reality
this film contains so many scene references to the original it becomes annoying and boring after just 20 short minutes if you loved the first three films the continual references to the highlights of the first three films become an awful and inescapable clich combine that with an ending straight out of the lesserknown and much better 80s flick solarbabies and youve got yourself essentially a high budget b moviethere are also other huge deficiencies has very little dialogue and is an extremely boring character had a son in the original not a daughter dodge interceptor was destroyed in the road warrior and yet is driving it in the opening scene of this drivel every car in this film has a blower not just car the little men running around covered in a white powder with black markings on their face thats a straight ripoff of a character in beyond thunderdome did not the writer have a single unique contribution to the series yes he did has a psychic premonition in which his daughter saves his life now has spirits and is a religious film what a load of crapthe continual road fighting is so exhausting they should have named the film two days on a truckyou know what would have made this film so much better if it had been written by directed by and starred mel gibson,reality
the rating of 85 imdb is just to high for this movie the pictures are nice the action is alright but its getting boring just chasing cars in the desert and i did not like the crazy short plots where gets the voices the whole storyline is too easy its as if youre waiting to eat a great meal and then its noting on the plate so you hope more is coming but there is not maybe a love story or something with more emotions would have made it better the ending is also not really fantastic its just that the bad guy lost here what i liked the pictures the sandstorm you did not have a real connection to the heroes in the movie it was just not enough told about the stories they had you could have make this movie far more interesting,reality
my expectations where high for this movie as i very much liked the originals and the trailer looked awesome but unfortunately nothing in the movie lived up to my expectations starting out with the casting of tom hardy as rockatansky perhaps it is me but in the entire movie hes outplayed by both charlize theron and nicholas hoult he doesnt show any of the charisma that mel gibson presented in the original series the troubled background of is not shown or little referred too and the character is more following the events than creating themnux nicholas hoult on the other hand was a pleasant surprise and added some kick to an otherwise lame story the same goes for imperator furiosa whatever an imperator may be played by charlize theron the other characters are more or less ok but dont really add to the story including immortan joeconcerning the story its the most lame of all movies no background no timing and the story is limited to driving from point a to point b and back again there is no information given whatsoever about the tribes and how they work and what their relation to one another is nor about the hierarchy or the way of living the hints throughout the movie leave you guessing too muchan additional credit for the movie are the visual fx the driving into an upcoming sandstorm was cinematographically very nicethe end verdict would be that it is a decent friday night movie but not something you want to spend too much cash on,reality
has been captured and is being used as a human bloodbag when he is dragged along into a desert chase to recapture women on the run with the one armed furiosai like many was blown away by the trailer of fury road the chaotic zen of action symphony was something i made sure i wasnt going to miss when it hit theatres tom hardy fills the role of originally played by mel gibson we get very little in terms of story and character development from him the little we do get is in glimpses of a flashback that seems to haunt him someone or some people he couldnt save from the horrors of this post apocalyptic landscape despite the film barring his name for the title it seems that charlize therons furiosa is more of a lead here the one armed soldier has just as much if not more screen time than hardy this is therons film no doubt and she steals the show from hardy rounding out the rest of the cast is nicholas hoult aka beast from the recent xmen films as one sick puppy determined to serve the antagonist till the day he dies hes the demented one using as a bloodbag he serves immortan joe played by original baddie hugh keaysbyrne hes a twisted villain who looks the part everyone looks the part thats where this film excels at the costume and makeup design for this film is astounding i hope it receives some sort of recognition come awards season time where else does this film excel at why the action of course the choreography in this film is astounding miller has raised the bar here i never once lost my place in the action miller always had something new up his sleeve and just when our heroes felt that they dealt with something here comes something new this two hour car chase was never dull never repetitive and always onpoint i had a big goofy smile on my face the entire time right from the chaotic beginning to the climatic end thats what i loved about this film it doesnt take time to explain things to you with exposition it immediately plunges you down into their world and dares you to keep up with it is bold thrilling exciting chaotic and so much damn fun people want to complain about zero characterization i beg to differ the film gave just enough characterization for me to care a lot of this film is ambiguous why things are the way they are who people are and their intentions i like it that way the film is all about being in the moment as for this momenti want to go see it again,reality
i have never seen anything like this beforeastounding and jawdropping action scenes make this film a must watch for all movie lovers complemented by wonderful 3d special effects and top notch production values fury road is a marvelous visual spectacle that no one should missa particular sequence of scenes towards the end of the first hour is so amazing that it is like no other out there and makes us realize the reason we love movies fast paced and spell binding first hour matched by an equally worthy second highly recommended flick go watch it in theaters thank me later what a lovely day,reality
fury road a movie after 30 years and without mel gibson as rockatansky was surely not a letdown a movie that inspired the likes of the saw series and even the music video of california love by dr dre and tupac has to be taken seriously and george miller gets it right yet again the plot revolves around charlize therons character imperator furiosa with tom hardy as playing second fiddle but adding to the madness nevertheless with a heavy dose of stunts and pyrotechnics and thrills and spills and hot women and a few older ones too kickin some serious butt drool this one has all the ingredients of a hit,reality
if you like cartoon action and lots of it this movie is for you its non stop action explosions and over the top sets stuntsand props from start to finishif you require any sort of character development depth or a reason to care about any of the players keep on walking this movie is not for you i saw the movie last night and i can only tell you the name of one character bottom line if you like movies like triple x youll probably love thisif die hard is more your style of action movie youll probably think this movie is beyond stupid i know i did,reality
nice action sequences explosions lots of noise bombastic score car flips truck chases and nothing else it it had at least some boobage i wouldve given it 3 starswell mmfr is another of these politically correct postmodern allegories that show that men are evil and that all worlds problems are caused by them and that women in the end will save the day and bla bla blathis thing is so dumb that whoever wrote this mess even invented super grannies who can shoot and kill and are as though as any 300 lb nfl oland the most interesting aspect of mmfr is that is has no story no plot whatsoever it is nothing more than an endless car chase through a desert they do not even know which is their final destination is is true that the scenery is awesome but we have national geographic to produce this type of material rightand in the end as expected prince charming saves the day and a retinue of damsels in distress as expected and the aforementioned damsels and other damsels reclaim the world as theirs to right all wrongs men ever have madethose remakes are so bad that i guess someday someone will have the bright idea of remaking rambo as a gay transvestite,reality
if you are a fan of overly special fx and brainless screenplay  go there unfortunately this piece cant live up to any expectations the nonsense ranges from total absence of any reasonable story behind it to pure stupidity like people donating blood to each other without knowing each others blood typesafe the money on i there is no real usage of that technology was the same waste of time like interestellari wonder if there is any useful coming out of westcoast recently the ending was clear from minute 25 approximately hero chick takes over form old warlordfunny enough all stereotypes covered,reality
it was very meh if im honest i enjoyed the postapocalyptic element and strangely the one aspect i enjoyed was that which my friends thought brought it downthat one aspect being the juxtaposition between the classes as the character of immortan joe clearly has great superiority over his people the lower classes as this caught my interest so did the scene in which immortan joe gave the lower classes water from his supply he allows mass amounts of water to drop from his high heavenly quarters to the peasants below suggesting that he is a good leader he then stops the water supply leaving some but no where near enough to give people strength thus oppressing them without them realizing that i thought was brilliantly donethen you get these twenty minute car chases which just stop the film in its tracks made marginally better by the weird fire shooting guitarist that was the moment when i decided it wasnt all it was cracked up to be i could have taken a dump came back and nothing would have changedplus when they included the several beautiful young women who just happened to be showering it reminded me of in films such as transformers when they get in some young bird to wear tight denim shorts in order to make fourteen year old lads think its a good movie it worked it out in the end as they were actually pivotal to the story line so ill give them that also because i need to bring this up even though it doesnt mean much i kept getting reminded of the inbetweeners firstly when just gets out of the sigh twenty minute car chase hes still chained to nicholas hoults car and so has to take him and the car door with him images of joe thomas carrying his yellow car door around thorpe park sprung to mind there were a couple more too but i cant remember them overall it wasnt a terrible film it could have been worse but it could have been a lot better for me personally i hate hearing about a films success before ive seen it when people just assume its a good film because it has a good rating on imdb or rotten tomatoes that annoys me because thats not their opinion its other peoples and a film could get slated by everyone who reviews it but it might actually be okay but you dont give it a chance because ooh it got below 8i actually dont think any films are infinitely good or bad its just a matter of whether it spoke to you or not if a film didnt grip me then ill say it was bad therefore i consider this a bad film but that doesnt mean it is thats just my opinion films i like the most are ones with a concealed meaning that you have to try and decipher sometimes that can come when you are in the screening or when youre thinking about it the following day fury road just wasnt able to pull me in like other films do which is actually a shame because i did love the postapocalyptic element they just didnt fulfill that potential,reality
it seemed like every time the action sequences threatened to get good they had to remind you just how silly and overthetop this movie was required to be i know they felt compelled to try and top the original but i have to ask one question why i just dont understand why they felt it necessary to try and top it at every turn just keep telling the story and let this film stand on its own merits why all the cgi chaos jamming in too many characters and adding camp and completely ridiculous action seems like they were overly desperate to make this reboot relevant the entire plot and the actions of the leads were beyond absurd and i just dont find moronic and impossible plot turns or cartoon stunts fun to watch i also found the character arcs to be shallow and even nonexistent im so disappointed i thought id find a fun film worthy of the name instead what i found was a waste of time and an insult to my active brain cells,reality
my friend convinced me to go to this movie because of the rave reviews and bizarrely high imdb and rotten tomato ratings i went in thinking it would be a great action movie and left very disappointed its mannered in a very way i can tell but as someone who has never seen the past 3 movies it is steaming garbage little actual plot or dialogue you could replace charlize theron with any actress who has played a female action star and tom hardy has a forgettable follow up to mel gibson nicholas hault is the best thing about this movie delivering the only good performance in a series of mishaps maybe if the movie wasnt 90 driving sequences i would have enjoyed it more,reality
when i was young i was introduced to the australian cult classic film 1979 by my dad ever since then has always been very special to the both of us it has been 30 years since the last entry in the franchise which was beyond thunderdome 1985 which in my opinion was my least favorite filmto see the next entry on the big screen for the first time with fury road it means so much to me that this film is one of the best films i have ever seen in my life from the spectacular action to the eyepopping scenery from the well thought characters to the well written script everything in this film i believe worked so masterfully by writerdirector george miller without his visionary this film wouldve been as epic if handled by another directorapart from the amazing practical action effects aside there are also many themes and meanings in this film when analyzed closely to me this is more than just an action film it is a masterpiece achievement in australian filmmaking and will be referred as a cult classic for the many years to come this is george millers franchise and he has brought it back to life my favorite movie so far in 2015 one of my favorite action movies of all time and without a doubt is phenomenally one of my favorite movies of all time a definite 1010 please by all means i strongly advise you to see this in cinemas for the exhilarating experience thanks for reading ,reality
beforei came to the cinema for this film id had very high expectation and enthusiasm about this movie i love the old franchise i had a doubt this film could match the greatness and the tension of old franchise but when i saw the trailer my old opinion definitely would be wrong but i was afraid because usually when i have high expectation before i watch a movie itd be disappointed but this movie is an exception this movies really exceed my expectation i mean it was a superb fury road definitely the best movie of the franchise and maybe the best action movie its the best cinematic experience ive seen since gravity the visual effect cinematography sound score and the design was incredible maybe this movie can get some oscar recognition for the effect all the performance was very good to but charlize therons performance is the one who should get our thumbs ill be if charlize doesnt get an oscar performance next yearalthough oscars never really about this kind of movie and george miller what kind of human is he how could a director made that amazing movievery recommended for all people in the world who still live if you havent watch it watch it nowsorry for my bad english,reality
charlize theron was topnotch her face expressions were so genuine its scary i loved so vulnerable from the beginning of the movie small talk dark sad past nonstop action i cant imagine how somebody can pack so much action in a movie this director is passed genius truly a movie worth every merit movies and directors will be measured based on this movie from now on mechanical effects marvel in every way so many details such clever invention and rewriting of common day life items and human life the matrix of this decade so many little details are there for you to grab if youre curious enough oh what a movie what a lovely movie,reality
first of all if you dont like this type of postapocalyptic action based movie genre you dont go to watch it just because everyone is talking about it this is not some dramatriller or whatever with deep story this is pure dose of adrenaline action based movie with best 3d effects i have ever experienced in the cinema not a single boring minute if you like stuntmonster truck shows watching this is something like that you have a feeling that you are watching best stunt performance ever with lots of action d the design of vehicles locations characters and whole world is just amazingi like it a lot im fan of this genre whole my lifebut of course something is missing tom hardy was good but he is not mel gibson i think whatever actor they choose it would be the same its not the same feeling like in old movies mel is just irreplaceable and why to force it with a new version of when you can build in this big postapocalyptic world a new story with a new hero or heroinemy opinion in that case i think in this part was just a background character because charlize therons imperator furiosa kicked ass definitely ruled the movie with amazing acting performance i like her character this will turn into classic one of best movies eveeeer made d,reality
q what does chinatown 1979 and on the waterfront 1954 have in common with fury road 2015a they are all within several points each other on the imdb top 250 list thats right the wickedly brilliant filmnoir classic and the famously acted and directed social drama of its time are both rated similarly to where does one go from hereon one hand just might achieve a new standard for nonstop action  stunt work bravo on the other hand it is one of the most unbelievably juvenile written scripts i have ever encountered shamefulat the end of the day all the money and amazing craftsmanship cannot hide the fact that the emperor really is not wearing any clothes i suspect and truly hope that after 10 years or so when those praising this film as a masterpiece see this film again maybe even with their own children their first comment after viewing it is  what was i thinking,reality
this is a classic example of peaceniks propaganda in collaboration with feminists politicalenvironmentalists and pseudoseculars who could imagine to be a henpecked second fiddle to a gun wielding man hunting amputee  furiosa what waste of a great actor like tom hardy who can stand out in every shot if cast as the leading nemesis alas in this latest installment of of the days of yore tom hardy is a mere drone to the intrepid warqueen furiosa charlize theron as far as i am concerned the very idea of tribalwomenwarriors is distasteful and pernicious it hardly leaves much to imagination whom the war boys are modeled after they are postapocalypse fidayeen indoctrinated quite like the islamists of our times with promises of heaven after death a place they scream out as valhalla the name surely has an arabic sound to it a kind touch on the forehead by a pure and perfect not pious for a change creature transforms the war boy this is such subliminal moral swashbuckling aimed at nonmuslims who need to be told that fidayeens can be made friends with display of sympathy called largesse in the context of realpolitik have they not read of what india had to endure when a certain bald and dhoticlad mahatma used the same idea to mollycoddle islamists  or has pakistan been transformed despite americas freebies and bailouts for years  and if the pacifistic messaging was not enough they went boldly feminist on us women are the real warriors  not only can they beat the deadcrap out of men but also are the only hope for life and for the restoration of all that was valuable before the holocaust we already have single women buying seed from spermbanks and making ivf babies in india proving they do not need men even to make men such unbelievable misandry and our law permits it they can perhaps show humans as hermaphrodites with tits in the next installment of as if indian and world mainstream media have not been inimical enough to men and to qafirs we now have main stream movie producers jumping on the bandwagon what next  they might start selling punching bags at decathlon with men and qafirs painted on those it is a global hit and enjoys an obscenely high rating of 84 on imdb this does not portend well for the future,reality
today i saw one of the worst hollywood attempts at salvaging a dead franchise was the definitive mansman who played second fiddle to no one be it male or female there are so many things wrong with this movie both storyline and defying the laws of physics and i dont know how to react i shall give it a go starting off being a die hard fan from the early days i went into this movie ready to fall in love even though eve ensler consulted on and changed a lot of the movie all of traits which made him the badass i loved were in fact given to furiosa she also took the reins and the movie then became imperator furiosa fury road it was an ultraprogressive feminist crapfest surrounded with action and cgi to die for the action and effects are the only reason i didnt give this movie a 1,reality
i have to give this film some stars for the things i thought it did well the vehicle design some of the camera work the scale of the environment however bland it was all very impressive on a big tv at home with the guys and a few beers im sure its funwith that said after the first half an hour i realised that id seen everything this movie had to offer driving shooting exploding and lots of sand this wouldnt have been so bad had there been any meaningful dialogue to break up the frantic action sequences but the film never settled down for more than a few minutes before the sound of distant engines and gunfire signalled yet another impending chase sequencei appreciate that for some people thats a good thing but not for me as an action movie yeah its probably very good setting aside the fact that the first and second half are basically the same but mirrored but with all of the praise being heaped upon it youd swear it was something more its really not if michael bay had made this movie itd get trashed,reality
i am really amazed how many good reviews i am seeing on this site for this movie although i must admit it wasnt really bad i would never called it good a lot of people have pointed out the photography the musicall the technical things and i must admit that indeed they are very well done the main problem of this movie wasnt in that it was in the casting and the plot so the movie begins and as almost it begins the action too which as all of the people who watched i too love my action but in giving the action the audience wanted i understood nothing about the plot because it was never developed i never got what were those white humans why were they white and why did they capture people for the blood and i must admit i have never watched mel gibsons movie or read the comics i heard there were comics about it but a movie shouldnt need the help of other mediums specially when its not a sequel so i didnt either understand why the wives were so important the second problem was the casting charlize theron stole the whole movie between the supposedly main character and the wives it was like i was seeing a high school play instead of a movie and as i said charlize theron didnt help matters by showing the great actress she is the third thing that was an issue or maybe not was the ridiculousness of everything starting with the guitarist playing the guitar while thousands of people were dying around him every time i saw him i laugh my head off then you have the medical stuff the blood transfusion while not even caring the type of blood of the donor and look i do not have a problem with a little fantasy in my movies but in a world that was stated that it came from ours it was unbelievable then the funniest thing were the people flying on the poles i loved the acrobatics and im sure the movie wasnt supposed to be a comedy but it ended up being that anyhow at the end of it i suppose it was entertaining even with its faults,reality
well i rewatched fury road again 5th or 6th time and the movie stands the test of time  this is a hell of a trip and all those reviews who are negative dont understand one simple fact this movie doesnt intend to be something else than it is  a postapocalyptic joyride on the wheels of hell the story may not be the most sophisticated one but tbh none of the movies of the franchise are but it gives what it promises a trip on the fury road a big bonus imo is especially all the analog done stunts  if i compare this with these fast and furios movies for example where almost every action scene screams cgi i am really happy to watch this traditional done action scenes which are btw just stunningfury road is just great and superb i also like tom hardy as okay mel i like more but anyway and charlize theron shows again that she can play all sortsgenres of movies and charactersi enjoyed and will enjoy this one greatly and i am eager to see the next movie of the series imo we need some more  so we can binge watch this over a whole weekend thats my future plan for living an aim worth for staying alive  all thumbs up  well done mr miller,reality
i actually had quite high hopes for this film i had heard good things from friends from some critics and though a 6 time oscar winner would be quite good oh how wrong was i a film such as this was never going to have a fascist style dictator in a dystopian world emerge victorious but a little bit of fight in them wouldnt have gone amiss the fact that within the first thirty minutes of the film you knew they would escape with as little as a scratch infuriated me the whole chase idea just turned into one long race which was closer to pod racing in the phantom mence the acting in the film was mild at best tom hardy and charlize theorn are two very good actors who were reduced to little more than grunts and tepid dialogue for the whole two hours of pointlessness the only thing that this film truly does get right though is the cinematography a beautiful example of how cgi should be done,reality
i dont get it i placed this film on my watch list simply due to the oscar attention and wins although i was seriously skeptical that a movie of this sort was really all that i figured that beyond the way it looked in the trailers that i so easily dismissed they must have really broken artistic ground must have knocked the acting out of the park the story they must have really done something special here nope the movie was worse than any low expectations i initially hadthe funny thing is i watched this movie following a debate about the integrity of the oscarswhich i defendedand then we watched this movie now i have my doubts there is simply no rational explanation for the accolades bestowed upon this film beyond some ulterior motives beyond somebody making money on this processthe characters in this film were all caricatures of anything that made any sense yet so ampedup and just silly that the it seemed everyone involved was on speed while writing producing and acting this out completely hollow characters shallow and essentially empty plot the film managed to be riveting only through nonstop action that as i look back feels a bit like a ptsd recollection of clockwork orange alex watching it strapped down with eyes forced openthe movie was indeed a visual wonder and spectacle and i enjoyed watching it if it was just there adorned with low expectations looking unloved and i watched it without biasthen perhaps would i simply say wow what a neat blockbuster extravaganza typical hollywood shallow but who cares it was fun but for this movie to win all these awards i feel completely sick about the entire oscars enterprise between this and the fiasco of the worst oscars ceremony ive ever witnessed they now have a long way to go before i pay as much attention to them as i once did too bad,reality
i havent seen all of movies the franchise is a remake of but i can tell you it wasnt as good as i thought the movie would bewhen you see tom hardy  charlize theron in a castyou expect a gritty story  great actingspecial effects in the movie are all right but story simply too simplistic  never really thrilling for meeven violence quotient is nothing specialto mebest sequence of the movie was right at the start before they roll the starting creditsafter thatit just goes downhillthe story started out with a promise of almost schizophrenic episodes of but after thathighlight of the movie is character of nux overshadowing everyone elseat the end it just fizzles outworth a onetime watch for its vfxlaced action sequences though,reality
thats pretty much itexcept the good actingi mean what iswas all the fuss aboutwhen you go to see a movie any movie really you need to understand and respect the people involved in the making of it and so did i the acting of theron was fantastic really greatas an action genre fan i cant say that i didnt enjoy the action scenes they were intense but nothing more if you are into off road car crashing car explodingthen this is the movie for youthe only thing that got me laughing about this movie is the guitar guy first time i saw the guy i saidreally really a guitar dude what am i even watching but after time it was kinda funny i hope the creators where going after thatall in all for me it was just driving action and nothing more the plot was a little dull,reality
wow fury road lived up to the expectations set by its trailer and i know i need to see it again in fact this movie was so intense that there were scenes i actually needed to see again while they were still ongoing but heres the weird part as epic and spectacular as fury road is i still think the first two are better films and fury road certainly makes up for the letdown that was beyond thunderdome even though it was a long time coming maybe it will become clearer why i think that by the end of the review maybe not im just gonna throw out some thoughts about the movie after watching this i dont have the energy for an indepth analysissee it in 3d in the largest loudest format you cani like that there is a bit more backstory and humanizing dialog among what would otherwise appear to be minor villains even just basic chitchat like hey where are we going is refreshing compared to wezs screamingthere are a few surprisingly emotional scenes that add a level of complexity to immortan joe that is unusual for any villain but these were the exception and overall he felt somewhat underdeveloped as a characteri didnt expect it but the weak link here is tom hardy early on it seemed that he was trying very hard  and succeeding  to channel the desperation mistrust and ultimate survival skills of the rockatansky we first met 36 years ago but then it sort of falls apart and he settles for a weird hybrid britishaustralianamerican accent and an overall bland performance this is no bane hes barely even the scarecrowso in the end i blame mel gibson that this movie wasnt quite as good as it could have been if not for the various misbehaviors that put him out of public favor this could have been a great opportunity for him to reprise the role of on the other hand fury road is not so much about as it is about the story which is superbasic i can see why some people complain about lack of plot the action is practically nonstop what seems like a bit of a lull in the middle is probably no more than 5 minutes longthe score is big and bold and fits the action in most cases though it is a bit too orchestral and less frantic or desperate than the themes in or 2 edit after multiple viewings i retract the previous statement the score particularly during the motorcycle attack is perfectly majestic and heroic and urgent and stirs exactly the right emotionsin fact thats another minor complaint this movie is hyperpolished every scene is visually perfect every background sound is orchestrated not a piece of rust or a jagged spike is out of place its a dystopian utopia oh yeah i kind of wished theyd been consistent and used another mack truck for the war rig but oh well i guess the oshkosh or whatever military truck they used was heavier duty and i have to say  the vehicles in this movie were insane  crazier than any hot wheels car ive ever seen sure theres a fair amount of men are bad in this movie but lets be real most of the men in this movie are bad and men in real life are pretty bad a lot of the time too i think real men ought to be able to handle this plot element without throwing a conniption besides if george miller was serious about the feminism angle he wouldnt have had one of the vuvalini riding a gold wing in the postapocalypse there are lots of really cool touches in the movie in the action sequences just to mention a few without spoiling them too much the cowcatcher on the war rig is quite functional and never siphon dragster fuel by mouththe ending works well sure its kind of a happy ending but with only one really happy ending out of four movies you cant complain that george miller is trying to blow sunshine up your aim sure i need to see this movie again probably multiple times just to absorb more of the stunt sequences but im not necessarily sure i want to see it again as much as i did or 2 so in the end fury road with all its greatness has made me appreciate even more the characterizations tone and gritty vision in the first 2 films still fury road is definitely a landmark in sequelsrebootsreimaginings and it puts george miller in a rare league that not even george lucas and spielberg could enter with their weak reduxes of star wars and indiana jonesheres my precise ratings of the series862510 2 the road warrior 910 beyond thunderdome 6810 fury road 8510,reality
set thirty years after the trilogy this reboot of brings more action and class to the already classic of a series you dont have to see the previous movies to understand this reboot only the characters and the idea of the not do distant dystopian future have been taken from the original trilogy arguably the best action movie of the year blends the fun of a popcornfilm and class of a cinema to give us a critical blockbuster which will stay with us beyond thunderdrome the cinema hallthe movie begins the action at the beginning which doesnt stop till the last minute of the movie the chasesthe carsthe warmachines the explosions the collisions and what not it has everything a action movie needs to rise your adrenaline levels through the roof the movie is like a big chasing movie in which george miller sneakily inserted a story to keep us engaged through out the movie the perfectly timed explosions caused by exploding spears and the vehicles which which are still coming at you even after the big explosions the villain immortan joe with never give up attitude going after the imperator furiosa and her allies the reason i am elaborating excessively is because there isnt a single aspect of this movie that i want to leave unattendedcoming to the critical aspects of the movie the use of color in this movie adds so much beauty to it that its like cotton candy to your eyes the story though not so complex but compelling to watch gives us another reason to relive this epic action movie once more time the music adds to more excitement to the action of this film it isnt the best background in business but for an action movie it just fills your cup to the pinnacle tom hardy the future holder of one of the great actors of all time atleat i think so give an amazing performance as a lonely scared and a guy whose only instinct is to surviveif your looking for an good action movie then look no further this is it,reality
why is the average user review for this film around 39 but the overall rating is 82 at 82 it has the same score as good will hunting raging bull chinatown blade runner casino a 39 score makes it worse than most adam sandler moviesi thought the whole purpose of this site is to check a movies credentials before spending your hard earned money on a cinema ticket you think youre getting blade runner when in fact youd wished youd watched grown ups 2 in reviewing this film i cant really add to the haters as i am one the 3 score is for the automotive engineering and if this film was an episode of scrapheap challenge or junkyard wars id have given it a ten,reality
this movie is a waste of time it has no script no direction no acting it has nothing i have watched it once and trust me i was about to cry for my time wastage millions of dollars spent on this baseless movie charlize hardly spoke a word i have seen better movies of charlize in which she inspired me and here she is getting bald for a senseless roll a bunch of stupid gangsters follow her on a road with no clue what are they up to guys i wouldnt watch it again if they pay me a million bucks i dont know why am i rating it 2 it should be 200 but i dont want people to lose faith in hollywood gangsters with funny cars funny getup and funny acting 200 psychos chasing one woman for nothing in the whole movie i admit it has fast action but action without story looked simply stupid i liked only one thing about this movie and its the name because it was written by some people to make people guys dont waste your time is my advice,reality
in a theater this is nothing less than an assault on your senses but on the smaller screen you need an actual story and this film doesnt have very much of one george miller gives us several good ideas about what a post apocalyptic australian future would look like but hes had his entire life to think about it so i would expect at least some good ideas after having decades to mull it over but this is mainly a bag full of tricks to entice every teenage boy into the theater and out of his allowance from loud cars to loud thrash metal to loud electric guitars that shoot flames  one of the many many phallic symbols in this film all the way to the group of bikini clad nubile young models who are actually wetting themselves down can anyone say wet t shirt contesttom hardy is probably the best actor of this generation and all his talent is so wasted here in fact the character of is superfluous to this entire film hes only here as an excuse to get us back to this time and place but hardy still manages to get in some good acting licks he has a way of bringing out the humor yes i said humor in the character of without trying to behave like mel gibson the way hardy runs around and the way he uses the file on the face mask is reminiscent of fighting in thunderdome without actually imitating mel gibsonbut this film is all about charlize theron kudos to her agent for getting her top billing at the beginning of the film it makes me think maybe miller had a crush on charlize and constructed this entire film as an excuse just to hang around with herin a nut shell if youre over the age of 14 and actually want a story to go along with all the cool cars and loud noise youre out of luck this movie is a bunch of massive hype with the big selling point during the months of promotion being that a lot of the stunts were done in real life instead of cgi uh that is actually the way almost every film made before the year 1990 was created too so whats so great about thatthe actual trick of making a big film is to balance it with enough intimate moments that make you sympathize with the characters enough to care what happens to them a good example of this being done right is james camerons titanic but in this film i dont care if all the characters die except for nicolas hoult who used his few moments and lines to make me care about his character nux this was no easy feat amid all the dust and noise so im anxious to see what he can do in other films but after watching this film 4 times i wanted to give it a fair chance to win me over im done mel gibson was smart to give this one a skip you should do the same as for tom hardy your time is better spent watching one of his former films over again instead of wasting it here pick one of his films where you can actually see his face and hear his voice this could have been portrayed by hand puppets and none of us would be the wiser who knows maybe it was,reality
to me that has seen the original movies this one is bad in many way the story line is no good cg is not good and wrecks and jumps are so off meaning the landing could not be done the angles are wrong one car you can see hit the cliff and falls behind but next shoot he is pulling in front of truck like nothing happen to me the worst part is the story line the 1st had a real story line and the 2nd one and 3rd one for those who have not seen the original i would suggest seeing them and you will see how much better they are in every way well cg might not be but they really didnt need it,reality
theres some of the old films magic here clever costumes and rigs and props made from scrap metal with nutty personalized touches people with crazy names some exciting actions sequences in the last half of the movie but the main character who gave the previous films their heart and soul is gone theres no here i dont even know who the standin is but he has no personality charlize theron is physically imposing but doesnt get to do a lot of acting the supporting actresses are just eye candy for hetero men their flimsy desert wraps artfully placed to just barely cover the naughty bits the plot is a wellworn scheme about a tyrannical ruler who uses control of resources and a bogus mythology to suppress the masses i guess if you havent seen very many movies this would seem original if you are over 40 you have seen this all before somewhat enjoyable but not inspiring,reality
great action scenes with lots of special effects and sufficient creativity and variations on unexpected situations nice touches involving thoughtful details relating to the classic saga of the mel gibson trilogy however there is a major flaw to this moviecan you have a hero with zero or next to non existing personality a major part of the movie is underway before utters an inconsequential monosyllable the previous character played by mel had strong emotional conflicts that force him to deal with external threats with decisive yet necessary violence the zombie in this movie seems like a robot with no idea of where or what to do unless he is told one expects that eventually he would wake up but to no avail sorry but the i and ii had a very definite character that we learned to understand and love charlize is very good and credible and the movie should be named ine although the college of wives was a bit too much finally the abortion scene adds little and is in very questionable taste good picture to view once,reality

ok so was a little nervous about welcoming having not grown up watching the other movies however the worries were soon put to rest very quickly after the movie started i really enjoyed it myself full of adventure and fun good action and good humor in some moments really not disappointed that i saw it in the least fantastic sequel god seems to be smiling down on the action fans this year first there was now this i am still in a rush from all the fun glad they had a female hero that doesnt fall in love with the hero for once though it would have just made it better if he or she had fallen for the other but back to the movie was very little swearing as well which i greatly appreciated i highly recommend u see it good for fathers and teen sons or mothers and teen sons not really a date movie  but see it u wont regret it,reality
all other films that think they can call themselves action blockbusters please step aside to make way for the only true blockbuster this summer and for many more summers to come im sure fury road oh my god this movie right here this explosive obscene grotesque beautiful movie right here was everything i ever wanted it to be and more george miller after thirty years has returned to his legendary series and hes returned with the some serious firepower at his disposal firepower in the form of 150 million dollars and the limitless wonders of modern technology miller fires off this ammunition at full force to create the impossibly vast and intimately gritty world of rockatansky in the grandiose way i think he envisioned it from the start upon seeing the first trailer for this film i said it looked like the film miller always wanted to make but didnt have the tech or the money to accomplish seeing the movie in its glorious two hour entirety affirms that statementfury road stands alone from its three predecessors with the titular character and his post apocalyptic scenery being the only thread that combines them fury road presents a wholly original story taking place in the wasteland where we meet a water hungry colony ruthlessly ruled by immortan joe the films badass big bad despite having plenty of water immortan joe hordes it to keep control of his colony while he impregnates his forced marriage wives called breeders with the hopes of them bearing future warlord sons the story gets going when imperator furiosa played by an ass kicking charlize theron betrays immortan joe sick names right and steals the breeders to get them to a land referred to as the green place previously captured by joes war boys ends up getting mixed up in furiosas campaign and finds himself aiding them on their long treacherous trek through the desert wasteland all the while being pursued by joe and his allied gangs from gas town and the bullet farm did i mention i love all the names of everything in this damn moviemy memory of the original films is somewhat limited especially when it comes to more specific elements of the world so i might be wrong in saying that fury road has some of the most ingenious and in depth world building ive seen miller accomplish even if im wrong about that the post apocalyptic society miller has constructed in fury road makes for an incredibly poignant and gloriously over the top statement on what humanity might devolve into after the apocalypse he does a fantastic job of bringing into the modern era as well where gas was the most precious of all resources in the original trilogy it now takes a second seat to water the resource most craved by society being in california this element hits frighteningly close to home everything miller does in fury road affirms and expands on everything that was so great about this series before its budget had nine digits as was the case with the previous films fury road isnt a story primarily about himself the story really focuses on furiosa and her own heros journey across the desert as she quite literally drives the plot forward she fuels a plot that ultimately has an awesome feminist angle by the end breaking down gender barriers and making the women of the film the most exceedingly capable and overly wicked characters ive already mentioned how awesome theron is and her accompanying group of supermodelser breeders quickly transition from damsels in distress to a resourceful band of hot chicks who also kick a lot of ass so i want to just come out and say this this movie is a visual masterpiece im not exaggerating either yes i saw this movie less than 24 hours ago and my testosterone levels are probably still spiking but i will stand by that statement as long as i live fury road is gorgeous it delivers some of the most wildly imaginative action set pieces every conceived and some of the most creatively constructed chase sequences ive ever had the pleasure of watching play out on screen i said a lot of things about the avengers age of ultron action scenes that i would repeat here about being clearly displayed and easy to follow but where fury road surpasses this is by showing just how beautifully shot these scenes can be and what happens when you accomplish the capturing of the impossibly huge scope of the australian outback setting this desert wasteland is massive and the film constantly reminds us of that in wide shots that would make kurosawa require a change of underwear yeah i said it also this is one of those incredibly rare moments in my film reviews where i would actually highly recommend the 3d it is one of the many many things expertly utilized in fury road miller expertly uses it as a tool to immerse you in his world rather than a gimmick for a few mediocre sight gags fury road is a film that traps you in its insane world for two solid hours of entertainment and you come out on the other end in a haze full of sand blood and nerd tears its a transcendental experience guys you need to experience it seriously you are doing yourself a major disservice if you dont go see this film so drop everything your doing and get to the theater to see fury road,reality
fury road is a australian postapocalyptic action film starring tom hardy charlize theron and nicolas hoult and is directed by george millerthis film is amazing a true action film for the ages and just like the trailers show its all action it hardly slows down in its 2 hour running time yet it also has a fun yet simple story interesting characters and great world buildingin the stark desert wasteland populated by a broken humanity driven with survival and the unending ravage for gasoline a loner named finds himself unwantedly caught in the middle of a chase while aiding the heroine furiosa and her female companions she struggles to return to her homeland and escape the clutches of a ruthless dessert gang leader immortan joe with the harsh desert sands in front of them and marauders behind only the maddest will prevail the stormi only just caught up with all of the previous films and enjoyed them greatly and i feel like this one fits right in with the previous ones tom hardy has replaced mel gibson as rockatansky and he is just as good as gibson hardy is an amazing actor and he doesnt have a lot to say in the film like the older films but his physical acting makes up for his lack of lines you also understand his mental condition more in this film than previous ones which i thought was interesting in the older films i didnt really think that was crazy but in this film hardy proves that he is nicolas hoult plays nux a warboy who is on the antagonists side of the fight in the film i thought that nux was a really interesting character because in the older films we saw all of these insane tribesmen fighting and dont really understand these crazy characters nux lets us into that kind of mindframe which i found fascinating hoult played him very well and is unrecognizable in the role not just because he shaved all the hair off his body because this is a side of the actor we have never seen before and he has the best line in the film which has become the tag line for the film what a lovely day saving the best character for last charlize therons imperator furiosa by far the most badass character in the film and one of the strongest female characters that has been put on the big screen in quite a while like hoult theron also shaves her head and sinks into her role as furiosa she is arguably the main character in the film having the best lines great action and emotional scenes while is just along for the ride in this film furiosa is taking charge looking after people and trying to save them which was nice to see i thought it was interesting that while is a big part of the film and the namesake of it miller decided it doesnt need to only be about himthe side characters are also interesting immortan joes wives are all strong women which each have their own thing to do and feel like real characters instead of just plot points which was nice to see the main antagonist immortan joe was also good played by hugh keaysbyrne who played toecutter in the first film he was a intimidating imposing character but not much more than that we dont delve into his character like we do the others but i think that is okay because the film doesnt focus on him too much and knows that he isnt the most important thing in the film the great thing about all of the side characters were their designs they all looked so unique and interesting that they stood out even if they were not the most vital character like comadoof warrior who is a random character that plays a guitar that spouts fire and gets the enemy troops riled up the character looks so cool that he is instantly a fan favourite going back to the action scenes because that is the most important thing in the film director george miller does such a fantastic job of keeping all of the action scenes fun and exciting the film is 2 hours long and id say there is about 15 hours of action yet it isnt boring and is always exciting to see filming in australia again was a great idea the locations in the film are amazing long rocky roads and empty deserts really made you feel like this was a postapocalyptic world that these character are living inthe fact that the movie is one long action scene is a real big feat for me and it establishes the film as one of the greatest action films of the last decade the actors are all great in their roles i cant imagine any film being better than this this summer465,reality
i really want to go back and watch road warrior now that ive seen fury road the first was a fantastic revenge story that also gave us some of the best low budget action we have ever had road warrior to me fell short of the first and just didnt give me that visceral experience but im definitely willing to give it another shot after seeing the insane fury road now you dont necessarily have to see any of the first 3 to understand the world of but you will have a better appreciation for what exactly is going on in this post apocalyptic world its cleared up by tom hardy in the first few minutes of the movie which shows flashbacks or recreations rather from the events of the first two films bottom line is to go see this movie in theaters its the best pure action film of the year and of quite some timewe begin at the citadel when presumably the world and its chaos is controlled by king immortan joe he has 5 wives who were individually selected for breeding and carrying on his blood who are held hostage at his place furiosa played by charlize theron isnt thrilled and decides to steal all of his wives and bring them to her homeland the green place while in pursuit she crosses paths with the once captured and they agree begrudgingly to help each other for their own greater good what follows is an insane action film that barely takes time to breathe 90 of the film is supposedly practical effects which is absolutely mindblowing i love avengers but half of the film is green screen and you can pretty much tell when it is but here watching the film i couldnt really tell you what parts were real and what wasnt and at 70 years old george miller did an unbelievable job especially considering some of the development problems the film had there are people jumping from vehicle to vehicle riding their motorcycles on top of huge trucks hanging onto the bottom of high speed car chases and almost all of it was real it gives you an extra layer of excitement while watching the film that you just dont get with cgi fest filmswith that being said the action never becomes overpowering or distracting it doesnt necessarily exhaust you it just thrills you especially with junkie xls brilliant score playing in the background sure i definitely would have liked to have seen more development from the characters especially our main villain besides having several wives and controlling the water supply we dont know much about him just gets stuck in the chaos its not even really his film its really furiosas film and wow is she an awesome bada character or what side note i would love to see some sort of team up between furiosa and rita vrataski from edge of tomorrow aka full metal bitc charlize theron strips down her glamorous hollywood look for the role and gives a terrific performance i found a lot of her backstory to be really touching and even heartbreaking as much as its a story of redemption for her its a redemption film for the franchise which will hopefully continue this can easily be a new set of films with hardy and the supporting roles which its worth mentioning how great and unrecognizable nicholas hoult was in the film this film has so many great action scenes with characters you root for and even some deeper themes about surviving madness and how you control chaos even though i loved the trailers i was deeply surprised by fury road and i hope to see more of these filmsfuriosa is an awesome character hardy is as good if not better than gibson insane action how did they do it sets up a new set of films but honors the ones before unrecognizable hoult action doesnt get exhausting junkie xls score character development 9510,reality
it is not a film it should be called furiosa road thomas hardy doesnt even do a good take on theres only one and his name is mel gibson the film is only for the new generation this was meant to be a 80s throw back and it is nothing like a good old fashioned film at all masterpieceofshit is all i can say terminator 5 may have flaws but at least it was entertaining and had its great star back mr arnold schwarzenegger that film was smashed for been bad and gets the reviews like its epic its not at all its simply nothing like the masterpiece they lead you to believe if you are a younger generation and into hardy the way of films now you will mostly love it but if you are a avid fan of the first 3 films you will hate it if your a true fan anyway,reality
what do i mean by saying that fury road a heavy metal action movie about a group of women led by imperator furiosa and that other guy his name trying to find safe haven away from the barbarians especially a darth vaderstyle slavemaster of the post apocalyptic wastelands by saying pure cinema it might be unfair to filmmakers who may just love to hear their characters talk and dialogdriven films can be made cinematic in the right hands but what i mean to say is that george miller really would have been perfectly at home working during the silent era when all you needed to show were images of things happening frenetically with the occasional dialog to get your point across ive seen fury road twice in a week and i have to wonder if miller really wanted to be buster keaton or abel gance when he was going to the movies not to say westerns dont figure plenty in the framework  they have since the original film and certainly the road warrior is nothing without the cowboys vs indians aestheticbut miller eschews a ton of exposition at the start and puts the characters right into the thick of the story furiosa goes to get the gasoline for immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne formerly toecutter oddly enough in 1 and goes her own path  she wants to get to the green place with ladies that are property of joes and she will stop at nothing to get there is along for the ride one of those great wild visual touches has him strapped to the front of a vehicle with a grated mask over his face  and is once again the reluctant hero for this journeywe find out all of this along the way really which shows how economical miller is in his storytelling he doesnt waste any time and all that matters is keeping this bad motherf of a movie on a roll the first major action sequence a chase of the war parties against furiosa would be the cliof any other film for miller its just the start and even when character try to take a rest certainly in the first half theres still tension and suspense going on and when i mean by pure cinema take the moment where first confronts furiosa and the women by the truck he has a gun on them we know its loaded from an incident we just saw but they dont so theres a level of tension for them but not so much for us then the gun gets wrestled away a fight ensues a manic fight but cut beautifully and yet the chase is still technically underway with the vehicles off in the distancevery little of that and other scenes in the film need any dialog though characters do still speak going back to the road warrior was millers man with no name the ronin the dude who says little but is a big man of action when characters do talk there is humanity given even some dark humor nicholas hoults character is a good example of that but whats so mesmerizing and awesome about fury road is miller pushing the envelope even further and in a way correcting some things that he went with in beyond thunderdome the movie is bleak but not hopeless for the characters and theres barely a moment where the stakes arent super high even a moment that is relatively calm like yes trying to pull the tanker out muddy sand with another vehicle a ways behind firing a machine gun this way and that the drivers got blood in his eyes woops is kinetic and sensationaland throughout we see two things here that are refreshing a style of direction and editing where you can always tell whats going on which vehicle is in relation to the others evenespecially during these bugf crazy chases and this seems to be a welcome thing during an era where action movies are cut too fast and shot too close miller has a method of controlled mayhem and fiasco and so its a film with about 3000 shots and barely a one is wasted the other one is charlize theron its really her story  kind of like eli wallach in goodbadugly with as clint eastwood  and her performance is rough powerful sometimes stoic but also sometimes incredibly emotional and shes not afraid in the slightest to show vulnerability just as much as the courage and badassery its one of those woman action heroes and performances thatll be up there with the greatsmiller started in ozsploitation with the first movie and as the have gotten bigger in size and budget he hasnt lost the spirit of making things madcap from the gnarled vehicles and character designs to a man who plays guitar that shoots out flames while on top of a rig and drummers on the back why does this guy keep doing this well he loves it thats why if you can dig the idea of seeing that then you should dig seeing the whole thing it delivers compelling heroes nasty villains an unforgiving landscape and details thatll make you want to come back to see what you missed at 2 hours it almost feels like thats it and last but not least hardy is a fine new making his own of the role that previously got mel gibson his career kickstarted he may not have the same level of charisma as gibson perhaps but the devilish fun and cunning is still there the wild gunslinger who will kill you if he has to but would deep down rather not is there in hardy and i cant wait to see more of what he does with the role in future films,reality
this is one amazing action film from start to finish not only are the characters and the world interesting the film is filled with shear craziness the film is filled with great performances from tom hardy and charlize theron as well as nicolas hoult on top of that the practical effects are astounding the stunt work is also top notchthe film also makes you feel emotion for the characters as well which is such a rare feat in action films of recent yearsi literally can think of very little to disregard this film except for the basic story which you wont even be bothered by during this thrill ride of a filmgeorge miller has managed to craft his amazing world 30 years later with spectacular results its gritty gruesome and above all glorious910 a must see film,reality
im going to be honest and say that this movie was a complete waste of time every so often i wanted to check my watch i was left sitting there asking myself when is this movie going to be over unfortunately the movie had very little plot and was lacking in many features that are required for an entertaining movie was full of explosions car chases and thrilling graphics however thats all it had with no story line a confusing plot and no character development i highly recommend not seeing this movie honestly please dont waste your money even if you are a fan of the original films this is basically the entire plot line of the movieexplosions more explosions then car chase and one girl getting ran over while pregnantby a monster truck actually wasnt even a monster truck more like a tonka toy the best part of the entire movie was the endso dont tell me,reality
the first big problem with is that tom hardy really is not a star he has very little charisma he is no mel gibson next the character as written and portrayed is a bumbling shuffling fool the first 20 minutes he is a captive so does not do anything of old would never have been in this position the film is one long repetitive action chase sequence all done quite well but by the end you are just numbed the supporting cast especially charlize theron are all excellentin fact she is more than him for stretches of the film is almost an extra or a supporting character hardy never conveys any emotion or depth most of the time he looks confused at the start when he tries to escape its filmed like a keystone cops comedy from the silent era a loud overloaded but not with the right contents big big disappointment  yet again most critics have become blind fan boys,reality
being a big fan of the first two films i have been looking forward to fury road for years sadly as the end credits rolled i only felt relief that it was over the cinematography was beautiful the action scenes well done and everything had a glorious sense of momentum sadly these factors alone arent enough to make a good film where things really fell apart for me was the poor dialogue  lack of any character building the action was frantic but without investing any time in the characters it was essentially meaningless the few occasions where an attempt was made to create some emotion or character depth were woefully inept  even jarring at times it soon became clear that the film could only be enjoyed in terms of action but even that became too repetitive like an overblown never ending repetition of the final chase scene from 2the other really disappointing aspect was that hardy didnt make a great mel gibson played the part perfectly in the first two instalments  even when he was a burned out shell of a man he had a certain charisma  there were touching glimpses of his former warmth that was buried deep beneath the surface hardy on the other hand comes across as an unlikeable clumsy fool  barely says or does anything at all till far into the filmthe one saving grace was charlize theron as furiosa  somebody wrote in another review that she was more than this is most definitely the case she was the only character i cared remotely about  without her it would have been a real struggle to sit through the duration of the film i would suggest that if any further films are made they should focus on her character because hardys portrayal of has killed off any interest i had in what might happen to him next,reality
looking at all the praise fury road has been getting i am completely and utterly dumbfounded as to how so many people can be so blind me and a group of friends went to see this on the basis of so many people including critics praising it as a masterpiece or an awesome film instead fury road is a complete and utter disaster and certainly not worth the 12 me and my companions spent why you ask well for starters the film doesnt explain anythinhg to the audience yes obviously we know this takes place in postapocalyptic world and theres a guy named tom hardy whos trying to help a tough as nails driver named imperator furiosa charlize theron get a group of pretty female slaves away from some bad guy with a skull mask some sort of breathing apparatus and a deep voice sounds kind of cool except the film does a terrible job explaining a few things like who the hell is he his names immortan joe but we only know that from a few times his name is spoken why are some of his henchmen ghost white whats with them needing blood and why should we ultimately care whether our characters prevail against him or not the film has absolutely no character or story development what so ever and the movie moves so fast that almost nothing sinks in for example other than and furisoa i dont think i knew any of the characters names in this film much less develop any incentive to care whether they live or die me and my friends didnt feel any emotion from the characters predicament simply because there is no story or anything to care about all they seem to do is drive around the desert and fight bad guys thats it another fault is the fastpaced visions keeps seeing of his family who apparently died but its never explained how or why after a while the visions become annoying ridiculous and fail to really add anything to the overall picture its possible that the death of his family was explained in the previous films but i only saw bits and pieces of the first one and that was years ago the filmmakers seem to be operating on the assumption that everyone in the audience saw the previous films and thats an enormous mistake to make if they wanted to reestablish the character then actually do so by giving us a little background on him now with all that said the film did have some decent merits some of the car chases were pretty cool admittedly as were some of the vehicles themselves many of them looking badass and the woman used as the models arent bad to look at eitheras for acting tom hardy and charlize theron do a decent job acting wise though therons character seems to dominate the screen more than does and the film is named after him right these are the only reasons why im not giving the film a completely awful rating but flashy visuals and awesome explosions dont make a movie people if that were the case michael bay would be heralded as the greatest filmmaker of our time yes i know its an action film and you shouldnt go in expecting to see citizen kane however you need there to be some character development and plot even if its an action film folks and especially if the movie takes place in a fantasy or futuristic world to explain whats going on to really put things in perspective even the big cheesy 80s action films with guys like schwarzenegger jean claude van damme or steven seagal had far more character and story development than this did and id also like to state that not only did neither me or my companions like this but almost no one in the theater did either after the last scene cut there was complete and utter silence and i certainly didnt hear anyone praising it as we stepped outside in fact i overheard one guy saying if he could turn his regal card in for cash bottom line i love action films but i cant give thumbs up to a movie that doesnt give us any incentive to care about its story if youre looking for a decent film look someplace else and as for all those who are praising it just how much money did the studio pay you to say those things,reality
seeing most people either give this movie either a 1 or a 10 rating i decided to give a more nuanced view there is fun to be had with this movie even if you are an adult spectator providing 1 you watch this movie with some friends on a silly boozefilled night preferably after ingesting some recreational mindnumbing critical thought impairing and illegal chemicals 2 you want to show off your huge home theater setup and feel the need to create a seismic event 3 you have just watched a marathon of movies by lars von trier darren aronovskyingmar bergman or the dardenne brothers i am belgianbottom line this is a dumb movie with over the top action wooden acting sorry charlize onedimensional characters and zero importance unworthy of being called a movie,reality
just got back from watching fury road and i honestly dont understand how this movie is receiving such high approvals theirs almost literally no story here just a car chase that last 2 hours long filled with explosions blood fights and the typical hollywood formula for all actions movies the only thing worth mentioning is the cinematography which very good anyway this movie is a 7 at best because of visuals but story wise it got pointless and sometimes boring after the first 30 minutes dont usually post anything in here but just baffles me how people can put a film up there with some true gems the film industry has ever produced if this movie stays around the 89 rating or higher ill never trust this site again or any critic whose praising this film people need to stop being nostalgic about the 80s and the mel gibons films and see this film for what it really is i recommend people to save your money dont get carry away about the hype its way overrated,reality
i cant believe the reviews this movie is getting this was the most redundant movie i have ever seen it was pretty much the chase scene from road warrior  but it took up about 85 of the movie okay to watch but totally lacked any depth at all tom hardy didnt have any lines to remember since he pretty much didnt talk throughout the entire movie i give it a 65 at best the original and road warrior were far more intriguing for the last ten years the ratings on imdb were accurate and reliable but this past year i have had several highly rated movies that were extremely disappointing what is going on someone stuffing the ballot box,reality
it has been nearly 24 hours since i saw fury road and im still trying to recover it is the sort of film you forget to breathe through much like gravity or captain phillips but for an altogether different reason unrelenting from beginning to end this postapocalyptic saga is virtually one long explosive chase sequence albeit one which seemingly has new ideas on tap the action ie the whole film is utterly bonkers conceptually and in execution that writerdirector george miller and his team concocted such ferocious set pieces is impressive enough but being able to pull it off with extraordinarily daring stunt work  augmented by gritty cgi  is simply aweinspiringvisually it is vivid and spectacular the searing desert landscape offering a dirtfilled grime so tangible your throat will dry up within seconds whilst the vehicles are creative and wonderfully preposterous the heartpounding score by junkie xl in which he blends orchestral and heavy metal music accompanies millers on screen splendour to create a visceral experience for both the eyes and the ears the vehicular carnage may be the drawcard but the committed cast elevate the overall product tom hardy is savage as charlize theron is compelling as imperator furiosa and nicholas hoult is gonzo as nux whilst a plethora of recognisable aussies show up in deranged cameostheres an intensity here you just dont find in majority of the bigbudgeted blockbusters an inventiveness in all elements that drives this movie from great to mesmerizing miller hasnt played in the world since the dreadful beyond thunderdome back in 1985 but by god he has redeemed himself and then some fury road is a rollicking ride that carves out a piece of cinematic history all for itself in short it is a grungy masterpiece,reality
i was lucky enough to go to the premierethey took our phones off us at the door last night and all i have to say is wow  i watch 1  2 on a fairly regular basis and i will be honest i wasnt sure that george miller could still deliver a movie worthy of not only did he deliver a movie that was worthy of he delivered a movie that was so far beyond my expectations for this movie fury road has to be one of the best action movies i have ever seen the action sequences are just phenomenal and amazing in the fact that most of it was real and not cgi the cars and characters are just amazing and as insane as they should be in the post apocalyptic world of and the scenery is both beautiful and cruel tom hardy was a good choice as charlize theron was amazing as furiosa but for me the standout performance was from nicholas hoult as nux fury road is a must see movie a must see in a cinema movie,reality
no spoiler alert necessary here the synopsis on this site tells you all you need to know about the general story the action is non stop which means that about a third the way through it i was bored because it was just over and over and over with the same old stuff impossible stunts  poor graphics ineffectual characters and the worst thing is that i really wanted to like it it made a bunch of money though and whilst crap makes money craps all well get why is a reboot or a sequel made decades after the original with a massively higher budget and more tech generally worse than the original maybe because in lieu of the issues above they had to cast well write well and develop characters we cared about give this a miss  most video games will satisfy your need for action and will have more character,reality
i hate watching movies that are not 10 or 910 but this was not much of my doing and it certainly lived up to any thoughts that i had about it before seeing it that is not to say i watched the film with a head full of preconceived notions no i was ready to watch a film that was a valuable continuation of the superb moviei readily give credence where it is due with a film of such explosive force that simply does not stop until the very end one need only look at the credits here on imdb to see the creativity and work that went into this film but for me it was not enough i could admire the work that went into creating the extraordinary cinematography but as for holding my interest it provided nothing beyond excellent makeup and action sequences if that is what you want in a contemporary movie so be it i am sorry i watched it though,reality
i honestly made an account specifically so i could write a review on this movie i would give it a 1810375930102974920194858920 out of 10 if i could there are a few snobby critics that honestly are a bit too critical dont listen to them if you love fire blood action creepy creatures guns and gore this is honestly the most amazing movie youll ever see ever i am a massive movie addict and am pretty picky typically but this movie is by far my favorite movie ive seen in years i left the theater wanting more and more and havent stopped thinking about it since yes there isnt an insane totally incredible storyline but i didnt even care yes there are prolonged action scenes pretty much the entire movie but its freaking amazing i am a makeup artist and blogger and have done a few fury road inspired makeup looks the crust punk edgy gory gorgeous feel is just astounding being artistic like myself i was seriously baffled by how amazing the whole look and feel of the film was the makeup was incredible the cinematography was amazing the colors were so dark yet vibrant i thought the acting was awesome tom hardy grunts a lot and doesnt talk too much but i think that added to the whole effect nux is the craziest little awesome thing ever the guitar playing thing most eerie creepy incredible thing ever theres quite a lot of dark humor in this film so if you arent into dark dry humor creepy frightening creature things and you hate blood and crazy awesome action then yeah this wont be the film for you but if you just enjoy a stinking amazing gory creepy kick butt movie from time to time you need in your life basically im counting the days until the next one comes out because im obsessed i actually think the term obsessed doesnt even express my love for this movie take a chance see it yourself because i highly doubt youll regret it i am a major superhero and scary movie fanatic and this topped every movie ive seen in years that says a lot for me my husband said the same thing and hes quite the movie snob as well i wont stop recommending this movie to people because i just think its stinking amazing see it love it and itll be such a lovely day  just thank me later babes,reality
the movie is good but i think it suffers from a couple of major problemsone problem is that the main character is too weak if there is anyone taking the lead it is definitely charlize theron is completely shadowed by other characters even secondary onesanother problem is the action is dull and repetitive doing very little to carry the action forward this is also the case in fast and furious but in this case this is explicit and it is what the audience is expecting the content of this movie including action that actually moves the story forward would probably take no more than 30 min all the rest is just show though a beautiful onethe design and scenography are brilliant no question about it but i think that for example the design in zack snyders 300 is more coherent and a better contribution to the overall experience the story in 300 is clearer and simpler and every element and action scene makes it move forward in a clear way this is not the case here characters in this are empty shells simple stereotypes with little content mere puppets in a grandiose artsy atmosphere with no inner lifemost of the action is completely reactive with the characters in pure survival mode very rarely demonstrating anything of their inner self and their back story i am all for not being spoon fed the back story and against talking heads describing their background in lengthy dialogs but this movie suffers from the opposite problem only very rarely did suffered from flashes quite literally from his previous life but it felt really completely out of touch with anythingin the end i didnt regret watching the movie specially in the cinema but it really felt a bit short at home i dont think i would recommend unless you watch in a very large tv,reality
ok i went into this movie because of the crazy high rating of the movie and the masterpiece reviews but it turned out to be far from any piece a master would craft was the crew paying critics to leave good reviews this whole tricked by imdb rating and checking out a movie leads me now to distrust the ratings here altogether for new launchesthere are many good things in this movie and these are things like action sequences makeup vehicles stunts acting but after 10 minutes of watching this gasolineadrenaline junkie trip you are asking yourself what is this all for this does not make any sense which is the main issue i have with this movie and i am simply perplexed about so many critics overlook this obvious issue this is far from a masterpiece as it does not ask or answer any questions which are somewhat related to real life the first sentence you will hear in this movie will be the whole story element after that you get just one action sequence after another with minor pauses and last but not least why is even in this movie because he just does some minor jobs and the real hero here is imperator furiosa this should be the name of the movie by the waythis movie does not justify the high rating it has been given now,reality
ok so again ive felt compelled to do a review as i cant understand why so many are giving this a 1010 rating the movie was stunning to look at but something was missing for me i guess thats what you get from a movie thats as fast paced as this one cant really give much away in terms as spoilers as nothing much really happened there was a chase for two hours lots of explosions no real suspense no twists no character development they defeat their pursuers and get to where theyre going and the movie endsgo see if if you want something stunning to look at but if you need some brain candy id maybe give it a miss,reality
quickie reviewthe world as we know it no longer exists turned into an endless scorching desert where every drop of water and fuel is precious enough to kill for furiosa charlize theron rebels against the oppression of immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne by aiding in the escape of his wives she comes across tom hardy a mystery man who needs furiosa just as much as she needs him in their quest for survival fury road is one of the most mindblowing insane action movies in recent years by relying on mostly practical stunts there is a real sense of danger tension excitement and awe with every explosion flip and wreck of the cars more surprisingly there is heart behind the action thanks to the welldeveloped characters beautiful chaos is a sight to behold and must be experienced on the big screenfull reviewi have never seen the original movies i just never got around to watching them since this was a reboot of sorts there is no need to watch them and i wanted to go into the movie fresh so this review comes from someone with no prior knowledge of the franchise short of it i loved itthe thing that people will be talking about after the movie ends is the action this is action like you have never seen before cgi is only used when it is absolutely needed and the other 90 of the time it is real cars crashing and flipping in every way they can the chase scenes are breath taking and heart pounding and i mean that literally after the first action sequence ended i had to remind myself to exhale because i felt like i was holding my breath in awe for the entire scene when another sequence ended i checked my pulse i dont know the exact beats per minute but it felt like i just came off the treadmill after 15mins of running like i said is beautiful chaos but because of the great shot composition there is sense in the chaos i never felt lost i always knew what was going on despite the frantic nature of the scenes that is why you will fully appreciate all the effort put into filming this movieone of the things i was most nervous about from the trailers was the world of i feared that everything would be so crazy like the flamethrower guitarist on a truck that itd be too distracting however the world is so wellconceived and well realised by director george miller that even the most insane things make sense in that context yes that includes the flamethrower guitarist he was awesome additionally the cinematography and soundtrack brought a much grander scale to an otherwise simple storybehind all the visuals though there is a level of depth to the movie that i did not anticipate the best character of the movie by far is charlize therons furiosa even with her disability she is incredibly strong willed and determined to finish her mission after all she carries a lot of the emotional consequences if she were to fail and so i was really invested in her story in a genre dominated by male actors it is refreshing to see a compelling female character such as furiosa and we need more of them in hollywood then there is also nicholas hoult as nux who had a great story arc i was surprised how much i empathised with his character you might be wondering why i havent talked about yet in a movie called well thats simply because he is not really the central character dont get me wrong he has a major role in the movie and tom hardy plays a convincing hardened hero nevertheless this is mostly a furiosa centric story that may be a complaint for some that shouldve been the focus and i can see their reasoning the way i understood it was that this film is one of many stories or legends in this world where a mystery man plays an important part in helping our heroes succeed in that sense the way character was handled was fittingwe are only half way through this decade and already ill call it is the best action movie of this decade the very least top 5 i have a strong feeling that fury road will be a classic decades from now i cannot stress this enough you absolutely have to watch this on the big screen iif possible you are robbing yourself of a truly unique visceral experience if you miss this one the only person i wouldnt recommend this movie to is someone with a heart condition because it might get too intensecheck out more on my movie review blog the stub collector httpthestubcollectorwordpresscom,reality
what a shame thats all i could say as i left the cinema thursday night after attending the first showing before i start my review for this film id like to share my thoughts on the first three as they were an integral part of my childhood and hold some nostalgic reverence for me as an adult is a film i dont particularly care for as i find it a bit too downbeat and low budget for my taste its also visually different from the other three films as it takes place in a vast country wasteland where as the others take place in dessert locals that give off a more grand scope thats severely lacking in the first film the first film also lacks any iconic action scenes or a memorable villain that would become a trademark in the later films the road warrior is a film i enjoy immensely and dont really have much else to add that hasnt already been said by everyone over the last 34 years beyond thunderdome is a film i find disjointed the one hand all the scenes directed by george miller are amazing and well done the thunderdome fight still one of the greatest in cinema history and the end chase sequence are exciting and hint at the great film it could have been had he directed the whole movie the rest of the film however featuring the lost children and anything to do with the people of bartertown and their politics is just annoying and slows the movie down to a crawl the tina turner song we dont need another hero however is classic and one of my favorite songs of all time so now we come to fury road a film ive been looking forward too ever since i saw the first trailer that premiered at comic con last summer the trailer made the film look epic and visually stunning featuring things we had never seen before on film months i waited for its release and with each day drawing closer and closer my anticipation grew cut to earlier this week as the reviews from many professional film critic outlets came pouring in they were declaring this film to be a masterpiece and one of the greatest action movies of all time i couldnt believe what i was hearing and waited with baited breath to see it on thursday night skip to 2 hours and change later and even now as i type this several days later what the hell is everybody raving about seriously im as perplexed by all this as other negative reviewers are this solidifies my thinking that film critics are irrelevant and dont know what theyre talking about same goes for rotten tomatoes a site i wont ever be going on again theyre a joke back to the film though im still trying to figure out how something that looked so groundbreaking and revolutionary from the marketing become so boring and uninvolving as you sit down and watch it in the theater the answer the story sucks oh wait i forgot there was no story just a bunch of chasing and then more chasing followed by more chasing before we take a detour in the second act where our characters literally do nothing but sit around at night contemplating about the situation theyre in and how they intend to get out of it for 30 straight minutes this section slows the movie down to a terence malick sized crawl as we the audience become restless hoping for something to happen soon and happen quick the cast is also disappointing with tom hardy being a poor imitator of mel gibson its not entirely his fault though as he isnt really the main character thats right hardly does anything in this movie yes he beats some people up and gets involved in some of the action however hes merely taking orders from charlize therons character and just seems completely uninterested in everything that goes on around him theron is fine in the movie but again is given little to work with as for the other females theyre not even worth talking about as they barely leave an impression on the audience and are not developed in the slightest the villain was cool to look at but again underutilized and nonthreatening the movies looks nice and is fairly well directed by george miller but has a feeling of a been there done that feel that indicated that george miller was only interested in creating cool visuals to distract us from his shitty script movies need more than pretty pictures to keep us engaged we need strong characters and story to make us wanna come back and watch a film over and over which this film fails to do so in ending this review i want to say to all the masses out there praising this to the heavens that you really should ask for more from your movies because if this is what we accept now as good films than cinema is dead my friends in closing i thought this film was pretty disappointing and now has made me sworn off from seeing anymore films in the future so no i dont recommend this film if u half to see it wait for redbox and watch the first 30 minutes which admittedly are great but be forewarned it all goes downhill after that thanks for reading my review,reality
i can not hide my disappointment after watching the reboot of the classic compared to the first original is miles away compared with road warrior pt2its kind of in a different league its on par with thunderdome road warrior had an amazing story a goal a redemption boomerang scenefantastic twist wez the crazy character and humungus fury road is lacking all this heck is like a comain actor with furiosa and the story drive there drive back one way through the canyon uturn i mean whats the point i asked myself hardy as is ok but this role is owned by gibson after watching 2 in 1982 i almost died on my bicycle i was so pumped up after watching fury road i almost got a parking ticket how slow was i driving disappointed very very disappointed,reality
i love the summer blockbuster they are movies that i look forward to years in advance and i anticipate each opening with excitement same goes for fury road unfortunately that excitement didnt last long true the action was top notch and the scope was epic but there were a few key ingredients lackingas you can tell from my first sentence i have seen my fair share of michael bay movies and although i do like his movies i understand some of the beef that goes along with them but what i dont understand is how his movies get criticized so heavily for lack of story or plot or character development or for having too many explosions etc etc when quite frankly fury road had far less story than any michael bay movie and far less character development as well the explosions well they were just as abundant and epic as any transformers movie yet everyone seems to praise fury roadfirst of all this movie shouldve been called furious furiosa furiosa road she was clearly the main character and quite frankly the only character in the movie that was worth routing for because she was the only character that had a purpose and a direction and somewhat of a backstory was nonexistent mostly and when he was needed failed to impressnicholas hoult was very good as nux but still his characters motivation wasnt clear and his lack of backstory or development made me not care if he lived or died or if he joined the good guys or notthe villains were pretty cool but there were some instances that made it seem like the different groups would be against each other but then were teaming up without any reason giventhere were some memorable scenes like the sandstorm scene and the guitar player was awesome all in all this movie was average at best and a lot of hype for a story that was one long literal uturn if you like minimal plot and character development explosions and dirty people being chased by even dirtier people than this movie is for you maybe i am not too proud to admit that i like movies with minimal plot and character development and explosions myself but i still couldnt get into this movie perhaps the hype surrounding it ruined it for me as i did see this on sunday and many people already showered it with praises someone close to me even said it was better than avengers aou so i guess my expectations may have been a little too high set your expectations to a reasonable degree before sitting through two hours of one long chase scene,reality
two of my favourite screen stars in tom hardy and charlize theron have really disappointed me in being involved in this film i loved the earlier movies and was so looking forward to seeing this it is beautifully filmed and the design is awesome but ultimately has nothing of substance about it the first hour or so is almost all action which after the first 10 minutes start to bore the viewer no matter how stylishly it has been staged though there is little dialogue what there is is difficult to understand as everyone seems to be shouting as loud as they can to be heard over the machines all style and no real substance how and why on earth would anyone play a guitar in a war chase for goodness sake,reality
seriously you want to see a twohour movie that has no story only action in the first minutes of the film began action jeo immortal declared war are just effects and dialogue that has no place in a movie not see anyone talking only go by car only to stop a tordirectory put too many effects and staying in ester that joe is immortal master of men give water to each take after declaring war to steal a shooting water and beautiful women the film needs a story i realize this is scifi but it let easier with scifi i want to see more story not too inspired he believes the film only needs action  there are only continuations of older movie i had something in my head if all is a parallel world to be a kind of portal ince two worlds the real world and one of them and i still do not understand what search people there and working for that i do not like i sit to watch everything i could be wrong i like just an hour of film just action and do not see phase scifi only cars are different and so let me down 20 50 for dialogue and action,reality
i love action movies that dont try to be smart i like roadcentric action scenes car chases or even roadcentric action movies death race fast  furiousyet i got really bored with this one the back story is too improbable and clich and the whole movie plot is weakworse the action scenes become really repetitive quicklyi guess its to be expected if youve seen the previous movies  i haventi still give it a five because the movie moved at as satisfying pace and is still mildly entertaining probably funnier if youre having a laugh at it with friends while you watch i wish i had done that,reality
im ok with the idea of doing a pure action dialogfree movie but even that extreme action has to make sense the movie has three parts the escape the return and the ending the first 30 minutes are great the atmosphere the cars the costumes the sand storm the pursuit the action then comes the return and the movie faints till the end showing more of the same only this time the cars costumes pursuit and action dont make any sense and finally comes the end which to put it short it simply a crap score should be less but since the flame guitarist was so awesome it gets a 6,reality
bring on the haterswell i finally watched fury road the other day and i thought it was sht not really but it should not have had the label it was a great movie as post apocalyptic movies go it was not a movie the acting by tom hardy was pitiful and his character was a waste of air time he probably spoke less than 50 words throughout the whole movie and then was hard to understand the most he spoke was at the beginning before the credits rolled in charlize theron on the other hand was excellent and she should have had top billing seriously the movie should have been called ine the character nux played by nicholas hoult was fantastic and i loved it hugh keaysbyrne also did an impressive job as immortan joe overall it was a good movie but not the genre of i give it 4 out of 10 as a movie but as far as a post apocalyptic action movie i would give it an 8 out of 10 if they removed tom hardy and called it ine,reality
its probably a given to not expect much in the way of dialogue from this kind of a movie however where there is dialogue it would be nice if it was delivered by the actors and the director so that it is not totally wooden its not the stars that fail to deliver its the supporting actors they sound like they have never ever had any training the visuals are great the scenery is stunning the plot is nonexistent but whoever went to see for the plot its all post apocalyptic road rage with lots of mutant humanoids right if you want ultra violence no dialogue and lots of action you might consider john wick instead at least all of the supporting actors talk believably,reality
at first i must say that i only watched about 45 minutes of this movie because it was so boring that i had to leave so please forgive me if i missed anything important but after 3 original movies this one was big disappointment no conversation just action demolition and car chase no story behind the plot no background no connection with characters just u bunch of special effects which were amazing i must admit i am a big fan of original movies and went to see this piece hoping it will live up to its predecessors but like i said i left after 45 minutes the role charlize played could have been played by any actress nothing special and tom hardy had a mask on its face again this reminds me of betman another role of him that anyone else could play anyway a very dark film i will avoid any future films of this director,reality
what has happened to the blockbusters of the recent decade there is no doubt that above all other options the audience should be entertained but to what extent is it worth to provide absurd entertainment aimlessly and without any story fury road is as frivolous as 1920s slapstick comedies except that these comedies are assessed justifiable as they have been made at the emergence of cinema however such idiotism that hitting and banging the whole 2 hours is strange in 2015 is storyless and there is no plan to involve the audience in events by drama too amateur illustrations that are tried to seem professional and rigorous so what is the role of misenscene on what basis has it been arranged that do not help the story promote fury road does not have necessary standards for being a movie at all and this is the outcome of cinephilia attitude that grabs cine academia aspects of the movie and presents inane scenes scenes that stems in illiteracy of the movie maker the movie characters are infirm and unproductive when a newcomer who has not meet previous versions of watch this one asks who is why does not he talk in order to help the backstory enhance the narration who is the bad man of the movie what has changed him into such a bloodthirsty monster what is the purpose of the story what is the relationship between water poverty and the movie narration and more important has george miller thought of anything other than burning shooting and rock music cinema is a medium to state through scenes fury road may gross a lot and receive many awards but it is a premovie and a disaster and if it is placed in 10bestmovies list of many critics is because of the discreet charm of cinephilia,reality
this movie starred the reavers from joss whedons firefly tv show that show is so awesome and the serenity movie the movie is so wonderful and the jungle guys from peter jacksons king kong that movie is so wacky and they race across the desertand they race to one end of the desert that took one hour and then to the other end that took another hourand then the movie was over which was awesome because i hate chase scenes which is what this race was and i hated this movie it was stupid i dont have any idea why this movie has garnered such positive reviewsi will mention that charlize theron looked wonderful those eyes surrounded by black paint and tom hardy looked pretty good too and nick hoult was in it as a slavering fool normally hes adorable like in jack the giant killer or in warm bodies when hes a zombie who realizes something terrible has happened to him but none of them had that many lines they were too busy chasing and racing to talk,reality
man this movie really sucks the reviews this movie gets are really from an other world you might enjoy this if and only if you truly love car chases otherwise its a real stinker no story no character development no logic only lots and lots of chasing cars fury road is just a long meaningless chase toped with plenty of stupid action scenes although i do admit that the cgis are great and you gotta love the neversleepcrazy guitarguy and charlize is as beautiful and excellent as usual but a two hour movie really needs some kind of a interesting story fury road lacks any kind of story i give it 310 mostly cause i love charlize,reality
absolutely amazing perfect from start to finish i very rarely give a film a 1010 cant even remember the last time i did but this was a 1010 definitely the best film of 2015 so far i would also definitely recommend paying the extra few pounds to go and see it in 3d ia few pounds well spent the experience will blow you away going back the ito see it again tonight it was that good i really hope george miller wants to do another one tom hardy and charlize theron were fantastic storyline was brilliant the cars were mental this film is one of the best films ive ever seen cant praise it enough great to see hugh keysbyrne in there too as immorten joesame actor who played the toecutter in 1 1979,reality
first of all to put into context this doesnt have much to do with the mel gibson ones like those 3 were different and can stand alone this one is no exception i saw 2 the road warrior just the night before seeing fury road just general things in common nothing too specificanyway i saw the trailers and they looked amazing but to be honest nothing can prepare you for the movie itself you know those avengers trailers where all the good jokes and dialogs are in the trailer this is not the case yes it is an action movie but an action movie like i never saw the human side is as important as the actionfury road its over the top makes you cringe sometimes especially when you see some of the characters its absurd its insane and  its pure movie experiencethis movie is not based on reality does not want to feel real it does want to feel over the top fantasy like for me it works because when i go to the movies i want to see art not a documentary like movie so just thank you mr miller,reality
this movie did absolutely nothing for me i couldnt keep track of the storyline and the action was not what im interested in i can see why others would love this flick but its just not for me,reality
fury road theres a reason i dont go and see hollywood blockbuster action films thought id give this a try due to the almost unanimously positive reviews and liking tom hardy note to self  dont listen to reviews utterly dull couldnt tell you any plot  just boom boom boom bish bash bosh okay if you like that sort of thing  i dont 1 out of ten,reality
where was exactly i thought this would be a reboot of the genre instead it was theron and a guy called absolute rubbish started nowhere literally and swiftly vanished back into that horizon if you loved the original dont watch this,reality
i have no words to describe how good this movie is you juet have to watch it,reality
i totally love cinemas action genre always going easy on it when the latest movie first came out i was pretty disappointed in it then all the acclaim and awards started pouring in is film dead did i just have a bad day i rewatched it and my initial thoughts have been reaffirmed the 110 im giving this is just a bid for this overall rating to lower otherwise id be giving this 510it made sense for a movie to be made now because of the massive upgrades in computer technology that and it seemed like a nice cash grab after all the movie does have a better overall look than the three previous instalments thats really about it in terms of what this movie has thats better than the othersfury road is not about anything the characters are flatter than paper and the story stays in one spot throughout the whole thing all it is is people driving in the desert with occasional explosions the audience is expected the care about these characters just because with underdeveloped characters why should we care it is super rare when we care about an underdeveloped character in saving private ryan giovanni ribisis character was underdeveloped but we felt tremendous remorse upon his death nothing that smart ever happens in thisfor readers sake i will try to give a good summary of the plot it is after the apocalypse obviously the human race is being enslaved obviously by the new leader who is actually cool looking who has many funny halfnaked uncle festers now played by tom hardy is like a stuffed animal in front of a car and the uncle festers try to capture an escaped charlize theron so thats it theres really nothing more it it than thatone good aspect of the film is the cool images the uncle festers although cornier than their 80s counterparts actually do look cool theres one fester with a sewn chelsea grin that i liked the lord guy is pretty awesome and the frequent use of the skull logo is pretty badass but not all of these are perfect theres a guitar player on the front of a car that plays and shoots fire while the battles happen but theres no point in him other than to look cool the fire that shoots out of his guitar dont do anything some cars have tons of spikes that look cool but they all explode right away theres no point in having these images other than to look coolthere have been several analysiss about the movies depiction of survival and feminism every movie ever made has themes fury roads use of them are unoriginal and uninspiredon the whole fury road is a subpar action movie that is not one of the best action films ever like so many people say it is literally just driving with occasional explosions and shootings i knew this would find an audience like early chuck norris and van damme films did but the critical acclaim and commercial success this has received is horrible do yourself a favour and just skip this24,reality
i was told that fury road has had excellent reviews although an early one that i saw gave it only two stars i can see why its a vast empty road with a desert at its heart when the end credits rolled the wacky names of characters hinted at a more enjoyable movie but like the 300 and other heavily stylized action movies i was just left with a headache and the frenetic editing makes crank ii look like the bridges of madison countytheres plenty to watch on screen and some sly nods to star wars dark crystal of all things and the cars that ate paris but barely emerges as a character in this version he really does have mental health problems and is hardly heroic as for the rest of the cast their appearance has to do much of the work of characterization as this is a film where punches hackings and gun fire serve instead of dialogue explosions are the new social networkan early shot lines up pursuing cars as if they were entrants in that old cartoon series wacky races but theres nothing as fun as that here the post apocalyptic desert world is well realized but even in the future aborigines have been marginalized i got the impression that white australian audiences just dont want to have to look at them or perhaps hope nuclear war will resolve any lingering problems from colonialismunbelievably actually all too believably a blogger has ranted that fury road is a leftist feminist plot on behalf of hollywood the blogger burbles this is the trojan horse feminists and hollywood leftists will use to vainly insist on the trope women are equal to men in all things including physique strength and logic and this is the subterfuge they will use to blur the lines between masculinity and femininity further ruining women for men and men for womeni can barely understand the reasoning here women and men only exist for each other equality ruins men and women but the fact is that fury roads depiction of women conforms to number of established types and rarely strays from soft porn imagery of virginal hotties gun toting babes and nurturing mothers the audience laughed at an amusing scene where looks up from the dusty desert floor to see a group of young scantly clad women hosing themselves down it is all very knowing but is knowing sexism any different from actual sexism anyway the women are needed here because like the female gladiators in gladiator they stop the whole film becoming madly homoeroticthe film is excellently designed drawing on top brit pop cartoonist brendan mccarthy who produced a brilliant run of covers for shade the changing man and the fably rogan ghosh a dimension spanning hindu deity cum jerry cornelius figure who exuberantly captured sci fis new wave for the nineties in a way the current craze for steam punk doesntthe trouble is fury road is so highly stylized so frenetic it just left me cold frankly two stars seems just about right but ill give it three just to be generous,reality
first of all if there is anything i hated its the story line now the proper question would be dude what story line and youre goddamn right the nonexistent one fck this movie secondly theres still no fcking story line how does one make a movie without a story this is bad on another level i swear that this is the first and the only movie where i cannot pinpoint one single positive thing do not watch thank me later,reality

once upon a time someone came to us the audience with a problem we inquired as to source of their distress we were then told they go fast a harmonized gasp sounded through the audience how do we fix this problem we asked the answer was simple go faster we applauded enthusiastically and a franchise was born we called it post apocalyptic fast  furiousthen someone told us the title was too long and probably copyrighted by now being that fast  furious was planning to make 9336 movies with the exact same idea we had to change it so we kept the fury because boy is it an angry movie and slapped road on it to discretely let the general public know the movies about carswhat dyou wanna see tnight johnny i dont know pop oh how about the one with cars johnny gee pop i hope it doesnt focus too much on plotyour wish is my commandit was a very hallow movie people if you could even call it a movie it was a loathsome attempt to win over the hearts of popculture as it so happens popculture was indeed looking for a terrible movie with great effects lucky you  this was a bad movie people enjoy because it doesnt make them think they can sit in the theater for two hours dribbling over high fructose corn syrup and worry about nothing beyond the flashy lightsit was unanimous soooo pretty oooooooo,reality
i have to say that i tried really hard to like this but my old fashioned there needs to be a story and interesting characters mode took over it took about fifteen minutes to figure out who was who apparently the guy with the death mask and the tubes was seen as a god that there was some religious following could be interesting i guess but what follows is one chase after another with every conceivable vehicle that some guy could dream up there were porcupine cars monster trucks guys on poles dropping into vehicles there was no logic presented as to why one vehicle would have a spear thing thrown at it and explode while others were hit with heavy artillery and seemed to move on just fine then we have who is a captive with a mask that looks like a 1955 oldsmobile grill he is put on the front of a vehicle as all this combat goes on unfortunately he has absolutely no personality whatsoever there was never any suspense in this film because the place they were trying to get to was never really in our minds eye then theres the short crop haired female which seems to be a standard these days make her look masculine and she becomes more formidable anyway it is spectacular to look at but when it was over i felt no emotion or satisfaction at all,reality
oh what a day what a lovely day i am a fan having seen the three films at age of eleven i adored the films in all their weird and actionpacked glory and they have only gotten better with age george miller was very clever in not doing the reboot a remake of revealing how rockantasky became the road warrior george miller decided that the reboot will take place in the post apocalyptic australia years after the new lost his family because he did not wish to do a remake or retell the story that had already been told and had wanted to update the universe and the wasteland and wanted new movie goers to remember as a man with nothing to lose after losing his family i see fury road as a pseudo sequel to road warrior and it has the quality of such over 80 of the effects seen in the film are real practical effects stunts makeup and sets the action and production design is easily among the top using that visual frame of reference miller is able to use the action not just to have cool moments and move the story forward but also add to the great character work done within the action scenes the characters are defined informed and developed by the actions that they take without having the need to announce what they learn or spell out how they feel to the audience its all in what miller is able to capture on camera with the help of cinematographer john seale delivering oscarcalibre work people is calling the film ine femmy road aka feminist utterly trash that is a load of rubbish charlize theron is perfect as furiosa always had powerful females in we have an old women holds up an entire gang with a shotgun in road warrior the warrior woman stabbing blocks and killing them all day long and in beyond thunderdome tina turner took control of an entire town and created the thunder dome get familiar with the old movies before freaking out about the new one i dislike tom hardy but his excellent as hugh keaysbyrne toecutter in as immortan joe is perfect he was brilliant his voice was extremely menacing and was portrayed as godlike what i mean by that is he is worshipped by all as a god what made him even more menacing is that if he caught up to only your imagination could describe what he would of done,reality
after about a decade of will itwont it production weve finally been given another movie is it a sequel or a reboot well kind of both really its the same universe but everything feels fresher and updated there are inconsistencies in the timeline regarding previous films but this isnt really anything new for the franchise everyone who had seen it before i did told me that i wouldnt have to see the previous films to get it but as soon as the revs of v8 engines start roaring when the film starts and immediately is thrust into a world of poop i feel that the movie assumes you know who is and are familiar with his mythology so if you havent seen the original trilogy and want to watch fury road i suggest you catch up first if not for the sake of familiarising yourself with the world of then watch them simply for the fact that they are undeniably awesome wellthe first two at leastyes miller has finally returned after his famous postapocalypse world after some oddlyvaried projects such as babe pig in the city andum two happy feet flicks this time however mel gibson stays at home his replacement tom hardy is one of my favourite actors of the current generation so i waited eagerly to see how he would fare as rockatansky after seeing the movie once in the cinema i can say that he does a satisfactory job hardy wasnt great but he wasnt bad either at times he looked unsure of himself and didnt seem to nail down a consistent accent instead bringing along a variation of his bane and jack bondurant and he often had a blank  sometimes comical  confused look on his face during the quieter scenes in fury road oh well  not everyones as charismatic as mel i think the best thing that can happen for hardy in regards to the franchise is more sequels so we can adjust to him playing the iconic roleits hard to believe that this action film is directed by a 70 year old it has a hyperkinetic energy and thrillingly outlandish pace to it that never lets go until the credits starts rolling miller has steamrolled his way into the 21st century and hes put most of the other films within this genre to shame if theres anyone who thinks that movies like the dark knight rises and fast and furious 7 have brilliant action scenes fury road is an obligatory watchfury road isnt like made in the same style as the previous films the colour palate is very vivid which make the action scenes 80 of which were practical you know look very bright in contrast to the bleak look of most postapocalypse films its also the first movie to be shot digitally but thats not as doom and gloom as it sounds  some of the shots in this like a particularly outstanding one of the camera moves down to the ground from a horizontal position as a speeding car runs over it would not have been achieved had the movie been made with film camerasafter a quick opening chase with a v8 interceptor cameo is captured and taken to the citadel to become a bloodbag  a delightfully disgusting invention by miller and co which involves the bloodbag being caged and strung up upside own with his blood being squeezed out through a tube and being provided to a half life war boy called nux who is suffering from some sort of cancer inflicted by the harsh environment the citadel is run my now favourite baddie of the universe immortan joe a ruthless and hideous masked dictator who holds a tight grip over the natural resources mainly water that are available in doing so he maintains a tight grip over the ill and diseasedridden population of the citadel and has assured those who follow him with enter valhalla the promised land during the course of imprisonment furiosa played by charlize theorn a rigdriverof joesturnedrogueforreasonsnotentirelyexplainedbutthen againnotreallynessecary kidnaps immortan joes wives who are implied to be sex slaves long story short  they run he chases nux follows with strapped to the front of his car escapes teams up with furiosa and what follows is a glorious featurelength crash bang wallop vehicle chase and thats the story in balamory,reality
having never laid my eyes on a film before watching fury road was something of a new experience for sure looking at the trailer i got the feeling that beautifully choreographed action and car chases were what i should expectand thats precisely what i got its inherently overthetop and the attempts at serious storytelling come across as afterthoughts but the action more than makes up for itwere immediately introduced to standing on a cliff overlooking an endless wasteland through some wonderfully rapidfire editing we get that hes constantly confronted with flashbacks from his tragic past a past in which he failed to protect his family he tells us hes become a man reduced to a single instinct survive hes captured by immortan joes forces who controls the local water supply and therefore controls the local population when hes strapped onto a car of a group of joes forces preparing to raid a neighboring village for gasoline imperator furiosa is one of the drivers she has plans of her own however shes taken joes daughters who were very much willing to go with her mind you and stuffed them in her truck she plans to go to her hometown before you know it she and have formed an unlikely pair each seeking redemption in their own waylike i said the storys quite basic and this is something directorwriter millers fully aware of as well labeling it simply a western on wheels having failed to protect his family now finds an opportunity to protect furiosa and company and in so doing find peace of mind furiosa seeks peace of mind as well believing shell find it in her hometown all the way across the desert and furiosas leap from unwilling team to brothersinarms is well done but some of the attempts at drama are a bit overdone after one plot twist the music swells as furiosa drops to her knees and yells at the sky all thats missing is her defiantly raising her arms aloft  la platoon and shouting nooo i get that complaining about a film being over the top is a bit redundant but i cant help but admit that these attempts at drama just dont make the impact theyre supposed to however i did like flashbacks they were well edited the imagery coming at you at a hundred miles per hour they werent just visually pleasing but they took little time away from the films main attraction actionneedless to say action is where fury road truly shines most of it takes place on the open road thankfully much of it looksand feelsincredibly realistic even when guys are using long poles to leap from one car to the nextand thats a tame stunt by fury roads standards the film also injects plenty of wellplaced humor into the proceedings as well and im not talking about any of those ridiculous i didnt sign up for this comments made by passersby and so on im talking a truck that has countless speakers strapped on to them including a man rocking out on his electric guitar like theres no tomorrow im talking countless cars crashing into each other and having the aforementioned guitar flying towards the camera in slo mo the list goes oneven though fans have had to wait roughly three decades for the fourth entry in the franchise it definitely seems like the wait was worth it some of the drama doesnt resonate at all but with action this entertaining who even cares,reality
the movie i couldnt take more than twenty minutes of the 1 and 2 second cuts before i could recognize what i was looking at it cut to something else and before i could sort out what i was looking at it cut again if youre over 14 this will drive you crazy3d not veryit would seem the theory is if you have enough explosions and crashes you dont need actingthe delivery dark grainy fuzzy i get a much better picture on my home tv this video delivery is a waste of time the excess volume will destroy your hearing1250 for two hours of eye strain and auditory abuse noi left after twenty minutes and got a refundthe movies are dead,reality
lets spend millions on remaking an iconic film why  well you just cant have enough post apocalypse in australia movies now can you  as usual we let mainstream film making off the hook again with its we have no more ideas but hey we can blow things up better these days approach i really believe they would love to just remake the same films over all the time just make us live our movie loving lives over and over again like in ground hog day they probably be remaking that one too lol okay so the film blew up crap better but it had no character at all like the original films once again though itll make money and they be another soon sigh,reality
movie starts in a post apocalyptic world perhaps after nuke war and then tom hardy is a survivalist potable water is scarce which can be extracted from only deep underground via pumps using gasoline and elites are using religion to control people corruption and filth in the barren desert shortage of food fuel etc so thats the beginning and your hopes will be raised about the movie but then it begins the illogical car chase in barren desert and then there is virtually nothing in that story afterwards also guitar will pour out fire using gasoline to motivate army or maybe it is just a pretentious way of saying our movie is cool and artistic because guitar is spitting fking fire seriously you will regret every second of itand then you compare ratings of metacritic and imdb and you will realize critics can be bought and crowd will rate a movie highly if properly advertised,reality
i have watched all the films from the start the first was low budget but compelling with a young mel gibson at his best the second and third took the idea to another level with a big budget and a softer crossover into the scifiwestern mainstream a reboot seemed like a good idea with no need for mel gibson to reprise his earlier eponymous role but what seemed like a good idea with george miller directing turns out to be a bad idea the budget is massive the landscapes are panoramic the retrofuturistic war wagons a delight the plot and script is a disaster i wanted to enjoy it the second twoinstalments were apocalyptic fantasies but laced with a sense of humour and charm this is charmless fury roads opening scene is a chaotic tour de force featuring the capture then escape of only as the opening draws to an end do the doubts start his ability to defy the hoards becomes a little preposterous still we have the first road chase to entertain us but as it unfolds the truth dawns that is all there is one long chaseinstead of the myriad possibilities that a dystopian future offers we are instead funnelled into the confines of the car chase a poor mans fast and furioustom hardy is fine as co star charlize theron is deglammed as rebel imperator furiosa glamour is provided  bizarrely by a small cohort of white robed vestal concubines however as the chase unfolds repetition creeps in and disaster strikes an action film i became bored there is only so much you can do with a car chase and those possibilities do not cover a 120 minute running time shooting airborne bmxers is a good joke but after a while isntall this is a shame some of the detail is good oxygen masks with wolfs teeth a battle party led by a rock guitarist shooting flame from his axe the spectacular sets shot in nabibia but it isnt enough the established vision is reheated with no new direction and the interminable running time just leaves you asking why i cant really comment on the acting as there is none the characters just perform the storyboard such a waste of money and resource the idea of remains a good one but a new director is needed to realise its potentiala budget of half and a running time of ninety minutes would have concentrated minds instead of allowing ours to wander,reality
ever since the aesthetic was immortalised in the california love music video a hollywood remake was an inevitability the result is in many ways what is becoming the standard hollywood homage formula  outrageous action sequences strung together by a plot and script that seem to have been cooked up on the back of a napkin at the last minuteon the plus side the film has some crazy chases and is continually entertaining in a kind of operatic way if you want a couple of hours of actionpacked silliness punctuated by the occasional out of place bit of brutality and peppered with amusing feminist overtones that will have male rights activists tearing their hair out then this is for youbut being a film fury road invites comparison to its predecessors and being a film it also invites criticism as a film the results are not positive the plot manages to be both simplistic and ridiculous suffering badly from being set in a very weird and unconvincing postapocalyptic environment gone are the dogfood dinners obsession with oil and lack of everything that characterised road warrior gone too is the historicallybased contrast between peaceful towndwellers and feral bands of nomadic psychos who periodically show up to rob and kill them instead we have a strange whiteboy tyranny thats not racism watch the film and youll see what i mean with a semidivine ruler his devotees apparently all being on something like crack so plentifully supplied with water that they can literally shoot it out of giant pipes onto the sandy ground and let people try to catch it in their hatsthe chalky crackheads do all the suicidal driving and there is also a large population who do what exactly just hang out being thirsty apparently since the big boss man only opens the giant water pipes for five seconds every day to make sure they dont get a taste for the stuff the set up is so facile and nonsensical the revolutionary implications so glaringly obvious i thought the film wanted me to suspend my disbelief and just accept that the people were whipped and sure enough nobody mentioned the political fragility of the madeup minisociety throughout but they had to have their cake and eat it didnt they in the end the film was neatly stitched up with a sixtysecond revolution in which the body of the king was presented the thirsty people chanted a bit and the few remaining crackheads folded faster than superman on laundry daythe premise of rescuing the models yeah you heard me was weak on so many levels there is no point even going into it the old ladies in the desert deserves mention for being very nuts what were they living on sand some of what they said left the impression that they had lived by shooting poor passers by and taking their stuff just like the crazies of the original movies but this is just dismissed as a kind of rustic charm  oh i always shoot everyone in the head hahaha and this is at the heart of my beef with the film  no psychology nothing human at no point do you really believe that the characters have been psychologically shaped by a brutal environment characterized by resource scarcity and and abundance of senseless violence a man raised from birth to be a kamikaze crackhead is converted by a single insanely outofplace line about manifest destiny yep the postapocalypse education system is apparently in pretty good shapethen there is charlize therons escape plan so the plan is you escape to your hometown somewhere that is about three days drive away and you take with you something so valuable that hundreds of bad guys are guaranteed to follow you there in broad daylight oh and did i mention that charlize was traumatized when bad guys showed up at her home town and abducted her as a child thats right and now she is leading hundreds of badguys back to that very place lucky for her when she gets there its just a big wasteland just stop me when this starts making sense each one of the many gaping holes in the plot are dismissed in a throwaway line and the motivations of the characters are given equally short shrift the sad fact is that there just isnt the time to say anything that doesnt drive the threadbare plot forwardlike i said the feminist overtones are fun in their own way but i have to say on balance i would regard this as a femsploitation flick the central character is a pretty convincing tough woman but the coterie of models who accompany her are cardboard cutouts that betray the boxticking commercialist logic underlying the whole fiasco in the end the film has ended up more like the video for california love than a serious attempt to deliver an interesting plot a social commentary or an enduring vision of a post apocalyptic world,reality
wanted to like thisheard about all the great reviewsfound the dialogue a bit clunky despite being happy to give post apocalyptic films a wide birth on new and strange ideassayings they might havei also felt was too much of a supporting character i had no problems with the amount of female characters and thought the strongest character was furiosa but was left wondering why the title character wasnt the most important character in the moviethe use of religion as a tool to control people was a nice touchthe action was well shot well edited and seemed to go on forever there was some reasonable character development happening during this action but the overall feeling leaving the cinemas this wasnt what i had hoped for,reality
when i think of a cinematic masterpiece fury road is not the first thing that comes to mind i cant say i had very high expectations going into the theater and when i asked what to expect my friend said its a masterpiece in the same way 300 is i cant actually pick apart this movie and tell someone what was good about it because i was honestly very bored throughout it the movie is severely lacking in any substance as it follows the stories of very 2d characters who drive around in the dust fighting pale metalheads aesthetically sure it had some value but it wasnt enough to compensate for the repetitive action and dull story mind you im not the type of person to get entertained by monster truck arenas so perhaps thats a factor either way i really dont see what all the fuss is about it was a rather boring movie with boring characters and the action scenes might as well just be the same one played on a loop it takes a certain lack of intelligence to be entertained by a guy jumping from trucks for 2 hours,reality
it is as if george miller really wanted to prove that he can still produce the best vehicle chase scenes in a movie the film moves along for the most part at break neck speed leaving little time for a breather for those who arent familiar with the original trilogy a brief explanation from about himself starts the film for any fan of the originals the way it was executed will of been a disappointment feels less important in this film his character is not the centre of the story but more a part of it perhaps this is a good thing however tom hardys version of rockatansky feels more trying mel gibson made that character his own it was pulled off naturally without any need to be macho or overtly crazy tom hardys portrayal looks and sounds more akin to some of his previous efforts see bronsonbut that was always going to be the inevitable disappointment for fans of the originals trying to enjoy a new with a different actor filling in the shoes of such an iconic characterthe film as a whole wears all the expected fabric of a post apoc world but only this time it is worn by a new breed theirs plenty to see in this revamped vision for fans of the old films to enjoy the insane characters and their surroundings wouldnt look out of place in road warrior or beyond thunderdome the pace of the film is very different and for some part feels too much too rushed like a sugar rush this was however millers intention to make a film that comes at you like a steam train on fire driven by a load of lunaticsif you treat the original trilogy like a family then they would all be siblings born of the same parents byron kennedy rip  george miller fury road then feels more like a step brother related but different from the restfor the younger generation or just those that have never seen the other three this new entry will either introduce them to the original trilogy or end up being just another action flicki personally will find it very hard not to stamp my biased opinion on this review being that the first movie from 1979 is one of my all time favourites i find fury road without heart and to me that was always my connection with the central character even when he is the burnt out shell of a man in road warriormel gibson just seemed to own that character every little nuance of expression and he sells it so naturally the chaotic pace of fury road like a trailer to a modern video game never gives hardy the chance to really take over the role and do it justice instead we are mainly treated to grunts and scowls to me the movie as a whole is typical of what hollywood are dishing out it seems to cater for the below average attention spanits popcorn fodder with plenty of crash bang wallops but no substance and hardly an excuse to even call this a movie instead it should be renamed furiosa the name of charlize therons character,reality
this 30 years old franchise has eventually roared its way returning to the big screen with a greater filming technology and a bigger budget though the same director after so many years george miller still succeeds in bringing another great entertaining sequel that is worth waiting for its epic action sequences and spectacular visual effects setting in future the plots apocalyptic society and sexual politics are pretty straightforward combining the insanity hyper accelerating and exhilarating actions without repetition of styles all are presented in a creative way which is rarely seen in recent films while its not necessary anyway the film does not have much of characters development but both tom hardy and charlize theron as well as the presence of nicholas hoult have a great screen time of heroic performances meanwhile musics by junkie xl sound loud tremendous and powerful likely influenced by hans zimmers style surprisingly suit the film well including the cool and classic cinematography by john seale miller is able to deliver more than what audiences might be expecting even with overdose f action scenes it is still effectively balanced with emotional moments and inspiring messages,reality
more than 30 years passed since george miller created the iconic postapocalypticroad carnage crazy universe i was in doubt if he could do his magic with fury road  but boy he didfury road is an unrelenting action fest from beginning to end i cannot remember any recent action movie that made me watch in awe unbelieving what i saw the amount of practical stunts the production design the camerawork the scope of this whole thing is beyond anything we got used to in modern blockbuster action movies in short this is 100 percent george millerness and just forget everything about the babehappy feet flickstom hardy takes the baton from mel gibson as and he gets the job well done talking with an odd dialect haunted by visions of the past muttering to himself and barking halfbeastlike to others in his few lines of dialogue we get the impression that something cracked in his mind beyond repair however is a survivalist machine with a spark of humanity left and like in the old movies gets plunged right into the s when things get messyteams up with imperator furiosa charlize theron the most kickass female movie character since ellen ripley a weird prosthetic arm mascara obviously made of oil oh charlizewill you marry me theron easily steals this movie by giving us a thinlipped but still emotional image of furiosa which may be her best performance of her career so farthe antagonist is scary immortan joe aptly played by hugh keaysbyrne yes the toecutter who wants towhatever undeniably the whole plot is paperthin but hey this is a movie not an elaborate and sophisticated shakespearian drama righthardy and theron are labelled as starring but the real star of fury road is george miller it is appalling how much effort passion and audacity mr miller packed into this film when i heard that the concept of fury road was a 2hour chase i was afraid that the movie turned out to be a boombang action flick which gets boring after one hour the opposite is true there are plenty action sequences but miller gives us few but powerful oases of calm scenes to flesh out the characters  and give us a moment to catch breath before the cinematic onslaught continuesand an onslaught it is crazy vehicles skulls madmen on spikes a motorized stage with a guitarist as battleenforcer with a flamethrowerguitar blades guns soupedup cars exploding spears you name it it has to be seen to be believed george miller has the grandeur of an old veteran knight stepping into the throne room and slapping the gauntlet into all the upstarts faces who think they are so high and mighty michael bay anyone honestly fury road blasts so much cgiaction boredom to pieces that even avengers age of ultron looks cheap and lazythe movie is almost perfect but there are some drawbacks it is kind of awkward that fury road is more of a buddy movie furiosa in the old movies albeit the first one was the man who made the difference and helped the desperate ones to turn the tide today he seems to have lost his almost saviour antics and is just an able and skilled postapocalypse fighter secondly there is the supporting female cast which has very little to do except to motivate immortan joes chase and look hot they are culprit for just being there to be eyecandy for the presumed male audiencein all honesty i want george miller to win the acadamy award for best director fury road is massive and if you have the slightest affection for action movies go and watch it in the theatre on a big screen or you will regret it for the rest of your life if there is a deeper revelation in fury road it has to be that a movie can work without mel gibsonbut not without george millerit was worth the 30years wait and it is indeed a lovely day,reality
thats what i said after watching this one and what an experience to be frank i have been urging people around me to go watch this one as i was blown off by all the trailers itself these days the movie marketing team is smart enough to make trailers worth while and all movies look good in the trailers but very few live up to the expectations this one is definitely one of themto start with the post apocalyptic world is shown truly beautiful what if humanity was reduced to fight for basic survival instincts and basic resources like oil or water can you imagine what the world would be cruel and thats what it will be so all the dirt in the movie does really makes sense when industrialization in future world is extinctthe story is simple our protg who is more of a sidekick is on the run from the bad guys thats it how beautiful is this concept but it only becomes beautiful when it is executed properly the last that i remember of such beautiful concept brought on screen was from our original mel gibson in apacalypto at times you never know whats gonna happen next and the adrenaline during the entire run of the movie of all audiences could be felt all were in for a ride and kind of a race probably felt heart one can feel for and furiosa reduced on single instinct of survivalfrom the start the movie is breath taking be not mistaken this movie is not made for laptops led tvs but has to be experienced only on big screen thats because of its cinematography its breath taking and the deserts of namibia or australia is so candidly captured on frame i will be surprised if this movie doesnt win the oscars this year in the cinematography section i never knew the desert would be that beautiful during day time even better so in moonlightthis movie is for an action buff dont look for performances here although charlize theron clearly steals the show her emotional outburst in the desert and the way it was captured was just awesome this is the art of direction in an action movie which scores over acting george miller is the real star herethe direction and art work is also wonderful and kudos to the mind behind george miller who captured his imagination and painted on screen with magical moments during the chase from guys hanging on a pole during the chase to a rock star with his electric guitar with n no of speakers behind him action 1010 cinematography 1010 and the music what can i say the background score heard in the trailer sounds even better in the movieif james cameron scores in best art movie direction with cgi effects for avatar then george miller steals the show here with original stunts choreographed without cgi ps do experience this in i3d  its really worth it,reality
i was awaiting for this movie ever since i saw the trailerthere was a small feeling in my gut that this movie might not end up as i expected as most movies dowith the trailer being awesomebut as i hopedthis movie came out just as i wanted toits an epic action adventure movie with great cgi which the previous mm movies could not providetime obviously is a bhthe storyline is pretty good too though i feel they shouldve gone a bit more deep on the characterslike a bit of flashbacks for furiosabut thats just an afterthought cause when i was watching this movie none of this came to my headthis is one of the best action films ive watchedand the guitarheavy breathingjust dont miss this,reality
the nottoorevealingsynopsis this is an addition to the series that is set in a desert world where order and scientific progress have ceased mankind still dependent upon fuel to power engines built in the productive times past scavenges and fights for whatever gasoline can be found organized bands of highway robbers are the closest approximation to society and those still with traces of humanity and civility can only survive on the periphery of savagerythe nottoorevealingreview it has a good story there are great action scenes the created world itself is thoughtful and detailed full of wonder and surprise it is full of memorable characters and charlize theron was perfect how then did it go so terribly wrong imagine a talented painter who spends months on a piece he creatively employs the appropriate techniques lighting texture perspective etc then the artists hands a random stranger a sharpie and asks them to overlay the painting with a stick figure mural which offers the strangers interpretation of the artists work in the end result one can still glimpse the beauty of what is underneath but the final product is irreparably marred this was fury road george miller had created a fantastic world and then for reasons i cannot fathom decided to ask tom hardy to reprise his role as forrest bondurant from the movie lawless hardy is a great actor with versatility and you ask him to do this why would you so extensively or at all for that matter rely on doublefilm speed to make the action scenes seem faster that wasnt actually that cool in the 1970s and it is just bizarre today and why would you edit the scenes so that they were choppy and seeming to purposefully stifle continuity and development it was almost as if the director wanted to regress to the graphic novel format somewhere in the vaults of the studio there lies the unedited footage for this movie if that could be put together in a less choppy slower pace film that more reflected mainstream films today this could have been a truly enjoyable moviethis was truly an unpleasant viewing experience for those wanting a comparison think crank 2006 merged with sin city a dame to kill for 2014 i suppose that if you liked crank andor sin city however this might be just the thing you are looking for,reality
im coming here not as a fan of the original trilogy but as a fan of the one and only original from 1979 the only one that made a real impact the only one that was filmed with guts and something to say the installments ii and iii had very little in common with the first film amounting to not much more than 80s extravaganza of bad costumes and poor imagining of the future and reducing the main character a man of deep suffering and in quest for retaliation to some sort of survivalist in a futuristic worldthe trend continues here with this fourth installment theres even less connections with predecessors and its a film in name only they invoked some mostly bad motives from ii and iii and upgraded them for modern day but thats not enough in my view obviously there is no mel gibson and tom hardy does what he can in his shoes but without the charisma he at best comes across as russel crowe impersonating gibson and at worst  as a wuss the character of is further reduced from a lone survivalist to a sidekick to charlize therons character and the film should really be called furiosa then the verdict on its merits wouldnt be this hard at one point utters something to himself in what would best be described as breaking the fourth wall truly a bottom for an iconic character of other iconic memorabilia  gone is the car gone is the sawed off shotgun and gone is the australian scenery i dont really remember maybe the savanna was gone in earlier movies already but here there is really nothing but sand sand and more sand  of namibiawhen i think of it gone is also the connection to this earthly world altogether plotwise nothing in the film could make me care for a world that is nothing but a sandy planet where people dont even need water to survive  its been presented here more as a soughtafter commodity along with mothers milk and blood rather than a bare necessity the world that is filled with various creatures some with only loose semblance to humans not much exposition is made to this world and screenwriters rely too heavily on viewers knowledge of universe some past thermonuclear skirmishes as well as oil and water shortages are mentioned to explain it all but they amount to nothing but a footnote the problem is  they were a footnote in previous installments as wellwhat remains is the chase the chase was the basis of the first and the second and it was what held both films together even if you didnt care about the backdrop the chase in fury road is truly and utterly spectacular its lavishly produced its what the director george miller does best and its almost 80 percent live action it seems that the filmmakers decided to use the whole plot as a mere excuse to cram in as much explosions car crashes motorcycle jumps and other stunts as they possibly could and that they took it a little too far or way too far and its unfortunate its pure relentless walltowall action alright but it never stops ever from the first to the last minute its chase and fighting with a couple of breathers chipped in every now and then it feels like a one long trailer and instead of lifting the film the action kills it after a while you dont know whos who whats going on or why  and you find yourself not caringthe whole impression might best be described in the words of its very director miller he exclaimed that he wanted to give the audience a circus and he is absolutely right it is a circus in both a good and a bad way its a nonstop action which at times resembles a long cheesy meatloaf video with freaks fireballs and even a guitarist its lavishly produced beautifully filmed cheesily acted and as dumb as any recent action flick i can think of if you like that sort of thing by all means  go for it and brace yourselves for sequels however to call it is pointless the franchise was already creatively spent thirty years ago and as everybody knew him is dead and gone to paraphrase a character from this film  we have just witnessed him going to valhalla and hes never coming back,reality

just perfect there is no other movie like this this has to be the hardest review ive written due to the sheer amount of insanity that takes place here the explosions are without a doubt some of the best onscreen nothing gets the heart beating faster than seeing pole vault from car to car whilst a fuel tanker goes up in epic flames behind him the stunts are the aweinspiring there needs to be an oscar category for the the stunt men and womentom hardy is he is the road warrior his line delivery is so gritty and delightfully croaky he starts off like a wild animal escaping from captivity then gradually retains mild normality but his eyes are always filled with a hint of craziness hardys mannerisms quips and neat little movements all add up leading to one of the best performances of 2015 the minute charlize theron appeared it hit me once again why she remains one of my all time favourite actresses head shaven one arm the other operating a mechanic arm with her head smeared in oil she looks the part and means business theron displays conviction desperation anxiety care and dedication throughout every single line she has is totally badass best of all you wanna get through this pick up what you can and run best performance from an actress this year so far it will be tough to beat as will the film then bring on the coolest looking scariest sounding antagonist ever immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne gives a terrifically terrifying performance a screen dominating character with authority amplified by those who worship him his voice is so epic and eerie as he speaks to his people and battle cries desperately chasing to get his wives back all the makeup costume design and vehicle designs are awards worthy they add commentary on how the people in this world live and in their condition in this dying worldnicholas hoult is unrecognisable as nux a dying warboy who is given a chance to prove himself by feeding blood into his system on his way to the gates of valhalla his performance alone is the in the title and easily boasts the best line this year oh what a day what a lovely day as he rides into a storm theres outstanding support from nathan jones josh helman and angus sampson as immortan joes followers each offering brute force ballstothewall behaviour and epic acts of violence then theres the fives wives brilliantly acted by all british model rosie huntingtonwhiteley again proves herself a fine actress line delivery perfect with raw emotion and providing one of the most shocking scenes in the film australian models abbey lee and courtney eaton are tremendous coating their scenes with innocence and vulnerability as well as riley keough who has the least lines of the five but performs with stunning expression zoe kravitz is a total badass and the lone wolf in her pack i cannot fault these actress they all did a fine job its great to see megan gale make an appearance as valkyrie furiosas contact whose appearance reveals a dramatic twist that completely turns the tide for all these characters fury road is breathless entertainment im dying to see it again it is perfect which is a big statement to make but no film is going to reach the heights of raw insanity here nor the carnage and beautiful camerawork filled with many crash zooms in 3d fury road comes to life with a heightened sense of depth and hard hitting pop out effects that knock you dead on the critical acclaim and buzz is worthy 2015 is at its high point,reality
this movie will bore adults who are over 40 years old they have seen this type of video game before i could not understand their words rarely because of their accents but i knew and saw of the 2nd road warrior with mel gibson i liked that movie a lot it had style it took me to an odd end of the world idea i had never contemplatedthis movie is similar to the temple of doom it seems that mountains need to be carved up with skull symbols what a lot of work for a people who are trying to survive on nothing carving up mountains with skull symbolsthe problem here is that the hero is immediately made into a slave whereas mel gibson had that cool sawed off shotgun to tuck into his belt this hero has nothing so symbolici will get right down to it i was bored 12 way through i started to fall asleep in the middle of one of the latter chase scenes this was because i did not expect to see anything newthe color of the sands was saturated by photo shop this gave it an unreal look so i felt it was more of an alien planet but no this was earth i could not understand the plot they were trying to save a water truck or somethingif you are bored reading this review just think how bored i was trying to figure out what was going on in this movie lots of action to get across the desert i could see that in spades but i could not understand why many of the people had white as an egg skin color they looked like aliens but this was earth i could not understand why the cars had to be so layered with do dads it looked fakethe first road warrior actually the second film in this series i loved they have added polish and paint and do dads and weird skin paint and wrecked this line of moviesthe one film critic mick la salle gave this movie a 50 out of 100 points i think i agree with him and with none of the othersthis movie is for kids it is for people who have only seen a few movies in their lifetime,reality
the bar is so low currently for movies that schlock like this gets an 82 lets make a movie that has no characters we want to root for no character build up and no story lets decorate the vehicles with skulls and scary stuff and also tattoo people with this stuff and have a guy who wears a scary oxygen mask this will not make the movie frightening but oh well lets not explain why people are searching for a place with water yet seem to be thriving and in good enough health to wage battles and have plenty of gasoline when they are out in the middle of a desert this movie is just a bunch of violent vignettes of vehicles racing down roads and the occupants fighting each other i was so bored but because so many critics and web sites seem to rate it so highly i stuck with it ill admit i fell asleep for part of it there is no suspense whatsoever and the character is lame i just watched the first with mel gibson and although it was a little choppy it had heart and it was way more suspenseful and exciting than this one especially considering how long ago it was made i enjoyed that one this one cannot compare i plan on watching the second movie with mel which is rated even higher than the first one i think the problem is that the person who wrote the screen plays for the first two movies so many years ago used stories written by other people and just translated the stories into screen plays i believe he wrote the original story for this one and it stinks perhaps hes past his prime i really dont understand the hype unless its because of the stars or sentiment for the directorscreen writer in my opinion charlize took a big step down in her career with this i love action and thrillers and postapocalyptic movies that are well done this is not to be honest the first and last halves of this movie were just the same old same old so falling asleep really didnt matter nothing changed this is one of the worst movies ive seen this year,reality
con air was my all time worst move everfury road has taken 1st spoti understand all the effects were spectacular and the overall theme is a bit bizarre butwhat this has to do with i will never understand i rated it 1  10 due to its lack of connection to and the fact it is devoid of any story at allsorry but i was there at when it was released and to date it remains a masterpiecegeorge miller is no doubt a genius and his attempts to rescue is a valiant one however when you actually understand where it all started this is way outside any boundaries across all platforms of creativitythe acting was superb and the scenery was sensational the story was non existentdont get me wrong i love australian movies in all guises but this is a trip far far away from any thread to do with if you have purchased a ticket then you will be amazedif you saw 1 and 2 you will be unimpressedif you liked 3 you will love it,reality
how is this a great movie sure the action is good but if your a person who like a good story this is not the movie for you there is very little dialog in this movie very little story and nothing is explained it is just people chasing cars for 2 hours the acting is okay this movie needs a lot more dialog and a story in a good movie you feel a connection with the characters this movie you feel nothing it is just mindless action once again if you care about a story dialog and characters this is not a movie for you if you care about action and nothing else this is a movie for you this is the worst movie i have ever seen,reality
maybe i came to this movie with preconceived opinions i dont like action movies without a story or acting and i cant stand tom hardys silly accents his bane was the worthers original granddad and his kray impression was brilliant if it was meant to be allan partridge so even though the opening scene had a voice over of hardy doing some sort of cross between south african australian kiwi and texan i persevered only to be met with a boring action movie with no story or acting its nice to see it win so many deserved oscars the costumes vehicles and sets are all excellent even if lifted from duran durans wild boys video but i had to turn it off as i had to observe some paint that was losing moisture,reality
a fastpaced film another glimpse into dystopia a world of anarchy and loud sound sometimes you think youve found pages torn out brave new york at others a dipping into nordic myths what can one say gratuitous violence a long car chase a display of military hardware that would fuel any terrorists dreams and then its a mugs game a 21 century retelling in the outback of hg wells time machinethe gentle or not so gentle eloi against the repulsive morlocks tom hardy plays to type and charlize theron doesnt and saying that even with crankoil grease on her face her natural beauty surfaces without a blemish even with an arm lopped off and so well sliced that it wound doesnt bleed she manages to carry on stiff upper lipped in all this is an action fill requiring no thought just your money thank you very much,reality
or feminazi with a gaggle of americas next top models wander the wasteland for no apparent reason with a neutered in tow endless ammo endless juice for the well maintained vehicles but sadly lacking a coherent storyvisually fury road will keep you entertained but caring about the characters or what happens is just so mind numbing indifferent this will not be in anyones classic collectionis a bland dimwitted bore grunting a few syllables here  there the feminazi is the star of the show the vogue models bizarre eye candy in the wasteland  the manboys white redneck scum babbling about some warrior republican valhalla  now the story is something about this hill top fortress with fat women being milked like cowstop model breeders and a older lord humungus in charge of the water spigotnow lord lord humungus drops thousand of gallons of water on the heads of ten thousand section 8 losers daily that do nothing except wait for the water to be dropped into their dirt rat hole mailbox  no crops no carbs no cheese  no barter town no nothing why keep them around i guess the ego tripping lord humuingus has the babes fuel  food and just enjoys gawking at the radioactive mob down below lots of chasing the fuel tanker and cars flippingvery well done endless interesting characters thrown in  run over before you even get to know themjust another cgi fast food movie buffet thats looks pretty but has been under the heat lamps of a master cgi wizard a day too long and the storybook of the writers a year too short a well deserved special effects 10 idiotic story 5 equals a 5,reality
i hate to say this but i feel this movie is a bit overrated the best things fury road has to offer are the multitude of intense epic action sequences and the visually stunning landscapes and images that the film captures besides these traits fails to offer much morewhile the film overall is still pretty enjoyable its major flaw is that it fails to develop any real connection with the viewer none of the characters are developed that well and none of their conflicts and goals are truly explored the problem with this is that some of the scenes that are meant to be more emotional arent very impacting as mentioned there isnt much else that is great about the acting is fine but nothing impressive the story isnt all that interesting the script isnt anything special and in general the movie fails to catch the viewers attention except for when the action sequences occur in conclusion fury road is still a fun ride but just not with very much to offer,reality
theres always been something a bit quirky about george millers film making sensibilities call it australian if you will or perhaps its just a comic book feel but from my admittedly american perspective all the series felt a bit different than the traditional uberviolent slick highaction popcorn flicks the die hards terminators and so onthis has been its  and millers  big strengths hes got a feel for a strange back story and somewhat absurdist characterization and a deranged aesthetic that drew me to the series originallythe road warrior was undoubtedly the high point of this series though always a lonewolf antihero mel gibsons was far more interesting and likable and the central action set pieces brilliantly and tightly executed miller was at the top of his game back then fury road has given miller a much wider brush to execute the strange and quirky sensibility and that feels like its key fault to me its the too much budget syndrome and its afflicted many a movie that was great precisely because it didnt have a massive budget 30 years and 150m to spend hasnt exactly been kind to this seriestom hardy is scarcely registering a pulse as does he utter more than 12 barely intelligible words throughout the film in a film with in the title i can hardly tell that was even there he could have been replaced by almost any other character in the movie nicholas hoults nux  a vastly more interesting character  for example or charlize therons imperator furiousa who may have more screen time than tom hardy overthetop violence and excess is a trademark of this series to not go in expecting this is absurd the problem is that the violence feels like an intentionally garish suit that miller has put on the absurd audiovisual assault of the first 510 minutes of the film for example feels precisely this way whats miller going for here what part of the plot and story is he trying to lay out and advance exactly nothing really id argue its there purely to prepare your mind for the ensuing craziness sort of like a shock treatmenti was very excited when i first saw the fury road trailers yes another movie finally but miller oversold his story and vision in the end he had way way too much money to spend i would have bought it more if he and hardy hadnt decided to make this very distant almost mute character is not a traditional hero to be sure but he has a moral center most of us can attach to i wont say this center was entirely lost here but i felt little emotion toward at the end that likability was there throughout the series  from the first to the road warrior to thunderdome its sadly missing here,reality
a new experience for almost everyone trying to send short messages that explain the story without spoon feeding it to the viewers explaining the lifestyle of the wasteland people through action only i think the above lines explain why many people like this movie so much that would be justified if there is a story to be told honestly i find it creative telling a story with decent details using only fighting scenes and explosions but what good is it if the story you are telling is so lame all of the loud rock music and slow motion scenes proves my point they want to show us how creatively they can blow up cars and set up chase scenes they added a small story between the lines so they can wrap up a long sequence of chasing scenes into a movie cgi doesnt determine how good a movie is because each movie is made with the latest pc software at its time certainly not artistic unless you like paintings of sand plus a package of useless scenes that doesnt add anything to the plot or the action 610 may be a compliment for the directors effort in this,reality
ive seen multiple action movies i enjoyed but this movie out did them all the action the music the cinematography and the special effects kept my blood pumping up for more i nearly cried at the end of this movie because it was so beautifully well made what a film what a lovely film,reality
yes beautifulmaybe thats not the word someone would use to describe george millers modern masterpiece but i willfury road shows us that all the choreographed and handcrafted action can take place in a moving rhythm anyone who accuses this film of being just a battle of material or a glorification of gigantomania has not understood something in refusing a superficial story stands out from the other blockbusters fury road is loud very loud but the movie doesnt numb you the whole is an overall composition of sound image and cut of crystalline beauty yes beauty this film is a poetic experience that is both direct and completely abstract we are directly affected by the pictures and basses but at the same time everything remains abstract since we cannot identify directly with any personfury road provides us with answers to questions we have never asked formally speaking we are actually similar to the characters in the film how they wander around without any direction but with a smile on their face they move from point a to point b and when they are at point b they go back to point a this directionlessness also drives us humans through the area but also keeps us in motionthe greek philosopher heraclitus was the thinker of opposites land and sea day and night and so on all opposites form a unity the most important message is that the way back and forth is one and the same way doesnt this make the entire chase obsoletegeorge miller uses this unity of opposites in sound design we have both fortissimo and pianissimo interludes and nothing in between many postapocalyptic films show an order into which chaos slowly enters fury road now shows how an order is forming in chaos but does it make any difference,reality
one of the things that stands out about this film is how miller manager to develop the character of without even using words or dialog  a truly great example in storytelling of  show dont tell the pacing of the movie is great  it is slower paced but yet youre never bored and it never feels slow miller does a superb job of bringing to life the world he has createdanother great thing i love about this film is that miller doesnt go crazy with cgi  in a day and age when it seems nearly every movie uses way too much of it  this movie feels very organic and it looks amazing because of it this movie will hold up for a very long time i cant wait for a sequel to come out hopefully one does,reality
perhaps the blood rushing constantly doesnt allow you to fully process what you actually just saw but after checking out the bonus features you have to realize that besides digitally removing certain things and enhancing colors every stunt you see was actually performed and usually at top speed im talking about blowing up huge trucks flipping cars motorists jumping over vehicles and so much more easily my favorite are the polerider guys you may remember them from the trailer on these huge poles to swing from one vehicle to another yeah guys trained for weeks to be able to do that and i might as well say kids no matter how cool it looks i only give you permission to attempt these stunts as long as you capture it on video so that i can laugh at you laternow i can go on and on about these epic stunts and explosions and kills and action and fighting but even that doesnt give the movie full justice for it is one of the most fullyrealized movies ever george miller had this brilliant vision and the product is a story told with hardly any lines spoken by the main character or other characters for that matter the women are given strong roles to emphasize their importance not feed on weakness and the message miller gave his unit was loud and clear and wonderful even though this is a postapocalyptic world that doesnt mean it has to be bleak and lifeless and bland this movie is vibrant and beautiful to put focus on how humans would actually scramble to find remnants of beauty in a forsaken world is a great twist that enhances the story and the experiencenow lets talk about the oscars and theres a lot to talk about this film won 6 all these very technical awards including his wife winning for editing and nominated for 4 others not only did fury road win these oscars but it had to beat the revenant to do so granted that masterpiece beat it in directing and cinematography but thats rightfully so i think a lot of people were questioning why an action flick was winning all these awards from an academy that is known for excluding action superhero and blockbuster flicks i am so glad it was recognized that this highoctane movie had such a vision that came together like nothing else its so hard to compare it to the other oscar nominated films but it is also really hard to compare it to action films in general generally you have the opening action sequence background of characters perhaps a twist halfway through then a balance of action scenes and talking scenes with a huge cliand that is not fury road my favorite vehicle from the armada is the huge cargo truck hybrid with drummers beating on the back and a guitarist suspended with strings jamming out and unleashing flames its an actual flamethrower guitar that to me embodies the movie a weird weird world full of rocking characters on a chase set to a score with an equal amount of pounding drums and quick guitar jams its so cool but still so intricate with the suicidal halflives who follow immortan joethis film changes the game the progressively more intense sequences keep piling up for some of the most fun youll ever have at a movie will other movies follow suit and more importantly how does george miller create a respectable sequel after thisyou can check this review and dozens of others out at gillipediamoviereviewsblogspotcom,reality

fury road 2015 sadly mmfr could have been a great movie with a plot rather than a fair movie centered around car chases on steroids i watched mmfr a few times to make sure i was not missing what others said was a great movie but my opinion keeps dropping the more i watch i do believe there really was a substantial plot originally planned for mmfr from subtle hints and limited scenes between speeding and crash scenes but this plot was edited out or glossed over rather than nitpick on what is i suggest immho a few additional character developments and scenes to bring out the deeper plot that was submerged yet still leave all the crashbang stuff for the kiddiesspoiler alert extra character development immortan joe make him simiimmortal before the war ij was an aging researcher of life extension in big phama and during the war he injected a crude rejuvenation treatment to survive the nuclear fallout but it was only partially successful thus the need for all the plexiglas body shell breathing equipment and blood transfusions basically hes an ageless biological mess but as the last gasp of the old school he will extract purify and hammer civilization from the mutated remains as his parting giftrictus erectus ijs only surviving son from using a primitive cloning technique years ago when ij had some remaining equipment re is less of a biological mess but still sterile like ij re is the heir apparent or apparent error re and if will eventually rule the city if ij ever diesrockatansky the youngest son of a police officer and a teacher who luckily was in the deep outback during the war and his small town survived several years before it withered and died mr learned his police profession after the war from his father while protecting the town mr is in good shape and somewhat educated so ij plans to use for his rebuilding plans breeding stock and his bloodimperator furiosa was to be just a breeder but failed because of her brains ij raised her to operate the hodgepodge technology loss of arm ijs left hand man  seeing the fate she avoided breeder and the dystopian society being built if rebels against ij after listening to mrthe wretched useless older prewar postwar mutants and moron offspring used for slave labor and expendable true believers of survival of the fittestwar boys mostly failed low iq offspring of ij breeding program but still usable as tradesmen workers cannon fodder and warriors true believers of ij and the false religion ij createdthe elite the few prewar postwar and wellbred offspring of ij perfect society who live in the upper levels and will be the future catalyst of the resurrected lost civilization or else true believers of the old ways and ijs new waysadditional scenes adding the expected villains monologue by ij to mr ij offers mr a bright future in the elite ie breeder roving talent scout and future manager of war boys and transportation equipment to help build the new society under ijs master plan a modern city for the elites will rise in forty years from the extracted labor of mutants and war boys who will regrettably not be around by then for the rebirth of society ij explains the social structure of his little utopian project to save the world forced rapid breeding of the elite ie human milk farm and why the entire punkdeath decor for the rabble bread and circuses to save everything for the elites who need it for the real work to be done mr being the noble savage throws a hairball so ij throws mr into the elites guest suite jail to be processed as needed mr if breeders and a few elites make a break for it to escape ijs dystopian playpen and make it to the rumored greener pastures to live normal lives sadly the escapees realize ij will not let them escape and decide to turn around and take over the city thus overthrowing ij who now is locked out of his own city gasping and weak ij and a few sycophants are told to take a hike or die ij rises starts the drums and the i am your god speech and all the war boys start to chant to let ij in if quietly says if you want the past then join it and aims a sniper rifle then vaporizes ijs upper head and after a few breaths ij falls forward the chanting stops and all the sycophant turn and run later mr leaves if in charge of the city and returns to wandering the wastelands for survivorsthe end,reality
it took forever but i finally saw it fury road was probably the most hyped up movie since gravity everyone was talking about it some people even saw it more than once but when i heard about the movie being pretty much 98 car chase and 2 story  characters i knew it wasnt really going to be my kind of moviefirst lets get to the positives the production values are incredible when i watched the movie i really felt that all the vehicles costume designs makeup and even the mostly practical special effects just had a lot of heart put into it there was an incredible attention to detail and thats what i admire about the movie these people wanted to make a real movie not just have actors in front of a greenscreen and fix the rest with a computerthe cinematography was also excellent a real visual treat to watch another thing the movie does right putting some actual effort into the photographic outlookthere were also some decent comical elements like the guitar player mascot some goofy and oddlooking villains and some sporadic hilariously outofplace linesso what did the movie do wrong well the biggest problem is that the characters are just not that developed there are some brief glimpses of possible character development like having flashes from leaving people behind and also furiosa in general i was thirsty for knowing more about her but it never went beyond her badasssurface pretty much all of the girls furiosa had with her which she kept locked up what the hell had zero characteristics at all the closest we get to character development there is a woman being worried about her baby okay note downcharacter trait worried about babygot it lets move on what is most disappointing with this movie is unfortunately himself he just didnt have a personality furiosa wasnt developed much but at least she resembled somewhat of a character and i could root for her but is just a regular guy not the bruce willistype of regular guy but simply regular tom hardy is a pretty good actor but he got way too little to work with he oddly enough had pretty much the fewest lines in the whole movie not to mention that when he had a line it wasnt very memorable you dont give your main character quotable lines whazzamatterwithyou a letdown and waste of tom hardys talentthe story itself was also oh who am i kidding the only story i got here was that people need water and a villain is hellbent on having someones baby speaking of it what did he need the baby for and where do the weird girls come from what purpose do they serve and who did leave behind was it his daughter someone elses daughter jesus this movie leaves more questions than it answersdoes it work as passable friday entertainment to some extent but its definitely not a brilliant movie i dunno maybe i was just the wrong crowd i just want flesh and bones to my movies not just bones,reality
plot in a stark desert landscape where humanity is broken two rebels just might be able to restore order a man of action and of few words and furiosa a woman of action who is looking to make it back to her childhood homelanddont listen to any of the critics who say it is a masterpiece this is not better than aliens terminator 2 die hard predator and even the matrix the most positive thing that i can say is the first hour was amazing but the movie dies after that each character is underdeveloped and a waste all of the actors are wasted except for charlize theron the cinematography is also great but thats itthis is one of the most overrated action films that ive seen in years this will never stand the test of time like the ones mentioned before it will be forgotten years later,reality
how are people rating this film it boggles the mind that something so shallow is rated over 8 on imdb i can only imagine most people rating this have never seen the original or are under 16 years of age its all cgi with little substance i would have rated it a 510 but i only gave it 2 to balance out the ridiculous claims that this is a great moviethis is typical of hollywood to make something so mediocre compared to the original just to cash in not that the original was great but they should have at least made something remotely similar or follows on from the original its lack any significance or similarity to the original movies the first was never great but gave an insight as to who he was 2 and 3 were significantly better it seems fury road should have been better but it just doesnt hit the mark its shallow theres not much dialogue to speak of and new audiences younger people who never saw wouldnt understand who he even is this film just shows him as some random person in the desert in some care thats gets caught by some other random strangers and imprisoned but for what it doesnt really get deep into the why and who he is this movie should never have had the tag its not even remotely ramble over,reality
before watching i had the sense of excitement due to the uproar surrounding it the first 15 or so minutes were energetic and intriguing to say the least unfortunately there after all expectations were not reached yes for an action film the intensity was constant graphics incredible and scenery immaculate leading me to understand that those who love action genre must have been quaking in their chairs however i dont wish to be demeaning but for those of you who are rating this above a 9 scale must have never watched a truly incredible film we grow no connection with either furiosa and tom hardy one of my favorite actors was given very little to do speaking about 10 lines overall having achieved a connection with the audience in most of his other films such as lawless and batman makes me believe that it must have been george millers fault that we dont grow this link with him the wives of immortan joe begin to annoy me resulting in little sympathy and nux well hes just there the people eater and the bullet farmer appear from no where and have no relevancy and the guitarist was painfully embarrassing almost making me squint every time he came on screen i am not saying this is a horrific film it isnt but please for goodness sake imdb users do not rate this a 9 or 10,reality
ive been super excited for this since i saw the trailer i was more excited about this than i was about avengers age of ultron did it live up expectations hell yeah it did this movie is freaking awesome it kicks all the ass is it the most thought provoking film ever no does it have an amazingly original story line with super complex and deep characters no when you get down to it its a 2 hour chase scene but that doesnt matter with this movie it wanted to be fun and it achieved that what sets this apart from other movies that try to be nothing more than fun is the fact that it doesnt waste time on a story that doesnt matter anyway lets use the transformers franchise as an example overall pretty terrible franchise why well a lot of reasons but the one i care about here is that each movie wastes time on pointless crap that doesnt matter its a transformers movie i want to see transformers fight i dont want to watch humans argue in a transformers movie those movies cant be fun if they keep wasting time on stupid stuff doesnt do that it lays out the basics so it makes some amount of sense then they get straight to the action and it doesnt really stop we get two glorious hours of exceptionally directed action scenes with no crap in between this really is one of the better action movies ive seen in recent years and i really hope they make more go see it,reality

i am an enormous fan of the series i grew up on the road warrior and have watched it countless times screened the new fury road film last night and felt like my heart was ripped out of my chest i couldnt believe how cartoonish this film looked after all of the talk about how much practical work went into this film and with george miller saying in an interview that he views it as an analog film i was very much looking forward to him revisiting the world that he createdit couldnt be further from the truth folks yes there are some really impressive practical stunts at work here however they are intercut with some of the phoniest looking green screen work ive seen practically every motorcycle jump crash or tumble would start off practical and then would be interrupted two seconds later by the same guy in front of a green screen to highlight the middle moment of the stuntanother important note is that a majority of the interior moments of the car chase are all green screen and are all badly done to a very distracting degree why this was done i do not know usually its done for continuity purposes and to save time however theyre in the middle of the desert and the scenes inside the vehicles where this terrible green screen was taking place were at times of calm reflection where nothing was happening and only a few words were spoken very bizarre choice in directionin my personal opinion heres the breakdown of the good and the bad to be aware of when going into this film in order to adjust expectations for diehard fans of the trilogythe goodcostuming looks great wonderful attention to detail  the war boys are wonderfully performed and developed as characters  obviously the vehicles look great  the music during the intense moments of battle is appropriately powerful  the conceptualization of the various characters is very compellingthe badi didnt care for and wasnt rooting for any of the characters except for the war boys as they are the only even remotely developed characters in the story and im not looking for heaps of background but there was practically nothing divulged on anyone else that was worth a spit  furiosas cgi armstump is not done well it just doesnt look real at all when her robotic arm is not in place  the only moments that attempt any kind of feeling are painfully saccharin exposition heavy and accompanied by very melodramatic musical queues  huge amounts of distracting green screen  very poorly done dubbing of all of the characters throughout the entire film dont know why this was done but it was distracting and was sound mixed so that no matter how far anyone was from the camera everyone sounded like they were two feet away from you at any given point very bizarre choice in direction  tom hardy was lifeless in the role he didnt carry any of the charisma or charm that the original character had  an almost constant barrage of flashbacks for the character terribly cheesy and supremely invasive flashes of daughter asking why he let her die ugh just supercheesy bad  too many of those terribly corny shots where the exploded debris is perfectly and digitally choreographed so that important pieces of scrap metal fly right into the middle of the screenultimately i found myself crushed beneath the weight of a joyless movie experience that i would liken to the fallout of watching prometheus and the star wars prequelsif you pretend that the other films dont exist and if youre ok with all of the bad points i pulled out above then youll be at the very least entertained the film wasnt boring just not half as well executed as the trailers would have one believing and hoping for,reality
the story is extremely bad  actually  its inexistent  yes  its a great movie with continuous action  but i think its stupid that there is no goddamn introduction  it just throws you into the action  halfway through  it gets pretty static and boring  i advise you to watch it in 4d so you wouldnt be that bored   the acting is pretty much idiotic and i think a 10 yearsold kid can nail it  tom hardy has about 20 lines in this movie  30 of them are extremely stupid  and mourns all the time like hes trying to cosplay yoda from star wars  lets hope that the next two movies  yes  there will be two more movies  will have a better plot and actually make a sense  610 for now ,reality
first i really appreciate the feminist message presented in fury road more movies with this message need to happen in the beginning i was excited to see the women coming out on top time and again also the shift in focus from gasoline to water was a nice nod to modern global issueshowever fury road suffers from an unfortunate execution fury road was simply a beginning one very long chase scene and an end it was that bad i miss the variety of previous movies of which the chase scenes were a treasured component fury road lacked character development and plot to complement the chase scenes they needed to stop somewhere meet the villagers solve a problem  or at least provide some events away from the vehicles to break up the chase sceneall in all fury road was tedious and i felt like leaving halfway through the movie,reality
i quite liked this movie but perhaps not as much as i expected im generally pretty cynical when it comes to sequels these days because there are so many and a lot of them are terrible i was genuinely expecting this one to be good though i did enjoy it but it just seemed to be lacking a certain something im not sure exactly what the action scenes were every bit as good as what weve seen in previous films the look and feel were consistent with previous films so it definitely felt like a film using plenty of aussie actors like in the originals helped the story was a bit light but honestly i think the same could be said about the other films i thought the acting was pretty good theron was superb as always tom hardy had some very big shoes to fill as i thought he was good but he somehow seemed to lack mel gibsons presence in the role and faded quite a bit in comparison to other main characters the villains i found a bit underwhelming there was the main villain of course but i think that perhaps there were far too many lesser villains and it got to the point where you almost lose track of who the good guys are actually up against,reality
ive just returned from seeing fury road and on the ride home i was reflecting upon what i just watched ill start with the pros  nonstop action start to finish if your thing is watching crazy makeshift vehicles chase down a tanker truck and fire bomb harpoon and shoot it up it seems like this was just one long chase the cons  and here is where im disappointed  im a big tom hardy fan but he doesnt get the opportunity to shine here why not its like the third hobbit movie where the main character bilbo is reduced to a support character thats what happens to in this movie i wont even refer to him as because theres no backstory to let us know why should be plus the dialogue as in what dialogue they gave hardy like 30 words total to say how the hell is the guy supposed to build a character on that more time was given to charlize which is ok because she is such a great actress but how about letting her look a little better instead of the concentration camp haircut and the terminator forearm the special effects were great plenty of action but at the end when the kid overturns the rig wouldnt it have been more fitting to have an explosion then and another thing in this post apocalyptic world i guess there is just an endless supply of water in a desert huh i mean so much that with the flip of a switch gallons upon gallons can simply be wasted oh and another thing  how the hell did those old women survive out in the desert for like 7000 days according to therons character without any water and why would they have simply stuck around there anyhow if by their own admission the muddy area that the truck was getting stuck in had become a toxic site years before anyhow did george miller consider any of this when he was reviewing the storyline or did he simply take his gazillion dollar check to the bank made sure it cleared then said ok lets do whatever the hell we want now finally one last rant if i may  who the hell are the morons giving 10 star reviews i mean seriously overall im really more disappointed than anything else in this i think i would have enjoyed paul blart mall cop 2 better,reality
i watched this movie with my friends and we do agree that it is cool the costumes the cast and the whole things in the movie are greati know it was sequel movieremake i dont know how to call it as a nonmadfans we expected on first 30 minutes there will be some introduction or explanation all i remember was he was a cop and feel failed to protect othersok maybe after the chaos is over there will be some story about how world turn out to be such that place we waited until the movie was over and i still dont get the story missed some points and still confusednot all people watched the whole sequel or previous movie like me and i think they only targeted market for fans who ever watched previous movie onlyanyway sorry for my bad english ,reality
director george miller revisits his classic that recognized himself and star mel gibson by bringing the mythos to this new generation of filmmaking with larger possibilities to expand its universe and even its insanity and fury road is just as simple as that it just goes nuts on everything along the road the momentum is unending the visual inventiveness is relentless and it doesnt stop there it also instantly establishes its own world wonderfully even though its already been known before but even to the newcomers you can already see what kind of largerthanlife world this is this is the kind of utterly enjoyable experience that a true action blockbuster should beeven with a larger budget and much riveting spectacles the direction surprisingly stays loyal to its original style the pacing is brisk the possibilities of honest craziness is endless and they still shine on screen there is a bigger arc from its characters that relies more dialogue compared to the mostly silent road warrior but even so the story is still majorly told by the action the entire movie is a grand escape from a ragtag enemies of punks and cults chasing after the mostly sane heroes on a truck its a truly magnificent kind of action that rarely halts its totally straightforward missionand people brag about how george miller takes a break from this franchise for the likes of happy feet but to be honest his achievement there does benefit for this films visuals the exteriors look great example is the sandstorm that lead to an ultimate visual wonder that no other director might have thought about its genuine ridiculousness and even the transition following after that scene is terrific it may sound overly hyperbolic at this point but really miller has always been top notch in this area but it gets better with larger special effects where the imagination is limitless but that doesnt exactly defined the movies at all its all about the characters and their designs and their expressiveness and of course the cars the characters are just a variety of weirdness that each of them are immediately established by every detail of their looks and their attitude and their vehicles happen to be made out of scraps from various models which is totally fascinating worth mentioning is the ride that brings an entire band with a lead flamethrowing guitarist that is called doof warrior who steals every moment of his presencebut the action isnt a totally mindless smokescreen of destruction and explosions either there is real action happening on screen that is truly gripping with the heroes helping each other briefly yet clearly explaining each of their plights having handinhand combat surviving from some stunt and even a competition if thats what they call it of spitting fuel into the motors of their vehicles faster generic blockbusters would normally just throw away the spectacles but here these fast moving scenes are the story the acting is stellar tom hardy is solid as and the physicality alone buys what coolness this actor could bring to the character but the real star here is apparently charlize theron since her role gets more characterwork among and she carries the film terrificallyfury road is definitely one of the greatest blockbusters in years big budget blockbusters concern today usually tend to pick either light or dark smart or dumb deep or shallow or whatever but here it doesnt even bother it just sticks to its own spirit except of course with heavier effects and heightened insanity these qualities have often turned us off due to its losing of imagination and staleness but this film gives us a reason to love it again it makes us less cynical that big films can be as fun as the dumb bmovies we suddenly found as our personal guilty pleasure its just lively relentlessly fun while the story is simple it already provides too much of an excitement for one day and youll be hungry for more,reality
fury road is absolutely god awful there literally isnt even a story there it tells you nothing what so ever i was practically begging for the film to end so i could leave throughout the entire film myself and everyone else in the screening with me had no idea what the hell was going on for a good 20 minutes or so into the film you dont know anything you are told nothing and a clear storyline is not present you learn nothing about the characters the only persons name i knew by the end was and what the hell was with that relationship between one of those albino guys and that hot chick they spoke for like 2 minutes and they are suddenly in loving relationship thats also a good point why the hell are there hundreds of albinos that isnt explainedwhy do they believe in valhalla and shiz also not explained a lot of other things are left unexplained but i cant remember off the top of my head because im trying to forget i even went to see this film also am i supposed to know who these boss guys are and what there goals are because i have no idea the only redeeming quality of this film that i can think of is the actionoh and that guitar albino that is all the biggest shock of all though is why so many people are giving this film good reviews and comments i mean do you even know what a good film is people,reality
i never set my hopes high in order to avoid disappointment so i didnt this time either i went to iyesterday to see the movie with my friends and we almost walked out it could have been so much better whats with all that silly stuff whats with the stupid guitar and idiotic drums how likely is it to see that in supposed postapocalyptic world we almost walked out as it was annoying the hell out of everybody i am not the only one my friends who went to see the movie a few days ago were of the same opinion it could have been so so much better but for us it is those silly unnecessary things that ruined the whole experience action scenes were pretty good we all agree on that no way i would recommend it and please tell me this is the last one lay it to rest once and for all,reality
george miller is back stronger than ever the new fury road was nothing less than a perfection and it even outshines the previous movies it gets you hooked from the first minute until the very end without letting you take a breath out of the action its a thrilling nonstopping action movie with amazing visual effects and great actorsthe 2 lead characters are played by tom hardy and charlize theron furiosa and if anyone wonders how well tom hardy did as he was simply amazing portraying him he fits really well in the shoes left by mel gibson then we have charlize theron who plays furiosa and can i just say how glad i am that george decided to create such a strong female character who is the most badass girl ive seen in movies for a while her character was pure joy for the eyes she makes you feel what shes been through the movie and all of that while fighting and killing dozens of bad guys we really need more badass chicks like her in future moviesfury road is one of the best if not the best action movies in the last 10 years or so hopefully the movie will have huge success and well see more movies in the universe sooner rather than later hopefully my next review will be for furiosa and it will be for another awesome movie if you still havent seen the masterpiece  fury road in the cinema i highly recommend that you do its worth every single penny and it has a high rewatchability,reality
fury road finally hit the screens around the world and let me tell you the thirty years gap was well worth the wait the technical achievement is beyond anything we see these days because it combines the best of modern technology with good old school cinema cgi is definitely used as little as possible while stunts and special effects are put forward in this slice of madness tainted of nightmarish visions inspired by paintings of dali and goya the colors sounds costumes design and characters development are amazing and the film turns out to be something completely unique a savvy mix of action adventure and visual madness probably the only film after el topo that has had such an impact on me huge fan of the original trilogy this film manages to respect the old style but pumps up the adrenaline and push the pedal full throttle into 21st century what surprised me was the fact that mastermind george miller now in his 70s has managed to direct a film of an incredible modernity while younger directors today are incapable of doing something as fresh or as original as this film clearly a modern masterpiece filled with so much depth and visual elements referencing the stolen generation the gender issue themes of slavery  servitude redemption and human greed shot like a huge chase across the gorgeously photographed namibian desert the cinematography from john seale who came out of retirement especially for this film is beyond anything i have ever seen every shot is filled with so much elements so rich of details i think i just took the biggest slap of my life at the movies i highly encourage the audience to watch it in i3d because this film seems to have been invented especially for this technology i assure you films like this come only once in a lifetime and i feel blessed to witness the rebirth of the lone samurai and anti hero rockatansky one little regret mel gibson would have been a better choice than tom hardy who does an ok job but lacks the charisma and the natural flashing madness so unique and perceptible in the eyes of mister gibson thankfully charlyze theron is impressive with her shaved head and mechanical arm inhabited by a rare determination and burning the screen with her raw intensity she will surprises a lot of people thoroughly thought and built this film is simply the modern achievement we needed for the rebirth of the action adventure genre in all its glory one can only hope fury road will destroy everything at the box office this summer so miller will start work on his furiosa when the v8 roars at the start you will feel chills going down your spine and return to the state of a twelve year old witnessing the beginning of a new cult classic piece of cinema like we too rarely see these days as a screen legend said once  fasten your seatbeltits going to be a bumpy ride and a one,reality
bane attacks again disappointment too much ado about nothing no post apocalyptic atmosphere like originalmaybe i expected much more well at least i expected somethingmaybe i am more fan of old school moviesoriginals but so many mistakes in movie that are visible to an amateur a common watcher in cinemamask man it was so painful to watch him cut the mask from his head poor tomahh and the guy with the guitar what was on their minds when they put that irrelevant character it was like ok we will put a unicorn because i can id give 110 but then it would be pure hatred so 210 is a good mark,reality
i was actually quite hooked the first 1015 minutes the cinematography was surprisingly sublime for what i thought to be an ordinary action film the colours sounds and everything visual was just extraordinary at first but you need more than just that to carry a movie all the way to the end and this movie had absolutely nothing else to offer guns grenades and explosions cool fast cars trucks and monstertrucks banging into each other cool but when at least 80 of this movie is exclusively cars trucks and monstertrucks banging into each other while shooting and throwing speargrenades in high speed things get real boring at one point you sit and wait for a sorely needed turning point and when you think it has finally come you realize that its not a turning point in its common sense its a literal turning point after having followed the films unbelievably lucky main characters crossing the desert in a truck whilst fighting for about an hour they stop and do a damn uturn to do the same thing all over again and the action scenes are nothing short of repetitive how many times do we have to see charlize theron make a determined expression and then bang into the cars following her how many times do we have to see some white warboy throw an explosive spear cool for 20 minutes but for an hour and a half no long action scenes work only when combined with good screen writing and a good underlying story no amount of beautiful cinematography authentic explosions and whatnot can make up for the lack this movie has of the basics a good story and interesting characters if this film stays among the top films on the top250 list i will be ashamed to be an imdbuser in terms of cinematography and orginality this movie is an achievement if you like movies that dont give a damn about screen writing this is the movie for you if you prefer a film with substance save your money and your time,reality
fury road was a complete letdown and a complete crap fest of a movie i thought this was going to be the highlight of the summer movie season a movie season drowning in mediocre superhero flicks and resurrected dinocrapyes im looking at you age of ultron and jurasic worldi was soo looking forward to millers newest take on the franchise it is not even close to the first two movies and even weaker and worse than beyond thunderdome a crummy and unnecessary 3d conversion badly edited terrible script idiotic plot and meaningless storylineand just an incoherent cacophony of sights and sounds desperately grasping at some kind of nostalgic replaywhich doesnt succeed in the least the original trilogy is miles ahead pun intended people are just soo underwhelmed by the yoke of marvel continuously spewing their mindless drivel that they are trying desperately to latch on to any movie that seems or pretends to be different but fury road is not different from its spandex clad cinematic brethren the relentless nature and frenetic pacing are meant to convey the wild and crazy imagination of george miller but if miller was a visionary as all the promo captions loudly proclaim that was in the past 30 years ago now the most vision he has is what brand of adult diapers he will choose to buybecause this movie has nothing visionary about it it is just pretentious hogwash supported by audience members and critics who desperately need to convince themselves that this movie is the second coming anyone who thinks or says differentis to be shunned and exiled to the wastelandonly in the case of fury road that was namibia and not the actual australian outbackthis movie is supposedly rated r14a but i never got that feeling all throughout the movie there is more violence gore and mature themes in a single episode of the walking dead or game of thrones and also more qualitywhen tom hardy an excellent actor as turns out to be second fiddle to charlize therons an overhyped and overrated actress if i ever saw one imperatora furiosa the movie takes a sharp dive when they parade the victoria secret models aka the wives of the villain whose name iswhateverbecause he is irrelevant as the raison detre of the moviethen it becomes bad when the resolution of the movie is to return from where they started out after being chased for almost the entire movie in the opposite direction then fury road crashes burnsand finally becomescrap the original trilogy well at least the first two movies were a bigpunkrockcounterculture middle finger to mainstream society and the sociopolitical and economic environment of the late 70s and early 80sthe current incarnation is but a pale shadow fury road is a conformist corporate driven empty spectacle pretending to be something it is notoriginal and visionary it is a bythenumbers testaudience dictated exercise in mediocrityboy this will be a looooong summer at the moviesand not in a good way,reality
i love this movie before i knew it it had crept to the top of my favorite movies ive seen it about eight times because i keep recommending it to people and then sitting down and watching it with them but im still not tired of it in this movie takes a bit of a backseat to an indomitable amputee and her companions women from the harem of the local creepy old warlord furiosa is not the only powerful one eithernone of these women are helpless or onedimensional tom hardy delivers a stoic yet truly impressive with something like 43 lines the world is what i love most though george miller creates several utterly unique colorful fullyformed cultures and he doesnt waste the viewers time with backstoryhe assumes were intelligent enough to figure out relevant details and the rest is up to our fully piqued imaginations though the action is nonstop it never gets boring and drives the plot rather than distracting from it plus bonus points for a lot of practical effects instead of relying mostly on cgiin summary powerful disabled female character fantastic world engaging action my favorite,reality
as a response to all those who are claiming this movie to be a 10 i just couldnt bear to not vote this movie was 3 times worse than the thunderdome movie with tina turner it just does not add up really in any movie there has been a shortage of fuel and now all of a sudden theres plenty of it the shortage has changed it is now water that everybody seeks after but why would you not flee with a enough water no instead they flee the rock city with nothing to seek out a mystical environment only to find it poisoned beyond repair but somehow there are about 5 old ladys who have survived without water food or any other supplies and they drive back to a place they were running from reallyas for the good comments on the action as some claim that this would be worth the 10 rating i know everyone under the age of 20 has been brought up with inconsistent explosions and or over the top objects well youll miss then also in this movie which could have been a welcome change were it not one complete incomprehensible unsupporting set to the movie itself really it just doesnt fit the movie i was glad to have watched it on a plane and not in the theater advice to all go and watch the original movie yes i said movie and not movies as any followup movie in the franchise just messed up the originalif you are going to watch this movie mark my words you have been warned,reality
i dont understand why i disliked this movie i love tom hardy i liked the originals i like nobrain movies such as independence day starship troopers and highlander and yet i just didnt enjoy this at allwere there too many questions i guess the characters didnt engage me there was no set up to he just got nailed by the white guys at the start why was he then trussed up to feed them blood what was the purpose of this the white guy didnt seem to miss the blood later on what was the deal with the skull face guy and how did he have all these attractive females why did charlize theron decide to go rebel and why should we care,reality
one of the top worst movie that i have come across tom hardy did a good acting but the other could not deliver proper linesthe film very dull no proper story lines and and the stupid fight and the guys on poles everything from the action to the dialogues are wrong in this moviethe movie starts with tom running from a bunch of guys on weird cars and then the blurry visions get him caught and the captors takes his never ending blood then the most weird seen is when the women with their pumps to take breast milk and the grown up guys drinking just had my stomach upset its just yuckin three lines the movie is about the some women are chased by their captors with worst boom boom boom and then they kill the ruler and head back to the city from where they fcking started and the rulers men happily allows them in,reality
i really liked the road warrior so i was looking forward to watching fury road especially with all the critical praise it has received after watching it i am left extremely disappointed and can conclude that imdb rating system has some serious faultsvisually this film looked spectacular but underneath its beautiful surface there lies no depth whatsoever i found it extremely boring and was looking at my watch regularly the plot was so simple that a complete idiot could have written it it still had plenty of plot holes so perhaps a complete idiot did write it afterwards i read about how this film was in development hell for years maybe it never left lets be serious if it took you years to write that script then you should feel deeply ashamed then again neither hollywood nor the paying public will penalise you for not having any original thoughts or creative ideas especially when it comes to big budget action sequelsmost of the illogical events concern nicholas hoults character hes a warboy whos totally devoted to sacrificing himself for the bad guys causeuntil he fails has a cry then a conversation with one of the wives and then decides to join their cause instead when hes stowed away at the back of their tanker the wife sees him and instead of throwing him off their tanker again she falls in love with him after a brief conversation despite the fact he had previously been trying to kill her and her friends maybe she has amnesia and has a thing for pasty bald guys with silver teeth or maybe im thinking about this film too much too much being thinking about it at all because if youre happy to turn your brain off and zone out for 2 hours then it would be more enjoyablethe primary reason for everything shown in the film is because it looks good many other reviewers have pointed out that in a world with scarce resources its impractical to transport a flame throwing guitarist and his huge amplifiers around on a truck like most things in this film its never explained why in the wastelands its important to have a mobile stadiumlevel rock concert but it looks good though its never explained why charlize theron paints the top half of her head the next time i drive to work ill smear some grease across my forehead i might get in a bit sooner there maybe something in it and its never explained how she lost her arm or what purpose it brought to the movie disabled lead character tick another box in the diversity checklistso if you have an insatiable demand for watching cars flipping over and exploding then this is the film for you and if you dont mind a completely uncharismatic lead who mainly grunts nor a bunch of things happening that make no sense then youll have no problems here,reality
with such high ratings and some good reviews i figured to give the movie a try i went in with high expectations but i was seriously disappointed awfully long and boring with no reasonable plot movie starts out with immortan joe ruling over the post apocalyptic city because hes got all the water and gasoline feriosa apparently betrays him and takes his girls with her to an unknown destination he chases after her with his gang to claim them backgang includes a vehicle solely for the rock artist playing a flame guitar for no apparent reason after hours of endless driving and shooting feriosa and the girls manage to escape only to pick up some old women and return back to exactly where they left dialogue is weak characters are poor i couldnt even tell what the role of was in the movie in summary the movie is basically two hours of mediocre car chase and senseless shooting i am only rating the movie 6 because of the visuals pretty good save your time and watch the trailer because that as much fun as you would get,reality
the story is formulaic the character development is shallow weak and trite the plot is more biased than the original series which were more dynamic of a story as it had one side being bullied but it ended up with the man in the middle of both sides who were jockeying for power as they are both exposed for their partaking of greed and pillaging while in the seat of power this film is very one dimensional and has one side evil and the other side all great and noble instead of focusing on one mans motivations of intense survival andor revenge as the originals it instead played more into the act of a social tribalism with everyone just coming together pretty much instantly because they like each other for being beautiful with one side evil and ugly and the other side beautiful and very great even the crying and weeping scenes with the violins playing in the background probably have most experienced people thinking gimme a break as it feels contrived and unnaturalthe best thing about the movie the only thing really since it takes up pretty much the entire movie are the vehicle chase scenes and contraptions the rest is pretty much same ol same ol i would only rent it if its through a free coupon or on tv,reality
this film has an 85 currently which it in no way deserves considering the lack of any kind of original or interesting storylineyes there is loads of action it is beautifully shot and everything you could want from a post apocalyptic desert survivor scenario as far as they way it looks im sure it cost a load of moneybut what was great about the original low budget films was the angst of torn between the good and evil within himself hardy is a great actor but we dont see much of his talent and what we do see is too sketchy to really get a feel for his character theron is great too but once again there is really not much going on the other guy is quite good and the rest mediocre at best  with such stock stereotypical characters they did not have much to work withso if you would like to see a two hour car crash set in an apocalyptic spaghetti western future without the cowboys this if the film for you if you want something to think about dont bother,reality
i wasnt going to see it but i saw the 87 on imdb the 98 on rotten tomatoes and i was sold i like action and i like a strong female lead but the problem is i like other things like dialog plot and character development imagine saving private ryan if they stayed on the beach for the entire movie and half of the people getting blown up were womengreat action but very very shallow in plot dialog and character development great action movies to me have great action and characterplot development think matrix dark knight t2spoilers beyond this pointif youve seen it and think im crazy tell me the names of the characters beyond and furiousa did anyone care when furiousa got hurt or when the bad guy dies,reality
if you love the original trilogy you should love this all but the character of is brilliantif you love action movies you will love thisif you dont enjoy action movies dont botheri felt as though not enough was done with the titular character either they found out too late tom was a bad choice or they just didnt bother with tom had a few lines and grunts then didnt speak the rest of the movie there wasnt any explanation to what was going on with him the effort was put into charlize and nicholas characters these two shared most of the screen timeoverall very enjoyable just disappointing in some ways,reality
bald morons spraying their mouth with something for some reason stuff blows up and people scream and imdb community comes running with about 60000 1010 reviews what has the world come to the entire cast may have said about 20 words combined and none of them can speak clearly they all mumble in really loud cars pretty sure they couldnt hear each other at all cause i couldnt understand much but doesnt matter anyway all you need to know is boomem that nobody makes that stuff anymore pretty sure these guys couldnt have survived at all especially the main guy who apparently has some weird illness that might have made sense if they tried to you know tell a story instead theyre just like he needs some weird creepy stuff to make him badas soon as i saw tom hardy eat a lizard i bowed my head in shame and immediately regretted setting foot into the theater i find it hard to believe that the original director had anything to do with this garbage unless he has gone completely stupid or needed a lot of money or something i dont know but im sure he had hardly anything to do with this if he is of sound mind he should be ashamed and happy with all the money hes getting from this sell out heres a list of all the problems in this movie no character development couldnt care about anybody no story no back story no side story no explanation of anything no suspense no drama no acting bodies move no plot twist unless you count going back to the place they were getting away from which is really dumb no memorable scenes no memorable dialog no relatable characters or anything to relate to at all filmed in a boring desert they couldnt find a city in ruins for people running out of water they sure chose a really retarded place to camp this was poorly named its not a movie its a charlize theron movie heres a list of things to like soundmusic explosions prop designs on a grand scale for post apocalypse very cool in that regard so that earns it 3 stars heres a list of things they didnt explain who is i mean were talking 30 years later who is theron i dont even remember her name who is the bad guy i dont even remember his name i dont remember anyones name who are the women and why are they breeding cant they just breed with anyone why are they dumping water on a bunch of people from a giant rock why would they build that in a desert and where is the water coming from why are all these people here in this guys dump with him i mean what does he do thats so special that got everybody praising him and worshiping him how in the hell did theron get these special breeders out of their amazing fortress in a giant rock thats a lot of bodies to fit in a small compartment in a semi too man they must have some kind of stealth why is everyone a complete dumb ass except theron why is theron the main character in a movie titled why when they went all that way to the place theron wanted to go to did tell them theres no point in going on they need to go back hes the one who ran away from these dudes in the first place he didnt even know about therons place but now hes like i gotta go back to the place they captured me i could list a bunch more stuff like how are people on stilts surviving in the middle of nowhere but i just dont want to waste any more time on this movie ive got the feeling that they spend a few million on paying people to review the movie with 10 stars on imdb ugh i cant believe the mindlessness of people these days there is barely anything interesting in this movie it was 1hour 40 minutes too long extremely boring i wanted to walk out but paying 15 for this i kind of had to stay didnt i garbage like this is a dime a dozen lately if you like this garbage you will probably like the avengers hobbit hunger games i dont know how you can enjoy that nonsense but the masses rule our entertainment apparently money is everything,reality
2015 is gearing up to be an interesting year for hollywood a couple of anticipated comic book movies as usual a few remakes and reboots of course and finally the next instalment of the franchise after 30 years of absence weve all been anticipating it for too long as a fourth in the series was to be released 8 years ago with mel gibson returning as the titular character unfortunately 911 happened and the australian dollar collapsed the iraq war caused problems via travelling to namibia and gibson lost interest after series creator george miller finished the happy feet series he finally returned to the project with five storyboard artists producing 3500 art panels a 150 million budget and then cowriting a script with 2000ad comic writer brenan mccarthy and australian actor nico lathouris the world is an apocalyptic wasteland desert for miles and miles tom hardy experiences lucid hallucinations of a troubling past and is soon captured by a pale skinned cult ruled by the tyrannical leader king immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne who played the lead villain toecutter in the original 1979 while off on a usual gasoline run joes right hand woman imperator furiosa charlize theron drives off course holding certain cargo that leads joe and his assembled army to go after her with strapped on the hood of a car along for the ride an epic chase ensues with all the traps of the land and various gangs not so far behindwhat sets this apart from every other movie at the moment miller took particular influence from silent movies 85 of the stunts are all practical and 480 hours of filmed footage has resulted in a 2 hour spectacle that delivered way beyond what i ever expected for all the trailers weve seen with giuseppe verdis music blaring out loud the level of punk in this movie is far beyond anything hollywood has produced in years and surprisingly more violent than your average 15 rated feature even when its off camera it was like a mix between an old john waters and alejandro jodorowsky picture and recent japanese extreme cinema was the only modern comparison i can think of something miller wanted to somewhat approachtom hardy is our new and does fine work as always though he somewhat plays a supporting character rather than a leading role this time to me has always sort of represented the everyman rising to the situation and im already enthusiastic should tom return to the character again charlize theron somewhat stole the show for me which has led to some hilarious antifeminist responses from men and really was every bit as strong as they made her character out to be nicholas hoults character was surprisingly charming and no other actor or actress turned in a bad performance the criticism i would have is that while hugh keaysbyrne turned in a good performance the villain wasnt particularly imposing memorable or even felt threatening a discount lord humungous from 2 if you willi admit to having a weakness when it comes to the franchise because i have surprisingly enjoyed all of them but never really experienced them for the acting or even the cars i simply am a lover of punk and i adore the outlandish style over substance miller has crafted and exaggerated as time goes on while fury road has made improvements over the predecessors i still only saw a movie of style over substance the blueorange colour scheme was gorgeous music by junkie xl was suitable and the stunt work was so phenomenal it made me remember why i loved these movies so much miller stated in an interview that fury road contains 2700 cuts over two hours apparently thats 225 cuts per minute and while it all adds to this movies fast one of a kind style some of the clarity in the stunt work is sacrificed as a result studio movies gotta look like a studio moviefinal verdict when all is said and done came back with a large budget and i fell in love with it all over again instantly while the road warrior remains my favourite of the bunch this certainly aint your daddys gone are the desires for gas and bullets this one somewhat deals with human trafficking and surprisingly remained refreshing new and somewhat nostalgic loud and furious when the credits rolled i wanted to stay in the seat and watch it again and again what a lovely day indeed 1010,reality
i needed some time to process what ive just witnessed i was very skeptical about this movie but having miller behind it with hardy and theron in the lead it showed some promise however since the first trailer which i must seen have a dozen times i was sold i was hyped usually a movie cant meet those kind of expectations fury road blew those expectations out of the water this is millers magnum opus a labor of love crafted into perfection the story is simple dialog is almost none existent and still everything is told visually the devil is in the details with brilliant simplicity the movie manages to motivate ever character without the need to spell it out for you you just get it you understand these people and where they come from and what drives themthe world itself is completely but however crazy it gets nothing feels out of place the action is spectacular and non stop but unlike say transformers its not deafening and tiresome its well crafted and real with the minimal use of cgi its believable no matter how crazy it gets but most of all its perfectly captured you see whats going on it all its glory these 2 hours flew by and left me thirsty for more its one of the best action movies i have ever seen and ive seen a lot its also rare to see a movie put so well together i cant remember the last time a movie made it into my top 5 but welcome back,reality
firstly i must point out i like 2 roadwarrior quite a bit this one first thing that come to mind is that some fan of the original movie took good parts from that movie and blew them way out of proportions thats pretty much fury road in short musical score didnt go with the movie at all it was good but didnt fit the movie i didnt like the opening act and in my opinion it didnt offer anything that couldnt be done with a monologue i also didnt like that the movie was one big chase scene there was too much cgi for a movie like this some scenes took me completely out of the movie by how cheesy they weremy viewing experience was probably hindered by wanting to see a movie done in in old fashion and contain a story this movie also in hindsight seemed to be done with tongue in cheek style with lots of comedic elements surely the roadwarrior had those moments too but they were done with bit more class fury road with its cars felt like a comicbook movie in a marvel style and maybe it is best viewed as such to methey should have had some other title to this now its just something to bring in the fans of the originals who will feel disappointedthere were some quiet and almost awkward bits where characters were tried to build but they were interrupted by another loud fast paced action scenesthis movie certainly doesnt hold more than 1 viewing maybe to fast forward to some action bits but once they are done the movie is done,reality
without plot dialogues characters evolution absolutely a waste of time,reality
first time i heard about a remake i was excited i loved the old movies where fuel was really rare and bandits were always trying to rob the big oil tower bases ammo was a rare commodity too 1 stands out in that it was more like a family movie where they suddenly get chased by bandits but it was nice to see that the friendly monster they encounter at the cabin actually returns in 3 where has to fight against him in the thunder dome somehow they managed to have this remake have nothing to do with the original trilogy suddenly ammo and fuel are in abundance and all they do the whole movie is 2 hours of only driving and shooting everything they come across it starts off with fleeing the big evil city saving some hot chicks from abusers then halfway through the movie they somehow reach like relatives of one of the women and then decide yeah we should probably go back to that city though so then its another hour of driving back the same way of course again getting shot at and shooting in every direction imaginable add in some really badly done ccg crashes and you have this horrible remaketldr 2 hours of only driving and shooting having nothing to do with the original trilogy,reality
not really a spoiler this fury road is so far over the top as to be no more than a circus of pyrotechnics and gymnastic stunts youll find no story here any old silly plot line would do notice how the movie is cut off at 120 minutes exactly it could have been 101 minutes or 137 minutes or some other number and not made any difference too bad good promo for a video game tho ps each review is to have at least 10 lines of text this movies doesnt deserve tenline review thats too bad as i mentioned mel had a reason to fight that is his wife and child were murdered by the local motorcycle gang the movie is pitifully derivative for example the bad guy is a takeoff of darth vader how original the one good thing i saw was the location in africa that was wild with crazy table lands theron was terrific but in a meh role was she following the hollywood trick of getting a big paycheck for a blockbuster and then doing a meaningful artsy movie again too bad because fury road is no blockbuster just a bust,reality
i guess im the living proof fury road is an action masterpiece as i never particularly cared for the postapocalyptic setting and im usually bored by car chases and yet this movie blew me away setpieces are varied and exciting pacing is phenomenal hardy hoult and especially theron are excellent in fact charlizes furiosa is arguably the main character and one of the greatest action heroines in years whereas hardys is more like a man with no name archetype who gets involved in a preexisting conflict and rolls along with it storytelling is brilliantly sparse and economical in a cinematic age heavy with exposition and talking heads writerdirector miller keeps everything focused leaving minor details to the viewers imagination the war boys spray some silver stuff in their mouths before attacking what is it we can guess its some kind of drug used as part of their kamikaze ritual but the movie smartly doesnt stop to explain a secondary villain is named the people eater why another blockbuster would have dished out his backstory but here we can only imagine it as its not relevant to the plot the same goes for the bullett farmer for the mysterious stilt walkers inhabiting the swamp an so on even in terms of themes the movie has much to say about environment and gender politics but seamlessly weaves it into plot and characterizationand thats why fury road moves like no other action film in years910,reality
this is my first review on this page so please excuse my grammar and my writing because i dont know very well english fury road is one of my most anticipated movies of 2015 i was so excited to see this movie that a buy the ticket before the movie with 1 week and i was expecting at something big explosive and action fury road is without a doubt the best movie of this year by now one of the best action movie of the decade and one of the best movies that i ever seen in my entire life this movie was complete action stuns chasings acting screenplay directing was so perfect i dont have a single problem with this things and with the movie tom hardy in this role was so good but not that good as mel gibson who is one of the best actor of all time but im okay with that because tom hardy does a great job in this movie but for me the main character was charlize theron who plays furiosa she is perfect in this movie she gives one of the best female performance that i ever seen is a role who defined her career is a role that you will remember is a keyroleis a perfect role the directing was great the screenplay awesome the stuns the chasing the action was perfect this is that action movie that ive been expecting many years and finally it comes fury road it is a movie that you need to see is a very very well made movie that you will remember over years is a marvelous movie with great action great acting great directing great screenplay is an insane movie that you dont need to miss,reality
this story given excellent based on my devote to this saga not losing its caliber what much of this genre for this saga kept its bizarre content very well what indeed would this country go to if it allowed itself to become a wasteland most of it already is interiorly for those of map lookinggood to see familiar face of ctheron from her commercials and ridley scottprometheus movie she was admirably convincing in this part as one of two people bringing down the tyrant symbol all the people at story start wanted freedom what else is new those marvelous chase scenes need you allowing them to slowly show you why some vehicles appear how are well done againwhat i would like to see is this saga try showing this bleak future showing the earth allowing gradual rejuvenation rewarding humans for having learned respect of the earth they knew,reality
fury road is directed by george miller and stars tom hardy charlize theron and nicholas hoult and is the fourth installment of the franchise in this film rockatansky is captured by a warlords henchmen and is taken to their fortress and is held captive once he escapes he forms an unlikely partnership with former lieutenant furiosa who is attempting to protect a group of people she cares for and return to her homeland the action is superbly shot with no shakycam at all it consists of wideshots of chaos and anarchy throughout this film is filled with relentless action and intense moments which are incredible george miller directs this film beautifully and with precision so much so that i believe this film to be the best directed film of the year the acting is excellent especially that of charlize theron who portrays the persistent character of furiosa tom hardy is also great as the troubled character of who was previously played by mel gibson the film is a nonstop action thrill ride but it also has a significant amount of feeling and emotion to it especially scenes with furiosa some scenes get really emotionally powerful later in the film the film has an intimidating villain a layered main character with intriguing side characters and amazing stunts i well and truly loved this film it is undoubtedly the best film ive seen this year and is easily one of the best action films ive ever seen,reality
never mind the linear story telling its mostly void of the ingenious plot twists thats expected from movies with such high acclaim nowadays george miller proves with this flick that amazing story telling isnt confined within the now classic nolanesque formula the plot definitely isnt a psychedriven non linear intricate and obsessive compulsive piece of narrationit is far simpler than that its as simple and textbook as it can get the brides who are simply macguffin elements are being liberated by furiosa theron on their demand which causes a ruthless warlord named immortan joe keaysbyrne along with his troops and allied warlords to chase these renegades down on the other hand just stumbles upon the whole thing this time its not a personal vendetta nor a quest but just a grunting man of a few words sheer will to survive he just tags along in a way he is what kalidor aka conan was to red sonja 1985 essentialy its the female protagonists main story but a previously featured strong protagonist takes on the supporting role in favor of a new one a plotcentric standpoint would call this movie imperator furiosa instead of but it would just be wrong what would otherwise sound like a bitter critique of the plot that i have written up until now is actually completely okay when it comes to this movie because it works it just worksthe movie is all about creating a setting a realm a reality and conveying the story through that reality its all about storytelling through world building its the small minute details that have been sprinkled here and there within the movie that complete this setting and constantly feed the lore and thats all that matters the name at this point is not much different from putting the cthulhu label on any lovecraft short story from the 1920s is just a brand name to remind the viewer that this postapocalyptic flick is not any other but its that of the universeits a documentary in that sense an immense setting is being conveyed not through footage that runs hours on end but through a selection of events to give an impression and depth to the setting in the short runtime of a standard movie documentaries about the savanna would feature clips of a cheetah chasing a gazelle rather than 500 hours of idle footage or repeated failures of the cheetah to catch its pray this movie has 480 hours of footage most of it comprising of probably not so impressive chase scenes and failed stunt attemptsthe amount of details adding to the universe conveyed throughout the movie is immense there are hints of a more globalized setting to this postapocalyptic wasteland compared to the prior movies for instance truly radiating the feeling that the world has decayed even further than before the buzzard tribe in their spiked vehicles appear to speak russian among each other for instance immortan joes car and the the war rig are both lefthand drives finally the salt flats are probably parts of the ocean dried up and over time flattened possibly creating a land bridge to asiathe collective madness experienced at this point of the earths decay is successfully demonstrated the openmouth screaming scene of immortan joe while holding a semicrooked body of angharad gave me chills and while i was trying to wrap my head around it a premature cesarean section deadbirth scene hit me like a brick by the time i was watching the swamp people walking on sticks as if from a dali painting i had completely accepted the distribution of water extremely valuable resource among the common people through the most wasteful and inefficient method everthen there was the doof warrior which defied every logic the resources used to bring that monstrous vehicle along but was an in your face approach in presenting the constructed cultures of the setting the different clothing choices among the tribes the whole witness me ordeal whoever came up with these elements kudos you deserved every single penny youve earned off this film,reality
it is rare for reboots and remakes of classic or at least kind of memorable intellectual properties to not be conceived by major hollywood studios as a scheme to make a cheap profit without any regard to quality how about for a reboot to entirely stand on its own as of a week ago i could think of two casino royale and the dark knight and out from the bare and beautiful desert rides film mastermind that is what they call him in the trailer george miller revving his armed armored nitrospitting vehicle of a film fury road which i can safely call the best action movie of the decade possibly this century here miller employs a refreshingly streamlined narrative as the foundation of some of the craziest practical combat sequences entirely inventive set machine and sound design and surprisingly deep performances all combined to rewrite the rules of action filmmaking the plot never takes any ambitious twists and turns but it never really needs to especially considering how much storytelling is executed through nonverbal means the sandsoaked horizon the offroad vehicles that look as if they were taken apart and put back together again with bigger engines and more spikes and the primitive one tracked nature of each character provides everything that needs to be known about the environment miller implies countless stories about each character with little to no exposition and because the main characters of and furiosa have been assembled and presented with such care the performances especially therons become much more powerful it is almost as if the atmosphere around the characters has eroded them so much that they have lost any use for speech and seeing such a beautiful thing lost to a world man has inflicted upon himself really hurts on a level that no dialogue could possibly explain for the first time since ihavenoideawhen we have practical effects on the big screen the entire movie was filmed on location in the namib desert of southern africa and all of the automobiles were entirely functional because these sequences are filmed in real time with actors performing highly dangerous stunts such as vaulting from one moving car to the next on 30 foot poles they have an energy and risk surrounding them with twice the thrills of a film largely shot in a green screened room that will be saturated in cgi when post production approaches even scenes that have to be computer generated such as a blood red sandstorm that the warboys fearlessly enter exclaiming what a lovely day in insanity stricken jubilee are believable because cast and crew fully commit to millers vision refusing to let such a monumental concept ever feel cheap the cinematography captures the action in all its colorful glory never masking any loose ends of stunt work or pyrotechnicsmost importantly the film travels quickly while still retaining a shape and a core for all of its explosions and heavy metal guitar players rocking out on top of a roaring armored car with a flamethrower attached to the guitars neck the movie has dynamics when a sequence ends it gracefully fades out into quiet allowing time to contemplate over the destruction and the endless desert ahead as well as a moment to study the complex predicament that furiosa and the wives face when the camera sweeps through immorten joes armada individual motors and warboys fade in and out of the mix according to the cameras position when gunfire pierces brief tranquility it does not oppress the movie from each direction but rather it occurs in one corner of the theater and crescendos into the movies next event a filmmakers job is to make use of light and sound to create art and millers new film is crafted in those terms to the absolute highest caliber some may call fury road a dumb hollywood action flick they may call it one giant action scene but even if it does not require heavy brain activity to enjoy even if it has extensive expertly crafted combat sequences it certainly has a purpose fury road is hope in the midst of hopelessness a world where battered individuals will travel for hundreds of days to reach a land that might not even be there at the end of the journey in many ways george millers struggles with this films production which went on for sixteen years parallels and furiosas journey to the green place miller had no idea whether or not his efforts to make this film would ever pay off let alone if the movie would ever finish production fortunately for him and moviegoers alike fury road pays off in every definition of the term it is classic moviemaking at its best and an unforgettable film going experience grade a,reality
ive always liked 2 the road warrior and would often recommend it to friends but fury road the fourth movie of the series made me extraordinarily satisfied to a supreme and fanatical level satisfaction beyond belief like no other moment in my life it is hands down a nuclear bomb in the world of cinema even if you have never seen any of the last three movies george miller will surely be remembered as a giant of the movie industry because of this every single person walking out of the cinema could be heard praising the movie as a masterpiece similarly to peoples reaction to the star wars movies back in the days this was on a level of epicness that can barely be described the vast majority of people told me they were physically tired after seeing this movie because they burnt all their energy trying to mentally capture and remember everysingle moment of the movie the characters were amazing the level of detail was mind blowing the universe stimulated me the quality of the shots were perfect the stunts were gigantic and impressive beyond imagination and the amount of stunts was insane the whole movie is almost one nonstop adrenaline rush of beautiful shots i didnt know it was even possible to make a movie on this level,reality
well it has certainly been a real long time between drinks for the franchise and i must that that this latest release  or should i use the term power up the term director george miller used to describe this latest reincarnation  pretty much gives every fan what they would have wanted there is probably only one thing that anybody familiar with the original movies would expect and that is basically massive car chase in some really hotted up postapocalyptic vehicles okay the original didnt actually have anything along those lines but when you get to the second and third movies that is what you end up in the cliit seems that this time miller has pretty much ditched the plot  well there actually is a plot but you dont go to a film for a detailed and absorbing plot  simply for the car chase basically the movie has captured by a group known as the warboys and when one of their drivers furiousa suddenly changes directions and heads off into the desert they all grab their vehicles and go chasing after it so for about a third of the movie we have this massive car chase during which escapes and joins furiousa they then manage to outrun the warboys and reach their destination only to discover that there is basically nothing there so they decide to turn around to go back which due to the warboys still chasing them results in the rest of the movie being a massive car chase as i suggested this isnt some ordinary hollywood carchase this is a car chase where you have all of these hotted up cars that look like works of postapocalyptic art in and of themselvesthe funny thing about this film is that there are a number of posts about how this film seems to emasculate men okay i didnt actually read them but i thought that it was quite amusing to see criticisms of this kind laid against the film still it doesnt seem to have affected its earnings all that much or the reviews in fact most of the reviews that i have read use words along the lines of insane okay the thin strand called a plot that holds this film together is about how the renegade furiousa is helping the wives of the warboy boss escape his harem and furiousas former tribe was a tribe of women who after being reunited turn and declare war against the warboys despite that i would hardly suggest that this plot serves to emasculate men unless of course those men who are complaining of this have problems with their masculinity we need to remember that this is the world of where the strong rule and the weak are turned to slaves what does is that he overturns this order and gives power back to the weakis also a world of shattered dreams like the previous film beyond thunder dome the characters have this dream of reaching a green and verdant land  a paradise but this paradise does not exist in the end it turns out that the only paradise of any meaning is already being ruled by the gangs as such it comes down to a wrestle where the strong fight the strong it is just that one of the belligerents is using his strength to empower the weakit is also interesting that miller has created a much more psychological aspect to character something which we never saw in the previous films as we discover is forever haunted by the death of his wife and family having been killed by gangs during the time when civilisation was in the process of collapsing now he is just a road warrior that travels the desert reluctantly helping those in need while he is a loner he knows how to fight and he shows his enemies no mercy however just like the lone ranger that his character represents at the end of the film he turns and walks back into the desert,reality
this is a wonderful movie full of action that gives you everything you need plus more if your looking for a great action movie with a believable star and co star this is it they dont over use cgi and they dont try to give you a little bit of everything they just stick with what they do great some of the scenes in this movie non action scene were amazing very artfulthose of you complaining about lack of story and lack of character progression stop whining and see a movie that fits your needs if that is what your looking for you have to judge a movie based of what it is and what it is supposed to be this fell short no where if you want a story see a drama or watch another crappy action movie try to give both at the same time and end up with a half assed story and bad action sequences in all fairness given the situation the characters are in how else could they even progress which they did a great deal you just were probably upset because it didnt go down the typical road this movie is great for anyone that wants to see a white knuckle wonderfully crafted action movie,reality
it has been a long and troubled road to bring back to the big screen  but it looks like all the behindthescenes drama was worth it as fury road is the best action movie of the year and i would argue one of the best to come along in years what makes it work is the lack of cgi and the reliance on a lot of amazing stunt work as well as the impressive turn from charlize theron who raises the bar for action heroinesdespite being titled tom hardy really plays a supporting role the film opens with who has survived the harsh future where gas has become the hottest commodity but not without sacrifice he has lost his family friends and has earned his nickname wondering if he is or if its everyone else he is captured by a group of bandits run by immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne  who is hooked up to a machine to keep him breathing along with suffering from some nasty skin lesions but nonetheless controls his piece of the world thanks to controlling a source of water he keeps a harem of women breeders as well as an army of halflife warriors so named due to the radiation that shortens life spans one of his highranking warriors imperator furiosa theron is going on a run to gas town and bullet town not the most original of names for a supply run  but soon after makes a detoursoon enough joe finds out she has taken his prize breeding women and summons all the forces at hand to go after her this includes warrior nux nicholas hoult who brings his bloodbag along with him wouldnt you know it  so he can drive thus begins what is arguably one the longest and most impressive car chases in film history was filmed in nambia across vast deserts and canyons and about 80 of the effects are practical  stunts makeup sets and the like  and i think this greatly enhances the tone and impact of the filmthe film is very visceral  you feel the action the explosions gunshots crashes  its all very in yourface and unrelenting despite that unlike say transformers the action is also much easier to follow its intense and often overthetop but it never feels fake or cheesy and the characters  man if you want female empowerment in action look no further if theron could kill you with a look  she would have taken out entire armies with the dagger stares she throws out in fury road she cranks things up to 11 and never lets down on the gas and she is surrounded by a supporting cast  rosie huntingtonwhiteley riley keough zo kravitz megan gale melissa jaffer abbey lee and courtney eaton  that gives women everywhere a reason to cheer from toting sniper rifles and explosive spears to shotguns handguns and even knives  thought they may appear to be fragile and scared these women know how to fightthe men in the films given names like rictus erectus slit the people eater the organic mechanic and the doof warrior are all either twisted unhinged or insane  yes even himself isnt exactly hero material the characters all seem to suffer from some malignant sickness likely due to the radiation or mutilation they are mean ugly and ruthless when someone gets their face blown off or is crushed under the wheels of a vehicle you dont feel bad doesnt exactly glorify its brutal violence but neither does it shy away from itfor pure action youre not likely to find another film that delivers in such a way as fury road it never hides what it is but surprisingly for all this action it does have a good plot one that provides a nice commentary on how we view and treat women and the dangers of following the wrong man or even the right one sometimes enjoy the action sure but know there are layers under all that grit that make a lot more sense than all the mindless movies hollywood tends to throw at us,reality
4ury road is one heck of a movie while not as good as 2 the road warrior this film manages to breath new life into the mythos and has me very excited for any future sequels enjoyed this one thoroughly tom for you hardy kills it as and theron is a total unrepentant bada this is what action movies are all about god its so cool its justa really cool movie i cant stress that enough the main plot involves teaming up with therons furiosa begrudgingly at first but slowly gaining each others trust to steal a warlords prized collection of wives and deliver them to safety the simplicity of the plot allows for some beautifully well crafted action sequences set against an intensely colorful and gorgeous background this is just a well made well acted well written and downright entertaining addition to the saga its a ten from me,reality
spoilers ye be herei went to see this with high hopes and thats always a bad idea the action was solid the acting decent and the plot interesting none of those three things was outstanding though the cinematography for every action sequence was quite enthralling what we have here is a spiritual successor to the original trilogy can we please just forget the third film that works well setting the tone perfectly for future installments but which still needs work as a standalone production i for one would like to know how furiosa found and escaped with joes brides unnoticed how she came to be in charge of a rig in whats supposed to be a predominantly male society i have no problems with this but given the world structure it needs explaining how joe and his disturbingly malformed cronies came to be in charge in the first place and how lost his family i suppose a rundown of furiosa being taken as a child would be a good inclusion toowere given hints of these important points but no outright explanations which makes the movie feel like an outandout popcorn flick that is amazingly rated on this site my only major complaint is that the five wives were just there they existed only to serve the plot and added very little as individual characters and i have no interest in getting into the supposed feminist message here its actually antislavery and little else overall nothing is outstanding but nothing is terrible either this is a solid movie that should and will do well at the box office that will captivate audiences and that will ensure is reborn as a longtime series once again i live i die i live again,reality
first off fury road is no bad movie by any means the movie takes the viewers on a crazy ride that does not stop although the action is close to flawless it will never cover the obvious weaknesses in the ploti will say the acting for the most part is up to par and tom hardy and charlize theron does a great job and i found nicholas hoult especially good what makes the acting no better than it is is the bad writing the three actors have few lines and the ones they do have are not exactly hard to pull off further on as previously mentioned the action featured in this movie is very good however the action is pretty much all the same throughout the movie we get a lot of explosions blood and fighting but what you will realize after a while is that it is the exact same explosion the exact same blood and the exact same fighting the only difference being everyone driving one way then the exact opposite way this is what makes the entertainment turn boring  it gets stale as for the plot i have already touched on it they go one way then they go the other way while defeating the bad guy as weak as it gets basically what you are getting from the movie is what the trailer is giving you action on vehicles i was entertained to a extent while watching the movie but had nothing left when it was done i have not watched the earlier films and this installment has not tickled my curiosity if you are looking for action and crazy this is the movie for you if you are looking for a film with even a touch of meaning this is not for you overall rating 610,reality
to quote a different old mel gibson action flick maybe im getting too old for this spit tv censored version i honestly dont understand the seemingly universal praise of this effort i hesitate to even call it a movie because in reality its a two hour chase scene it certainly has its moments and i can appreciate the impressive real world stunts and explosions i also give it high marks for being exactly what it advertised itself to be a ballstothewalls insane action romp pivoting off the original films for me that romp played out like watching an insane persons nightmares over and over and over the first two acts grew tedious and became something to endure rather than enjoy then the third act hit and the last 20 minutes were amazing you almost come to care about characters even though none of them were bothered to be developed along the way almost,reality
unfortunately the main part of is absent there is no main male character there is no in this picture and the necessary component is really missingi remember mel gibson eyes speaking of his character madness i remember quite a few quotes from the original series i will forget the most of the fury road very soonthe rest of the characters is denied good development either original series was about characters the scripts were about charactersthat said i must explain why i gave this part such a high vote 7 the action part of the movie is really great in a perversive way it is like monster track madness feat cirque du soleil sometimes script gets in the way of this exemplary road action but dont worry it doesnt take much time,reality
i fking loved itthat was my initial reaction after walking out of the theater following the screening of fury road and 24 hours later i feel exactly the same trapped in a state of perpetual forward motion and absolutely relentless in its pacing its a jawdropping eyepopping mindblowing experience that sets a new standard for what audiences should expect from action filmmakingfrom the first shot of tom hardy surveying the wasteland the film shifts into high gear and never looks back its nearly a full 30 minutes before youll have a chance to catch your breath and even that respite lasts mere moments before the engines are roaring the bullets are flying and the characters are pressing ever onwardalong the way we encounter the major players in this post apocalyptic tale theres immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne a dictator who controls the only source of clean water and breeds a constantly supply of his war boys to keep himself in power furiosa charlize theron one of joes most trusted lieutenants and driver of the massive war rig and nux nicholas hoult a war boy with a surprising connection to who yearns to prove himself on the battlefieldand then there are the breeders zoe kravitz rosie huntington whiteley riley keough abbey lee and courtney eaton smuggled away in the cargo hold of the war rig racing cross the desert in a desperate attempt to free themselves of joes tyranny furiosas decision to defy her master and smuggle his wives away to her childhood homeland is the spark which ignites the fires of war and its not long before joe and his entire army  not to mention the surrounding clans  are bearing down on furiosa and but these women are no damsels in distress  quite the contrary in fact furiosa is every bit the warrior that is proving her mettle time and again throughout the neverending chaos and the wives are smart and strongwilled resolute in their decision to no longer be seen as objects but rather as people each character is given ample time in the spotlight and if anything its that winds up getting a little shortchanged herethe final chase scene during the third act of the road warrior has stood the test of time as one of the greatest action sequences ever filmed so its only fitting that it should finally be dethroned by the same director fury road feels like george miller set out to film a twohour version of that same sequence only with bigger cars bigger guns bigger explosions and of course a bigger budget everything about this film is big and thats exactly how it should be seen on the biggest screen with the biggest speakers and surrounded by the biggest audience you can findif that sounds exhausting youre not wrong  but its exhausting in the absolute best way possible i can honestly say ive never seen anything quite like this released by a major motion picture studio and warner bros deserves all the credit in the world for allowing miller to bring his vision to life on such an impossibly enormous scale fury road is a brilliantlydirected strikingly original film extending a defiant leatherclad middle finger to a genre that is all too often flooded with mediocrity and daring the rest of hollywood to elevate their game,reality
i rated 7 because acting cinematography vfx sfx are good but the script has logicless things water will never be gone from this planet water recycling is not a untrue thing did they even think about this even if water will be gone with some way can it be gone in only 40 years later it is impossible even we had the great nuclear war we cant see anything like this okey in this movie doomsday came out and all the water is gone but wait how the cars are working what kind of doom is this all the waters is gone with heat or something then why the vaporized waters are not going back to them with rains if the heat was a really big then how did they survived as i sad bad story but good content,reality
the movie is non stop action normally i love action movies but this was so much action they forgot about the ploti would highly recommend it if your male and under the age of 13,reality
i grew up with and loved the original movies and apocalypse is a big favorite genre for me that being said i did not enjoy this movie the first or second times i watched it and i will hopefully never try to watch it againfurry road is easily the most overrated garbage scifi to ever reach the big screenfalse flag critics thought it was going to win big oscars as a strike against the man for feminism or some garbage but all it ended up winning were sound and fx awards nothing important well not the big awardsi was actually offended by the terrible story stodgy acting and dodgy scriptit is easily one of the worst rebootsremakessequels of all time which is a scathing review in an era where more than 70 of films that open in cinemas circa 20102020 fall into this categoryi have loved theron in the past but her hyper feminism is starting to turn my stomach hardyis the title character sort of and had no lines and when you could make them out they were corny as hell in really weird inconsistent accentsi wouldnt force my worst enemy to watch this movie and certainly wouldnt chastise anyone who wanted to turn it off in the first 15 minuteseverything in the movie except the consistent color pallet crumbles under even the slightest scrutinyin all honesty anyone giving this more than 510 doesnt have a mind to review anything,reality
garbage film nothing on the originals chase across the desert tom hardy grunts a few times fin absolute sh,reality
fury roadit is unbelievable that fury roads director george miller made happy feet and babe but then he also made the original and hence that statement should be the other way around of course since this is almost 30 years since that the new version is at least 30 times grander somewhere george miller is yelling my movies action will speak louder than words and thats exactly what the film does it is a visual spectacle that redefines the sheer pace of an action movie narrative almost 90 minutes of the 120 minute movie happens on dirtkicking moving vehicles which just refuse to slow down when the vehicles stop you are gasping for air and feel like taking a shower but before u can regain your senses those mutated vehicles are running again of course words are not important whenever the action quietens you have stunted b movie dialogues which could have been better except for this hidden gem hope is a mistake if you cant fix whats broken you will go insane my only grouse with the film though was that whenever there is an opportunity to show unbridled gore miller flinches maybe cause a nc17 threat was peeking over his shoulder but the movies jarring metal soundtrack makes up for it the star if not the action would be by far charlize theron as furiosa a cold and calculating rebel who has balls of steel and then there is tom hardy as who is more insane than mel gibson could ever get see his eyes dart to and fro in a crucial cliscene the guy seems dead inside much like the desolate wastleand he dwells in and yet there is a craziness which lurks in him is not a perfect film and may age poorly but it is definitely the most exhilarating film you would see in a long time one word epic,reality
enjoyed watching it all the way through good soundtrack the cast was great just a really good movie to watch,reality
if you like intense action explosions and car chases through beautiful barron deserts this is a movie for you to some it up this film is nuts but thats why i love it i was on the edge of my seat the whole time and i really felt like i was part of the acton the movie is incredibly stylised and colours are saturated and unreal various moments are sped up or slowed down and characters strangely look slightly more animated than they do real i love this because it turned fury road into more of a piece of art than some dry boring movie like all of the marvel movies fury road feels unique that said this may not be your film because the whole movie is basically one long car chase with no massive twists to surprise you but i completely recommend watching it,reality
but a lot of action basically the entire movie is one big battle with a few scattered minutes of rest the characters barely speak and there are no surprising turn of events to speak of in fact i think it is the worst actionmovie ive ever watchedsure itll work as background noise while chatting on a day of severe hangover but  nah if you want to watch a proper movie with a story where the characters actually speak something unexpected happens the characters evolve etc any other movie will do,reality
i cant see the feminism everbody talk uncreative unattractive boring and long just a action movie with a random confusing and poor story a shame that charlize are part of this,reality
on a cow pie scale of 1 to 10 this is a 10 nonstop action to stretch a thin and ridiculous plot line to 2 hrs early on hardys acrobatics are not simply the stuff of ma fighting they are childishly unrealistic he meets theron and its obvious they are both running from the same common enemy  yet both continue to think they are adversaries perhaps in the future all will have forgotten the fundamental principle that the enemy of my enemy is my friend gas is scarce yet everyones chasing them with soupedup racers that burn more fuel in an hour than most of us do in a month bullets are prized items yet somehow everyones got oddles to spare  enough for hardy to fire warning shots at the girlsas some have noted the cg graphics are amateurish plot holes anyone how about continuing to drive in a sand storm or supercharging your engine by pouring gas directly into the intake manifold uh huh or on the return trip  presumably a few days later  the bad guys are still there far from their base waiting around forwhat therons acting is flat perhaps more because of the script than her own limited range hardy is the better actor but theres little for him to do with his wooden character probably more the writers fault than the directorswhat really bothers me is that so many think this is a really neeto keeno film it isnt its not even good escapism character development is minimal for the heroes and nothing for everyone else the plot is thin and unconvincing even if we stretch our credulity to a reasonable limit the high opinion speaks to the loss of aesthetic judgement so prevalent in this country  perhaps loss of judgement period,reality
is back in this thrilling and action packed adventure through a desert wasteland the actor who played did a good job hes not great like mel gibson was but he is good charlize theron is the best her character is a real badass the rest of the cast is amazing as well the villain is solid i liked him and understood him the film is shot beautifully the look of the desert along with the characters cars and trucks getting torn to pieces in the action sequences it was an incredible sight it is a movie where i really cared about the characters the director george miller did a fantastic job i remember watching this movie in the cinema it was one hell of a ride i hope there is a sequel to this movie i want to see more films like this,reality
i have seen all movies which focus on little story and full action those movies actually 3 parts released on 1980s where mel gibson takes the lead all those movies have intense action at that time but when we see them now we are not satisfied due to the current special effects used in movies and we grow by seeing them but this fury road is the complete action package for all action lovers it reminds me the 2nd part actually where the chasing scenes and trucksvehicles used in the film are nearly same this movie has a story just for a name sake and it is completely filled with mind blowing action sequence from start to finish tom hardy and charlize theron has given their best performance if you like action movie and if you are missing this movie then there is no point that you are action movie fan watch this without any disturbance at big screen or blue ray,reality
in an age where hollywood blockbusters look very similar where a major us city gets destroyed in almost every film i understand why fury road is a breath of fresh air it looks unique the art design and costumes are fantastic it totally deserves the oscars it wonhowever the story and characters merely serve as a vehicle for action sequences thats cool if you just like action but come on lets not act like its a masterpiece its an action packed thrill ride but nothing more the dialogue is clunky and even the action gets repetitive there isnt much depth to any of the characters except maybe nux who has the most character development in the whole storyin anticipation of this film i watched road warrior for the first time and i couldnt help but think about how much better it is in terms of scale it is a much smaller film but it is gritty and tense the world is brutal and a can of dog food is the best meal a man can expect in fury road people use water gas and bullets like theyre infinite the rules of the world dont make sense its inconsistent and it constantly breaks my immersiontom hardy is poorly cast and poorly written as say what you want about how crazy gibson is but he can convey more in one look than all of hardys grunts in fr combinedtheron is good as furiosa but her character is underdeveloped she has no arc she just is she suffers from being too perfect she has no flaws every bullet she fires is a headshot its boringimmortan joe looks cool but hes hardly as intimidating or interesting as the humungusone of the biggest things that was praised about the film were the practical effects but that is all undermined by having survive a fatal cgi car crash in the sandstorm scene he doesnt even get a cut all tension goes out the window after that partfury road is loud fast and in your face but its compensating for a lack of interesting story and characters it is the cinematic equivalent of dangling a shiny object in front of a cat sometimes thats all a film needs to be but lets not pretend its the best film ever the praise this film received almost makes me think the bar for good films has been lowered,reality
i only got around to seeing the original just about a month ago thirty six years after the fact considering the amount of favorable press this film got and the huge amount of award nominations and wins its already sustained i figured i wouldnt wait around so long to see this one probably wont make it anyway but thats neither here nor therenot generally a fan of these types of films id be less than honest if i said i didnt get a certain eerie pang of visceral thrill out of the whole thing the characters and action are so mindblowingly furious it makes it hard to keep up i also got a kick out of the odd names the writers came up with though if i were watching this without captioning i would probably have been totally losti dont know if it necessarily takes a warped mind to concoct something like this but then again george miller also wrote and directed happy feet so theres obviously a creative bone in his body to speak of where the vision comes from is probably the better question on a different day and in a different mood i might have experienced this picture entirely differently but catching it the way i did i have to say it was quite the experience,reality
im not in the generation that watched the old movies but i watched this one i usually love a good story in the movie but this one didnt have it it definitely had a red thread and you dont get bored but you keep wondering if there is going to be something bigger all the time and it doesnt anyway to the good part the movie is visually astounding and it is amazingly well done the few effects the cars the gritty dark feeling it really makes you feel like you are in a post apocalyptic world and the actors professionality just makes it go home perfectly perfect for a late night watch if you dont want to waste time on story but rather want to see nice and awesome atmosphere and action,reality
well im an aussie and i find most aussie films childishempty and devoid of any intelligence this one was no different i expected much more as i thoroughly enjoyed and loved the original films which is saying something for me i like to be entertained orat leastshocked when i go to the movies and this did neither i totally agree with the other negative reviewers and thank god someone else didnt like it yes it was visually stunning but thats the beginning and end i dont understand all the hype and incredible praise for this movie what is it about people that they are quite content to sit and watch 2 hours of mayhemnoise and confusion with no storyno script and no intelligence was there a plot i think so who is and why is he how do we know if we havent seen the originals theres a whole generation who havent even heard of mel gibson whos that at least it was a bit better than wolf creek the worst movie of all time,reality
 fury roadi have not have such an experience of watching a film for 27 years that was robocopthe characters in millers univers is completely consumed by his glorious world of madness tenderness humanity strength harshness and above all survival it is truly an magnificent canvas he has created one that will last forever and he has without a doubt set a completely new standard for the legacy of the action film so that in the future when people will be talking about the action film as a genre there will be an before fury road and after it is an actionoperait is a film about the beginning of man and the end of man it is a film about the myth of a man that came and then left again thanks to george miller for a new beginning it is as if i have been wandering around on the dry canvas of the action film searching for a miracle only to find illusions but you mr miller have finally with fury road given me true water filled to the brink with vitality madness sadness and a crack of joy as life it self10 carcass heads to mmfr,reality
tremendous its a nonstop thrillride with interesting though quickly drawn characters and some of the most economical storytelling ive ever seen it makes all other hollywood action movies look like theyre in kindergarten every minute brings a new indelible image it has a strong female presence with charlize theron as almost a colead to tom hardys both theron and hardy are wonderful with hardy giving a very different flavor from mel gibson i loved nicholas hoult as well and hugh keaysbyrne who played the toecutter in the original has a powerful presence as the major villain a masterpiece of its genre i loved it so much i saw it twice this week in the theater,reality
george miller gave up a medical career to direct in 1979 his directorial debut the film starred mel gibson as rockatansky an australian police officer haunted by the death of his family an excuse for car crashes and chase sequences the film was heavily influenced by the countless american road movies of the era duel twolane blacktop the driver vanishing point etc thanks to clever editing kinetic camera work and a cut redubbed by american voice actors it would become one of the most profitable movies of all timeis said to take place in a postapocalyptic world but a better term might be preapocalyptic millers heroes have normal jobs normal family lives civilisation has yet to fully collapse and oil shortages are only now beginning to warp society dystopias on the horizon but not yet hereby the time we arrive at the road warrior millers 1981 sequel our world has fully descended into anarchy feral gangs abound nuclear war has killed millions and survivors have sequestered themselves in makeshift fortresses meanwhile the madness that caused this calamity  a global economic network reliant upon incessant oil  has led to an almost religious obsession with petroleum in road warrior oil is life oil is survival and everyones desperate to get their sharewarrior like george romeros dawn of the dead which similarly expanded upon a lowbudget debut made an overnight superstar of miller essentially a giant chase movie the film delivered audacious stunts and jawdropping choreography but more interesting was the comicbook world miller created with its grime smeared denizens warrior kings bizarre names lord humungus and imaginative decor wed seen postapocalyptic worlds before but nothing quite like this road warrior was edgy but also camp homoerotic and aware of its silliness the film mocked the very machismo which fuelled its apocalypse even as it bathed in testosteronenext came beyond thunderdome 1985 the franchises third instalment it found mankind having fallen further society drenched in nuclear radiation and sprouting tumours the character of had himself devolved into an archetypal loner rarely speaking always brooding as it was only codirected by miller thunderdome suffers in comparison to its siblings its the most watereddown most conventionally shot picture in the franchise and whilst the first two instalments embraced their exploitationbmovie roots thunderdome reeked of hollywoodthunderdome was a lousy way to end a franchise released in 2015 fury road resurrects and reinvigorates millers franchise like lazarus on steroids directed by miller himself now a 70 year old grandpa the film opens with tom hardy being captured by the war boys the henchmen of a warlord known as immortan joe is then dragged to the citadel a giant fortress in which joe lords over thousands of inhabitants early sequences brisk but brilliant sketch the workings of this society with its class hierarchies its exploitation of men and women its milk pumps its foodwater shortages its battles with cancer and blood poisoning its militancy its psychotic obsession with oil honour and warfare and its quasireligious devotion to all things immortan joewhile attempts to escape joes prisons another character plots a similar escape shes imperator furiosa the immaculately chiselled charlize theron a onearmed woman who attempts to flee the citadel in the war rig an 18wheeled oil tanker with furiosa are sex slaves who are tired of being treated as baby factories joe wants his slaves back and so gives chase what follows is essentially another giant chase moviein terms of conceptual design nothing in fury road has quite been done before the films vehicles bristle with gun turrets armoured plating and hidden compartments some resemble hedgehogs others are outfitted with bungee chords poles ramps harpoons spikes and manic moraleboosting drummers subwoofers and guitarists most of these vehicles are crewed by the war boys brainwashed footsoldiers who foam at the mouth and spew ecstatic war cries when the boys arent using exploding spears to slay cars like wild buffalo theyre worshipping chrome and dreaming of valhallafurys first act ends with furiosa and joining forces to evade joe riding the war rig hard they head deeper into australias churning deserts joe gives chase with a mighty convoy of vehicles throughout these sequences largely plays second fiddle to furiosa a woman hellbent on survival is just along for her ride for nowfurys final third begins with convincing furiosa that home exists not out in the desert but back at the citadel ones responsibility implies is not to run and restart but to reclaim and repair unlike recent ecothrillers interstellar colony pandorum snowpiercer etc road fury thus espouses revolution not relocation and so with plant seeds and suggestively named feminists the vuvalinis in tow and furiosa head back to the citadel much patriarchycrushing carnage ensues fittingly its only now that begins to blossom into the protective hero were familiar withan instant genre masterpiece furys awash with deep reds and cool blues sophisticated trash the films aesthetic collides 1980s kitsch with 1970s comicbooks and grindhouse its script  minimalist yet rich in detail  only occasionally missteps millers third act is far too frenetic for example his revolution wholly clichd see instead land of the dead and he unwisely rushes through his films beautiful moments of downtime like sequences in which furiosa does running repairs on the war rig or gazes wistfully up at night skies intelligently shot composed and choreographed fury roads almost too classy for action movie fans who are likely to miss the films finer points or dismiss millers formal control and madcap idiosyncrasies though a better actor a miscast tom hardy lacks mel gibsons aura charlize theron and nicholas hoult are excellent at times even soulful8510  see lorenzos oil and judge roy bean 1972,reality
tom hardy as in for a treat i thought charlize theron well if anyone can match tom hardy playing  i thought  then charlize can as for the storyline with such a legacy and a bit of dosh how can you go wrong i thought opening scene tom munches up a twoheaded lizard alive hehe funnnneeeyyy good start i thought after that the whole thing goes tits up you hardly notice it at first because youre just sitting there sucking on your smuggled popcorn waiting to see some serious action wrapped up in great acting wrapped up in a riveting narrative and there certainly is plenty of action in fury zzzz but its of the wrong grossly overdone silly kind the acting is stilted like everyones been dubbed over in body as well as voice the storylines cheap and nasty with a dialogue to match good points music score definitely cant think of anything elsehave considered giving it 1 star as a punishment for wasting such huge resources  and 2 hours of my vida  on this surreal parody of errors wannabe but settled on 5 because of the soft spot i have for hardy on account of just having watchedloved him in child 44 and because therons buffness has fresh inspired me to drop yoga and take on some army trainingin other words move along folks nothing to see here,reality
i am a true tom hardy fan but there is no f way i am going to support another film about the survival or humanity that excludes all races except whites it would have been very refreshing if the directors vision included the striking presence of lupita nyongo and michelle rodriquez in fact either of them would have made for a much more interesting actress to work opposite hardy however us film makers prefer to maintain a lilly white version of the present and future humanity even though whites will soon be a minority in this country i am totally sick of it and i will not support this film or others and suggest that other persons of color do likewise,reality
yes this new is a non stop chase movie without a real story which some people complained about but this doesnt mean that the movie is disappointing the other way round i really felt a film after years what the action movies are lack of these days is heart and soul and this movie got it right most of the new generation blockbusters have lots of action digital effects high technology maybe magnificence but without emotion and spark hollow movies this movie is not a bluster movie somehow there is a drama in the background there are chases but not for the sake of it we care about the characters as for criticism as he was not the hero or star of the movie it didnt frustrate me while i was watching the dark knight rises i was always asking where is the batman where is the batman because batman was like a cameo in the movie is different is there waiting for you i mean it works here somehow everything works well in the movie the story is if there is one is plain and simple but somehow it works perfectly story development is not powerful but the movie doesnt need that maybe only flaw of the movie is the underestimated villains the master director george miller doesnt do justice to the great villains of the film a great villain is another thing that new generation action movies are lack of we rarely see the main bad guy and his henchmen especially his muscled son are not effectively used in the film the villains are intimidating and haunting but mostly they were more like pawns in the desert however this is not a big problem everything is done as it should be as for tom hardy as a fan of him it was a pleasure to watch him again but i couldnt see him as he was more like the son of the than our old original character however i liked him as a character mel gibson could have joined the cast as a cameo but it seems that he didnt want to do it what about furiosa hype that has shaken the world well charlize theron was remarkable but dont expect the most legendary character of all time in movie history or something not unforgettable but a very gritty character portrait the girls were charming and their story was sad but maybe their surreal existence was out of place in the movie the opening scene of the movie was disappointing for me but then the movie turned into a breathtaking non stop journey an amazing freak show with fuel machines fire and blood the action scenes were an example of incredible technical craftsmanship i just want to congratulate all the cast and crew for this hard work in comparison with the original old trilogy a powerful story with a development is missing here but as a separate film my favorite film of the year so far there is tears there is fun there is fuel and there is blood,reality
i saw this movie twice for the first time it was awesome as an action movie it works great i dont know if anything i have seen in this movie makes any sense but the setting is crazy enough that you dont need to bother asking why they are doing what they are doinghow ever as a movie and thats where the spoilers start im not quiet sure what to think about it first of all its basically the 2nd minus much of its story the interceptor gets wasted some people with an alternative lifestyle try to flee from some kind of humungus kind of guy on a huge truck lots of things get blown up and decides to go its own way i liked the idea that the people in the citadel are separated into castes like the warboys or the mothers but i it could have gone deeper and shown some morei also wonder how the bulletfarmers and the gastown boys are related to all that they just unite their force at some point and chase the tanker so there really should have been a tad more background story to fully understand that id say a 7 is appropriate because the chase in this setting is just fun and the 2 hours feel really really short but as a movie id say its somewhere behind beyond thunderdome in terms of atmosphere it also does not feel as dark and hopeless they dont seem to suffer from any kind of shortage like in road warrior where the lack of fuel is all present the differences in the story is that in one movie they flee from forces from the outside and in the other one they escape and try not to brought back both movies got a super sized villain but the originals humungus was more suitable plus his sidekick wez was more badass an inmortans whole crew combined tldr great nonstop action that should be watched without thinking to much about the other movies if they added that his family had been killed they didnt right it would perfectly work for its own,reality
the action is spectacular the cinematography is gorgeousbut the characters are too flat that mainly is the fault of the writing plus tom hardy and charlize theron are pretty subdued throughout i know that mel gibson has had his problems but his electric presence would have been better than what hardy does its one of those things where it doesnt matter if is supposed to be two decades younger than gibson is now they should have still had gibson in the leadit becomes tough to care about most of the characters for the most part except for nicholas hoult as nux one of the villains drivers he at least has a story to tell and it is more interesting than everyone elsesthe villain is immortan joe played by no one other than hugh keaysbyrne dont recognize him with the whole mask and getup here he was the lead villain in the original yes the toecutter himself its super cool that hes back as another villain here but hes unrecognizable which cuts down the impactthe film score is by tom holkenborg aka junkie xl he does have some good moments here especially some ethereal synthdriven moments along with percussiondriven ones but the rest of it is fairly straightforward actionmovie stuff of course probably nothing could come close to brian mays first two scoresthere are many fun touches here and there mainly the guitar player guy whose sole assignment is to play power chords while chained to the front of a massive vehicle that is basically a mammoth speaker stackmeanwhile except for the main compound where the vast society lives lorded over by immortan joe there is little world building even with a budget over 10 times what thunderdome cost and over 30 times what the farsuperior road warrior costeven though george miller proves he is a much better director than whippersnappers a third his age the story is a bit too thin and the characters dont have the emotional punch they could have had 7 out of 10 stars,reality
this reimagined film is deserving of every positive review it has received its one of those most rare things a major hollywood action film with a meaningful plot an emotional soul and very important points to make about politics despotism gender roles and ecology yes its extremely violent its a film but the story assumes that modern society has fallen and brute force rules in the resulting scramble for resources you dont tell that story by filming folks engaged in diplomacydirector george miller pulls very few punches here humans are set against each other as enemies in furious vehicular battles and are shown using each other as fodder as shields as meat targeted in their cross hairs its not for the squeamish sam peckinpah might have flinched a couple of timesthe film carries some cautionary aspects theres only one person of color in any primary role and women are shown endangered and exploited yet the core of the film is imperator furiosa a female warrior played with grim ferocity by charlize theron she seeks redemption for the bad things she has done and is willing to chance all in a risky hurtling plunge to escape her living hell she and as played with brooding taciturn energy by tom hardy form the tautest of action duos a partnership driven at first by accident then murderous animosity then edgy distrust and later by mutual respect is only reluctantly saddled with the role of knight errant hes a battered cynical doubtful vagabond pressed into helping furiosa through a gradual escalation of increasingly bad crazinessthe plot follows furiosas rebellion against one of the more fundamentally brutal despots committed to film a warlord named immortan joe who holds absolute sway over a teeming cluster of humans because he controls the only dependable fresh water supply for thousands of square miles doling it out from a cliff top keep called the citadel his body is racked by radiation deformities he breathes through a mask styled as a death grin and his progeny suffer from chronic birth defects he essentially holds enslaved a captive harem of women whom he calls wives but the women have no choice in the matter furiosa a trusted mercenary fighter for joe launches her longplotted revolt by smuggling five young concubines out of the citadel in a tanker truck war rig a vehicle with such a rugged beastly aspect that it becomes a character in its own right the air intakes on its supercharger breathing in the desert air lustily as the behemoth thunders forward like a mechanical dinosaurimmortan joe is extremely angered by all of this he brooks no interference with his expansive lordship and absolute power do not become addicted to water he admonishes his vassals it will take hold of you and you will resent its absence joe is played with psychotic relish by hugh keaysbyrne who also played the bad guy toecutter in the very first film joe froths and seethes with malignant furor discovering furiosas betrayal he unleashes his dogs of desert hardscape war a cadre of true believing fanatic war boys who ride a gloriously outlandish collection of vehicles styled after glossy but mutilated classic cars the mayhem beginstwo other similarly antisocial warlords join joes trek for revenge upon furiosa the people eater is the ruler of gastown a refining enclave to the south he has a deformed foot and a disdain for joes family problems and then theres a reckless firebrand known as the bullet farmer a man who still has the ability to manufacture ammunition who lacks patience for joes tactics which he considers far too gentle so water gasoline and bullets form the power triumvirate in this twisted pseudosocietytensely allied now with furiosas party runs fights hides a stray skinny war boy nux nicholas hoult realizes the error of his thinking and joins the group but before that change he is an imprint of the personality cult immortan joe has created as his lone vehicle continues to trail the fleeing war tanker into a dangerously violent electrical storm he exclaims in rapture oh what a day what a lovely dayduring the last third of the film the tanker meets a band of deep desert survivors women called the vuvalini and we learn of furiosas tragic background its at this point her despair finally inspires into a pragmatic suggestion the tactic suggests is a calculation which equally weighs their options the risks and the ethical demands of the situationnow i must say i find utterly ridiculous the criticisms leveled at the film by various mens rights groups who decry it as a deliberate attempt by hollywood to trick men into going to see a seemingly masculine action flick only to discover to their distaste that its really an extended piece of feminist propaganda one oftquoted post bitterly complains nobody barks orders at thats a mindset not only ludicrous but seriously lacking in testicular fortitude a hugely ironic fault in such a misogynistic argumentwith this reboot george miller has hit a grand slam home run clear out of the park of typically low hollywood action expectations this one sets a new bar just as saving private ryan did for war films in 1998 fury road isnt just a great action film its a great piece of social commentary full of sound fury swirling red dust crashing vehicles explosions and enough little bits of petty madness to fill several typical action mill flicks fury road delivers the bang and does so without being braindead on the contrary the heart and thought embedded here are strong enough to inspire some heated debate and a long list of critical plaudits whens the last time you recall an action movie doing that,reality
let me but this as bluntly as i can this is the best action film ever made in the history of cinemaforget that the action is all done with mindblowing practical effects my friend couldnt believe me when i told him that after the film was over but the actual storytelling was excellent the story was pretty thin but its the way that it was told that made it so amazing even the characters themselves have a lot of subtle and great development that bring a human touch to a world so full of insanitybut the action scenes one review put it perfectly the first car chase in mm fr is the best in movie history but the worst one of the film that pretty much sums up the rest of the movieoh yeah and the opening shot to the film is the best opening shot to a movie this year without question it isnt grandiose like the avengers opening tracking shot but its so gorgeous too look at i wanted to pause it in the theater just to admire it9010 action movies are slowly making a come backfirst john wick then kingsman and now this please keep it up hollywood no more cgi feasts like f7,reality
this movie wasawesome i have seen this movie twice and plan to see it again in theaters it is by far the best action movie i have seen in yearsthis movie doesnt only live up to the original three movies it might actually be better than them this movie is action pure action no matter how hard i try i cant think of a scene in which there wasnt well choreographed action but it wasnt dumb action there was a strong plot backed up by strong and compelling characters aside from this movie being pure action it is packed with strong performances from tom hardy and charlize theron tom hardy kills it in this role and he only says like 5 lines charlize theron gives a thought provoking and emotionally resonating performance that added undeniable depth to the movie this movie is a must see a,reality
this will be hard to properly score is it a good movie definitely is it a good movie well that is a tougher calli feel that tom hardy was horribly miscast i trust that george miller having directed all four movies knows what he is doing but even if we accept that this was an intended shift in personality i do not feel its for the better 30 years is a long time since we last saw on screen but i am not convinced that his modernization went the right way we went from witty and visceral portrayal by mel gibson to pretty clueless and almost contemplative version as acted by tom hardy on top of this his madness is unconvincing told through flashesflashbacks without context and in borderline cheesy manner with over 400 hours of footage if these were the best expressions or reactions that editors could find then i guess the actor simply does not fit i could see someone like travis fimmel as much better  where madness would be apparent instead of implied or spelled out this all just gives way to everything that is great about the movie charlize theron is stunning maybe for more experience maybe for greater charisma but this is much more her characters furiosa movie then  hence my title above she exists in stark contrast to tom hardy conveying believable emotion and more importantly motivation onscreen she handles all emotional consequences and is the projection of all resolutions is charlize the new ideal for cold blooded action heroine possibly i would very much like to see more such roles for her especially since she now proved that what she did in prometheus was just bad directingscript not her lack of talent great job the best i saw from her since devils advocate i disagree that other characters are undeveloped what characters this is universe  a playground for key protagonists with everyone else relegated to little more than propssome people are already displeased by script but lets take a step back and see it in context of entire series now this is a script  a story about ride from point a to point b and back to point a nothing more nothing less then what first three movies were all about i was happy to see that it avoided some obvious clichs  nobody is truly selfless and nobody goes out of his way to sacrifice his life and the best thing there are zero deusexmachina moments a true surprise nowadays my only issue is that nux was an obvious red shirt and id love if he survived cannot have it allsetting is executed to near perfection wasteland universe is not heavily used in commercial fiction we have just a few computer games and even fewer movies book of eli ugh but millers rendition of post apocalyptic tribal culture is solid with great integration of contemporary symbolism into fictional future expression well be mcdining in valhalla and movie is visually stunning i watched jupiter ascending the night before which tries to be rich in style and while this is not similar in execution it tries to achieve the same effect and it blows anything seen this year out of the water raises the bar far above where it lingered for quite some time and it will be interesting to see if anything comes even close soon no sense to talk more about the visuals  go see it if only to see it in actionfor me it is 510 it deserves more i would love to give it more it is an outstanding achievement but sadly my disappointment with intended main protagonist makes me downscore the movie possibly more than it deserves,reality
i dont see the point in this movie utter crapfrom the bgeinning to the end makes no sense to me,reality

first unbelievable  it is that franchise could be so wasted i am slowly or even quickly getting used to the lowering of quality in almost all sequels they get worse and worse year after year but nothing prepared me for the fury road it was almost univocally acclaimed by the critics  it is the second unbelievable how could anyone like it what can be possibly liked in that disastrous pathetic movie first  himself where is in this movie there is just some pathetic loser who has no well he has nothing no charisma no strength no brain no ideas no mission  nothing the rest of the characters  not better than the worst part is a bunch of the supermodels who apparently have just had their hair done nails polished facial and full makeup applied in a world of dirty ragged apelike cavemen where did they come from they just doesnt fit it hurts eyes and brain the special care for them is not plausible they would have to produce lipsticks creams powders eyeliners and so on the story  plain stupid a movie doesnt need to be very deep it is actionoriented but here nobody knows what and why shehe does the decisions are random we can not feel the story it simply doesnt look real we are not in this world we dont experience it we just sit in the cinema watching something boring by the way it is but the lead character is some chick i know nowadays girls must be the main characters in the movies or a girl and a man but if it is really necessary why just not do a princess imme why to do a laughable in all of the old parts there was action blood violence and something deeper here is only action violence is on a naive kindergarten level and it may sound paradoxically but action is boring,reality
what is wrong when pulp movies like this can get a high scores by audiencesdoes that mean these are faked does that mean people are very happy when they see a exceptionally standard fullmovie chase without any depth plot or content whatsoeverjust a lot of explosions some shooting some weirdos going whaaaaa most of the time a few sideheros get it for the sad emotions the real heros get away with everything and can fight along even with arrows through their bodies is that all it takes nowadays does this say something about the current society where content is replaced by fake news and cheap amusementthinking is not allowed we need cheap amusement in order to distract us from the fact many need two jobs to make ends meet if they have jobs at all while the rich finance movies like this to keep us distractedthe fact that movies like this can get high scores and even win oscars says something about society i fear,reality
as many movies fury road threw one straight into action in the beginning the opening scene often can seems to be out of place and throughout the movie you start to realize its meaning however unlike other movies never came to that realization for 1 hour and 55 minutes i lived in the false expectation that the movie would turn and the guys would stop driving their cars in a coachellalike environment when only five minutes of the movie was left i understood the mistake i had make by not pausing the movie when i first sensed something was odd do not loose time and temper by making the same mistake as i did,reality
a one hundred and twenty minute adrenaline shot absolute carnage in the desert and all shot with awesome grungy violent and most importantly physical actionimmortan joe a tyrant of a blasted and wasted desert after earth suffers a nuclear apocalypse controls all supply of water for his downtrodden citizens he also holds sway over his five wives imprisoned in his citadel but when one of his subordinates attempts to rescue these women he is led on a gasoline fueled chase across the open desert while amongst all of this a traumatised loner named gets pulled into the frayback in 1983 australian director george miller redefined the action genre with his sequel the road warrior to the 1979 a film with so much vehicular chaos and destruction it was praised for its physical stunt work and world building now in 2015 we get miller returning for a rebootreenvisioning of the same story but fear not this is millers baby and it is in good hands fury road is exactly the film it should be like 2012s dredd it is a one trick pony but the ace up its sleeve is undeniably astounding capturing the precomputer generated age of the 80s and 90s the film is a visceral and eyepopping spectacle of carnage of the highest caliber made even more so by the current oversaturation of action filmstom hardy takes on the titular role as a man haunted by the death of his family shown exclusively through jarring nightmarish flashbacks beside him is charlize theron as imperator furiosa the warrior woman with a bionic arm who defies a tyrant to free his slave wives immortan joe is played by hugh keaysbyrne who played the part of the villain toecutter in millers 1979 all of the acting asides perhaps the angerfueled immortan is downplayed but not forgotten here the film shows rather than tells with hardy barely speaking at all outside of an opening narration therons furiosa very well steals the show as the character with the most to lose a worthy note should be given to nicolas hoult xmen days of future past who disappears into the role of one of immortan joes pasty pale war boys people argue that theres a lack of characterisation here when in fact there is plenty to progress the story and make you understand their motives what this film lacks is unnecessary quips oneliners and exposition dumps all which can bog a film downbut the action takes centre stage here and the budget delivered towards the vehicle costume and character design and construction near everything is practical effects you cannot watch it and not appreciate how everything looks my eyes were on stalks just taking everything ini actually cant think of anything wrong with it it is a grisly film a visceral film with such an astounding visual style that has been long forgotten abouttheres a truck in this film covered in massive drums amps and on top a blindfolded dude suspended in bungee chords with a double necked guitar that shoots flames how how can you not like that,reality
firstly like most big budget films nowadays this film is going back to an old franchise to guarantee interest secondly hey lets make a woman the dominant powerful character thats a very original spin nowadays and lets just pack the film with so much action noise and explosions that no one will get bored that should guarantee a great film eh wrong people are sick of remakes and films retreading old ground men who tend to be more into action films than women are getting pretty sick of being forcefed feminist agendas all the time make films where women are somehow physically more powerful than men if you want by why do it with a film called and as for the story well like most action films nowadays it leaves me cold back in the 80s90s good actions films were stories with action thrown in they were involving adrenaline pumping exciting and they had likable memorable or charismatic characters that you cared about this film fails on all counts,reality
in 1988 roddy pipper and sandahl bergman made a bmovie about rescuing a bunch of beautiful women being kept for breeding by mutant frogmenit was no masterpiece campy dialogue head slapping special affects silly action sequences an idiotic plot every young male fantasizes to live vicariously through carefully crafted 2d caricatures not characters intentionally laughable villains but because the movie understood what it was and did not try to be anything else it was humorous and an enjoyable 96 minutesroad fury is essentially a frogtown remake but with all the common sense decisions of frogtown left out the movie is one giant action scene loaded with expensive and pointless special effects whose sole purpose is to distract the audience from the complete lack of plot hollow characters without any personality and almost no dialog unlike frogtown the villains here are unintentionally laughable but most tragic in the failed and misplaced attempt to force a genreincongruous theme feminism all the humor of frogtown is lost and with it all the adolescent charm of its predecessor,reality
got this in the 4 bin at walmart on black friday what a waste of money i want my 4 back i dont know how this won or was even nominated for an oscar the dialogue is stupid like it was written by a 7 year old that got ahold of magazine for the first time the sped up frame rate during action sequences had me checking to make sure i didnt accidentally hit fast forward on the remote control some of the action was interesting for about 2 seconds then it just went on and on so boring i saw an interview with george miller in which he stated that he probably wouldnt make another one lets hope that this is true and we are safe from any more garbage like this now i know why the 2 main stars fought so much during filming they were fighting to leave this crap film,reality
honestly my rating for this is 25 stars but somebody has to vote to negate the high ratings by people who apparently are suffering from some form of dementia preadolescent notsmartenoughtoread dementia  look for it in the dsm6rwhy i would give it 25 stars if i didnt need to do my bit to balance out the stupidity here in ratings is that i thought the production design was pretty yes skulls and flaming guitars are goofy 14yearold boy fantasies but if you look into the four cultures they portrayed there was actually some thought behind the design for each of them i like the wasteland the lack of water the end of civilization the surfeit of sepia but as with the original movie i wondered where theyre getting all this oil now if it is the end of oil that precipitates the crisis theyre sure burning a lot of itthe whole breast milk motif certainly is creepy but creepy not about the charactersabout the filmmaker whose aberration is already in the dsmwhen i realized there never was going to be a plot i watched the second half at 4x and dont feel i missed a thing,reality
i did enjoy the movie but i didnt like it does that make sense if you are a fun you are going to like it and yet hate it at the same time the acting was ok i loved the music but i get this feeling that this movie is not made to have as the main character but furiosa and the love story of nux tom hardy hardly lol says a word in the whole movie and that kind of itches me y know in conclusion not a great movie its okay to pass your time but not something special to get 82 out of 10,reality
i love these types of movies but an 80 plus rating is laughable makes you think no believe that the makers of this movie hired a couple of dozen slackers to sit around and write glowing reviews for this 60 at best movie and 60 is pushing it lots of action lots of explosions slow middle lots of action lots of explosions ending tom hardy is as stiff as a board enough gas water and bullets to last 10 lifetimes this is not sad is more like it that being said sit back and enjoy a funny crazy action packed explosion of a video game and dont try to keep up with the characters they all die ps the best part of the movie is the old lady who is a dead ringer for blossom rock grand mama from the original addams family she is it it lol,reality
i watched having not seen the older films since i was young and without reading any reviews or any preconceptions about what it would be likemost people will know its an action film but it really is just that i found it difficult to get absorbed into the movie because it was very cgi driven and whilst technology has moved on it was still too obvious that many scenes were graphical the very few lines of speech in the story were all very cheesy and poorly acted had only a handful of lines but they were not done well  i would argue he wasnt even the main character there was no attachment to any of the characters and no concern about their fate  even when there should have beenthe story could have been written on an a4 sheet of paper and the rest of the film was all about action shots in vehicles in the desert followed closely by more of the same just when you think you might see something interesting it just sends you right back from where you came more vehicles more desert more fightingthis is a pure mindless action film but its mostly the same kind of action all the way through there is barely any story or character development it is a blockbuster in terms of the scale of action but that isnt enough to give it more than a 6 out of 10how this has 83 on imdb at the moment is crazy mindless action lovers giving it 1010 and those who loved the original enjoying more of the same when it comes down to it most high budget films are worth the watch for the spectacle and i do enjoy most of them even if theyre not technically great films in this case my main feeling was that the movie was just rubbish and i wouldnt recommend it to any but action lovers,reality

watched fury road for the second time last night cousin is in town and insisted on seeing it with mei want to start off by stating i dont dislike this movie parts of it i found really exhilarating primal caught myself clinching a fist during an action sequence more than oncebutoverall the character of rockatansky felt extremely shallow to me i tried to take this at face valuein no way relating him to mel gibsons just couldnt do it there simply isnt enough there we know as much about rockatansky the guy the film is named for as we do coma the doof warriorshredding out on his flame throwing guitar had coma been given real hardcore solos in his scenes something really musical as opposed to just straight shreddingand some crazywild back story i think he would have actually stolen the entire damn movie out from under theron and hardy had actual cities and towns the road warrior had the refinery and the bandit camp thunderdome had barter town and the kid oasis foundations to help hold the moving story up fury road has what a whoping 45 minutes of citadel we hear mention of gas town and the bullet farm but we dont see them we never get to understand why the bandits attacked furiosa in the war rig for being on their patch it just happens things in this movie continually just happen if youre lucky you catch a tiny shred of back story to them in the end this is one long giant car chase bout what it boils down toone thing this movie almost gets completely right the war boys they hands down own this movie some flashback scenes showing insane indoctrination and drive training would have totally fleshed them out and made them the undeniable stars absolute insanity on wheels insanity on foot insanity in the way they speak they are awesome as enemies maybe something to build on in the future war boys  high octane insanitythe stunts as usual fantastic cinematography wonderful music a but even after watching this movie twice on the big screen i still feel it only deserves third place in the long line of es the road warrior fury road thunderdome i would have gladly spent another 30 minutes in the theater had they placed just bits and pieces of flashbacks alongside the more important characters,reality
this first part is without spoilers the visuals are good the acting is good the action is good but becomes boring after the first action sceneand there is little to no story heres a summary of everything that happens spoilers gets captured gets sent out with the people that captured him as a bloodbag to bring back some women that escaped the car is in crashes gets free and cooperate with the women the others are after to get to the greenplace a long car chase they get to the greenplace but its gone they get more people in the group they make a plan to take over the others base they succeed,reality
wont be writing long review because there is nothing deep to say about the movie for the entire movie i was waiting something to happen and then  movie ended no depth no thrill just couple of well known actors and lot of money spent into special effects and one big disappointment at the end i think maybe 5 is too big score for this movie very average but watch it if you have nothing better to do that would be all and i just hope charlize theron didnt cut her her for this role but its not all that black i would like to see what happens next now when they clamed that citadel i think thew will be making sequel very soon,reality
let me start by saying i loved as a kid and gibson was half the appeal of he truly melted into the character and made it his own ill start with the good truly epic effects which is what i went in knowing id see the explosions the cars the scenery it oozed with road warrior goodness truly beautiful and breathtaking never an overkill especially not for this movie it felt like a rollercoaster ride from hell i never do ibut wish i did for this film sadly i will not rewatch itthe somewhat bad tom hardy is a very talented actor in this movie i just had a hard time seeing it it being throughout the movie he is given a handful of dialogue and most of it is very quietly spoken somewhat like the from thunderdome however other than the intro i found hardys boring and one dimensional even his accent was bland and completely unlike mel gibsons there was his first line in the beginning of the film where it was super scruffy and hoarse voiced australian and the rest of it felt like bane without lines the location of this story is australia the people should probably be somewhat australian sounding i was quite upset about hardy because i know what an amazing actor he is especially when given a great piece of writing this was not it thoughcharlize theron as i said before this movie was centered around furiosa and the pregnant girls she played her character well and i think thats because theron always does exactly what directors tell her and i can respect that i dont think charlize theron is majorly talented but she does what shes asked of in respect to direction which is a commodity in hollywood and a blessing for directors eve ensler when i heard this i dropped the movie by a star why was this movie partially written by the chick who developed the vagina monologues this is for effs sake are you kidding me i feel her input took away from the realistic scenery of a postapocalyptic world 130 lb charlize theron in a fist fight with 240 lb tom hardy riiiiight women all placed in sexually appealing clothing and somewhat exposed so the message is all the men are disgusting vile evil people and all the women in the movie are sexy beautiful model types that can do no wrong riiiiight i learned that apparently george miller is a feminist and i lost a lot of respect for him although i dont believe in feminism his opinion would not keep me from respecting his craft or watching his films i lost respect simply because i dont care for political messages forced into any movies that im unaware of prior to entering into and whether or not you want to believe this movie was politically charged doesnt matter this movie was not about i just pray that the next installment actually includes him in his own movie and what was with the guitar guy i really couldve done without that i mean i get it these people are crazy and sadistic but the guitar dude strapped to amps seemed kind of lame maybe it was a cool scene in i,reality
in the best possible waygoing into this movie i feared that all the hype might be too high an all out action movie receiving a staggering 99 on rt is very rare however i can assure you the hype is met in fact this film exceeded most of my expectationsfirst off i have to talk about the cinematography simply put its staggeringly beautiful the camera moves around these wild car chases in such a fluid way its almost poetic the colors of the barren desert are eye popping and every grain of sand on the ground is captured in such detail now the action it is just insane yes i had to use that word again and the best part about the action is the rawness and grit of it my hat goes off to george miller who at his age has achieved sometime outstanding the direction of the action is what makes it amazing beautiful wide long takes mixed with quick pace editing it is something to be witnessed on the big screenthe soundtrack is also perfectly fitting harsh unforgiving intense when a moment of tension arrives it is enhanced by a subtle yet prominent soundtrack which gives it that extra edge in the climoments of the film the soundtrack begins to rise in tone and give the car chases and absolutely epic feel another great aspect of the filmone of the only tiny mini little gripes i had with this film is the acting yes charlize theron and tom hardy are excellent as the two leaders of the film however the supporting cast especially the wives had some moments of awkward and forced dialog it didnt seem natural even nicholas hoult had some slight moments that took me out of the movie and seemed like an actor playing a part nevertheless i absolutely loved this film this is the reason i love movies it is the ultimate form of escapism you go into the theater sit down and just get lost and have a great time for 2 hours it is the purest form of entertainment exactly what this movie was supposed to do i believe this film is a milestone of action filming and shall be remembered that way for a long time,reality
this movie is getting so much hype and buzz that people would have you believe its oscarworthy well nothing could be further from the truth i was bored after the first half hour zero character development the barest minimum of backstory a silly plot that is essentially one big uturn and no acting to speak of all the bad guys are faceless and nameless and the good guys arent much better its like playing a shoot em up video game where you just go through scores and scores of identical bad guys blow up lots of things face off with the big boss and rescue the princesses by the end it takes summer blockbuster to a new low  i mean the special effect action movies tend to at least have some likable characters and a little bit of humour and maybe some decent oneliners but this has none of the above unless you like watching two hours straight of things exploding this isnt for you two stars for the beautiful namibia scenery and one star for charlize theron but thats it,reality
who are the target audience for this movie might be difficult to find a description for certain groups if any actually exist in the sober world should this film be lauded by the academy with any awards other than the odd technical nod  then they could be doing themselves an injustice it could be just another nail in the societies coffin a pointing to its being a consumers club for self promotion and then theres this talk of direction is this truly anymore than a big screen version of a cgi computer game a nonstop repetitive exercise in senseless blood letting come chasefest the most honest and intelligent credit among an endless list is the one requested by the dti it tellingly reads produced with the assistance of the department of trade and industry south africa who does not accept any liability for the content and does not necessarily support such content they at least had the good sense to see the inherent dangerisis see the west africa and the full non muslim world as rubbish to be annihilated and this crude but expensive tosh sets out to prove it problem is it will entertain them and convince them to continue their pursuit dont kid yourself it wont this probably brings us to another target audience bikie gangs and hoodlums of every persuasion movie makers seem to pander to every want of the worlds thugs yes even the sophisticated variety knowing they will invest in tickets and more for the cause enter yet another very likely target group the ice crazies addicted to nonstop grotesque computer games try working in a physiologists clinic or hospital these days this ugly moronic outing helps signify the end of intelligent entertainment and hints mr miller could be reaching that stage all once were good movie makers come to and sadly dont see the writing on the wall till it all falls over george once helped audiences grow up now its all for the quick buck yes you will make money from those that go because of the hype and noisy violence but take a close look at the follow up word of mouth so many most revealing reviews posted from the folk that matter most the audience seems a sad fall from the grace that was once yoursps loved the review from the viewer who wrote words to the effect if this is where award winning movie making is going then stop the world i want to get off im thinking many might join him,reality
was looking forward to it after watching the real years ago not bad but samey and rather boorish a constant scene of moving vehicles wheres tina wheres mel wheres a decent soundtrack there could have been at least one change of scenery american movies are continuing the trend downwards boring with lacklustre endings as usual im trying to think of something good to write oh yeah the acting was ok the vehicles were real gone the makeup and masks etc were great and my wife is asleep and doesnt know the dishes arent done yet on another note its good to see a movie that doesnt have a sex scene in so the kids can watch it makes me wonder the mentality of movietv writers to have to include sexual scenes or references to nearly every movie or tv show yeh should have done the dishes,reality
having waited in anticipation for this modern remake for quite some time ever since the rumours first originated i have to say that i was a little disappointed it was a pretty standard attempt to recreate a cult classic which i guess you could say is typical of hollywood not to mention the opening line of the movie  my name is my world is fire and blood is justwell cheesythe cinematography on the other hand was unique with some exceptionally vibrant graphics colours scenery and action yet this wasnt enough in my eyes to rescue the movie from the sheer lack of suspense storyline and any opportunity to express any level of talent or emotion from the characters the complete opposite of the likes of say game of thrones it seems the focus these days is more about all out action hype and special effects rather than substancealthough this movie seems to be based on 2 which is understandable considering the first really just set the scene there was no introduction to the history of how the world was in the sorry state that it was in or any real agenda the entire focus of the movie was built around one concept which was a singular action  chase scene from start to finish this is such a discredit to the original trilogy and such a shame considering the 150000000 budget spent everything was in place for this to be a master piece right down to every outstanding little detail in costume and sceneryif you genuinely want to know what and the media spread hype is all about watch the original 2 and 3 if all you care about is all out action eg if you are 1215 years old watch the remakenot to offend anyone but the 1215 year old comment was a joke i grew up watching the originals countless times when i was younger which may explain my biased review never the less i believe it would be an injustice for anyone to base their opinion without having watched the originals,reality
is not supposed to be about convoluted plot lines talking heads scenes and a world that makes sense what it is supposed to be over the top post apocalyptic world punk  heavy metal imagery  cars trucks and bikes and all that good stuff and this movie delivers the plot line is super thin but gives you what you want a 2 hour car chase through the desert with absolutely stunning stunts beautiful shots and crazy crazy crazy characters designs and action furiosa  charlize theron was a surprising choice but works quite well and is the main character of the movie this is my only beef with the movie tom hardy could have had more impact  be more present as other than that 2 hours of pure fun,reality
impressive movie i initially went with the idea that it would be another one of those new wave movies like age of ultron to my surprise i was deeply and emotionally engaged in the entire film and time went away without telling the entire movie was so incredibly forceful where the struggle for one last freedom in the futuristic world is possible but not without struggle and help from all direction it make me think that even though life in this universe has existed in different worlds at different times but ultimately all elements of life are always wanting truth and freedom at the end must see movie at least once if not three times i am hoping there will be fury road 2 ,reality
this is probably where tony abbott is taking australiai find all the 1010 reviews very suspicious it was a run of the mill dull dumb action film the plot consists of a chase up a road and back again im not kidding ive just read that i have to write a minimum of 10 lines of text for this review thats a bit ridiculous considering the script cant have been much more than that bizarre fact the directors last two films before this were babe 2 and happy feet mind you the intelligence needed to understand this film is way below the 15 years requirement to get in to see it,reality

i dont know why people are complaining about this movie all of them are saying that this movie is disappointing but i was actually impressed seriously who wrote this moviean apocalyptic story set in the furthest reaches of our planet in a stark desert landscape where humanity is broken and almost everyone is crazed fighting for the necessities of life within this world exist two rebels on the run who just might be able to restore order theres a man of action and a man of few words who seeks peace of mind following the loss of his wife and child in the aftermath of the chaos and furiosa a woman of action and a woman who believes her path to survival may be achieved if she can make it across the desert back to her childhood homelandwhat i like about this movie is an originality once again some crazy people wrote this movie just look at some scenes some characters seriously where the hell did they found that dude that looks like a baby and is fed with baby milkalso some people are complaining about tom hardy starring i was really happy with it no im impressed again i really like his hallucinations of his past charlize theron starring furiosa did crazy as well her hope for better tomorrow was done well these mothers are done good as welli also really like visual effects that effect of sandstorm is amazing seriously my jaw drops after sometime sound effects and soundtracks are done good as well i really like that dude that is playing some crazy looking guitar at the front of the car there is not much dialog which i really like this movie is concentrates on action not on the story telling also well made when i first saw the trailer i was likeanother movie but i didnt watched the first trilogy but what i really like is that this movie is not connected with other movies you dont have to watch other movies i think i watched the third movie but i didnt like it much you know cars and stuff not a fan of race movies or gamesthe action scenes are awesome i was creeping out while watching those scenes i dont know why but i was i really like their spear with a bomb on the top dont know where that came fromat the end i think this movie is the best movie released this year sharing first place with kingsman the secret service i have to say if you already didnt go watch this movie,reality
totally surprising movie experience first post apocalyptic roadmovie ive ever seen george miller doesnt let you look at watches while watching this because you just dont want to finish this ride forever stunning sooo much details and even interesting story and background philosophy purpose to think about at first i was like hmm aanother actlikemovieblockbuster but when i sat in the cinema and saw opening scene it was really promising music camera action actors screenplay environment details and total crazyness of everybody on the screen what a lovely day miller really did a nice job even on film tricks and stunt actions most of physics was trustworthy it also kinda reminded me the matrix one hero with his team can bring victory to all the people will he survive will he die whats the matter of this war for nothing all of these questins will be asked with such a tasty way in both od these movies now im gonna have some aqua cola and fresh milk p,reality
if ever a movie deserved to be called action filled this is it i would guestimate well over 90 of its length is action it begins with a 45 minute i timed it action scene and never really lets up after that the slow moments are like slowing from 60 to 30theres the one mandatory scene of exposition reveals and tad of emotion but its relatively brief and little if any romance or even much sexual tensionaction action action with nary a moment of dramabut good special effects great stunt men and women if they werent cg good music good cinematography good editing and good use of musici preferred the original im 66 so of course i did precisely because it didnt have the production values of this one which are fully hollywood it somehow made it eerie in a way i liked more of a feeling of the lone hero a la eastwood than this onesomewhere theres a thread complaining that this movie is obviously feministic propagandagood grief lets be clear this is a movie it has no message no deeper meaning and isnt the least bit feministic we have both hero and heroine who has a more than passing similarity to sigourney weavers alien roles even the haircutoverall enjoyable but boring unless youre rather young its ok to see just keep your expectations solely limited to actiongregr,reality
what a lovely day for fury road not it has characters that you dont care for if they live or die this movie is way over hyped dont fall into this best movie ever trap i dont know if the actors were desperate to be in a movie or wanted to cash grab but these people tom hardy charlize theron nicholas hoult hugh keaysbyrne nathan jones zo kravitz riley keough rosie huntingtonwhiteley abbey lee courtney eaton directed by george miller need to rethink their career path tom hardly was a big let down tried to be a thriller with epic explosions but it fell short this is not a summer blockbuster just a rental at best i explained my dislike more here httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvarsvfsorqgg,reality
i am honestly not that generous with my 1010 ratings i assure you and yet this is the third film out of four in the franchise that i awarded with a welldeserved 1010 rating next to the lowbudgeted but tense and progressive 1979 original and the phenomenal 1981 the road warrior fury road is the third bona fide  unhinged masterpiece in the series only beyond thunderdome i rated a little bit lower due to a weaker second half but even that one was highly enjoyable all this makes one of the greatest  perhaps even the greatest  movie franchises in history it doesnt matter that this fourth installment only reaches us nearly three decades after the others and it doesnt even matter that a new lead actor depicts the legendary titular character george millers dystopian post apocalyptic world perspective is still 100 perplexing adrenalin rushing and mindblowing from start to finish fury road is a highoctane pun intended scifithriller adventure with nightmarish characters dazzling stunt work incredibly insane plot situations and  guaranteed  the most grotesquely imaginative set designs vehicles base camps death traps ever created and you know what is the best part of this all almost everything in fury road is real by that i mean real stunt work with manually manufactured vehicles that are driven by real tough guys  and gals  in authentic desert locations instead of computer engineered effects or cast members stupidly miming in front green screens lone drifter rockatansky roams around in an uncivilized wasteland regularly haunted by hallucinations featuring the restless spirits of his deceased wife and child and gets captured by the minions of the tyrannical selfdeclared demigod immortan joe this creepy dictator is about to be doublecrossed by the rough gal furiosa who secretly hid immortan joes beautiful breeding girls in her massive fuel truck and plans to take them to the green oasis where she was born joe sends his war boys after them an army of sickly albino freaks that practically orgasm whenever immortan joe even looks at them the most ambitious war boy is nux and he chases furiosa with attached to him as a living blood bag there are many sub plots twists turns and bizarre escalations but they are all worth discovering the most fantastic thing about fury road are the downright marvelous vehicledesigns i swear the people who thought up and created the cars and trucks for this film are real geniuses for sure there are trucks with the coachwork of volkswagen beetles monster trucks with old mercedes coachwork processed into them pickups with caterpillars sand buggies covered with metal spikes and many many more perhaps the craziest gimmick of them all is a war boy with a rock guitar that is attached to a truck and his only reason of existence is to incite the rest of the troops the almighty george miller also penned down some of the most nightmarish yet intriguing supportive characters like corpus colossus the deformed midget son of immortan joe the people eater a creep that constantly rubs his own nibbles and the bullet farmer fury road is cinema in its purest form see it and dont just wait for the dvd or for the film to appear on netflix or whatever this is a film you have to experience at the cinema on a gigantic screen with the best possible sound effects sheer brilliance,reality
role in this movie was as significant as brad pitts role in 12y years a slave well to be honest was not needed at all and the most important question was and the good news is no he was not in fact he was absolutely dumb list of people who were interestingly 1 immorton joe 2 all the warriors half deadborn who wanted valhallah 3 furiosa the decision of escaping involved both madness and courageduring the first 15 minutes of the movie was 1 a brisk lizard eater obviously because lizard cant eat him instead 2 a gruesome fighter who can try to escape from the prison just to be caught againduring the remaining movie turned out to be 1 a guy who scares unarmed innocent girls with a pistol and ends up getting bashed by a girlfuriosa 2 a very calm composed and silent person who actually doesnt look violent at allmore like a saint 3 a man who doesnt know how to use a sniper rifle 4 who doesnt share his name as if it was supposed to be very confidential may be he was like harry potter that if one comes to know his name theyll just keep chanting his name throughout the movie anyways furiosa gave him a correct title of fool 5 a man with no expressions in any circumstances maybe he knew that its just a moviewhats there in the moviefirst half of the movie it is about a war rig being chased by the warriors lots of firecrashes action music really want to appreciate the guitarist who never stopped playing until his last breath i believe his soul will rip in valhallahsecond half please read the first half againthe oscar should go to the war rig for the best tanker in leading role yes because it was leading throughout the movie and nobody ever chased it downthats all folks,reality
the movie was okay they could have done better the action is above average,reality
there is a lot of scene i laughed my ass off and the stroy is very weak you have to watch the old movies to understand some important elements in the movie  the action is pretty good with practicals stunt  the location is very good  the acting is good  overall its a good action movie with very weak story,reality
ive been a fan of the series this one has the biggest budget but is sucks it shouldnt be call because he hardly speaks hes not a bad actor but hes definitely wrong for this oneplus theres some really stupid s like the guitar player for examplebeyond thunderdome is still the best,reality
it was good but not that good full of action thats why it lacks a good story behind it i liked it but as an action film as a film in general meh,reality
this was better than i was expecting even with all the rave reviews i just didnt think i would like it as im such a huge fan of the originals i figured it would get hollywoodized with charlize theron looking like a post apocalyptic starlet all pretty and clean and then cgid so that it lost that cool unique atmosphere of the original neither of these things were trueset in a sun parched post apocalyptic future we again follow loner this time he is tom hardy as he gets caught up in the plight of a group of warrior women as they flee from an evil rulerdictator across a desert wasteland most of this movie is one big car chase which actually isnt a bad thing full of high octane stunts its pretty awesome and also keeps the atmosphere and tone of the originals perfectly with lots of weird crazy characters its desolate futile and hardy is mostly silent theron does a good job doesnt look prettyeven though i was surprised that i enjoyed this and that ultimately it is a good movie im still not sure it warranted all the accolades it received,reality
this movie is great the characters the story the action the acting the visual fx are all top notch furiosa will go down as one of the most legendary female action movie characters ever,reality
i love this movie for the same reasons as conan the barbarian 1980 the action is super clear filmed so that we really see what happens there the story is told very linear so that everyone can understand many say the story is so simple but i can not think outside the box because so little is said in this movie the action is super filmed almost praised actors give everything they can only by facial expressions and gesticulating because very little is talked about in this movie the music is cool yes im honest there are only two songs that i think are super blatantly the rest was okay,reality

fury road movie reviewfury road is one of the best action movie i have seen in years and perhaps it is the one the best films of this decade fury road is visually beautiful breathtaking sharp and stylish action sequences are stunning and astonishing and very well executed the direction of george miller is excellent his vision towards each and everything in this movie is very well craftedthe performance of all the actors and characters of the movie are fantastic especially tom hardy and charlize theron they both are amazing in their roles they have given one of their best and memorable performances charlize theron was superb as furiosa and tom hardy totally rocks as tom hardy is one my most favourite actor so it was truly a delightful experience watching him in this film the action of the movie is simply the best all the action sequences are breath taking and it is like a thrill ride from start to end a touch of emotions too in the form of the main characters back story has added a lot to the character development depth and intensity the plus positive points of the movie are that the screenplay cinematography acting action stunts dialogues emotions background score music and little bit humor all are perfect they all feel very realisticthe movie is a fine example of great film makingthis how a film should be made i cant find any flaws or have any issues with this movie because it is so perfectly made i enjoyed and liked the movie very very much i watched the film in cinema theater and it was an awesome and amazing experiencefor me fury road is definitely and always will be one of my most favourite film of all time all over fury road is a brilliant spectacular and remarkable film best and good points about the film one of the best epic action movie ever made action sequences are stunning and spectacular visually beautiful breathtaking sharp and stylish a real lifetime cinematic experience true example of art of filmmaking great performance by tom hardy excellent performance by charlize theron brilliant direction by george miller fantastic and amazing practical effects strong script screenplay and cinematography awesome soundtrack music and background score this how a film should be madebad points about the film nearly none flawlessplease note that this review represent only my professional point of view and my personal honest opinion about the film and does not represent others thank you,reality
fury road is everything i want an action movie to be and more the action is spectacularly filmed with cinematography that makes me salivate to think about the pace is so fast that you never get bored and it constantly keeps your attention by having very little dialogue making sure that you have to watch the film to get whats going on the characters have a surprising amount of depth to them with furiosa being a huge standout among female action heroines shes tough but not emotionally cold competent but not invincible her motivation to save a group of women from a patriarchal tyrant is immediately sympathetic and you root for her all the way to the endfury road might not be the smartest movie in the world but nobody can deny the craftsmanship that went into making what i consider to be the greatest action film of all time,reality
i was hearing critics talk amazing stuff about this film that it was the definition of fun that it was one of the best action movies of all time that it was a masterpiece and so forthi watched this movie twice but not because ive enjoyed it but because i wanted to find why this movie got so much love and i failed i was disappointed by this filmwhats the plot of the movie i dont know it has a very loose plot is basically moving from point a to point b and point a again is really underwhelming the characters i dont care about them theres only 2 characters that get development and have an arc furiosa and that guy with painted mouth with silver that played beast on the recent xmen movies and there are parts of this film i just dont get like for instance there are several parts were gets visions of people calling for help were did this come from were did it go the bad guy on this film i dont even remember its name thats how forgettable this movie is is so over the top and annoying i wanted to kill him the highlight of the film is the action and admittedly it is very well done very impressive camerawork and stunt work some welcome practical effects and creative set pieces the problem is that this movie is 2 hours of cars chasing through the dessert and after a while i got bored also the overreliance of practical effects make the moments when cgi is used very noticeable and thats not a good sign on a film on top of that there are some pieces that as impressive as they may be they are just tough to buy like fighting on top of a truck at full speed thats really hard to believe and other parts did bothered me as well the soundtrack is very mediocre that guy with the guitar i thought was really stupid the overall costume design i didnt like and there are scenes that could have reached its full potential like when furiosa discovers her familygroupclanwhatever was murdered she takes her mechanical arm off and screams at the top of her lungs if she took her arm off and slowly walked away to be by herself it would have been a lot more powerful i could go on and on but im wrapping this off overall this movie disappointed me it isnt terrible it has some good and even great parts and it had a lot of effort put into it which i appreciate but if the story and characters were better i might have found that amazing film that everyone was making it up to be510,reality
for someone who doesnt usually enjoy action movies from beginning to end was non stop action and i actually really enjoyed it i am more of a comedy and romantic movies yes i know its kind of gay but guess what i dont caresay what you will but i prefer ashton kutcher and ryan reynolds then bruce willis and tom cruise sue me for being sensitive lol anyways back to subject fury was the best movie i have seen in 2015 behind fast 7 of course but that a whole other topic of conversation but for someone who has not seen very many actions movies i have seen and recommended this movie to every one i know you has asked me for my opinion anyways like that made sense,reality
the initial movies were crazy and odd enough but they had a solid plot with character dynamism and a lot of lines but the one in question is a constant and rough chasing with vague characters performed by celebrities hardy theron hoult  all distinct actors otherwise modeltype ladies performing doubtful roles as heavily pregnant women handling heavy machinery and kicking butt and unseen actors faces with warpaintmasks true there are some silent and pensive scenes in the middle but they seem out of context as a pause for audience to catch breath before uproar starts again just back and forth on the same deserted landscape with even explosions and shots not influencing some characters exteriorthe only personage i liked somehow was nux skilfully performed by nicholas hoult but his change of sides remained mystery to me all in all the movie is like a protracted manowar video or a road movie inside out but the conceptual element regards visuality only the rest is rather mediocre at times annoying meaning that visual effects might be a supporting component of plot only eg tarantinos movies not the substitution of activities  logic of events,reality
i thought was suppose to be the main character in a film this film focused on imperator furiosa charlize theron and her struggles to find her home land a little more than it did tom hardy in my opinion not that im complaining because its still a great film this film is set in an apocalyptic era of course which causes it to be a breeding ground for a lot of action and to me thats what made this film so great almost from beginning to end theres enough nonstop action to keep any action film fan satisfied the story line that involves the two main characters were simple but the action completely made up for that overall its a good film not what i expected it to be but still good,reality
swings in front of the camera holding for dear life to a pole while vehicles that would even look out of place at a monster truck derby blow up behind him like an orgasm after one of the many action sequences that make this movie the scene reminded me of the one with the ladders and trains in the lone ranger another recent film to get action righthowever unlike lr fury road does just what its title promises  it races straight on leaves you next to no time to breathe or look at your watch in a way the movie made me think of an opera grandiose almost to the verge of ridicule but epic enough to sweep you along for the ride characterisation and plot are there and something rare happens the story actually continues to unfold as the action goes pedal to the metal instead of taking a break while you look at all the beautiful explosions what about the action you ask well forget your shaky cams and frantic editing to make up for the lack of actual skill involved the set pieces are fast and all over the place but you never once wonder where you are whats happening and where the protagonists are in all this mess after such a magnificent love letter to action thrillers one can only hope some of them actionmakers take a notepad with them when they go watch this one,reality
i saw fury road in the theater which was one of the best experiences ever i now happily own in 4k pure blast about the sacrifice of comrades masterful soundtrack sound deign stunts style cool cars memorable lines and glorious tom hardy that i love george miller is the only person to reimagine the classics since hes the original director of the trilogy which are just as magical and pure excellenceits really cool how theres a mix of horror elements mashed into a masterful action like this i am and was so happy when this won a bunch of oscars its rare when what i want to win almost never does,reality
n the future the world is an industrialized labor intensive oligarchy women are used as breeders furiosa charlize theron whose name sounds like a harry potter spell absconds with a group of women and heads east toward the green land she is pursued and confronted and that is basically the story in a nutshell tom hardy who cant recall his name becomes a prisoner universal donor hood ornament fighter ideas man and a fuel injector his lack of dialogue made him a rather boring character and when he spoke they werent gems like other little speaking charactersill be backin spite of the limited personality of the title character the rest of the film is action packed as goes the hollywood remake trend to please the younger audiences who prefer video game action over an involved plot the left has proclaimed this a feminist film due to the role of theron as a leader rebelling against the order and will of men there may be a message there somewhere within the recess of what amounts to a shallow popcorn film but i didnt desire to think that deepthe action is almost nonstop this would have an appeal to those who love monster trucks dirt bikes pretty girls and demolition derbiesnow at one point there is a discussion of traveling in one direction for 160 days on bike assuming they ride a modest 500 miles a day they could circle the globe 3 times proper land bridges yet theybreak out the popcornguide i caught 2 quick fbombs no sex wet tops distant rear nudity not much in blood and gore mostly vehicle crashes and explosions,reality
as most negative reviews put it fury road is a fastpaced action movie which stands on a thin plot with a lot of cliches and not too much care about character development but those are the tenets of any action movie anyhow not taking itself too seriously fury road is humorous in the sense of schwarzeneggers terminator movies as a person who can hardly sit through any action movie i found this one fun to watch,reality
fury road doesnt  to the best of my recollection  pick up from where the third film ended which is fine seeing as beyond thunderdome came out the year i was born i dont recall too many specifics from the original trilogy other than it was a postapocalyptic desert australian wasteland and motorcycle and car gangs reigned supreme fury road keeps that tradition alive  at its core it is a roadchase film and is relentless throughout with everything it does from the scenery soundtrack stunts cars violence and explosionsthe overthetopness serves the film well though  much in the same way 300 was hypervisualised this is the same but instead of heaps of slowmotion some of it is sped up keeping the pace of the chase buzzing it also has the same sillyness in that none of it is remotely realistic but it all works within the universe the film inhabits except for where all the fuel comes from miller mustve dreamt up most of the cartruck hybrids when he was a kid  and kudos to him for making them a reality especially the poleswinging guys and the main rig  certainly great to watchhardy is satisfactory as theres not many lines for the brooding hero and theron is good as the vengeful furiosa trying to protect a group of women from the evil emperor or whatever his name is  played by keaysbyrne with billy connolly hair not sure why hardy had to have a banelike face covering for some of the film after the dark knight rises  detracted a bit from the film favourite bit  the guitarist on the front of the truck loved how the drums and his riffs only came to the fore when the camera panned to them,reality
this is a decent movie set in the universe but is definitely not as gritty and good as the original two movies the third movie wasnt so great it suffers from the same problem the third movie suffered from too big budget and too much flare,reality
action films dont get much better than thisbeautiful exciting styllistically original this is highcalibre action in a dystopian worldtheres not much to say about this film as the plot is simple and the characters straightforward i often find movies that are 80 action get dull but this was strong from start to end,reality
everyone seems to be giving this review either one star or ten come on people the plot of this movie is just ok and really does not explain itself very well the dialog was also hard to follow at times including some occasional australian slang dialog that i had never heard before if you want to understand it better watch the movie on dvd with it set for dialog for those who are hard of seeing and hearing anyway there is a lot lacking in the plot and characters and the baby birth scene was sort of uncalled for in my view and what happened to the baby i thought the character was especially dull but this movie is the best i have ever seen as far as futuristic battle scenes go it is crazy off the wall creative amazing totally intense amazing road battle scenes wow,reality
this is a movie that heralds style over content with no real story the plot consists of one continual car chase across the desert of course there are heavyweight leads with hardy and theron that elevate the movie slightly but apart from grunting their way through a weak script there is very little for them to do if it were not for their involvement then this would be yet another movie that would be relegated to the echelons of so bad its good moviemaking alongside the likes of hobo with a shotgun spun and tank girldespite the slick cinematography and editing i am left baffled how this movie could be nominated for best picture at the academy awards,reality
fury road feels like a breath of fresh air after so many crappy hollywoodbollywood action flicks this is one of the best action movies i have ever seen those who have seen the original trilogy will love it those who havent might love it or hate it because there is no or very thin plottom hardy does justice to his role he doesnt speak much but his eyes do all the talking you can feel his pain he is broken by his guilt and grief but it is charlize theron who steals the show here she is exceptional as furiosa this might be the best performance of her career sometimes i wondered why the movie was named after when it was more about furiosathe cinematography is gorgeous i liked the blue tint in the night scenes the screenplay is excellent the background score is amazing and direction is brilliant george miller who is 70 years old is at the top of his game here he doesnt give you the time to feel comfortable he puts you straight into the action right from the beginning he wants you to feel the perils of living in a post apocalyptic world where anything can happenthe editing is  excellent with frame rates going high when you need it works like an adrenaline rush but the action doesnt get lost george miller shows you everything thats happening you know where the different cars are unlike other action films miller shows you everything with the help of some perfectly angled shots whenever there is an explosion you will know the reason behind itin the midst of all this george manages to add some humor there is a blind guy who keeps playing thrash metal riffs on his flamethrower guitar during the whole chase sequencethe villain is really good and he sounds a lot like bane he has controlled the water supply and acts as the master of other peopleone more thing that i loved about this movie was that there was no unnecessary romance which often ruins great moviesnow this could have been a 610 movie because it is really easy to make such a movie with cgi but it deserves no less than 10why the acting direction cinematography editing music screenplay are awesome and the movie is 10 cgi and 90 practical effects so almost everything you see on screen is happening for real cars are being thrown here and there the explosions are real people are fighting for real and all the stunts you see in the end are real imagine the efforts they have put into making this movie thats the best thing about itso if you are familiar with then go and watch this movie asap and if you arent then decide for yourself but if you miss this flick you will miss some of the best practical action scenes ever done on screen,reality
not bad but feels like a music video at times makes it hard to follownot enough analog grit or too much digital grit something is off although theres obviously impressive scenes they feel like part of a showreel more than story really long action scenes can become tiring to watcha mess of styles overly saturated dynamic range to give it a processed comic style the orange and blue filters orange in the day blue at night the sped up animated effect some action sequences look comical like from a 1950s movie a digital dusty orange and blue flick which has some curious high dynamic range visuals but the rapidfire editing is distracting the constant orchestral soundtrack it all gives a sense of watching a long preview of a movie,reality
its been thirty years since i left the cinema feeling more than a little let down by the kiddie friendly hollywoodised action of beyond thunderdome could this longawaited reboot from the series original creator george miller make up for three decades of disappointment you betchaone certainly cant accuse miller of playing it safe with his fourth outing fury road is an exercise in absolute excess from start to finish the outrageous plot opens with tom hardy taking over the iconic role from mel being captured by a clan of desert warriors ruled over by ruthless tyrant immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne toecutter from the original who keeps order in his citadel by controlling its supply of water and breast milk the helpless is used as a blood bank by sickly warboy nux nicholas hoult before finding himself strapped to the front of nuxs vehicle part of the huge convoy that takes off in pursuit after rebellious onearmed rigdriver imperator furiosa charlize theron who has betrayed joe by making off with several of his wives having promised to escort them to a promised land of greenafter the chase enters a massive electrical sandstorm during which nux crashes his car finds himself free once again teaming up with furiosa he helps to drive the rig to safety but on reaching their destination and furiosa realise that their only hope for survival is to turn back and face the enemy head on up to this point the action had been impressive but what follows is absolutely breathtakinga mindboggling mle of sheer madness and mayhem with more mashed metal and massive explosions than all three previous films put together times ten quite how miller managed to capture some of the scenes of carnage without killing anyone in the process is hard to imagine such is the incredible level of vehicular destruction on displaythe previous movieseven thunderdomeexcelled when it came to production design and fury road is the most imaginative yet with its wonderful citadel full of manpowered machinery and of course its cavalcade of absurd postapocalyptic vehicles love love love the the cars that ate parisinspired buggies covered in metal spikes the attention to detail here is superb with far too much to take in in just one viewing ive only just finished watching it and i already want to see it again the insane characters also go a long way to making this film the hugely entertaining experience that it is slit a warboy with a jokerstyle smile rictus erectus the dim musclebound son of immortan joe the doof warrior a guitar playing gimp stood astride a bank of loudspeakers on wheels and a strange deformed dwarf another of joes sons who watches the world through a telescope from the safety of the citadelfinally the 3d usually i can take or leave the gimmick of a third dimension but here it really added to my enjoyment miller milking the process for all its worth i suggest watching fury road in 3d if only for the shot of the steering wheel flying into the foreground i felt like i could reach out and catch ita lasting souvenir from one of the most spectacular movies of the millennium so far,reality
im sorry but this movie really lacks heart tom was awful cgi was bad plot was simple not very realistic in parts of the movie this movie needed mel gibson for his acting and direction no classic in my book stick to mm1 and mm2 just as george lucas tried to relive the past and failed so does george miller sadly no mel no good i tried so hard to love this movie and gave it a fair go i felt emotions with furiosa and the girls at times but from the beginning it left a foul taste in my mouth when we see eat a lizard how ridiculous was that lizard skins are way to tough to chew and even if had a beer he would still choke i quickly dismissed that scene as to not let it affect my overall judgement but there was so much more unrealistic crap that it was hard to really love it i may watch it one more time on bluray at home in 6 months but unlike mm1 and 2 which ive seen over 50 times it wont be part of my classic collection shame,reality
what was the purpose of this film it has a budget that is many times greater than the original film and none of the qualities that had the 80s film was great fun and it reflected much of the spirit of that decade it was also simple sincere and despite the violence quite innocent in intent but what about this new version it has no reason to exist other than to make money it is not an homage to the 80s in any real sense it exploits that eras cinematic ingenuity bastardizes it and throws in all kinds of nonsense that plague our nihilistic age the new film is a film about nothing it is sterile and empty of meaning it is a pc nightmare in which lone women drive cars in deserts and beat men up to survive its kind of ironic that a film about anarchy rebellion and brute struggle for survival actually caters to the sensibilities of a weak entitled spoiled deluded politically correct generation that conforms completely and indulges in fantasies about human nature that have no basis in reality and that would be shattered in an instant in the kind of universe depicts,reality
warning spoilersno mel gibson bearing in mind that an ageing flick could seem comparable to the last indiana jones so good choicehowever tom hardy as was terrible i am not one for character development and i understand over a period of time has became colder however he felt like christian bale as batman he really didnt do much in the movie an empowered charlize was there to do most if not all the work actually the title for this movie should have been charlize with a supported role by the problem with this movie is there is very little about considering the title is named after him he seems to be small part of a parallel story line that clashes with the main story of the film to finish up as there is not much to analyse about tom hardys acting in this movie i think just about anyone could have done equal if not a greater jobcharlize acting was ok not terrible but it seemed like her role should have been role charlize appears in the movie with a short haircut and looking similar to a man she even has a mechanical arm and almost dies saving the main cast were tom hardy nurses her back to healthafter writing this paragraph it has dawned on me that maybe the writers changed the roles to be more pc however that is only an assumption now for the moviethe movie itself is very high in action has similar wacky car ideas and innovated ways to destroy a large moving object but it is only a variation on the 2nd a big truck and the third a train storyline goes somewhere saves some people and stuffs up the bad guys with a slight variation in this one goes somewhere captured doesnt really do much and leaves at the end leaving charlize to play the role of maf my rantbefore i start i know this is a fictional story but the premise of is this situation could happen two men enter one man leave and angry anderson asidewhose idea was it to put in biker grannies not cool and illogical for an apocalyptic movie pcwhat was with that angus young guy constantly shredding on top of that moving vehicle no needwhat was with that guy saying not to get addicted to water water is an element of lifehow the hell where there so many people in the desert the only deserts are in the interior the majority of people live in the coastal areasagain what was with those biker grannies i know 6070 yos cant see that one happeningwhat was with that bold guy with who in australia would believe in valhallahow did everyone in the citadel get access to white face paint all the time in the australian outbackhow could that citadel be created in the australian outbackwhat was with that main bad guy again i know this is a fictional movie but if you live in australia you would recognize the first one thats how australia really looksto conclude i give it a 5 watch it if you are a fan who must see it if you dont want to be disappointed stick clear of this oneactually just stick clear the anger you will feel afterwards is not worth it,reality
fury road is an outstanding movie with an extremely well developed plot and a terrific cast there is no other movie truly like it it may be the fourth film in the series but it is very different to the mel gibson versions its significantly weirder filled with tons of action that keep you at the edge of your seat throughout and is beautifully directed by george miller in what is without a doubt his greatest work to date i think the film definitely needed to develop a bit more i understand it was taking a different approach to telling the characters story but for an audience who have not seen the previous movies it is not very clear that is the way he is because of the murder of his wife and daughter they should seriously consider focusing on this more in the sequelthe cast are all superb here tom hardy charlize theron and nicholas hoult all play characters that start off not being particularly likable and as the film progresses you really care for them all and want them to succeed in their journey only complicated somewhat antiheroic characters like these can only gain support when actors as talented as good as these are portraying them it is a wild ride from start to finish that always kept me entertained and never slowed down action packed truly unique and well acted i would recommend fury road to all moviegoers in an apocalyptic wasteland two rebels team up with the hopes of restoring order best performance tom hardy,reality
insane action packed two hour road rage movie that more or less sums up this crazy film george miller still got it coming back after 30 years and making this in just the right spirit and with all it entails is amazingthis film is an instant classic even though a film where they drive around for two hours sounds like something that gets boring it just introduces new strange characters one more crazy then the next all the time and keeps the action and tempo at a very high gear i was entertained from the beginning all the way to the end and there was enough to see and think about on the way caught myself sitting with open mouth and a big grin on my face many timesthe acting is not deep but there are many characters one more crazy and strange until the next one shows up how did they find all these crazy people and drag them out into the deserted lands miles from civilization well actually there isnt much acting for most parts or not in matter of lines the only one that really pulls through on this is charlize theron she delivers a good performance is a tough girl and still keeps the glimpse in her eye tom hardy on the other hand more or less grunts through the first half and gets a few more lines through the rest but he does deliver a good performance as the main male character crazy or driven to insanity of sorts is his name  the young nux played by nicholas hoult also does a great job we see the world through different perspectives through his eyes first as the mechanic that wants to be accepted into valhalla and later he finds that there is other wayshugh keaysbyrne plays immortan joe dont know if he is the only one but he was also in the first movie from 1979 i think it was missing a camio from mel gibson or tina turner that would have been a fun surpriseall in all bang for the buck really nicely topped of with visuals and music that just fits perfect into this desolate wasteland and crazy character scenario two thumbs up from me and a big happy smile,reality
last time i felt really misguided by imdb was dark knight ok heath ledgers joker was good action was decent but that movie was really not one of the 10 movies of popular cinema anyway the third movie dark knight rises didnt surprise me after all it was really really badand we had road warrior this movie was something else theres no other postapocalyptic movie like it  even no action like it mel gibson  george miller had a really unique and flawless chemistry there the movie really freaked me out when i was a kid aaah 80s third was a kind of joke near it so i didnt even bother to watch itso when i heard is back i was really excited and waited for this movie for so long and when i saw the perfect reviews and hype on imdb i thought okthis will be epicumm yes its not bad no no its really good  as an action flick its way better than soo overrated dark knight movies its better than zillions of action movies but this is nowhere near road warrior tom hardy is not if this movie has some other name  as the fury of postapocalyptic desert people or what a lovely day i would give higher vote but it uses name and its not an easy name to use,reality
ok visually this is stunning but thats about it there is 0 story basically you see a truck being chased by cars for two hours ok the cars are great and the special effects are awesome but youd expect that with the the 4th installment of the series wed at least get a clue on to what exactly happened to the planet to be in such a state and who is and what is he doing there in the first place this is basically a 2 hourslong music video complete with guitar player on angry femen going to burning man oh and dont expect anything even mildly realistic vehicles that conveniently glide through the desert sand without getting stuck even once fullyloaded 18 wheelers that outrun small cars people that never eat nor sleep they just drive 247,reality
when a few years back australian director george miller announced a new film would be in the works but sadly it would have taken over 25 years for the project to fly off the development stages as there was issues with production locations and even script development over the years but this year was the year audiences would finally see it on the screen in this final completed work the question is for all fans was would it be worth the wait all these years to happen and would it be worthy as its original trilogy the following summary below pretty much sums up the wait and anticipation had really paid off for both the fans and the filmmakersfury road is a worthy wild action ride that packs punch value and high quality into the trilogy that was established previously it can be considered both a reboot and a sequel but this enables miller to expand the wasteland universe and to further the life of the road warrior having seen the trilogy countless times we are immediately aware of the production value it should carry but with the film having the biggest budget to use beating the trilogys separate budget values miller crafts not only an epic film in action and storytelling but in terms of value concept and direction he gives us a shining feature that stands strongly and respectively for the fans of the franchisecasting in the film was great in particular marks the first time that a different actor has filled in the shoes and duty of portraying and that actor was tom hardy the dark knight rises lokie bronson and inception at the time when it was announced of his role fans both agreed or disagreed with this casting choice as he was of british decent and it was mel gibson that defined the role as iconic for both him and the franchise with hardy he gives a solid performance that makes us feel that has still strong after so many years past since thunderdome and pulls it off without no flaws that makes him solid like gibson oscarwinning actress charlize theron plays as furiosa a character that seems to take the leading action role as much as hardy but there has been criticism from various antifeminist groups that she is more dominate and more actionoriented than hardys character on screen and thus making fans feel that is a secondary character from my perspective this is a false fact as does play a major role throughout the story as hes assisting with furiosas journey of redemption to bring the women into a safer world without assistance she may not have survived joes ambush and violent attacks to stop herthe supporting cast includes the talents of nicholas hoult xmen days of future past warm bodies hugh keaysbyrne from the original rosie huntingtonwhiteley riley keough abbey lee nathan jones and megan gale to name some in which all play great performances in their roles from my eye hoult makes homage to the gyro captain from 2 thats in the form of his wild boy character nux while byrnes immortan joe is dominate as the villain and bares the similar voice with bane played by hardy  with tension and pure bad buy quality theres barely any bad dialogue from him or any of the charactersin terms of action fury road is indeed a major contender for action quality that matches not only the quality from the previous films but takes it further in terms of stunts practical effects and choreography work from explosive crashes highwired acrobats jumping and moving along moving vehicles and fist fights on top of tankers the film does it with amazing eye for detail and realism using practical effects and stunt people whilst using minimal cgi to assist the action or landscape the fast and clear camera work and editing makes the action sequences seem so beautiful brutal and flat out insane that it leaves the recent fast and furious films in the dirt and in shamecinematography sound mixing editing and practical effects are all top notch throughout the film miller and his crew give the action story its characters and its deserted environment a style that has been missing from the genre for sometime though a few today have occurred to be solid examples such as the raid 2 furious 7 kingsman and even some of the marvel cinematic universe films but miller reignites both the genre and his style of filmmaking that make it seem possible for the film to get oscar worthy consideration in 2016 which would be nominated for best cinematography sound mixingediting visual effects and possibly direction the amazing cars featured including the signature interceptor are all real detailed and seemed so based from the minds of miller and his design team and its a true fact that 350 vehicles were used in the film but who knows how many of them were destroyed during the making of the film i hope the future home entertainment release will feature a behind the scenes look into this and the production valuesoverall fury road is an epic action ride that delivers solid entertainment for both action fans and fans of the original trilogy miller has taken so many years to get this franchise back on the screen and the results we see are the best weve seen in filmmaking and the genre itself this is perhaps my favourite film ive seen alongside age of ultron chappie kingsman the secret service and birdman but this film stands at the first position and earns itself an seal of approval for quality entertainment55

this movie absolutely blew me away when i first saw it and ive now seen it probably 20 times after purchasing it on amazon instant video im normally an indie film lover but i just appreciate a story well told die hard and the dark knight i totally and unequivocally disagree with any reviewer who says this is typical hollywood action fare this is art that benefited from tasteful cgi and special effects not the other way around i loved the airtight script some people wanted back story but i loved that the story unfolded the way it did i feel it wouldve been typical and distracting to delve into needless exposition for the emotional experience we didnt really need to know why furiosa decided to rebel how the wives came to hate immortan joe or why wanted redemption i personally cared deeply about all these people and i was easily able to suspend disbelief spoilers aheadthe action was so perfect too what do you knowcharacters being in actual danger works i dont want cookie cutter stories like the avengers with crap like the avengerstransformerssuperhero crap you know theres a bad guy and theres a big fight at the end of the movie where the villain is defeated and the world is safe you know without even going to see the movie absolutely everyone you care about will survive with fury road you really wouldnt be able to guess what happensit is an original and authentic story at the beginning of this movie and pretty much throughout the whole thing id never have guessed splendid the pregnant wife would die that nux would martyr himself and i genuinely was afraid theyd kill furiosa when she got stabbed the action was insanely thrilling too i was constantly on the edge of my seat hoping everyone would survive i was totally lost in the experience not focused on the special effects i literally had adrenaline rushes going last but not least thank you for featuring such strong female characters i heard about the feminist buzz and backlash prior to seeing it and that honestly made me want to see what all the fuss was about it definitely lived up to my hopes this is one of the best things ive seen in a long time it touched me in a way i havent really felt since watching raiders of the lost ark the dark knight and fight club definitely a game changer movie,reality
the movie starts of with a voiceover and 15 seconds in to the movie the action has already started we quickly get introduced to the main characters and then the story starts this whole movie is simply put a 2hourlong chasesequence with real stunts chaotic but easy to follow explosions and fightsequences unlike the mess in michael bays transformers movies this movie works so good mostly because of george millers vision hes got such a great control over the action and the universe miller is the star of this movie even though he doesnt appear onscreen that i noticed when i walked in to this movie i was a bit afraid that two hours of this would get boring after a while but i guarantee you that it doesnt the universe this takes place in is really interesting and the thing this movie does right is that it doesnt tell you everything it doesnt explain every single little detail about everything considering the fact that its probably less than 100 lines of dialog in the movie its visual storytelling so the universe is as complex as you make it yourself you can see this movie for the action alone but there is a lot of interesting elements besides the action even if its only sort of hinted at the great thing about the action is that very much of it is done with practical effects and real people this makes the movie feel more authentic and its a nice break from the cgiheavy superheromovies of today even though there is some cgi its never too much you feel the speed and the action and instead of slowmotion this movie use quite a bit of speedup footage which adds to the insanity of the movie the movie is visually really stunning and i especially liked the feel of the nighttime scenes which were actually shot at day but touched on in postproduction its visual beauty the characters are also very interesting himself is pretty much as we know him even though tom hardy has taken over for gibson theron plays furiosa which is a female protagonist right up there with ripley and sarah connor personally i think i found hoults character nux the most interesting i wont spoil anything but hes great the villain called immortan joe is a classic villain especially considering hes played by the same man who played toecutter in the original his presence makes the movie even better overall i will say that fury road is hopefully a future classic on par with mm2 the road warrior and other actionmovies like die hard and terminator 2 it sure as hell deserves it this movie is like an awesome rollercoaster youre in for a ride that will shake you around for two hours and when it lets go you will if youre anything like me want to get right back on for a second spin its insane and makes the fast  furious movies look like theyre meant for kids and i like those movies too this is just so much more thrilling the plot may be a tad too simplistic but that didnt bother me because the action weighs up for it if the taken sequels had actionscenes like this i wouldnt complain one second for the lack of an original plot this movie is just so inspired and feels so fresh i cant really explain it with words you just have to see it for yourself chances are youll either love or hate it it all depends on your taste in cinema but it sure as hell fits me perfectly i will also say that its a movie that is meant for the bigscreen so dont download this on your computer or watch it on a small bad tv if you can catch it in the theaters than do so the visuals and the soundtrack is best enjoyed on a large scale the soundtrack is awesome btw and sort of played by the people in the movie i guess youve seen the guitarplayer in the trailer watch it in theatres now,reality
imagine this youre in a theater but instead of simply watching a film youre grabbed by the shoulders and violently shaken for 2 hours thats the fantastic experience of mmfr its less an adrenaline rush than a direct ivshot of caffeine into your bloodstream faster and more furious than the most recent carbased movie its kinetic action in the style of a fever dream a punkrock postapocalyptic nightmare thats a feast for the senses benefiting from director millers visionary and fearless eye pure unadulterated insanity that reminds us what it looks like when great artists try something uniquely extraordinary and succeed millers main achievement is getting everyone to buy into this insanity with the scale of a blockbuster and the soul of an indie mmfr is unlike anything youll see in theatres this year hardy as the new continues the characters reactivestyle heroics with just enough heart behind his crazy eyes and all the supporting cast portray their varying levels of madness with crazed conviction however all of these talented performances are overshadowed by the amazing aesthetic through grimy herkyjerky visuals miller gives us practicaleffectsfilled action sequences that are masterpiece level this isnt to say there isnt something deeper going on on top of being of a feminist manifesto a study of religious extremism and an argument that capitalism leads to death its ultimately a moving story of equality and hope that proves goodness can defeat desperation havent seen the mel gibson originals thats okay dont let the daunting task of seeing all those first keep you from one of the greatest action films in years,reality
honestly never heard of series before i just went to the theater to watch tom hardy and man it was breathtaking 3d effects cars crunching make ups and the plot two words top notch at first i thought it will be another mediocre hollywood reboot but i am awfully happy that it proved me wrong the film made me stay on my seat allthetime and i literally forgot to go to the restroom at some point brilliant simply brilliant storyline and each and everyone acted accordingly needless to say made me watch the previous trilogy nonetheless i must say george miller has shown what hes capable of loved happy feet duologue and then this couldnt get any betterif you love action and pop corn its a must watch flick for you and oh in 3d of course d,reality
after a week of skipping this film due to other scheds i finally watched it today sadly i didnt get the chance to experience it in iit would have made me a very very happy cookie regardless the cinematography is just amazing i also have no complaints not one in editing a firstthe characters were for me strategically developed not the traditional way we usually get in most movie scripts there were moments i kind of murmured wt7 but in the course of the movie even if theres less talk i get what it means and say ahhh the visuals the expression of the characters and the way the sequences were shown all somehow relate and i get it  unlike other films that had long interactions but less substance enjoyed every bit of it i even found humor in some acts especially that guitarist lololol and when he finally got tired and obliteratedtom hardy just doesnt fail to amaze charlize is just freaking furious compliment and the vehicle action scenes are just wicked this is fast and furious edi disagree on the r16 classification in my country though its not really gory i highly recommend the movie not a lot of cgi for a change just natural action epic,reality
the movie starts out with a bang and it seems like it never ends not that that is a bad thing its a thrill ride from beginning to end the action scenes are amazingly well done the acting is great though i did think that some of the wives could have done a better job at it the characters are really interesting this movie finally gets the female action hero right the movie is as much a movie as it is a furiosa movie the story is not that complicated but it has layers of deeper meaning to it which you can choose to ignore and just enjoy an action movie or give it some thoughts either way its a very good movie the desert landscape is beautiful the vehicles and machines are very detailed and look great what also stood out to me was the score by junkie xl he really outdid himself here during one of the amazing action scenes i thought to myself holy sht the score is absolutely amazingi would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone ive seen it in iand it looked amazing hope to go see it again soon,reality
in a drastic move for a director who has so far this century only worked with dancing cartoon penguins george miller returns to the franchise that made his reputation and delivers a masterpiece of violence velocity and vroomvroom that sets a new standard for rrated actionthe screenplay by miller comic book artist brendan mccarthy and alum nico lathouris is a work of minimalist brilliance that never bogs down the story with exposition or shoptalk just scanning a list of the character names makes the imagination run wild how many summer blockbusters can you say that about tom hardy is fun in the title role but charlize theron is the star nothing left to prove theron has entered the highfranchise phase of her career and now finally has a vehicle no pun intended to demonstrate real courage grit and leadership with a subtle redemption arc that distinguishes her character from tom hardys who is motivated solely by his will to survive and silly accent the rest of the cast is terrific too xman nicolas hoult skillfully elicits real sympathy as the comic reliefthe legions of people who worked on the visual effects sound and stunts are all mvps and every technical element is turned up to eleven cinematographer john seale oscar winner for the english patient brings breathtaking desert visuals costume designer jenny beavan oscar winner with nine nominations deserves special recognition my favorite the heartpounding music from tom holkenborg if you loved the music in fury road then you are in luck holkenberg is scoring four more movies over the next year i believe holkenborg will come to define the sound of modern genre movies just as hans zimmer did in the last decade of course the odds of this movie getting any oscar nominations at all sit somewhere between those of antman and paul blart 2,reality
fury road is handled and directed perfectly by george miller and is by far one of the best action films of recent years fury road is basically a western on wheels and is an action packed thrill ride having you on the edge of your seat at all times making you feel fear for the heros life at all times everything you could ask for from an action movie fury road hasto me the only complaint i could have with this movie was tom hardy dont get me wrong he was great in this movie but to me he didnt really sell the part of charlize therons character furiosa on the other hand was great in every scene the villain immortan joe was exactly how i wanted him to be hugh keaysbyrne did a great job as the antagonistgeorge millers directing is also great every frame was perfect every shot and angle was done great the cinematography was done exceptionally well by john ceale at no point did i take my eyes off the screen fury road was so fast paced and so well shot i didnt even want to blink just because i did not want to miss a single moment in this movie another thing that was great was the explosive action scenes they were insane and exactly what i wanted from this movieoverall fury road is a fast paced action packed thrill ride and is one hell of a movie and i recommend you to check it out this needs to be viewed in cinema like i said the only problem i had was himself in my opinion george miller could have set this in the same world and time period as the original trilogy and gave hardy his own character then this film would have been a perfect action moviego watch fury road as soon as you can you will have a great time at the cinema and will be very entertained,reality
fury road is true cinema it does not like the inescapable mass of dull summer movies rely on a makeshift script and thoroughly uninteresting characters to sell tickets to a largely indifferent audience looking for two hours of bland entertainment for no reason other than to pass the time rather fury road breaks well and solidly free of common summer movies it is not only riveting it is deliciously shot and welldirected an art movie and blockbuster rolled beautifully into one the film stars tom hardy as rockatansky a solitary man trying to survive in a harsh desert wasteland haunted by visions of his past tom hardy instills a certain desperation within his character almost making him seem like an animal void of intellect and feeling a man reduced to one instinct  survival tom hardy plays the role very well but he sometimes comes across as good ol bane in his mannerisms a man of few words and a whole lot of musclenow while tom hardy kills his role charlize theron butchers hers she plays imperator furiosa a onearmed woman who teams up with to escape the warlord immortan joes citadel armed with a massive war rig and a group of young women referred to as immortan joes breeders this role is easily the best role charlize theron has ever taken on her cold piercing stare is as unsettling as the insanity raging around her she is not like summer movies nowadays would have us believe a woman who simply exists to remove her clothing for the pleasure of a man she comes across as a pinnacle of morality strength and power better than anyone else on the screen could come even remotely close screw off mens rights activists im a man and i can see that this is not feminist propaganda this is just an unprecedentedly spectacular performance from charlize theron that does not involve her being a sexual object mens rights activistswowof course however this film was not made to showcase charlize theron this film was meant to convey pure and terrifyingly logical insanity that races purposely through your mind like a centipede scorching your eyes and smashing your brains out augmenting your own little crevices of insanity hidden deep within you until you are gasping under the strain of it i for one occasionally wanted to stand up on my chair and scream i was never sure why the chase scenes which encompass almost the whole movie are beautiful it seems as if each shot was meticulously chosen in order to send a rush of adrenaline pulsing through the audience each explosion each maniacal yell and flying body each gunshot each and every flipping car and a final explosive flying 3d guitar each element of this film makes the audience understand that they are in the hands of a master director that has been crafting this wonderfully intense story for thirty years this film should be the standard for summer moviesnotice that i said that this film should be the standard for summer movies i dont believe that it exceeded it to the point where it should be immortalized in the canon of incredible action movies the final battle scene while being as visually commanding as the other ones was not as epic as i had expected it to be considering all the buildup that it had leading up to it it felt much like the other scenes invoking a sort of dj vu that greatly reduced its effect i was expecting a matrix subway fight instead i got the lobby scene for the second time now that is not to say that this film is in any way bad this film is very good just not the excellent film that it had every right to begeorge miller scorns hollywoods moneygrubbing emptiness with this film you can almost hear his voice amid the chaos and violence saying seriously is that all you can dorating 910,reality
fury road r 2015  fury road is an eradefining worldclass action spectacle that will be the perfunctory default for anyone answering the question of what film is the most iconic cinematic achievement from the year 2015 george miller is back in the directors chair here and gives us a true sequel to the road warrior that every film fan has been waiting for with baited breath in fury road the world has become a mere shadow of itself as the warlord immortan joe rules the wastelands with an iron fist charlize therons superb female hero imperator furiosa acts as the impetus that sets the plot in motion by stealing immortan joes precious wives rockatansky played brilliantly by the viciously talented tom hardy gets caught up in this chaotic maelstrom that seamlessly plays out as one long chase scene across endless stretches of desert the action is relentless heart pounding and beautifully shot but when pealing back the layers of this unhinged action masterpiece a powerful underlying message can be found that challenges the sometimes despicable lens through which women are viewed in society george miller with minimal dialog still manages to draw us to each character and their plights he reminds me of the great sergio leone in that both have directed few but critically acclaimed films both directors revived a seemingly dead genre and each of their magnum opuses feature a character who relies on facial expression instead of words to convey emotion the structure of the film and its stellar execution leave very little room for problems but there is still enough room for a few to squeeze through the minor nitpicks i have with this film only include some stilted dialog and not enough in a film one thing that may deter the general moviegoer from seeing mmfr is the overthetop kookiness interspersed throughout the film this wasnt a problem for me but i can definitely understand how certain people could be turned off by that fury road is a beautifully and stirring action genre landmark that represents an experience in the theater unlike anything i have had before 910,reality
well i am 5 months into 2015 and this has got to be just about the worst film i have seen this year i really am hard pushed to find anything to say about a film that has no plot was made in 3d iand has the worst cgi and special effects that i have seen in a very long time it further and worse still lacks any originality and leaves the mel gibson films looking like masterpieces which lets face it is a long way from the truth although the originals had the benefit of being that original this particular offering was at very best a poor imitator even with the benefit of all that computer graphics interfacethe main core of the film is the almost incessant crash bang wallop and destruction of cars trucks and lorries with literally hundreds of vehicles and their drivers being plastered all over the screen and really that is all that goes on from the first minute onwards leaving me feeling that a better title for this film would be how to smash and blow up as many vehicles as you can in two hours starring more stuntmen than you can countthe script was not just poor it was poverty stricken with unbelievable characters who pretty much lacked any kind of real personality in a barren landscape that allowed for unlimited petrol vehicles with nitro and hot rod modifications that you would be hard pressed to find pre apocalypse this film annoyed the hell out of me and i understand it cost 150million i came away from the film with just one single thought why did they bother,reality
after viewing avengers age of ultron a couple of weeks ago and now this one i have to give this film the edge as far as enjoyment goes wow is just one of the words i would like to use when describing return to the big screena return that was long overdue and it was very nice finally seeing a film in the theater the film put forth here is one of intensity and nearly nonstop action a film that does not have its characters stopping in a random place so that we can see some back story that really is not relevant to the plot no flashback scenes so the director can tell you why the characters are the way they areno here we have simple action and the characters actions telling you what they are about it would be nice to see other films in the future and it is possible as tom hardy did sign on to do three films more than likely if they did get made would once again find himself in the middle of a dispute that he really wants no part of but begins to feel the need to helpthis film starts out with getting captured in record time as he is taken to a place called the citadel which has water and greenery in abundance but said greenery is controlled by a man named immortal joe a woman who apparently drives for him named furiosa begins her next mission but she is about to break ranks with immortal joe and will soon try to help her and her cargo escape the demented man and his crew of crazies in an attempt to find a place away from the madnessit was great seeing again as miller made sure a lot of the staples from previous films were included as well as some odes to the previous films it was nice seeing the sawed off shotgun the pursuit vehicles and the nitro makes me wish theyd let miller direct one of the many comic book adaptations as he proves you can create a film that is nearly all action without it looking like a cut scene from a video game tom hardy does admiral filling in for gibson had they made this film when miller had originally envisioned gibson would have been in the lead role once again but hardy looked the part and it did feel like he was it was also neat seeing that miller got the actor who originally played the toecutter from the first film to be the main villain here though he is most definitely a different characterso yes really good action films with very little talking can be enjoyable to watch why wouldnt they be ive never understood at times why they always feel the need to make action movies and such accessible to everyone it is not as if they add gun fights and car chases to a musical to make it more enjoyable for a male so why they always seem to do this for people who do not like action films seems a bit silly granted you may lose some of the american audiences money but a film like this is going to thrive in the foreign market i at least hope it does because i would enjoy seeing on the big screen again however if i do not i will at least be satisfied with seeing this one as it was an incredibly intense action film rarely seen these days,reality
a stuntmans drug induced wet dream the plot made little to no sense the action is repetitive the acting wooden anybody who likes this has no taste in films,reality
i have absolutly no idea why some people like this movie let just start by saying that i saw all the original one with mel gibson they are decent and fun movie and they have some originalitybut this new version well no its not original its just boring and stupid from the start to the end i saw this in an itheater with a big confortable seat and still it was painful to watch most of the time when i dont like a movie and i see that people rate it high i try to see the movie again but with this awful garbage and absolutly will not do itcompare to this movie the original is a pure masterpeice,reality
i rarely write movie reviews it would be mistake if i say the world how awful it is i couldnt believe movies like this were made and secure the rating more than 8 in imdb i couldnt find any good in this movie i strongly suggest there is no point talking about any filth in the movie please stay away,reality
let me begin by quoting director george miller commenting on this release losing some of the information of colour makes it somehow more iconic nearly 2 years ago to the day fury road exploded ferociously onto the big screen it now stands as a modern pioneer of the immense success that large franchises can achieve by using practical effects over cgi wherever possible over 80 of the film is shot in this way rereleased now in monochrome this version of fury road is just as thrilling to watch as it is in colour if in radically diverse waysinitial stipulations for fury road included making the film as colourful as possible it is unusual then that miller should be calling this desaturated edition the best version of the movie in fact this is the style in which miller always wanted to release fury road and ultimately it isnt hard to see whythe 2015 version is certainly a stylish film winning six academy awards including best production and costume design but the blend between action and monochrome is remarkably tasteful here it can be strongly argued that fury road is the ideal film for this sort of translation the black and white itself is never flat its not just a simple case of putting a filter over the screen plenty of extra contrast is added to the image which enriches the movie nicely creating a chilling atmosphere at points although unfortunately in black and white it loses a lot of the emphatic impact of the flaming guitars and the incredible stunt work isnt quite as staggering for a film based primarily on its visual effects this does take its toll on the overall product in contrast however the outstanding performances by the cast are wonderfully enhanced hurling the audience back to the golden age of cinema where movies were dependent on the principle casts integrity to be an effective movie not special effects in the moments where fury road isnt putting the fast and furious franchise to shame with its exceptionally filmed car chases through the australian wastelands the personal moments are somehow even more forceful than in the original miller is indeed right about the absence of colour making a film feel strangely more distinctive and fury road benefits enormously from this added layerit was announced recently that james mangolds gritty dystopian superhero masterpiece logan will be rereleased in monochrome thus it seems cinemas adoration of black and white is sliding back into popular culture again and by god let it endure the possibilities for future iconic rereleases of movies in black and white are limitless and as it does for the use of practical effects in modern times fury road proudly stands as an embodiment of the great achievements that big budget films can accomplish if released in monochromewhat a lovely way pun intended to watch this adrenalinefuelled spectacle,reality
and road warrior were great movies fury road is a pile of dog excrement in addition to what the other reviewers who hated it said it relied too heavily on cgi had a scattered poorly written  dare i call it a plot because it really wasnt  and we had no reason to care about any of these characters it was a mess from the moment it started until it thankfully ended if this had been the original no one in hollywood would have ever made a single sequel of this horrific mess sad that this is what passes for a good movie these days,reality
so i decided to watch these after seeing so many people praising how amazing and innovative it is i especially like the comments about the movie lacking a romantic subplot which i always hate seeing in action moviesthis movie definitely gives off the impression that something really great is just about to happen i was on edge through the whole thing ready for things to get interesting but it never happened that interesting twist or thing that would explain this confusing world just didnt occur they drove out into the middle of nowhere fighting the whole way then drove back fighting again thats all that happened why does everyone love this movie i honestly dont get it i mean the fighting is kinda cool but i need to understand why they are fighting to really enjoy it and the movie doesnt do a good job of explaining that,reality
where 1979 was just a fun periapocalyptic romp and a genre movie that garnered no awards who can explain this mess winning six oscars every single aspect of this film is a travesty compared to the original the plot the acting the costumes the dialogue the soundtrack the action the pacing its all bombastic over the top nonsense and loud very very loud i have never come across a film that so disappointed me from the opening scene i watched it unfold and thought oh for crying out loud what is this surely it cant all be this bad but no it starts off ponderous and loud and gets no better disappointment turned to frustration and anger theres even the clich of a female character gradually losing her clothes thats from 1980s teen slasher films and parodied in galaxy quest and did i mention some guitar playing that seems to be taken directly from todd and the book of pure evil george miller should have had two dvds to consult while making this film and watched them every night after shooting a green box with a copy of the original labelled make it more like this one and a red box containing waterworld and labelled make it less like this one,reality
fury road is the finest piece of pure action spectacle that ive watched since the raid 2 and john wick it feels like the film that george miller always wanted to make and in many ways its a virtual remake of 2 the road warrior except with a grossly inflated budget and cgi effects used to enhance rather than dominate now i love the road warrior and always will but fury road truly is an action film for our timesi know that some will hate it the story here is action and action alone and theres little else to get in the way its one long chase film and the amazing thing is how they manage to sustain the momentum for a good two hours exemplary cinematography and quite wonderful direction is what makes this work with bad direction it would have been a real chore to sit through but instead we get tons of suspense great fight scenes and incredible spectacle this is the kind of film you watch to see stuff thats never been done beforetom hardy feels like an obvious fit for the role and brings some working class style charisma to the part as many have commented is often a supporting player in his own film but charlize theron as the real lead is excellent too so thats not important even nicholas hoult in support is fantastic i loved the way that the bad guy is played by hugh keaysbyrne who was the villain in the first all those years ago overall though this is a film not about the people but the namibian desert landscapes the modded vehicles the speed the violence the overall thrill of the chase and its pretty much my idea of a perfect film,reality
im sort of a fan of the old saga those movies introduced me to a road movie genre of sorts where films are centered around driving ranging from dead end to even waterworld i thought of that badmouthed movie as a sort of with water instead of wastelands i wasnt expecting much of fury road to be honest as the vast majority of sequels and remakes nowadays i thought it was going to be a hyped clichd attempt to revive the franchise boy was i wrongfury road delivers the whole experience of the old saga plus more let me start by saying that this new movie borrows a lot from the old ones from camera angles to paraphernalia even a bit of the fastforward motion used in the old movies i checked afterwards and to my surprise and delight fury road creators are the same as the old movies so that explains a lot i believe this new movie could easily pass for one of the old ones minus that little extra cgi of course im glad they didnt try to add new more modern stuff to the universeoh and this is not a sequel but some sort of remake it is another vision of the same theme personally i think itd be better to watch the old movies to get a better understanding of the reality presented to us in fury road those flashbackhallucinations would also make more sensethe first 30 minutes of the movie are pure nonstop action without cheesy or cool dialogue added something that ruins most films nowadays in fact theres very very very little talking throughout the whole movie something that stays intact from the old days as well and that i sincerely appreciate but hold on the action still continues after that marvelous beginning when the pace slows down a little just a little its only to gather momentum its hard to surpass that first part of the movie ok although its still greatthe added cgi creates the perfect extra for that postapocalyptic future although its mostly old stunts and little cgi i think which is also a bonus for me in this industry overcrowded by cheap and overexpensive computer generated graphicsthe cast although not great for the main characters is acceptable im not a big fan of tom one expression hardy or theron id actually have preferred to keep the mask longer it gave him more of a air it reminded me of the sensation i got from seeing the last installment of judge dredd where leaving the helmet on all the time supports the character and makes us focus more in whats going on at the same time instead of attracting unwanted attention to poor acting in the form of shallow facial expressionsi found the mythology in this new movie very appealing im glad they stayed away from christian themes allow me to also indicate that i hate movies like fast and the furious or whatever those are called please in case anyone relates to that trash let me tell you that its nothing of sorts uses the vehicles as a means to deliver a story of survival in a dystopia contrary to the other movies where the means are the same as the end this is not a movie about tuning saying clichd cool one lines or any of such nonsense this is a movie about survival no matter how absurd it might seem or actually be you have to center in the action and forget about the rest while still keeping it in the background as a reminder of what you are watching complicated well its just not about car racing and being cool and lets leave it at thati read they are going to make a sequel to fury road i certainly hope they can stay in the same road no pun intended no need to mess up an excellent comebackits great to find a movie like this in this present reality of bad overhyped creations more creators should go back to their origins and deliver shows like this the only thing they could have added to make it more like the old movies would be mel gibson im afraid that would have made too though,reality
im only going to make sense on this if i lay it out short and in bullet pointsthe ultimate gladiator arena of car chase movies the ultimate circus of postapocalyptic villainy great story generally well paced not the big bad feminist plot that was rumoured absolute ridiculous carnage completely insane stunts great little references and concepts eg blood bag great characters reminiscent of the originals charlize theron was made for this franchise tom hardy is the best that couldnt have been mel could have had more dialogue but i get it more likely to be a onewatch affair for many due to the amount of spectacle over substance but it has both and is breathtaking on the first watch i just dropped my block of comte on the floor it now has dust and pubes all over it luckily id eaten most of it before i dropped it ill be seeing the sequel,reality
this movie is atypical of todays multimillion dollar blockbuster special effect movies the premise is a good one but the movie fails to pull it all together i thought the director rushed to cram everything in within a couple of hours instead of building out the characters and storyline it tried so hard to stay true to the original two road warrior movies with the postapocalyptic world and theres a nice spin in the movie instead of a fight for gas this time its about the scarcity of water but it ultimately just wound up being a movie about a bunch of monster cars and car chases tie that to a subplot of women being used to bread warriors and this could have been a really good tie in to the original movies this was a disappointment but many will like the action and explosions minus a true storyline,reality
81 of 10 this takes everything in the original sequels and ups it a notch while seemingly providing a prequel to the original films the action is nonstop the gore and desert dystopia beyond anything the original had to offer and bordering on horror oftenthe downside the end of the world dystopia scenario is less believable than it was in the early 1980s there have been much better scenarios since then and they failed to integrate them especially another femalehero anime called nausicaa 1984 that remains the best of the madseries and imitators its also a little too cartoonish at times the way people are able to bounce around and survive brutal accidents but it fits within the story of the film and is made believable enough to not interfere with the overall enjoymentit is true that this would be better called ine but contrary to criticisms furiosa lives up to any version of the character and gives the second half of the title and film meaning plot and mystery to enjoy,reality
greetings again from the darkness thirty years have passed since we last saw mel gibson donning the leather in 1985s beyond thunderdome which was of course the third in the franchise after 1979 and 2 the road warrior 1981 over the years rumors have persisted that writerdirector george miller was going to add to the franchise and take full advantage of todays hightech movie making techniques by securing the budget necessary for a true blockbuster it may have taken 3 decades but mr millers dream is realized with his 100 million version compared to 300000 budget on the first one that will undoubtedly satisfy the fans while also reminding the industry what an action movie can be michael bays corneas may burst into flames watching thistom hardy plays rockatansky a loner haunted by a tragic past seen only through millisecond flashbacks that occur at both inopportune and opportune moments hardy has the physicality to pull off the role but despite the title and the history this film belongs at least as much to charlize theron who literally drives the story as imperator furiosa tired of living under tyrannical rule furiosa frees a group of breeders played by zoe kravitz rosie huntingtonwhiteley riley keough elvis presleys granddaughter abbey lee and courtney eaton their plan is to escape across the desert well everything is desert these days and return to furiosas childhood home known as the green placethis is pretty much a two hour chase sequence featuring monster vehicles soaring motorcycles massive gunfire screenfilling explosions and enough stunt work to amaze even the casual moviegoer all of this is accompanied by earbursting highoctane music courtesy junkiexl the first films were scored by brian may of queen some of this music is raw heavymetal shredding occurring live on one of the chase vehicles  quite a sight and sound gag it should be noted that stunt work is the surprise here these days most movies rely on cgi effects while mr miller mixes an extraordinary number of old school stunts with the compliment of cgi for such things as an overwhelming sandstorm and ms therons mechanical arm its a fascinating blend of old and newjohn seale certainly deserves mention he is an academy award winning cinematographer for the english patient and has also been dp on films such as rain man witness dead poets society and the firm he has four oscar nominations and is not the first cinematographer one would think of when putting together a huge action film however the choice pays off in what is a beautifully shot film  both in space and close up scenes it brings an element of propriety to what on the surface appears to be outofcontrol nonstop chaosthe postapocalyptic look and feel is accented by periodic splashes of color that prevent the usual bleakness from others in this genre many will be surprised at the minimal dialogue but the straightforward plot removes any need for extended conversations from folks simply trying to survivenicholas hoult warm bodies may be the most interesting of all characters and probably has the most lines of dialogue while still not saying much he is a slave caught up in the dream of serving his master while then rediscovering a modicum of humanity buried somewhere deep inside fans of the series will also cheer the presence of hugh keaysbyrne who plays the very striking immortan joe and also played toe cutter in the original film 37 years agofilled with nostalgia and respect for the original series this fourth entry also provides a new palette for a new generation of fans the biggest change comes from the focus on strong women who are out to change or at least escape a world rotted by the male lust for power its difficult to say insanity rules this world because so little sanity exists that rational beings are nonexistentgeorge miller will always be known as the creator of the series but we shouldnt forget that he also directed the happy feet movies as well as babe pig in the city perhaps those two personalities allow him to create a world as crazed and chaotic as we see in his latest film mostly we can feel happy for him that he was afforded the opportunity realize his filmmaker dream  a nice reward for 30 years of patience,reality
ok being an avid fan of the predecessor of the original series i thought oh what a lovely day a new this film was up to scratch tom hardy played a very good road warrior but not as good as mel gibson but dont tell him that a few minor things that my friends and i picked up on was the scene where they are trying to winch the truck and the lead actress charlize theron started trying to push it as if it was going to help another thing was that it had way too many guns in the first film there was one shotgun in the second one there was two guns a shotgun and a pistol stick to the purpose of it being an apocalyptic bare landscape and only have a couple guns i mean come on that scene where the guy used two ak47 and two ump45s to spray bullets at the protagonists be real they would conserve ammunitionin conclusion think that it was a good film more of a run and gun than a storyline film but it was good and i would recommend it,reality
there arent many action films that do much for me usually the story itself isnt engaging enough for me and sometimes the action just becomes way too overwhelming to the point that i become desensitized to it and lose interest pretty much in fact this is what happened to the rest of the films i think all are decent but great not really so i was super excited for this because of all of the acclaim but also hesitantthankfully this film really did it for me in terms of narrative structure its pretty straight forward but the universe created here is nothing short of outstanding and the themes its presenting are grandiose and powerful for all of its madness and yeah its truly theres a sensitivity to the film that i cant really pinpoint its one of the loudest busiest films i think ive ever seen but the fact that its heart shines through and it actually comes across as honestly trying to tell a story about human nature and not just putting it for show because it needs to have a story is wildly impressive some of the dialogue is stuff to be expected but the way the film paints these relationships without trying too hard really pays off the film is able to maintain its madness and through it all actually resonate emotionally thats a grand featbut in terms of the action wowza dont really know what else to say whereas many action films and with a lot less action i may add suffer from the way the action is filmed nothing here does the editing and cinematography need to be praised for that alone there is so much happening and yet every scene comes across cleanly without any glaring problems the film also cleverly overwhelms its first act with as much action as possible and in its own way calms down after that this helps to let viewers know that the classic action film structure will be broken and its done wonderfully to say that this is my favorite film would be a huge understatement its glorious and majestic wickedly bombastic and entertaining easily one of my favorite action films ever and the only time ive been overwhelmed by an action film but was still able to enjoy it,reality
synopsis years after the collapse of civilization the tyrannical immortan joe enslaves apocalypse survivors inside the desert fortress the citadel when the warrior imperator furiosa charlize theron leads the despots five wives in a daring escape she forges an alliance with rockatansky tom hardy a loner and former captive fortified in the massive armored truck the war rig they try to outrun the ruthless warlord and his henchmen in a deadly highspeed chase through the wasteland,reality
everywhere i turned there were people telling me about the rebootwith the original tale the warning was its not about nuclear disaster its about the lack of petrol which did not stop the audiences rave about nuclear disaster especially after chernobylwith this one the production team made it clear they put a useless monologue in the beginning to make sure the audience gets it now its about petrol so a wise guy put in a lizard with two heads which like in all cautionary tales written by english majors lives and functions wellnow because the problem is petrol the only way to entertain yourself is to cover large distances without roads in inefficient cars that are made even less efficient with all sorts of addonsprecisely because there is no petrol all people use electric tools that are fueled by the toxic fumes going out from the ears of the writers and director involvedand because there is no petrol there are no roads either which helps the characters save fuel and run on pixie dustit becomes mildly amusing once you start seeing the ugly white corpses as minions on a budget probably painting them yellow instead of white would have made the film somehow better,reality
just one positive thing about this movie and that is the atmosphere nothing more than this,reality
i was 30 when i watched the first installment i was expecting more action in1980 watching this remake of the second installment taped in 1982 i finally got the action i wanted then boy this is action no kidding and not for the faint of heart this one is so well done that you immerse in the it and have to remember you ought to breathe from time to timei now see that the subtle message of first in 1979 the fundamental prediction of the current progressive thinking the last vestiges of the law to attempt restaining vicious gangs an officer without any legal support is left without any options but to take the law on his personal hands against those who killed his wife and son it is clear the justice system cannot help him becomes a brutal revenger hunting down and murdering those who had the law protection in fact this is very similar to todays human rights or progressive groups more worried about those who violate the law instead of those who are victims or those who are in compliance with the law,reality
tremendous action filmamazinggreat movie,reality
the best action film ive seen till date and i felt this superintense although this movie is not for people who would like to have more character information in the film,reality
i watched this film without any previous experience so keep that in mind while reading this but now i cant wait to watch the other 3 films definitely is not an everybodywilllikeit film but if you are one of those zack snyder 300 and sucker punch facet fans you have to check out this george miller film not only is a really cool fatal feminism film but it has this amazing postapocalyptic scenario with a lot to say about radical religion all this with over the edge road battle scenes during the whole film,reality
theirs nothing but only amazingly modified cars blowing in the air and people jumping from one car to the anotherwhat makes this an action masterpiece the high use of practical action effects and not depending on the visual effectsthis is a highly recommended film from mei dont know why the reviews are horribleplease watch this,reality
this is the very film that i regret the most that i didnt go to the cinema to enjoy it has the most beautiful fascinating and exciting scenes in the film history and i just repeated watching three time in a row looking forward to the release of the next film and i think its worth it very much to see it in a well equipped cinema,reality
81  is this a joke what did they find in this unpleasant movie likeness three times i began to look at it in the hope of finding some meaning but i saw and heared only some chouts and i did not try to watch anymore and i do not know what the beautiful charlize theron is looking for here when such films get high ratings one has to seriously thinks about where this world is going my rating is 1 just because there is no 0,reality
lots of flashy action with thin plotpros great use of practical effects and set piecesvery well directed action cons very thin plot doesnt offer much in way of storyvery little character development i barely knew the main character by the end of the moviein short this is a fun but shallow movie that gets far too much acclaim,reality
going into this movie i really did not have the highest expectations i had heard fellow reviewers claim this movie was sterling but i figured that i had to try it for myself watching all of the previous movies i already had an insight on what the director looked for in the movie but this new adaptation gave the series a bigger sense of accomplishment and a bigger sense of plot overall i did miss out on a lot of key plot scenes to give the movie a smoother flow but it was compensated by amazing costumes and an overall powerful acting i do recommend people to watch this movie and have high expectations of it truly deserving of the oscars it won i can now say with full confidence that i find this to be the ultimate action movie i have seen,reality
fury road is a special film its bombastically entertaining and action packed but it doesnt disregard emotion and story and its a fitting followup that will make lovers of the road warrior giddywhen i completed the movie i was wondering to watch again and again because of such wonderful story which we love to watch in the coming futurea movie as crazy as fury road very much needs a cast that will commit to its overthetop world as well and george miller has put together a phenomenal ensemblefury road is a special film its bombastically entertaining and action packed but it doesnt disregard emotion and story and its a fitting followup that will make lovers of the road warrior giddy,reality
well maybe the word lovely isnt the best way to describe it although the visuals are quite beautifulid say that the best words to describe fury road are awesome intense chaotic and jaw dropping it is one of the greatest actionadventure movies i have ever seen not only is the action well shot and executed but the entire visual style has an epic quality to it everything from the character designs to the color pallet work together to form a masterful cinematic roller coaster ride this brutal and monumental instant classic also contains likable characters strong performances and subtle storytelling as george lucas once ironically said a special effect without a story is a pretty boring thing fury road is full of mind blowing special effects and also contains a pretty outstanding story there are moments of genuine power and tenderness at times miller puts the action on pause and the spotlight is now on the characters so despite this film containing seemingly non stop action it still is strong enough script and character wise to keep the audience caring and engaged i would also like to note that i very much admired how backstory is mostly kept a mystery here perhaps it is explained in the original films which i have yet to seealthough i do plan to sometime soon instead it is made clear that something has happened to him there has been some tragedy in his past life and it effects his character it shows some kind of human weakness almost like the final scenes of mccabe  mrs miller warren beattys character always seems like the toughest guy in town but by the end the pathetic nature of human beings is shown and his weaker side is at last exposed,reality
blinded by action sequences and explosions fury road lacks depth and emotion leaving the audience confused if they want more or if they care at all to simply summarize the plot drive away stop drive back after you finish the 2 hour flick you wonder if anything was even accomplished and leaves the viewer feeling empty after the stuntinduced high and raised adrenaline from one of many 1015 minute high speed action sequences any acting or lack there of is intended to be ignored by the viewer in hopes to avoid the lackluster and unintelligent dialogue written by an action movie director could be the most overrated movie that won 6 oscars in my opinion,reality
i dont know what the producers were thinking when they made this movie the movie bored me to tears a 10 year old could have done a better job i think it is time to stop making movies as the more they make the worse they get the car and truck scenes are to far fetched there was nothing exciting that kept you on the edge of your seat i was so glad when the movie finished i was asked by my husband if the producer was smoking something when they made the movie because you would have to be smoking something to watch it if i had bought this movie i would be asking for a refund the story line is the same as the last movies so why did they bother with it if they had nothing new to add,reality
tom hardy is haunted by his past failures to save the innocent he is captured by immortan joe and his men imperator furiosa charlize theron is driving the war rig to transport to gas town and bullet farm instead she has freed immortan joes imprisoned wives and escaping back to her former home the green place is chained as a blood bag on the front of his car with war boy nux nicholas houltthe action is unrelenting the car stunts are amazing and fully worthy of the name it is pure energy on screen the only thing missing is a gyrocopter and mel gibson tom hardy is physically acceptable as although im not thrilled with the character hes lost a bit of the spark the spark he lost has been transferred to furiosa and has lit a blazing inferno she is more than i am also pleasantly surprised that rosie huntingtonwhiteley is actually good in this movie the action the outrageous vehicles and the pure energy make this something unlike anything else i would suggest putting the stunts in the closing credits jackie chan style,reality
after finishing this movie i wanted my money back the problem is i didnt pay i watched it at my friends house he was telling me how good it was and i completely disagree visually it was great but the acting was sub par and the story was weak i would rather watch the first three movies then watch this again i may give it another try but i seriously doubt it i am a big tom hardy fan but this has to be the worst movie he has been a part of i hope that if he is in any squeals that they give him a way bigger part and a better script they must have been trying to give us shock and awe and hoping that we wouldnt notice the bad script,reality
i saw this movie in the movie theater today it is enjoyable but boy what a flimsy story i reckon if they had invested 1 of the props budget in a decent scenario this film would be better off because the props are really fantastic great job there also there is plenty of action in fact there is too much action the whole movie is practically one long car chase and with all things in life good and bad too much is too much rev up the engine shoot a few times fight on the truck throw somebody off the truck push a vehicle away benhurstyle and repeat 5 times there is your complete scenarioive read some reviews here and yes the movie lacks dialogue and indepth character study and a decent story but ive said this alreadyi have a suspicion that people who liked snowpiercer are also gonna love this one ic 14y old boys and hillbillies the plots in the movie are highly improbable i actually had a bad feeling after the first scene and my fear came true not homage worthya game to play while you are watching this film is deciding which model looks best it keeps you busy the whole time the budget for this film was 150m dollar if humanity keeps making such films surely we are heading for apocalyptic times,reality
what are action movies today they are a sea of cg pg13s just for the label marvel super heroes and michael bay jokes but every so often there is something like this and while this is an existing franchise this moves shows us what a modern action movie should be one of the draws of the original trilogy is the real stuntwork during the action scenes there really is something special about watching an actual stunt and knowing it was done for real fury road actually is real stuntwork like its predecessors but not only that it is far more ambitious in every action scene just about every move someone makes or a crash during an action scene here really is a spectacle the theatrical trailer is just a small taste of what happens and i estimate that 5075 of this movie is pure action yet it somehow doesnt grow old but this is not a cg free film however cg was only used to remove stuff like rigging and wires which makes the action even more spectacular another spectacle this movie has to offer is the production design just looking at the vehicles and how most of them are pieces of different vehicles is just incredible and they all were real and at last theres the story this movie sort of is a remake of the original and the road warrior but at the same time is its own original film not only that but theres the aspect of the characters and despite the massive amounts of action every major character is completely developed and even the supporting cast is very memorable for different reasons in actuality the story keeps the action from getting old and the two parts actually are almost the same thing this movie is almost a month old at the time im writing this review and this is one of my top 10 favorite movies this may not be the case for most people but the use of action as visual storytelling really left an impression on me and i wish more action movies will follow in its footsteps it really is impressive that 30 years after the last movie and after 14 years of delay that george miller brought back his signature series with a completely new vision i look forward to the sequels that come this is a really simple summary and it does not do the movie the justice it deserves fury road is a movie that cannot be summarized in words it can only be experienced,reality
fury road can best be described as the film equivalent of an adrenaline shot a literally breathtaking movie that offers the best action seen in years even though relying on a somewhat thin plotstill this doesnt mean that there is no story whatsoever director george miller the mastermind behind this whole franchise since the very beginning does a nice job of familiarizing the viewer with the crazy postapocalyptic world he created set in a desert wasteland somewhere in the future this world is weirdly appropriate mixture of bdsm steampunk and motorheads our hero rockatansky tom hardy who replaces the original mel gibson is captured by the socalled war boys an army who belongs to the crazy tyrant immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne whom they worship like a god joe rules over a region called the citadel with endless water supply yet limits the water rations of his people to a minimum to assure his leadership one day he sends out a war rig driven by his lieutenant imperator furiosa charlize theron to get fuel and bullets which just like water are rare goods in this world but furiosa has other plans together with immortan joes wives his breeders she plans to free herself as joe finds out he and his army of war boys start to pursuit her whos being used as blood bag to a sick war boy called nux nicholas hoult has to come with them strapped on nuxs car from here on a crazy movie emerges that defines the expression actionpacked in a new way explosions carchases fightscenes everything happens at once at an insane speed captured by the camera in the most beautiful and iconic way one can imagine the movie clearly benefits from the practical approach they took one catches himself to cringe at some of the impacts seen on screen the few cgiheavy sequences fit in well with the rest of the film the great soundtrack and soundediting make this one of the liveliest movies of the last couple of years maybe even of alltime thankfully the movie doesnt solely rely on its fascinating action instead it manages to bring in a lot of interesting characters and a thin yet perfectly functioning plot especially george millers ability to establish his characters and give all of them interesting personalities is impressive considering how little talk there is throughout the whole film particularly imperator furiosa deserves to be mentioned here she is probably even more so than himself the main character of this movie her hope and search for freedom is what this story thrives on furthermore she is one of the strongest female characters in recent movie history both meaning that she is kicking ass but also well written developed and understandable which is often a problem with female leads the wives are also worth mentioning they could have easily become onesided forgotten characters or even worse annoying eyecandy who depend on a man to save them instead all of them have their own charactertraits which make them likable and individual the plot itself functions mostly as a justification for all of the insane action but still offers enough substance to involve the viewer emotionally and intellectually some might even shed a tear here or there yet one thing must be said about the dialogues as i mentioned earlier there isnt a lot of talking in this movie thats no problem however the use of dialogue is one instead of letting the imagery speak for itself or implementing things in the dialogue important plotpoints are often just spoken out directly which comes off a little weird from time to time this is seen in the greater context of the movie forgivable but could have been done in a smoother way performancewise tom hardy and charlize theron are both great as lead characters even though therons star shines a little brighter in this one than hardys thats no surprise since mostly communicates via grunts and gestures whereas imperator furiosa is a more fleshedout character who experiences far more emotional changes and who develops therefore a closer emotional attachment to the viewer than the supporting cast is solid throughout led by a brilliant nicholas hoult model rosie huntingtonwhiteley bounces back from an awful performance in the awful transformers 3 as the lead wife and hugh keaysbyrnes is a wonderful villain if somebody is faintly reminiscent of the first seeing him  he played the main villain there toofury road offers everything one might hope for and probably even a little more the mostly handcrafted action is obviously the selling point of this movie and that alone is worth the entrance still every actionsequence serves to develop the story as a whole which even though short offers enough turns and twists to keep the viewer interested as a whole this movie is a brilliant showcase for all studios on how to revitalize a beloved movie franchise in a fresh yet recognizable way if this turns out to be george millers last movie one can only congratulate for ending his career with what might be the best actionmovie of alltime,reality
haunted by his turbulent past and having visions of people of whom he couldnt save believes the best way to survive is to wander alone nevertheless he becomes swept up with a group fleeing across the wasteland in a war rig driven by an elite imperator furiosa they are escaping a citadel tyrannised by immortan joe from whom something irreplaceable has been taken enraged the warlord marshals all his gangs and pursues the rebels ruthlessly in the high octane road war that followsto say that this film is an experience is a huge understatement to describe the film is simple its a two hour chase movie where the runners stop for a break for about ten minutes and then hit the road againliterallybut to say its a movie is a little bit of an overstatement as here he plays second fiddle passenger if you would to imperator furiosa the films story belongs to her but most of the narrative belongs to the titular character but you will be so lost in millers vision your left so breathless to even care about politicsits not a reboot in any sense of the word this fits somewhere between the original and the road warrior and it has that absolutely crazy feel to it just like you remember furiosa and aside i couldnt think of one character who didnt have their own particular trait from physical disabilities believe me in some twisted way the film plays out like a viewable medical journal to strange looks and this goes for every single supporting characters not one is how you would say in a perfect worldnormalthey are all odd in their own unique way the way that you wouldnt feel safe around themas soon as the war rig takes a detour the action never gives up and there are times when its so over the top so visceral its a white knuckle ride and there were times when i was going ooooo like an old womancars are thrown around people more so and immortan joe has his own mobile soundtrack awe inspiring laugh out loud funny and making this something else even when the truck stops for a second the imagery in the background of the huge angry convoy still makes it feel urgentmy only quibble is when furiosa reaches what she believes to be the green land the movie grinds to a halt so we can have a little bit of a summary of events but it only feels like this because the action of the film is so relentlesshardy man of few words is brilliant as and at times you really feel like he is channeling gibson with some of the looks he givesbut its therons movie her quest and she makes the film become more dangerous to her characters something believable in an otherwise bonkers worldmiller is a genius his daliesque vision is beautiful and this will easily be the most memorable summer movie of recent years and i feel in years to come alsowhat a lovely day for moviesmichael bay take note this is how you make a good looking action movie,reality
well after 30 years we finally get another sequel after years of development hell and false startsfirstly the good this film is visually incredible production kept the film as real as possible with the stunts etc and you can see that every penny made it up there on screen i saw this in i3d and was blown away by how it looked and towards the end it has quite possibly the best 3d effect ever in a film yes it was cheesy but it suited the film the films characters with the exception of which i will come to in a minute was brilliantly portrayed by an excellent cast which you would only get in a film nicholas hoult should get a special mention as should hugh keaysbyrne returning to the franchise after playing the toecutter in the original 1979 film he was quite frightening as immortan joe and had the appearance to go with it the guy with the flame throwing guitar needs a special award as most crazy awesome minor character in a movie however this is where the films only strengths liethe bad im sorry folks but tom hardy is very overrated as an actor and he is quite possibly the worst one in this film he is nothing like mel gibsons version of i bet he only has a few lines of dialogue in this film and the film really shouldnt have been called but furiosa as the film seems to be all about charlize therons character when hardy did speak its as though he was trying to find a middle ground of him being mel gibson and being his own actor and it was very badly done i really think that the films praise is exactly what happened with the movie gravity and although is nowhere near as bad as that movie i think its another classic case of people being in so much awe of whats on screen they have completely forgotten if they are watching a good film or not to me this film is not what should be with the original three movies there was something towards the end of each movie that sent over the edge which made him but with this film he is just along for the ride and for this reason and the fact that tom hardy was awful as i didnt like it yes i am a huge fan of the original three films and its obvious that we will never get back the grittiness of the first two films which in my book are the action equivalent of leones spaghetti westerns especially in style also the music was just awful as well i liked junkie xls music for 300 rise of an empire but god i missed the brilliance of brian mays scores from the first two filmsthe above is why i dont get why this film is being praised so much i recently watched the original film for the first time on bluray it looked and sounded amazing and i still love it today probably because the first film is more relevant for todays times than ever before i really did try and go to watch fury road with a fresh mind but as i have mentioned this just wasnt for me its just a damn shame that george miller didnt get to make this film 15 years ago with mel gibson sets were built everything was a go then the damn iraq war started and everything got shut downjust a thought why the series hasnt been as good since the second one its obvious that the glue that made the first two so special was obviously down to byron kennedy who produced the first two and sadly died while location scouting for the third film just like the star wars films it was the same when gary kurtz left the films have not been the same since although the director is responsible for the actual end product its obvious that lots of help and ideas comes from the producer its a shame reallyanyway there is already talk of another sequel and i hope it goes back to basics next time and not the overblown and overpraised movie that is fury road 510 and that was pretty much for the visuals,reality
fury road is the action movie ive been waiting to see in my five years of film reviewing i havent been waiting around in agony like a southern belle longing for her rhett butler  i have instead been continuously leaving the theaters of various actioners pleasantly charmed but thrills yes thrills have been kept at a minimum sure its fun to see cgi likable actors and bombastic set pieces mix it up with the delirium of a succulent martini yet these days action movies seem serviceable great for two hours but not for much else they dont stick with you you end up ranking their greatness in the scheme of other films in their franchise immediately after captain america the winter soldier last year for instance my sister and i spent most of the ride home arguing about whether it was better than the original avengers hardly talking about what we liked about it what made it such a successthe minute i grabbed a seat for fury road last night i didnt know what to expect the first three movies ending thirty years ago with the imaginative beyond thunderdome were cynical explosions of dystopian disaster where the mindset is kill or be killed and the lead character the titular isnt so much a hero as he is a wounded guy trying to survive the movies are so seminal because the action is so unforced the remaining population is so willing to slaughter for the final drops of gasoline to propel their decked out vehicles that the films may as well be called vs the world no one is ever ever safe you can count on to survive but you cant bet that the world will be a better place after he fends off his latest opponent fiery and desolate the balmy lands of the postapocalyptic future are never much of a haven isnt a hero rather a man who can work a gun and a car and who seems to constantly be in the wrong place at the wrong timefury road has been called a reboot of the original franchise but reboot seems too plain a word reboot suggests laziness a robocop no ones in the mood for with the same director at the helm george miller fury road is a reawakening a rollicking continuation and a startling return to form certainly it is the most brutal of all the films not for the screeching sissies of the population but it is also among the finest action movies in the history of cinema we have been able to stomach superheroes smashing goons into the buildings of new york city probably killing hundreds of civilians in the process for so long  here consequences are really consequences the characters are vulnerable however heroic or villainous they may be and the action sequences produce just as much of a thrill as they do a shudder for once something humane in us lights when someone gets crushed by a mountainous vehicletom hardy replacing mel gibson portrays rockatansky a loner deep in the australian outback attempting to hide from the dangers of the recent collapse of civilization only a few minutes into fury road is he kidnapped by the war boys the henchman of the tyrannical immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne who leads and controls a strenuous territory with a massive water source the war boys are essentially halfdead young men  in response is provided as a blood bag for the sickly nux nicholas hoult meanwhile imperator furiosa charlize theron an ally of joe takes off on her war rig to collect gasoline from a nearby pipeline but after driving off road it becomes clear that she has something else in mind she has brought joes five wives along with her who act as his means of breeding so a chase ensues the nefarious foes close behind and furiosa finally meet when nux catches up to the rig  and a partnership is formed left is a series of car stunts tour de force performances imaginative cinematography and a feelup of a dystopian society refreshing among a sea of ones filled with sexy teens and hunger gamesthe aesthetic of fury road is something of a punky raging pulp novel cars are covered in metal spikes guns are an extension of the arms of the characters night scenes are drowned in a cerulean blue the days a ferocious orange bullets eye patches and skulls arent simply decor  theyre part of the landscape as natural as the air as the dirt even part of joes entourage is an electric guitar player who strums whenever sht is about to go down these touches may be laughed at by some but as a part of millers vision theyre something of a wonderand while the film may include the name in its title furiosa is the hero of fury road and the female action hero weve all been waiting for long gone are the busty black widows and lara crofts with her metallic placeholder for an arm oil warpaint bald head as a stab at gender reversal she is an embodiment of zeroed in anger therons performance is by turns explosive and vulnerable you wont be forgetting furiosa any time soonyou can disagree with me all you want but fury road is the best action movie of the decade before you completely write this statement off the map though consider this what was the last action movie that really surprised you really slapped you around and didnt ask if you wanted to take a five minute smoke break this is visionary filmmaking action or otherwise,reality
i was dropped jawed throughout the entire movie what a ride gorgeous incredible and original looking visual effects and set costume and vehicle design the car  motorcycle chase scenes  stunts were paced and timed perfectly so i could see all the detail iow no frenetic jarring quick cuts that left me asking what just happened where did that come from i missed something it all made sense as if i was watching it livespecial effects has really improved in the last 5 years its all very realistic and seamless prometheusgravity ex machina are now four thats left me scratching my head in amazement usually in the past i could see signs of off looking cgi but now i cant tell fake from real where are they teaching people how to make this stuff only complaint is was ear bleedingly loud i actually felt i was getting nauseous just from the high energy intensity of the visuals and sound or maybe im just getting too old for these types of movies i felt i lost some weight watching it,reality
this is one of my personal favorite films im actually a fan of the films i really liked the first one second one the road warrior was even better and is also a personal favorite film of mine it was a long wait for this film like reaching the destination of any long road trip it was well worth the tripi really like the look of the post apocalyptic world which i feel just like with the road warrior is in a wider scope its dark and yet fascinating at the same time despite the lack of certain technologies they at least have some technology that works but of course the most valued are the automobiles which is to me what makes the post apocalyptic world fascinating because its a automobile subculture taken to the extremeit also really looks like the madinsane have truly taken over the earth and it seems like and furiosa along with others are literally almost the last sane people on earth which really creates that isolation feelingnicholas hoult as nux i though was a fun character and actually has a really solid character arc hes crazy and yet hes actually really smart which makes him useful to the crewtom hardy is excellent as rochatansky i really love the voice which is kinda rough and gravelly tone is well still its true he doesnt say much in the film but wasnt known much for talk anyway because hes a man of action and i like that as usual hes reluctant to do the right thing but he does it anyway because of how driven he is by his conscious and lets face it what else is he going to docharlize theron was just fantastic as imperator furiosa shes one on my favorite fictional feme fatales up there with betrix kiddo kill bill ripley aliens and others on my list i said my list and literally steals the show her character is just true to her name as she is just driven by fury and is just hellbent to her task willing to mow down anyone that gets in her way i love that she can kick some serious ass and takes crap from no one she literally almost beats in a one on one fisticuff fight which i always find cool seeing a supporting protagonist beating or coming close to beating the main one which i dont see enough ofboth and her have an excellent back and forth in a way its sort of the first time had a go two person that was a match for him and furiosa is more that one for him both in a way are almost the same in a way as both have been robbed of their family and are at the gangs the world and themselvesi like that with all three characters they have something in common all three want redemption for in his mind he failed to protect his wife and child from the scum in this world nux wants to be a hero but has been playing for the wrong team furiosa was practically kidnapped and forced to be one of joes solders this one task in transporting the slave girls to salvation is to them is the thing they need the mos to make some difference in the world and of course what their doing amounts to making a big differencethe villain i thought was solid fun and memorable immortan joe played by hugh keys bryne whom played the main villain in the first film which is really cool because in a way it makes things come full circle i really like the look of him he really looks like sweet tooth from the twisted metal video games i really like the voice which is menacing and you can tell from his mannerism he is completely crazy and nasty from the inside out which is just all the more motive for all three protagonists to get away from himbut like with most of the films were all really in it for the action and automobiles and both have plenty of gas and speed to keep you entertainedthe automobiles are also the stars of the film and their terrific i really love the designs of each of the automobiles which all look like they could be on the roster list in the twisted metal video game franchise each of them are uniquely colorful dangerous and crazy looking from one vehicle that is a mobile rock concert where there are enough amps to make anyone go deaf and there is some crazy mummy guy playing a guitar that also doubles for a flame thrower another with a crazy amount of spikes front to back its practically a mobile porcupine the action is just fantastic the stunt work and chirography in fight but also automotive driving is spot on and its over the top violence which makes it even better where automobiles are just exploding left and right bodies and body parts are just flying heads are getting blown off and so forthi really love the fact that this film is kinda one big chase movie which is great because it makes the film simplistic no boring bull crap the pacing in this film is just constantly going almost like in the film speed where you hardly have time to take a breath one of the action sequences i really liked was seeing just jump on one rival vehicle after another and just beating the crap or killing any of baddies manning them it just sort of remind me of swashbulckling actionwell ive said enough is back and still has plenty of millage for funrating 4 stars,reality
this is the best action movie i have ever seen this movie is a huge success with little dialogue cussing or nudity the story line was amazing i dont see anything wrong with the movie besides that it had an ending nicholas hoult did his best in this movie and it was phenomenal the best acting ive seen in a long time i would see this movie again it deserves all 10 stars because it was all around an amazing movie story line amazing plot amazing acting amazing violence amazing special affects amazing this movie is going to be a classic that i will buy and keep for a long time see this movie as soon as possible,reality
heres a question can an action film ever be considered art usually with big blockbusters such as avengers or the fast and furious series explosions are paired up with corny dialogue never do we see a film that treats this genre with respect and is willing to take risks the last time such a movie of the actionblockbuster genre was able to achieve such balance and quality was probably with christopher nolans the dark knight rises but we have another savior in the shape of mastermind george miller his latest installment in the series fury road might compete to be one of the best films of the series and i will be bold enough to say that it is one of the best films of the yearfury road achieves such a high caliber due to the incredible simplicity of its plot and the lack of unnecessary sub plots featured in todays action flicks fury road avoids telling the entire backstory of our main character tom hardy replacing mel gibson and simply jumps straight into the action with being captured and held prisoner we are in post apocalyptic australia although the film was filmed in namibia due to the very rainy season that australia had in the original films of the early 80s the main concern then was a nuclear apocalypse while this film sticks more or less to that apocalyptic theme one cant help but look at the dry landscapes and relate them to the climate change epidemic we are facing with prisoner to an oppressive leader of survivors named immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne we move on to the story of imperator furiosa charlize theron who ends up being the true main character of this story furiosa is a loyal and celebrated commander of immortan joes army of war boys however as the story opens we see furiosa betray immortan joe and steal his personal breeders women slaves used to feed and reproduce the survivor population a chase ensues and being used as a blood bag for an ill soldier named nux nicholas hoult is taken along for the ridewhat is most impressive about this film is that the majority of special effects used for the explosions and flying cars were not cgi according to imbb 80 of the special effects were live stunts i think the risk alone of that by the actors is enough to earn my respect however the explosions themselves were panned to look beautiful this paired with the either heavy metal soundtrack or verdi makes most of the fight scenes feel majesticgeorge miller is an aged director 70 hes made various great films including the original trilogy and the more family friendly babe and happy feet what is most striking about fury road is the lack of dialogue apparently miller had composed the film using storyboards first it was only after that that a screenplay was written and i think its the fact that miller created the story visually first that makes this become a precise spectacle this lack of dialogue also allows our actors to display the frantic paranoia that verges on insanity the performances from tom hardy and charlize theron are amazing but the true surprise here is nicholas hoult hoult is probably better known for his role as beast in the new installments of the xmen franchise in he plays a crazed war boy who has as his prisoner and blood bag hoult portrays his character with a restricted insanity so that he seems scary enough but one does pity him tom hardy plays with more grunts than dialogue and when he does speak he uses a voice that recalls his role as bane in the dark knight rises however after such scarring moments of his past one cannot blame character for having gone well so in that aspect hardy does a good job in handling the role as for charlize theron she plays furiosa with a composed viciousness since she is not objectified in this film as the attractive female that she is she was able to show the range of her acting chops with more ease in fact the majority of the second half of the film was filled with a womanpower that was appreciated and in the apocalyptic setting didnt seem forced at all it was only in some points that the actors felt a little lost amongst the chaos so that some character development doesnt end up being too realisticso in conclusion fury road is the perfect rebootsequel to the trilogy the beautifully created action sequences along with and explosive pace are enough to make one feel goosebumps george miller youve done it again,reality
epic visual graphic design exquisite package for the whole movie very very consolation turns a bad day into a what a lovely day every each of those casts played their role amazingly theres nothing more awaitable entertainment so far all of the credits to george miller and all of the supporting cast also for those whom take parts of this such brilliant masterarts some would say it might have been better than the avengers regardless of all the casts but considerate of how those movies made i dont think we cant make any arguments it was the same all empty works well cant wait for another 35 projects over this distinctive story thanks a lot cautions contains an enjoyable fulfillments,reality
so here was another weekend and as is the norm a movie in the theaters was on the cards i and my friends were all eager for piku as the word of mouth was on a rollbut sometimes things dont happen the way it should  as goes the rule of the fury road i randomly checked for other movies which were on the show this weekend and was excited by the ratings of fourth instalment with a staggering 99 rotten tomatoes 89 metacritic and 89 imdb rating i just drifted towards this ride of contemporary cinema and oh what a ride it washaving never watched any instalment before i had no idea what to expect from the movie but then less expectations more funthe movie is based on a postapocalyptic world and adding any more description to it would be an injustice towards the people who are yet to watch it its a one of a kind movie and describing the movie would be like ripping the heart out of its charisma i mean we must have watched movies of different genres and different scenarios and different presentations but one could rarely fathom a movie which goes beyond those classifications this movie redefines every adjective which we have ever used for describing a movie it is pure ingenious cinematic brilliancethis movie sucks you in its world and makes you undergo such surrealism that you are on the edge of your seat throughout its ride it is not only the madness which gets to you it is the ultra skewed world the premise the machines and the inherent humour in the face of doom which gets instilled in your veins as if you are the part of that world such is the intensity of the cinema that youd want to jump in the road of fury as binding as it gets towards a true movie watching experience and a cinematic marveli learnt about the franchise from wikipedia and i was more than overwhelmed to know that the first movie broke all the records of the boxoffice in australia it is an australian franchise and held the guinness record for most profitable film for decades the other two sequels have also had great runs and by the look of it the fourth one is seemingly going to topple the previous films earnings george miller the director of the franchise must really be a man from another worldwatch this movie for its surreal setting which seems from another planetworld its thrilling and spellbinding action sequences its warmachines the special effects and exclusively for the madness the humour and the innate meaning it carries for the dwellers of the real world the last time i was this overwhelmed by a movie its name was interstellar watch  fury road because it is pointing its fingers towards you and screaming witness mefor the sheer cinematic experience  55,reality
crazy fun inventive beautiful and most of all crazyive been a fan growing up i must have seen road warrior countless times and when i heard they were doing a remakesequel without mel gibson i was skeptical then again it was george miller so perhaps there would be potential the series has progressed more and more with ideas and visions of how an apocalyptic society would be and fury road had a far larger budget than the previous films visually the film is stunning and the car stunts are something i havent seen id compare the car stunts to the raid 1  2 they are creative over the top and some scenes are very extreme the acting is top notch as fury road has charlize theron and tom hardy theres a sense of sadness through those characters also the other characters you get a small glimpse of the chaotic nature of this not so distant apocalyptic future,reality
after allowing it to lie dormant for nearly three decades george miller reboots his beloved franchise in a manner that i believe very few saw coming while its the season for raucous summer blockbusters that require little thought and provide for passing entertainment fury road changes course for the series and the idea of a blockbuster this is an exhilarating but uncommonly brutal display of some of cinemas most kinetic and coherent actions sequences of the last decade sewn together with everything from grotesque characters and characters that tread the line of being impressionisticfor the first time the titular character isnt played by mel gibson but instead tom hardy who provides a large amount of subtlety in addition id say that he also has about two full pages worth of dialog in a onehundred and twenty minute film he is less a character and more a brushstroke representation of an action hero even moreso than in the last three films taking place yet again in a distant future where societal order has collapsed is kidnapped early in the film by a gang known as the war boys led by the ruthless king immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne to be used as a blood donor meanwhile a woman known as imperator furiosa charlize theron who was assigned to use an enormous armored truck to collect gasoline the most sought after commodity in the community is driving off course with all five of king joes wives all of whom meant for breeding winds up escaping and hitching a ride with furiosa resulting in a long chase throughout the entire desertthere is a simple moral of personal redemption in fury road and its a moral that keeps the film from being entirely empty however its not tacked on or exploited in a way that feels heavyhanded this is one of the many tricky dances fury road manages to pull off and do so very well its also a film of details with screenwriters miller brendan mccarthy and nico lathouris essentially playing around on the large spacious canvas of the desert seeing where they can go and what they can do in order to create a film entirely focused on creating tension and breakneck action consider little inclusions like a deformed character who rides on an enormous truck shredding on an electric guitar with dozens of loud speakers behind him it doesnt add much to the story but it provides for some incredible sounds throughout the whole filmthe film also bears the best cinematography and visual effects so far this year the desert has scarcely looked more attractive in all its sunsoaked glory and cinematographer john seale gets some of the best most vivid shots of it throughout the entire film consider the scene when furiosa collapses to her knees in the desert as the sand and the sun are shown as limitless representations of time and space and stray sand grains softly glide on top of more compact sand effectively creating what looks like a mirage or even consider the longshots that show the intense scenes of the war boys catching up to furiosas truck all of these beautiful inclusions and more are thanks to an extraordinarily talented visual effects and cinematography teamfinally we have the action which makes up about ninetyfive minutes of the entire film and for the first time im not complaining for one the action in the film is captured clearly and vividly miller never loses us in the camaraderie everything is so visually pristine and clear that theres never a lost sense of suspense because the camerawork is shoddy or the editing failed to do the scene justice editor margaret sixel really shows her talents in the beginning of the film a briskly paced opening sequence involving who is haunted by past memories desperately trying to outrun the war boys whilst being burdened by visions of his past encounters these kinds of scenes are haunting and add a layer to what would otherwise be standard situations in action films however the action is captured so crisply that its impossible to ignore the sheer magnitude of talent on display herefor me fury road is an early candidate for the most surprising film of the year and favorite summer blockbuster this is a film that pulsates with life and energy taking one exhilarating cacophonous circumstance after another and bathing it in road rage gasoline and unbridled chaos its immaculate portrayal of madness almost works to call out other bigbudget films that have skimped on their own visual clarity proving great results can be achieved if time is taken to do such great work it appears that during his time away from the franchise miller reflected on where he wanted to take it and what results is a fully realized film that struts with confidence and swagger the film proves a lot of things about action films but most importantly also proves you can have a franchise lie dormant for years and if seriously handled and given to the original creator there is still potential for a spectacular comeback,reality

if you have never seen the other movies you will like this one but if you are a fan of the old movies then you might be disappointed as i was there wasnt anything new in my opinion and there was less blood i would rather watch the original movies myself i was hoping to seen new wild action scenes and more violence but i was let down like i said if you want a only action movie and havent seen the original movies you will like it its only pg13 so if it comes to dvd with an unrated version then it might be somewhat better i also felt like tom hardy was using the bane voice to much in the movie and made me laugh my friend that hasnt seen the original movies really like it so i understand why there are so many good reviews because it has a lot of action,reality
after a 30 year gap george miller at last returns to his roadwarrior franchise set in a dystopian future this time starring tom hardy in the title role however the film is misnamed  his partner in mayhem imperator furiosa superbly played by charlize theron provides all the motivation and purpose for the thin plot and story unwillingly at first is just along for the ride the ride in question though is a thrillaminute chase across arid desert and rocky canyons infested with all kinds of postapocalyptic lowlifes intent on stopping or capturing furiosas fortified articulated lorry  the warrigfuriosa is a driver for the local warlord a horrendous character named immortan joe who seems to have fathered an entire race of warriors and uses them along with his control of the water supply to enforce his will on the ragged and desperate population joe has five favourite concubines he uses as breeding stock and furiosas mission is for her to return to her childhood home and save joes women at the same time naturally joe is reluctant to part with his harem and so pursues his erstwhile employee which provides a frame on which to hang two hours of hugely enjoyable chaos which often makes little sense but never fails to entertain and amusemiller must have enjoyed the advent of cgi it enables this film to be what the first three films never could be although to be fair the cgi is used sparingly and heavy reliance is placed on daring and dangerous stunts if there was an oscar for stuntmen this film would be right up there the cinematography is stupendous and set and costume design are sumptuous and convincingthis film may only attract technical awards by the academy but believe me its an evenings entertainment not to be missedthe only real criticism i have is that the character of is not developed in any real way save for the flashbacks he gets at critical and often inconvenient moments has very little dialogue and very little emotional input to the film hardy does very well with what he was given but i hope that the next film has him open up a bit more in some wayswelcome back 9 out of 10,reality
after three decades returns to cinemas i had high hopes for the fourth installment to my knowledge confirmed as a midquel between road warrior and beyond thunderdome and the return of george millers direction gave me hope even without based mel that is why i am happy to report that fury road wholly delivered it is not as good as road warrior but hey being 2nd best aint too badill start with the obvious tom hardy is great as and is worthy as a successor to based mel his carries all the nuances mel carried and while not as dynamic as mel hardy still keeps his stoic demeanor flawlessly through the film a newcomer in the series is charlize theron as the warrior imperator furiosa shes totally badass even more so then the amazonian in road warrior she may be one of the coolest female badasses ive seenspeaking of these two what makes fury road work as an action movie is how fragile and furiosa are the peril is real as is the threat of them dying it is easy to root for them and feels great to see them succeed however it is just as easy to root for the villains theyre so delightfully insane that its just pure jot to see them on screen one dude has a powdered wig made of bullets and sits in a chair mounted to a car another dude is eyeless and rides on top of a car playing a flaming electric guitar for a majority of the film the villain of the film immortan joe while not nearly as good as lord humungus from road warrior is still pretty cool and his design is one of the best villain designs ive seen in a whilethe guy who steals the show is nux played by nicholas hoult he is so insane it is awesome and his character arc throughout the film is strong poignant and genuine goofy like the gyro captain but also a tragically well written character nux serves as the most memorable side character good thing he has lots of screen time the war boys in general may easily be the best and most fun group of baddies ive ever seen in a movie on the downside the sex slaves immortan joe is chasing arent memorable and are just kinda there and some of their dialogue is confusing theyre walking talking macguffins but what else could they bethe thing to be most commended is the action fury road starts fast and never lets up it is basically one long action scene but the action is so visceral intense genuine and that it never gets old or tiring this is without a doubt the best and most fun blockbuster action i have seen in a theater in quite some time the direction is pitch perfect and the editing is high octane the sound also perfectly accompanies the direction in bringing these sweeping car fights to life the sound effects are perfect and the score ranging from classical or booming orchestral compliments each scenethe plot isoh come on who watches for the plot theres a truck in it are sex slaves a tyrant wants gets tangled drive away from the tyrant or die trying that is fury road it serves its purpose and echoes a typical plot and serving as a segway into the mind blowing action scenes for all its runtime the movie is entertaining as hell while also being masterfully craftedin short this is the movie george miller dreamed of making as a film it succeeds in leaps and bounds it is one of the most intense and thrilling action movies ive ever seen and rights all the wrongs commercialized blockbuster have inflicted nostalgic without ever feeling rehashed this trip down fury road is one hell of a ride that should not be missed please i urge you to go see this film if you are a a fan b an action movie fan c one who actually cares about great quality high budget movies not about rehashed superheroes or toy linesdont let this suffer the same fate as dredd help the return of the violent r rated testosterone high action movie succeed,reality
last nights viewing of the latest installment has left me and the entire cinema in awe i was never a huge fan of the movies so when i heard about another installment i was not too thrilled but i decided to give it a shot the first impressions and reviews that i heard from cannes got my hopes up and the imdb reviews got them even higher from the opening sequence i new that something wild and crazy was at hand 1 the story unlike the last three movies this one has a story that actually makes sense and has a beginning and an end it is not something spectacular or groundbreaking as inception or interstellar but it functions perfectly simple and understandable without any difficult explanations or twists ending with a sequence that can only be explained as an adrenaline injection into the spine2 the acting since the movies stars are hardy and theron much was expected i believe that hardy was the best possible choice for and he did a good job the cold crazy performance he gave made me feel like i was watching a wild animal in a cage trying to escape this perfectly intervenes with the script and the dynamic of the movie his madness and barely controllable rage follows the story so perfectly it is hard to believe that any take was made during filming fluent and uninterrupted without a single break of character hardy is but even though it takes a whole lot of heart to say this therone gave the best performance in the movie her acting is something so perfect and flawless it is hard to believe she has only one oscar her character and her portrayal was extremely vivid and lifelike she was the only character that i believed was a real life person and not a comicbookstyleversion of a real life person in an post apocalyptic world combined hardy and theron took the movie to a whole new level a level the previous versions never even came close to 3 the atmosphere by far the best element of the movie the postapocalyptic feel was present from the first sequence to the last one could almost feel taste and smell the dirty and disease infested wasteland of a world the story takes place in the colors and combinations of colors present in the movie gave it an even more relevant feel the drastic change of color picturing night and day was as beautiful as terrifying but the thing that makes this movie even crazier is the paste perfect timing perfect duration of the sequences the editing was the best i have seen in an action movie in the last 20 years all in all this visual masterpiece is george millers triumph and best movie by far it is brutal ugly dirty it holds no connection to reality whatsoever and that is exactly why it is so brilliant it is a movie that must be seen over and over again at this point fury road is the best movie of the year the best movie and one of the best if not the best action movie in the last decade,reality
this title pushes the limits of cinematic brilliance some scenes hold you to your seat just looking at the visual treat that is before you dont let me lead you astray  that is only one part  a major part but still only one detail of this amazing movie is one hell of a ride  and i mean every word of it  we have a glimpse into what man will become when everything goes to  it is not hard to imagine such an outcome just take the niceties out of the world we live in and enter into the desert and nitrous filled world of this movie you need to see again and again  seeing it once  you will forget what it was all about a review without giving much away okay you have tom hardy  furiosa charlize theron immortan joehugh keaysbyrne  and some other folks some really cool folks you think that this movie is a chase  but it develops into something much much more  some people want redemption  some people want to keep hold of what they have  some people want to correct the way things are  for a movie that is thought to be this violent  it is not gory  it is actually beautiful there is no over glorification of kills  no slow mo shots  this movie is not about that  who says you need words or sanity to make a movie work  is a success worth watching more than once  but this movie screams for a bigger screen,reality
if youre reading this you should stop right now and go see fury roadand if youve already seen it go ahead and see it again sure there isnt much for character development or much by way of story at least not the conventional variety that movies usually containbut it was still there just a bit differently conveyed and with a strange sort of im loathe to use the word in reference to this movie simply because it sounds absurdsubtlety the plot is propelled in a very visceral way with the explosive momentum of the action itself as the vesseland good lord was that intensethis movie took the tension and action from the road warrior and beyond thunderdome rolled it all into one beautifully executed package and made it far more epic than the previous films could have been this was the movie i spent more than a decade waiting on from the first time george miller began discussing his plans for fury road only to have it put on what appeared at the time to be a permanent hiatus and it was worth the wait as much as i wanted to see mel gibson reprise his role tom hardy handled it with the sort of professional capability that made it easy to deal with while experiencing the final product hell there were even scenes where he was almost indistinguishable in the role from road warrior era gibson charlize theron was fantastic in what amounted to the leading role of the movie but theron being great comes as no surprise to anyone i would imagine she always is of course we cant forget the absolute perfection of continuing the farscape correlation at least those of us who were fans of farscape melissa jaffer who played utunoranti pralatong plays keeper of the seeds in fury road just as virginia hey who played pau zotoh zhaan portrayed warrior woman in the road warriorand then theres also the fact that hugh keaysbyrne who played toecutter in once again portrayed major antagonist by portraying immortan joe in fury roadlittle things like that really do make me happyim not going to deny that there are probably numerous flaws with the movie beyond the miniscule ones that i noticed but i couldnt conceivably care lessthe whole was strong enough to compensate for any shortcomings in the components admittedly im a fanboy im one of those people who sincerely feels that original trilogy of films stands just as strong as movies like the terminator and the other movies from the same time period that are considered to be classics by many my opinion is of course a bit biased in that respectbut not that biasedit was fun it was intense it was jawdroppingly spectacular where the effects were concerned the cinematography was actually beautiful in a lot of respects the acting was solid and consistent throughout and millers directing was superb this one is worth seeing on the big screen as many times as you can manage it in 3d if you can manage it it takes advantage of the 3d better than a lot of movies doso get going,reality
i couldnt help but think of st john paul iis description of the culture of death and how it kills a civilization either slowly or very quickly peter kreeft following on this line said the the third reich was supposed to last a thousand years but only held for over a decade simply because it chose to build itself through killing its own a similar note rings throughout fury road as we are presented with a story of humanity at a crossroads in figuring out how to rebuild itself after a profound era of destruction the movie tells the story of a group of women who escape a vikinglike primitive civilization in search for freedom from slavery as prizes for a select group of men in her culture civilization as we know it now has dramatically fallen and gangs of primitive tribes form around a culture of gasoline and cars manipulating them and extracting all their worth as their dependence on it will eventually fade imperator furiosa charlize theron leads a group of haremlike women out of their desert city as tom hardy gets reluctantly drug into their escape merging goals of finding a way out to freedom the relationship of men and women one thats crucial to the survival of a civilization is at the core of fury road what the movie presents are two extremes of the sexes in relation to each other one given a very bad depiction in its harsh expression and rightfully so and the other in a more subtle though inevitable retreat into nothingness the city furiosa and escape from is nothing more than a slave state with a despot that controls his people through water distribution he chooses a group of women to be his harem and thats that later in the film were presented with a rival tribe composed of only women and hostile to all men that come their way theyre even laying bait and hunting them this too will not sustain a civilization the obvious necessity for any civilization to thrive is a way to produce stable homes for children and a culture that threatens that and there are plenty of ways that that can be threatened will destroy itself especially if it rejects this necessity the two main characters and furiosa are a microcosm of this tension between the sexes grappling for power but working together toward the same goal freedom from a destructive society both struggling with the negative tendencies of their sex there are few movies that ive felt such anxiety over the pursuit of an evil and terrible gang of villains seeing what they do to those who oppose them the terror theyre threatening throughout the movie is almost debilitating and thankfully there are a few moments where we have respite from it a parallel exists today in isis which i couldnt help but think of throughout the movie its a terrorist society built on religious extremism and is notorious for brutality toward women and their enemies and unapologetically so the depiction of these gangs roaming and destroying what they wish is likely similar to whats being done by isis in our time which puts a weight on other societies to act on it in some way religion itself in the movie is given a lot of screen time and in very interesting ways the religion of furiosas society mimics the pagan religion of the germanic tribes of ancient northern europe with references to valhalla and their warrior emphasis men are brought up from birth as soldiers and the society is built around war and plundering characters in the movie routinely pray some to an unknown god and reference the afterlife which in a sense is a welcome addition to the film giving characters in the movie a more interesting arc and drive some will interpret this as a vestige of primitive societies that more advanced ones will grow out of and there is certainly the existence of childish religions however its not clear that the filmmakers are saying that for the first half of the movie is portrayed as a selfish and very distant renegade all the while carrying hallucinations from a past trauma in this i welcome an actual madness to something i was always wondering about the older movies just seemed like a tough guy nothing really meaning crazy about him in the older films this movie takes it more literally in the sense that hes suffering from a psychological ailment throughout the movie and it comes up repeatedly this adds an interesting handicap to and a more visible struggle hes working through as he escapes the tribe trying to kill him all in all the movie is a fun ride a tense one and it delivers other reviewers have called it a muchneeded shift for action movies in our time especially as the fast and furious style films run their course this movie carries with it a feel of mythology and universality something any jason statham movie probably couldnt convey as well as i write this news of more movies are on the way and i hope they hold this theme of civilization building stripping it down to its chrome shell and seeing how long it will run on a certain frame this movie does not contain any explicit nudity or foul language though the violence is intense and gory,reality
unless you identify yourself as a mens rights activist and really hate strong female characters fury road might be the best movie of the summerthe story for this one has the spirit of the other films the characters are terrifically written and performed tom hardy and charlize theron are particularly awesome in the film and theron pretty much steals the show as furiosa it was cool to see the actor who played toecutter hugh keaysbyrne in the first film return and play a new equally insane character the action is almost too much to handle and those with weak hearts might go into cardiac arrest from it all but appreciate it because the action is so awesome and the overthetops elements not only feel at home with the franchise but help make it wickedly entertaining and at times amusingaside from the spectacular action one of my favorite aspects of the film was how strong the female characters are none of them come off as weak or set dressings or as damsels in distress this movie thanks to the help of george miller getting eve ensler to consult on the characters isnt compiling with the outdated notion that action films have to be all about gruff growling men who seem to never shave but actually trim their 5 oclock shadow it stinks that this has to be a highlight when in reality it should just be expected but it was so refreshing to see an action film with women who just come off as tough and you never have to question why they are that wayoverall i absolutely loved this film and have no complaints about it the movie proved that sequelseven done years latercan work and it proved the old completely outdated notion that hollywood is still mysteriously pushing in 2015 that it is possible to have strong female characters in an action film heck i actually thought the character of furiosa was way tougher and cooler than and i now want to see a spinoff thats all about her hollywood take note because this movie just took you to school on how to write strong female characters,reality

i went into this film sceptical  i thought that as i hadnt seen the others i would be confused and bored but what actually happened was that in the first minutes i was blown away by this amazing film i never believed that it would be this good but it was the film goes on a confused and tyrant spiral as we see the socially inept having to join forces with charlize theron character who is badder than bad and action packed she is saving the sisters who only exist to be bred for babies in this apocalyptic thrill ride there are also insane sites such as a baby being pulled out of his mothers tummy with a knife and a man who is living on oxygen through a crazy and disturbing mask to be fair just watch for nicholas hoult as the wonderful nux who adds the comic relief and tragedy to the film what a day what a lovely day,reality
right out of the gate this film fires all 8 cylinders and never lets up the film is pretty much one large chase scene and while that sounds terrible on paper it works incredibly well the style of directing here is unique in that there isnt much exposition dialog at all everything you need to know is presented in small doses as needed to advance the story the film does exactly what a film should do and thats show dont tell you need not see the previous films to understand who is or why he does what he doesthe film is absolutely gorgeous most postapocalyptic films are bleak and dreary but this film breaks the mold for those not familiar with postprocessing film techniques its as if the entire film has been instagrammed because this film has little exposition through dialog the look of the film says it all one of the most impressive pieces is when they show the inside of a dust storm thats all ill say about thatthe sound design is flawless you feel every bullet shake with every explosion and are brought to near tears by the soundtrack there is also a very unique presentation to some of the tracks as the war parade has musicians acting as war drummers and trumpet players on the front lines im reminded of how tasm 2 used dubstep during the showdown with electro but this time the incorporation is actually goodthe film is ridiculous on so many levels in the best kind of way the man playing the electric guitar that shoots fire out is nothing short of lovable you actually feel like you are on the front lines of an all out war with war drummers and said electric guitar man being the driving force behind the energy the war boys are wicked cool and their belief system gives inspiration to their absolute madness their leader is utterly terrifying everything from his voice to his armor to his inability to feel true fear helps elevate this villain to the top 10 listthe amount of detail presented in every shot is breathtaking you really get the feeling that this is the film the director wanted to create for the last 30 years but because of budget concerns he was never able to the fact that this film was in development hell for so long is usually a clear sign of a destined failure see duke nukem forever but here it payed off the acting is spot on is still a man of few words and furiosa is the perfect teammate if you had to create a team of badasses you would pick furiosa and their chemistry is brilliant its not forced at all you know they need each other to survive and when they work together great things happen i was a little nervous when the first 30 minutes of the film contained michael bay levels of madness i thought well theres only one way to go from here i can safely say i assumed wrong the director has more than enough fireworks to last the entire run time the finale is absolute madness its not just people killing one another so survive its about redemption for multiple characters this was their last chance to make things right and you felt everything we have witnessed was nothing compared to what was to come the delivery was so action packed i couldnt believe what i was seeingits hard to find flaws in this film sure we can nitpick little things but honestly i would need to study the dvdbluray with a microscope to find them if you like action films you owe it yourself to buy a ticket for this,reality
this will become a classic in its own right i have given this a 9 because i would have wanted to see mel gibson back but too be fair tom hardy plays a very menacing and totally believable but i cannot help thinking that the role was written for an older who was looking to cure his inner demons since seeing the film i have read that george miller wanted to cast mel gibson but his previous public misdemeanours had prevented him from doing so what a shame i watched the film last night and felt the need to add my positive thoughts to the others on the imdb review boardit has a different agenda from the first three in that fuel is no longer the controlling element but water hope and the future of the human race charlize theron dominates this film and her character develops as the film progresses into a caring person ultimately looking for redemption someone i went with actually thought she must have had a prosthetic limb in real life such are skills of the cgi boys go see this in the cinema and enjoy it in all of its widescreen and dolby surround sound it is the only way to watch this masterpiece,reality
flesh and metal collide in the part sequel part reboot post apocalyptic no holds barred fury road 70 year old director george miller returns to the franchise he created 30 years after the last outing this time with tom hardy as and charlize theron as furiosa two rebels trying to survive in a desert landscape of lost humanity the plot is fairly simple imperator furiosa abandons her duties and sets out to find her homeland and take immortal joes young brides with her joe of course sets out to stop her and is caught up in this battle charlize theron is fantastic as furiosa with her artificial limb and war paint determined to find her home and reunite with whats left of her family tom hardy as is a man of few words troubled by visions of past horrors both need to work together as they guide the fragile and beautiful brides of joe to safety the film has a core theme of feminist solidarity that balances well against the testosterone of immortal joe and his war boys the performances from the two leads and their mutual respect is told mainly through actions rather than dialogue exposition takes a back seat hereunlike previous films in the series the budget this time around of 150 million finally matches the ambitions and imagination of the director the sheer originality on display is impressive stunning photography high contrast warm colour palette and smooth camera work draw you into the wild west wasteland the jaw dropping carnage of the action scenes are indescribable fast  furious is a walk in the park compared to this you must see it to believe it but even then you still ask yourself is this actually happening it has the right mix of cgi and real stunts that will make you think back to classics like james camerons terminator 2 and it all looks awesome in 3d ithe score by tom holkenborg aka junkie xl is loud heart pounding epic and in sync with the bizarre but soon to be iconic flamethrower guitarist and tribal drummers who get their fair share of screen time are there any negatives to the film only a few immortal joe was fine as the main villain but the bullet farmer and the people eater lacked depth i wanted more time with them to understand their reasons for actually being part of the chase joes brides which included zoe kravitz and rosie huntingtonwhiteley werent the best performers and were quite bad at timesso despite tall that i highly recommend this film if for some strange reason youve been sitting on the fence its feral dark gritty anarchic surreal just pure mayhem fury road isnt just any action film its one that sits side by side with your favourite hollywood blockbusters a new classic that demands repeat viewings for its visual triumphs and sonic assaults now if you excuse me im off to watch it again,reality
the film has some interesting concepts but it doesnt particularly excel in any area there are some decent characters but none of the characters are really all that memorable with the exception of a guitar playing maniac who swings around on a ministage for the duration of the film guitarman as i shall dub him was the funniest and most memorable part of the movie for me overall the action is somewhat entertaining but it wasnt memorable there is a lot of vehicular warfare but most of it feels bland the handtohand combat and gunplay are similarly bland the character development isnt particularly revolutionary both of the main characters remain mostly undeveloped by the end of the filmon the topic of characters i must point out that some people are bashing the film and praising the film for nonsensical reasons on the one hand there are those who insist that the film is feminist propaganda introduced into theaters to pollute the action genre with excessive and invasive commentary on social issues like equal rights for men and for women this is simply nonsense is portrayed as the stronger character more than once if it wasnt for the mission would have arguably failed and furiosa would have died both characters have adequate screen time and i saw no contrived attempt to depict furiosa as a feminist symbol for the most part it didnt feel like the interaction between the two characters was supposed to serve as some kind of political commentary being that she has only one arm furiosa is seen in a weakened state multiple times not only does save her but he provides her with the right path to take when she is about to set out on a long and useless journey those who are attacking the film because of it being propaganda are in my opinion grasping at some serious straws simultaneously it is nonsensical to praise this movie for its depiction of women yes there is a strong female lead yes there are many women who play important roles in the film but to focus on this is to ignore the fact that the action is bland and the story undeveloped is to prefer political commentary over action in an action film to focus on praising the supposed feminist material embedded deep inside the action is to inject politics into a movie that is fairly simple and straightforwardall in all this movie has failed to provide satisfying and memorable action yes there are a few cool scenes and some fun moments but for the most part you wont come away from this movie remembering any particular crash or explosion apart from the rest this isnt to say that they are all equally amazing crashes or explosionsto me they werent really spectacular to begin with while the film did have some stunning visuals some appealing music and a very interesting postapocalyptic cultureit failed to be what it could have been if it intended to be an action film it didnt deliver enough the throaty v8 sounds are never met with interesting vehicular warfare rather its the same repetitive chaseandspeedup with the occasional exploding spear thrown for effect the interesting subcultures the group encounters are never given enough treatment to establish an intricate and wellwoven narrative for the audience if the film intended to be a commentary on a womans ability to match men it failed to do more than offer viewers with the opportunity to inject immature and baseless politics into the film but perhaps it intended to be a fertile soil from which widespreading dialogue on feminism and representation could spring forth if that is the case it arguably succeeded in achieving its goal  but the price for this is failing to be a great movie and instead becoming an overrated and politicized ployi would encourage you to watch it once if youre looking for some mindless action and plenty of v8 noise to take your mind off of things dont look here for a meaningful treatment of complicated issues though its greatest deeper meaning comes not from a deep detailed and carefully constructed narrativebut from the internet warriors who insist on forcing deeper meaning onto the bland action,reality
well first off i would like to point out that this film is one of the best paced action movies ive seen in a long time hence the 810 but it isnt a film its kind off a late spinoff there were many after the first films and as thus i can appreciate this film but as a film i give a solid 210 why no real explanation or exploration character building into ever growing madness but some vague flashbacks and references to the old films the over the top actionscenes greatly cgid though were most of the time too long and only there to fill up this movie with yet more action so that the story was left floating aroundwhich explains the lack off  but as said in the beginning its an action film and there is plenty of it in this movie too bad they lure people into thinking that this film is the real deal and feed on the franchise i did find myself at the end of this film hoping that would leave and he did there is at least that disappointing film but great stand alone action flick,reality
there are some movies considering a visual style the special fx or pure tnt action that set the benchmark of excellence for other movies to follow these films come very rare sometime once in a decade it is even more rare to actually see i remake which is directed by the same director from the original movie and it is total rarity if the new version is better then the original this is precisely what we get with this years most action charged remake of fury road an absolutely marvelous attempt by director george miller to revitalize this cult 80s classic the original trilogy set mel gibson on to the hollywood stardom and who knows this film might take charlize theron and tom hardy to the next level as well years after the collapse of civilization the tyrannical immortan joe enslaves apocalypse survivors inside the desert fortress the citadel when the warrior imperator furiosa charlize theron leads the despots five wives in a daring escape she forges an alliance with rockatansky tom hardy a loner and former captive fortified in the massive armored truck the war rig they try to outrun the ruthless warlords henchmen in a highspeed deadly chase through the wasteland essentially the whole movie we might describe as long continues action chase scene the intensity of pyrotechnics stunts and greens screen compositions is a unbelievable experience i had a pleasure to see it twice once in i3d and once in standard 3d the iversion is where the film truly excels in fact watching it you as the viewer are actively participating in what is going on on the screen the combination of great sound design and visuals create hypnotic atmosphere which we are lucky to experience i must say i dont remember the last time i felt such a rush it is truly mindblowing the way it is shot it looks as if director of photography recorded the action sequences in very slow frame rate and and in the post production editor speeded the action up creating very crisp sharp picture normally whenever camera operator moves camera sideways it creates a motion blur in fury road the picture is so crisp that at times is almost looking bit artificial apparently 80 of the movie was shot on location using practical stunts and only 20 of sequences where supplemented with cgi i have to say the first 30 minutes can be put in to a film history books as the most intense and mindblowing action sequence this film also uses a different color palate then most post apocalyptic movies of the past which usually focus on washed out desaturated color scheme fury road is highly colorful and saturated with red hot explosions and beautiful golden deserts the final color correction is a real eye candy the lead performances are very solid charlize theron brings extreme amount of intensity not seen since her magnificent oscar awarded performance in monster you can see that she did her homework the inner work which she has learned in ivana chubbuck studio shines through every inch of her being there is a strength and vulnerability in her performance which in someway steals the whole movie tom hardy in the last few years became truly well crafted actor his minimalistic approach to acting brings to mind genius of marlon brando he doest talk much relying on body language and sort of mumbling delivery of lines which creates very believable characterization the chemistry between him and theron is very good and we are hoping for them to succeed and fall for each other on the romantic level it looks like nicholas hoult has been casted based of his performance as a lovable zombie in warm bodies and to some extent delivers similar type of performance as a war boy  nux who is trying to get to mythical valhalla place popularized by vikings as the paradise after death where all the real warriors reside after their heroic death in terms of the story or rather a plot fury road is very straight forward which for some might leave something to be desired but lets face it this film does what it promises it offers mindblowing action unlike any other you have seen in the last few years in that regard fury road sets a new standard for action intensity and it looks like we will see more of sequels considering that tom hardy signed a contract to make 3 more movies if there is one thing to be critical about it is the fact that plenty of dialog was rerecorded using adr automatic dialog replacement which gives sense of artificiality because it is very difficult to rerecord dialog and give the same type of performance intensity as in the actual take on location the reason for it might be above mentioned frame rate racking which later in post production is being speed up where lips do not move in sink with the sound of the actors and subsequently need to be looped in adr session fury road is a new type of movie of a digital filmmaking age sort of benchmark of how other action movies will be judged i loved it and if you like an exhilarating action you wont be disappointed as well i promise,reality
fury road is a triumphant realisation of all that is possible on the big screen the explosions the violence the sounds forget all that you think you know about blockbuster action movies this is it okay lets pump the brakes for a second what makes a classic movie storyline and dialogue sure but well have none of that here thank you not necessary dont get me wrong i love a good cleverly written movie with witty dialogue and an interesting premise plus a dash of quirkiness but although is indeed interesting it doesnt have or need any of that other stuff this is visual story telling in its most basic and pure form it is little more than a car chase through the desert spanning a couple of days and destroying countless vehicles and lives along the way and it is beyond epic this is quite possibly the most action packed movie i have ever seen at times it borders on complete sensory overload there is just so much awesome stuff going on including a gimp chained to a truck playing a flame throwing guitar and ladies yes you should be going to see this with your boyfriendhusbandsignificant other hell go with the girls the thing is this i dont remember ever seeing a movie with so many strong female characters in it kicking serious arse true many of them are insanely hot but some are also old and wrinkly all are awesome girl power all the way i would be so darn happy if i went to see this again and there were big groups of girls going to celebrate having a vag and an attitude in this high speed desert pursuit rather than the formulaic clichd bullshit that is pitch perfect 2 sorry i just dont care how funny fat amy is director george miller deserves to be knighted or at the very least he should be given his own reality tv show where he gets to judge the everyday functions of everyday people in a situation that makes it seem somehow not mundane thereby becoming the most popular personality on tv the guy is a saint when i first heard they were making a new a thousand years after thunderdome i was highly skeptical no way could he pull this off no way could he make this relevant modern audiences wont appreciate it whats he gonna do have an old mel gibson oh wait tom hardy is going to play and its going to be set around the same time as the original movies i dunno man i have never been so happy to be wrong about a movie the theme song from the lego movie belongs here now everything is awesome quite simply this is the best movie ive seen this year go see it 9510 see all our reviews at wwwfacebookcomshenaniganmoviereviews,reality
fury road stars tom hardy charlize theron and nicolas hoult and is directed by george miller the plot revolves around imperator furiosa a woman who is trying to get back to her homeland as well as escorting five young women who are on the run from the dictatorlike immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne a man who has rallied an army of doomed radioactivepoisoned boys  the warboys the kamakrazee  and who has basically enslaved a population of people since he promises them water something that is rare in this world these five women played by rosie huntingtonwhiteley zo kravitz abbey lee riley keough and courtney eaton are also immortan joes wives kind word for it his price breeders its here where and furiosas paths crossnow the story in essentially boils down to a twohour car chase even though the story has more layers to it than what you would expect in any similar films furiosa needs to get these women from point a to point b but theres a lot more going on than that beneath the surface of the initial plot has gained a lot of hype especially during the past week or two most of this originates from early wordofmouth that supposedly said that this movie was amazing the movie then gained an unprecedented 98  on rotten tomatoes and an 89 on metacritic seven points higher than the dark knight critics cited this as one of the greatest action films of all time now obviously this puts a ton of pressure on this movie and how well does it hold up to those words well to put it simply fury road is an achievement and one of the best films ive ever seen  ever this movie was absolutely incredible a feast for the eyes if youre a movie fan then this is a must go you have to see it to believe it so why is the movie so fantastic well lets start with the performances and the characters tom hardy is great as rockatansky he may not have a lot of lines in the movie but tom hardy pulls off troubled past subtly and perfectly and then you have charlize theron as furiosa she was fantastic in the role some have argued that she is actually the main character of this movie the one who really drives the movie forward and thats not a bad thing because she knocks this role out of the park and furiosa as a character is really well written and fleshed out despite the fact that the focus isnt really on the characters at all but rather the action the biggest surprises of this movies ensemble came from nicolas hoult who plays warboy nux and from the lovely ladies who play the characters who are referred to as the wives nux as a character may be the deepest in the movie and at one point that character even moved me to tears in a movie in which a man plays an electric guitar which shoots flames through its neckyeah its that good the wives are also very interesting since they dont play like usual damselsindistress at all instead each one of them feels unique and importantbesides the performances and the surprisingly layered and deep characters there was a thousand other things to love about this movie the score is perfect by junkie xl and the writing is also perfect it just really fits with the movie but lets get down to the bones of it the essential parts of why this movie has made such a splash first of all this movie contains what easily competes with the absolute best action sequences ever put to film in the history of motion picture cinema the action scenes  who are 8090  practical effects differentiating itself from todays cgi heavy films  are absolutely breathtaking mindblowing and jaw dropping there were several moments were my jaw dropped from the sheer spectacle before my eyes and due to my other main thing namely the cinematography this movie is one of the most beautifully shot films of all time in my opinion the way george miller utilizes day and night sequences and differentiate themselves from oneanother is brilliant every shot is a sight to behold and its so nice to see a postapocalyptic film that has such colors that this one hasverdict fury road is a spectacular visual effects extravaganza of epic proportions with surprisingly layered characters and heartstopping beautiful cinematography and production design but the real surprise is the tender backbone that the film backs up its insane action scenes with and its all thanks to the real star of the picture george miller whos dream film no quite literally dreamfilm he dreamed of this movie a decade before it ever saw first light is perfectly executed by a master filmmaker by the end of the film you cant do anything than to applaud and bow to the mastermind himself fury road is the movie to beat for the remainder of the year and the action movie to beat for the remainder of the decade1010,reality
the postapocalyptic genre is a very bleak but somewhat uplifting critique on our future the idea that the world would be wiped out through a thermonuclear bombing an act of desperation causing the destruction of a country or even the rapture of biblical lore has been hammered into our minds for years becoming as popular as a view of our future as much as the shiny utopian model from the jetsons is personally im a big fan of this genre a world where scavenging and common necessities become vital for your survival has a great deal of potential for survival based horror adventure revenge stories even stories that just expand in the setting alone just remember when you think darkhorse knightdhk you think postapocalyptic storiesthat being stated and brought out of the way im about to review one of the best films to embody this genre and the best summer film of 2015 as of now fury road and oh what a lovely day it is to be a cinemaphille the film starts off with our cynical protagonist played by tom hardydark knight rises bane standing on a crag along with his car while a narration gives us a brief statement about both the oil wars and the water wars after a brief car chase with a tribe of raiders is captured and shackled being assigned as a blood bag for nuxnicholas hoult soon we get a good look of immortan joe the anarchofascist ruler of the many tribes a crippled man wearing lifesupport and covered in armor adorned with the many biker medals one assumes after a life of conflict joe is immortalized as a god among mortals he controls the water and the food and therefore he controls the wastes despite many wounds and blisters covered joe proves that hes the chief and king for a reason by leading charges with his lieutenant rictus erectus on a monstrous war machine made up of vintage muscle cars from the 50s during a supposed run to gas city imperator furiosa another lieutenant sneaks joes prized breeding women away to a sanctuary that may or may not exist in the desert after being double crossed joe sends a war party lead by himself to chase down the rogue imperator nux hearing this finds this a great way to prove himself worthy of valhalla so he may die a heroes death and be born again since he needs blood to make his journey is forced to join himhowever the mission is compromised by a sandstorm the heavily pregnant breeding women is killed after joe runs her over with said war machine to which he grieves so much that his iron jaw opens later a raider medic finds out the child that died in the womb was perfect as in free of any known defect fueling the flames of his vendettathe rest of the film is within the confines of a war rig a tanker resources like gas to fuel the truck and water to help cool off the engine are becoming needed by the mile in order to reach the sanctuary at the same time they both need to stay fast and conserve reserves and its impossible to do both without fail the film soon also doesnt have any subplots the entire running time is about getting to sanctuary the only thing close to a subplot we have is nux trying to deal with a crisis of faith while at the same time prove that hes worthy of valhalla if it doesnt exist even the closest thing to romance in the film is with nux but its only implied and never shown again due to his demise at the very end sacrificing himself to further the missionfury road is a success as a summer blockbuster can getand it runs to the end and goes beyond reaching for the stars in a giant bloody war machine it is also a continuous piece of the trend regarding postapocalyptic story telling dont miss out on a great filmalso theres a raider with a firespewing guitar how much better can you get5stars sranking,reality
im old enough to have caught all the original movies when they hit the silver screen here in americait was entertaining but i felt sort of let down i expected more of original formula as much as i like tom hardy in other movies he honestly couldnt carry the character then they tried to make up for it with some weird horror like montageflashbacks i got the feeling this had either gone insane or maybe he was on some serious drugsmel has this sort of spark to him his version was much stronger more masculine sort of like a superhero harding on the other hand seemed weak and kind of mushyim starting to feel that gibson would have been better again despite his age sure maybe he couldnt crawl under a truck anymore but arnold and stallone carry an action movie fine and they are even olderit did have the feel to it at times but for the most part it seemed to have a lot more of the modern feel unfortunately this time miller must have been wooed and couldnt resist the temptation to over do special effects like 90 of most action movies are these days ill say it again and again if you dont have story you dont have anythingdoes every movie need to be one and half hours plus of pure sfx it got to a point were the movie seemed too implausible and surrealand then it seems like miller was thinking screw it im going to make this movie really mean something and make this weird dynamic about some political statements all over miller seemed have gotten soft in the head the originals were like watch this wild strong guy try to survive in some apocalyptic wasteland and that was all we neededthis move just doesnt have that magic the original really had this edge to it and it had a lot of characterin the end its a pretty entertaining movie but like me youll probably leave a bit disappointed if you were a big fan of the originals,reality
the rest of the world is wrong this movie is terrible the only reason it gets 3 stars instead of 1 is because it is visually stunning and imaginative well one day the special effects and visuals in movies are going to be even more advanced and then this movie will have even less to offer there is no character development and no explanation of anything going on in the plot actually scratch that there isnt a plot the whole movie is one long chase scene where and company run away from halfdead people and everyone cuts and shoots each other there was basically no dialogue between any of the characters just a series of explosions and grunts ive actually never seen a movie with so little dialog,reality
hollywood has become hollyweird one of the worst movies ive seen in a long time,reality

twenty years from now when film geeks and ordinary moviegoers both look back on the movies of 2015 which one will first spring to mind as the movie that most defined the year above the avengers above all the traditional oscarfare above even the return of star wars fury road stands as the movie of the year i truly believe that in ten years this film will be nearuniversally regarded as one of the greatest action films of all time alongside die hard aliens terminator 2 the matrix and raiders of the lost arkit is an absolute masterpiece a film so lost in its worlds insanity that the viewer cant help but be pulled into every minute of it the nearconstant action is directed and choreographed with a precision and eye for detail usually reserved for art films its commitment to practical effects adds reality to every explosion and car crash every bullet fired and punch thrown until you can almost smell the gasoline smoke and blood and yet there is such beauty in it its as if were looking through the eyes of george miller to see the beauty to be found in all the chaos and destruction awash in bright colors of orange and blue that play as the gorgeous backdrop to the brilliant and unique designs of a fleet of tricked out muscle cars and war rigs making their eventual destruction into bits of flaming twisted metal all the more visually stunningbut all the action is backed up by a story with more feeling and humanity than countless more serious films tom hardy charlize theron nicholas hoult and a brilliant supporting cast milk every bit of emotion and character to be had from a script as stripped down and efficient as the films visuals are over the top the subtlest of facial expressions and effectual use of sparse dialogue manage to convey all the emotion we need to understand whats at stake its a story of redemption of finding life and hope where there is none of acting for justice and equalityfury road won 2015 ladies and gentlemen give it a round of applause,reality
fury road this was my absolute most anticipated film for the entire year and to just get this immediately out of the way this film did not in any single way whatsoever disappoint me it has been days since ive seen the film and im still pumped about it fury road is a masterpiece that is exactly what it is and there is not another word that describes it any better it is a masterpiece in every sense of the word in terms of action concept writing character style effects acting sheer filmmaking i grew up knowing of the franchise but i didnt really grow up with it other than the glimpses i had gotten and the few scenes i caught on television as a kid not until i got into my late teens that i caught the first movie on tv one night and i liked it but it wasnt until the second viewing a few years later that i fell in love with it it was something that for some reason or another went over my head the first go around but when it finally clicked i went straight into watching the second film 2 the road warrior at the time i was determined to not let the second film one go over my head like its predecessor and i fell for road warrior right away to me the first two movies are some of the greatest action films of all time although that is pretty commonly said about road warrior the original i think is pretty underrated now beyond thunderdome i honestly dont like much at all theres really no hate that i have for thunderdome but there not a whole lot for me to enjoy about it either mel gibson is still good in the role and thats about it then when i came across the rumor of fury road at first i was a little skeptical but once i saw a trailer and some still images any skepticism i previously had completely subsided and was replaced with excitement if this film ended up being bad you have no idea how depressed i would be the fact that this actually somehow exceeded my expectations is beyond comprehension thunderdome wishes it could have been this for a film being in production hell for 30 years this was an unbelievable achievement in film history probably because it had a genius like george miller behind it creating the entire story solely out of storyboards alone which makes this film such a rich experience its as if i was watching a silent film at times every shot was completely stunning any time the movie took a breath it was still so beautifully constructed that i could put the film on mute and still get an emotional response although i will say that the musical score was just as beautifully composed and added even more to the performances on screen there is not a boring moment throughout any of the running time there is not a dull character that comes into play there is not a bad stunt or special effect thrown in during any of the action it is as close to flawless as humanly possible i will say that it was slightly sad not seeing mel gibson in the role anymore but tom hardy nails everything about rockatansky that is the most negative comment i could say about the whole thing and i dont even think that even comes close to counting as a knock against the movie actually in a way is a compliment to a talented actor he felt like the same character but has naturally progressed into more of a primal being than before for the first half of the film he doesnt even really speak he grunts this was awesome just to watch him sort of mumble and grunt to himself and some of the other characters but i loved that the film still remembers the first being haunted by the death of his family it went into that territory just enough that it supplied me the character development for that felt satisfactory and justified the movie to remain as action packed without feeling as though there were no one worth routing as much as this is movie it is equally furiosas too played by charlize theron oh god she did fantastic in this embodying exactly what miller said to be the female road warrior in anyone elses hands could have gone horribly wrong but it doesnt she is fierce while also heartbreaking furiosa deserves as much credit for making this film work as does if not more so in some aspects lastly i just want to go over the villain real quick entering the frame it was as if seeing the next darth vader pop on screen immortan joe holds such a presence that i thought i was gonna st my pants so now that i have gone on and on about this movie this is a must see for the summer for the year for the decade a straight up must see period i loved this movie its pretty obvious that most everyone who has seen this film loves it i do not want this to be the next dredd film or edge of tomorrow where it is an absolute great film that gets screwed in the box office and never gets another chance to expand its universe with a sequel this is one of the greatest action films of all time right next to the first two films in cinema history please go out and watch this i am begging you if i dont get a sequel to this then i am going to go on a killing rampagei mean i will be very sad seriously though was fantastic and i hope to see more of and even furiosas story in the future,reality
i got a chance to watch this for free and was a little curious anyway the first part of the film was fast and chaotic it didnt seem very promising tom hardy seemed hardly worthy of following up mel gibsons legendary portrayal of futuristic hero but i decided to pull throughthe film may seem pretty simple and straightforward and in a way it is but it is was also quite entertaining and there were a lot of little and big things going on hardy turned out to be an okay successor to gibson and charlize theron was even more than okay the rest of the cast played a great variety of characters of whom the leaders and nux nicholas hoult  it took me a while to recognize this boy impressed me most and those models werent hard to look at at allthe biggest fun of the film is in youll not be surprised the action sequences on and around the war rig the guitar player the motorcyclists explosions and what not the list is seemingly endless and then there are some pretty atmospheric intermissions for a good deep breath before it all starts up againim still very much in favour of the first film as the best of the series but this one was more than doablea good 7 out of 10,reality
can i begin by saying that most people usually just pay no attention to the original and claim that the road warrior 2 is where it all began sadly its a shame that the first gets passed off in this manner as it is an absolute classic and i urge you to check it out if you havent the second is excellent dont get me wrong thunderdome being the weakest in the series for me people giving this film bad reviews are wrongfury road is basically the film george miller wanted to make all those years back but didnt have the means to at the time this film was quite simply awesome screw what people in these reviews are saying about there being no plot thats garbage the plot works because its bleak and simplistic theres not much left in their dying world and the portrayal of its nothingness works throughout this brings me back to my original point of people saying 2 is the true film isnt that what they all wanted with fury road then another insane piece of celluloid depicting epic chases through dense unforgiving terrain bleak landscapes with humongous bad guys all in all a truly great edge of your seat action film with menacing bad guys insane stunts and some of the best camera work known to man an excellent addition to the world bring on the next instalment,reality
fury road is the last film i expected to be this years darling of the first half of 2015 does the original trilogy really have that mainstream fondness cult favourites certainly ive only seen the tedious first half hour of the first which i will finish at some point i trust road warrior is a significant improvement but since beyond thunderdrome george miller directed family movies such as the babe sequel and the happy feet pair he has an oscar for directing a cute film about dancing penguins but was the sunstroked chaos of fury road swirling in his head the whole time nevertheless despite its long production period fury road is not a film that feels overthought waiting out a couple decades of mindless cgi disaster porn fury road is a breath of fresh dusty air with ambitious practical effects taken to a scale not possible in the 1980s its commendable for that alone given its essentially one long chase scene with little time to breathe its an incredible technical feat with its editing and creativity to keep it thrillinghowever its very rough around the edges the curse side of its wild blessing the first act is overcooked and all over the place setting up its promises and overdelivering its a blur and with confusing motives its difficult to latch onto however once were through the sandstorm and it strips down its dynamics for one giving its protagonist a chance to grunt a word and reveals its secrets theres a reason to invest in what its trying to do if you want to call it a feminist agenda to expose a collapsing patriarchal hierarchy then fine but its very welcome in an otherwise barren genre the film does something that most films these days have forgotten letting the hero be a hero is a complete stranger to the story and while he helps because he must theres an element of his moral compass in there too so many films revolve around the protagonists problems but a real hero is much less selfinvolved its refreshing to see a classic archetype utilized so well charlize theron steals the show from tom hardy providing an emotional texture with her glazed over eyes to the films action that it would otherwise severely lack however the world of is not an endearing one the revolting culture of the antagonists is vague and while im glad it didnt go into it despite the idiosyncrasies its something i cant embrace nicolas hoult is especially awful never landing a sincere moment at least not until the second half of the film where hes all walk and no talk shame millers taste in dialogue is so dreadful at least his taste in atmosphere is something to behold though the guitar guy took me out of it every time he was on screen im not sure if i would call fury road one of the best action films of the decade but its certainly the most action film710,reality
watched the movie at home and glad didnt go to the cinema to pay and watch itthe movie is not bad or greatits right betweenit lacks the storyi felt like the movie was more focused on the girl then on seeing the movie is called the script was very poorly for a movie promoted so much and was expecting a lot morethe dialogs were way to poorly and action was so and socompared to the 3 parts clasics its a lot betterfrom those 3 old movies i felt depressed after seeing themeven for that time period the movies were lame like no otherthey could only compete with poltergeist2015looking at those old movies i couldnt wrap my head that thous gangs leaders were gayinstead of a women behind them they had guysand ugly ones toodont get me wrong i have nothing against any gaybut just sayingso all and all movie wasnt badbut for our period time you would think we will get a lot more thinking on what budget they hadif you want see itwatch at homedont pay to see it,reality
my god what a film those were the first words to come to my mind when the closing credits started rolling indeed this film or more of an epic was pure awesomeness right from the beginningthe chase and the fight scenes were breathtaking and the whole film just kept coming on with all cylinders tom hardy as rockatansky was a great choice and charlize theron played furiosa flawlessly i think the movie somewhat differed from the earlier iterations but was because of that maybe even betterall in all the movie was a fabulous experience and if you havent yet seen it do it as soon as possible,reality
is seriously the best movie i have seen in a really really long time by ten minutes in i was completely hooked and it kept my attention till the creditsone of my favorite elements of the movie was the casting charlize was phenomenal and my favorite character overall plus the women in this film kicked a which was such a refreshing change from the stereotypical female role which is still seen in hollywood todayi cant wait till this movie comes out on dvd because i am buying it and will most likely watch it over and over again go see this this is what movies are supposed to be like,reality
forget about story arc fury road is an unpredictable thrill ride that keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the protagonist stays in the background so that the secondary characters who are not critical to a sequel have screen time to be humanized before some of them are killed in an orgy of clever and inventive brutality the refreshing lack of humor is made up for by a handful of personalities whose agendas are evident and therefore interesting although it is violent the passion put into every scene shines through the bleakness it feels authentic as dystopian fiction the themes of despair and hopelessness are presented convincingly with the help of amazing settings props and cinematography i dont have any real complaints apart from being perhaps a bit too hard to relate to overall here is a movie that has realized its potential watch in 3d,reality
miller invented what we actually know as the postnuclear universe and all the movies after interceptor toke huge inspiration from almost ripping off its vision george romero in the 7080s did the same with zombie movies but failed to impress at old age on contrary miller still continue to impress proofing hes still the best in this genre without spending many words ill say this is a masterpiece action vibe photography fxs stunts everything will surpass your expectations and satisfy your needs if awesomeness is what you needi bet in the next decades we will be submerged by other movies like this because lets face it we needs movies like thischeers from germany,reality
its about adrenaline rush from the beginning until the end however george miller can very well maintain the plot and simple storyline so that although he has brought the rush from minute zero the movie could still execute and present the cliin a very good way to the audiencethe moviegoers who havent seen the original movie should be able to learn and gather the puzzle of the story not to clear everything up yet but the way it tells the story and explain it is so classy for a action brutal full of truck race and debris movie we wont feel confuse when we leave the theater in fact asking for more  sure there are some details that questionable but hopefully those can be answered in the sequelthe actors performance are quiet balance anyway charlize theron appears to be too plain for that strong character of furiosa i was thinking that someone as strong as sigourney weaver could fill that shoes tom hardy simply nails it this classy actor can transform from the unknown to resentful to lovable and reliable hugh keaysbyrne plays brilliantly as immortan joe very full of testosterone and adrenaline his total madness and love for the wife and baby in the other side can represent what the movie is all aboutabsolutely look forward for the next one,reality
thats the world of fury road our world earth as it is in the forthcoming future a desert planet where once was green vegetation is now only sand and salt dried out ocean beds and hostile tribes of different peoples some possibly mutants war with each other for scarce resources one of most scarce being waterthe plot is simplicity itself a powerful warlord and cultleader the ugly and evil immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne who wears a hideous mouth mask holds power supreme over an impoverished people from his balcony at the citadel his stronghold like a beneficent god he opens three floodgates allowing gushing water to fall to the waiting masses belowhe also has a private harem and a wandering woman furiosa charlize theron has stolen five of them all beauties because she must rescue them she alludes to being abducted as a child from her native land and perhaps serviced such a warlord herself she drives off into the desert with a truck holding a tankload of gasoline and with the women safely stowed away in the passenger compartmentunknown to her tom hardy an itinerant wanderer overwhelmed with guilt by the death of his wife and daughter that he could not prevent captured and tortured by the warlords warriors escapes and hitches a ride on furiosas truck wary of each other at first they come to terms and are soon cooperating which is a good thingbecause the warlord learns that five of his beautiful sex slaves one prominently pregnant have been abducted brimming with rage he storms out after her with his army of goons into the barren desert in full pursuit to capture his women and carry them back and in the process destroy furiosa and so the battle beginsthe goon army armed to the teeth and plowing through the desert in their makeshift but deadly vehicles with their banners flapping in the breeze and their massive oversized tires and their strange music filling the air and pursuing with full and deadly fury furiosasa truck and savoring the sweet revenge that they will unleash on her when they catch up with her looks for all purposes like some malevolent caravan of motley beasts guided by miscreant creatures straight out of the wizard of oz or the gates of hellfuriosa sees her deed as a way of finding redemption partly because she herself must have served some warlord tells her if you cant fix whats broken you will go insane she must face the fact that the land she left her green land is forever gone tells her in order to find the green land again she must return to the citadel furiosa with help and also with the help of the young women whom shes rescued must battle the warlords warriors all the way back and what a fight total mayhem like so many wars vicious and merciless and fought to the bitter endnormally i dont much care for blowemupsshootemups and this movie has it in spades far enough to satisfy the most hardbitten action junkie but from a review i read that charlize theron was in the movie and playing the main character to boot its as much her movie as it is hardys possibly even more so normally i dont see a movie because a particular actors in it but ive seen her in several movies and shes very goodthe cinematography is outstanding most of the movie was filmed in the namib desert in namibia an african republic to the northwest of south africa the red desert with its large forbidding rock formations is stunning and the formidable sandstorm that rushes down on them like an enormous tsunami is incredible i have a scene like that in a book i wrote but words must be chosen very carefully and even then it remains challenging to capture the moving action of such a titanic thing the music convincingly supports the militant and lifeordeath handtohand fighting taking place brutality begets the beast its my understanding that very few of the scenes were cgigenerated the great sandstorm must have been though if that is so then i must say they are all splendidly done kudos to miller for his directingi give it 10 out of 10 id like to say a bit about my ratings i read one reviewer who said he doesnt like to give any movie a 10 out of 10 because it can always be made better if one looks at a movie like any other work of art this is true no work of art exists or will ever exist that somehow couldnt stand a bit of improvement im a writer and know that myself an artist must do the very best job they can with the skills they possess but that being said the work must end so the artist can reach their audience otherwise the work of art is a perpetual ongoing project so if the directing script acting score and cinematography are of very high quality then i give it 10 out of 10 yes it could probably have been worked on more but then there would never be a movie that could actually be seen by viewers like mei vaguely remember the original series from the 1980s and they struck me as tongueincheek notwithstanding miller wrote and directed these too as far as i was concerned they could have taken place in a galaxy far far away but not so this if you get beyond the action theres a hard look at where the future of this planet may be heading in the not so distant future and its not a pretty future,reality
i think what would be most appropriate when reviewing a film like fury road is to do a move that the late great roger ebert did a couple of times when he reviewed his own film beyond the valley of the dolls which he wrote along with writerdirector russ meyer and when he reviewed john waters pink flamingos he gave neither film a star rating with beyond the valley of the dolls the reason was quite obvious because he wrote the film and was good friends with meyer and regardless of the film being a cult masterpiece which i think it is he did not give it a star rating because the rating would have been biased so instead he gave more or less of a recap of information and what putting together the final film was like in general john waters pink flamingos which i would also consider a cult masterpiece was one that ebert felt that he could not give a star rating to because he felt that a rating system did not belong or would not be acceptable for such a film if you have seen pink flamingos and every lover of the offbeat really should you can definitely see what he is talking about the film while i still like it very much is extremely offbeat and you could use any number of adjectives to describe it whether you liked it or not but to rate it as one of the great films of all time or even what to rate it at all would prove definitely a perplexing and difficult problem for some i would personally give perfect ratings to both dolls and flamingos and i personally own both films and consider them and look at them very highly yet bizarrely i find i am running into eberts dilemma when it comes to fury road though i simply do not know how to rate it as my alias on this site suggests i am definitely a fan of all films offbeat misunderstood and stuff that the general public has shied away from so why am i finding it so hard to give a rating to fury road which definitely falls into a lot of those categories i think part of this is while i certainly did find a lot i liked in fury road and in general i would have to say that i did like the film i think part of the dilemma for me is that this is an action film and very few action films rank very highly or favourably in my palette of taste for films to say that fury road is not an action packed film would be the understatement of the year because from the second the film opens till it ends it is action packed from start to finish and sometimes is so over the top in its action and violence and often even its fast editing style which jumped from scene to scene as if filmed by a madman reminded me of russ meyers own editing style which was very similar only he never really made a film like this and this editing feels like russ meyers style with a days worth of coffee and energy drinks thrown in before i run out of space to write i must say what i liked and disliked about this film to be a proper reviewer basically there was nothing i did not like even though the action genre is definitely not my thing never has been never will be i still liked fury road and found things to like and dare i say even admire about the film my biggest compliments probably come on the technical side of the film the cinematography capturing a post apocalyptic wasteland and showing all the gritty and barren backgrounds to the absolutely and sometimes hideously looking people inhabiting this space was all very well done the makeup costumes and cinematography was all first rate in every single way the editing which i described above is also extremely impressive and worthy of praise here as well the acting is definitely not award worthy but i felt all these actors did really hold their own and did a decent enough job here what i really found impressive and an admirable trait for this film was that a major studio like warner bros would go to all the efforts to get this film made and spend one hundred fifty million dollars to do so is an incredible feat and i am impressed that a major studio would shell out that kind of money for a film so offbeat and definitely bizarre as this one warner bros and other major studios would do that type of thing all the time back in the day but now unfortunately it is becoming more and more uncommon perhaps with this film there is still hope for hollywood yet as it stands i will not give this film a star rating because i dont feel i can but i did definitely enjoy the film and it certainly never left me bored for its two hour running time,reality
fury road is an insane movie boasting amazing stunts great action artistic cinematography epic music and much more it had many good aspects to it but in the end it didnt quite live up to the hypethe latest installment in the franchise is essentially all about the action the action is insane for sure and immensely thrilling to watch george miller has such a unique style when it comes to action and it definitely shows in his latest piece of work the stunts are crazy and very believable as most of the stunts were done practically without the use of cgi the cinematography on this movie is splendid in its own way the colors are very saturated which oddly gives the movie a more gritty look the camera work also fits nicely with the actionthe soundtrack for this movie is thrillingly epic and may be one of the best soundtrack out there each piece is electrifying and fits in perfectly with the movietom hardy and charlize theron are amazing as the two lead roles in this movie they bring a sense of desperation to the movie and their characters the supporting cast is also great in their specific partsthe storyplot is not so important in this movie but it is still there and there are some important plot points one does not want to miss there were some messy moments on the story but all in all it felt complete the pacing was very fast and there was next to no quiet time but it still felt like the movie was evened out quite nicely my only gripe is that the characters werent fully developed in the end fury road is an exhilarating ride with great action music cast and cinematography it was gritty and dark but extremely entertaining and thrilling i had very high expectations for this movie and it didnt quite live up to the hype but i still think that its one of the best movies of 2015 so far,reality
i wanted to see this really bad after witnessing the mountain of positive reviews and a score of 88 on this site also i wanted to see if it was anything like the road warrior which i enjoyed immensely in my teens so after watching this film in the theaters i have to agree with the hype this movie is at last an action movie where you can actually freaking see what happens and where the action is kinda logicalwhere questions of how and why make sense and the moments when they dont are few and far in betweeni feel like i have to make this clear this is an action movie and should be reviewed as suchit is what it needed to be compare this to most of the action movies that hollywood produces each year and yes this is a masterpiece from that point of view although i dont know if i can agree with this being no25 movie of all times but i can see the appeal of itthe visuals where astonishingnot only can you almost see every detail that is important it is also beautiful to look at the stunts were amazing and directing from a technical point of view was really well done the non stop action that glued you in your seat just wins the oscar here entertainment at its finest the actors for the most part were good theron was awesome as furiosa and the main villain immortan joe left a good impression on me and the dialog was entertaining to say the leastwhat a lovely day indeed why 810 well minus one point for some flaws here and there and for the plot which could be a tad better although you can argue that it was good enough for an action movie and minus one point for tom hardy as although i dont consider him a bad actor or that he was horrible in this film it might be just my personal bias because i liked mel gibson much better and i inevitably compare the 2 of themoverall this is an action movie that you have been dying to see forget transformers where you can barely see who fights whoscratch that you cant see even that or fast and furious where a car under 1ton stops a freaking tankyea that happened here you have fury road that retains the ridiculous over the top elements that its predecessor possessed combining it with non stop action that is clear and makes sense nothing more and nothing less,reality
so this is what happens when you give george miller a good budget completing a recent trifecta of spectacular world cinema in the action category the raid 1 and 2 fury road not only easily becomes among the top movies of 2015 but arguably amongst the best action movies this century two hours of absolute postapocalyptic mayhem this is one of the rare sequels that not only stands tall with the originals but actually surpasses them what used to slightly restrict the previous movies were budget and technical limitations but in the 21st century with more money involved and more resources to tap into george millers decadeinthemaking vision comes to life in the most entertaining and thrilling way fury road may have the tag but his story is just one of many that roam around the most impressive amongst the cast tom hardy as really didnt have much to do outside participation in the carnage is definitely charlize theron who plays the toughasnails woman that jumpstarts the action that will preside over the last 100 minutes of the film without mentioning too much theron has there been a quieter action career than theron as furiosa steals a massive armored rig and raises absolute hell as she tries to make it to her childhood homeland with other prisoners crossing paths with her is a loner with recovering from his past who also has been taken prisoner even though plot isnt usually a focus point in action movies of this caliber there is plenty of social commentary and feminist themes to stir the pot while the verbal and storyline aspects are nothing to scoff at the technical details of this movie is the headlining show here nearly flawless from the art direction to the cinematography to the editing the apocalypse has never looked so beautiful the colors pop out at you and the camerawork isnt shy of displaying the miles upon miles of nothingness that surrounds the characters it truly feels like the end of the world as you see the small shadowy figures of vehicles maneuver through the layers of sand or see dark blue darkness when the sun mercifully comes down and then you have the wide array of visually unique characters that look straight out of your pulp comic books yes the guitarplaying fiend deserves his own story its a hauntingly beautiful ride millers directing is what makes the movie stand out the action sequences are intense relentless and done with so much precision and attention to detail you cannot look away from the screen a millisecond as you see the next round of carnage take place this movie tries excruciatingly hard to separate itself from the pack of normal summer blockbusters and it succeeds by pacing like a video game continuously escalating and topping the previous action sequence the raid movies also notoriously saved their best tricks for last and my friends even if you might be the slightest bit underwhelmed just wait until the final 30 minutes be prepared for some of the tightest and wellchoreographed action since the criminally underrated adventures of tintin the opera chase deserves much more love the mix of special and practical effects blends in so well you swear you can smell the burning tires the movie is one big long vehicular chase and one that never starts feeling stale summer may have peaked extremely early because it will be very difficult to top the vicious joyride of fury road from start to finish from the toptier acting right down to the sound effects this installment is the best handsdown even though hardy is no vintage mel gibson not sure what happened to american action filmmaking but now australia and indonesia own the right to claim their country has produced the finest action flicks this decade if you are in the mood for a highly entertaining yet original action extravaganza look no further by the time 2015 finishes i can guarantee you that fury road will remain as one of the best movies in the entire year,reality
way back when i watched the matrix for the first time as did everyone else back then i didnt know what to think about it what did i just saw how to process this is it good better or even bad then i watched it again and its actually that good and its fresh same thing here watch it once to get into it and then rewatch it to understand it fury road is so fast and stylishly paced that you just dont have the time to soak explosion of details and process all of it at once hence repeated viewingits the movie michael bay wish he was 110th able to make one day but he cant because he is a hack its frank millers wet dream of how over the top everything and cranked up to 11 is but doesnt look crass and cheaply macho yes this miller george the creator babe maestro somehow pulled it off again and made fury road one of the superblockbusters of the year 2015 and rightfully soone requirement is needed though if you never saw older movies do that first if you hadnt watch them in a long time refresh your memory first not for the story but for the atmosphere that is so rich and unique everyones been copying it since the first and second movie it does take a while to take you back into it emotionally how everything is damn insane and silly in the universethis movie drives you from start to finish in no time no stopping pedal to the metal and its never boring the opposite of this is the final fight between zod and superman in man of steel that lasted 45 mins and you were bored andor sleeping from the get go no fury road keeps you engaged all the timeand thats also one thing that actually choked this movie a bit if you look closely you can see how magnificent and smart everything is and detailed from cars to costumes and characters movie just zooms through it and almost never lets you fully enjoy it savor it its like miller is saying to us were not here for you and fan service youre here for us now enjoy which i like  no bs and audience pandering just getting straight to it but i would also like more of everything please but judging from initial response from well  everyone we will probably get at least one more movie named the wastelandperformances are mostly solid those breeder wives could get an acting lesson or two but overall  solid superkudos to massive amounts of practical effects and makeups it looks great gritty so gritty and dry in fact that it actually made me thirsty while watchingreally nothing more to say go see the movie,reality
was really fun could probably have benefited from some more editing to improve the pacing though they could have easily cut 15 minutes or so i watched fury road earlier  it was a god damned thrillridereally loved seeing the most recent trailer before another movie recently i was sure this thing was gonna suck and starting off i thought the action in the 1st act was encroaching on emotionless bling  la lightsaber fever im blaming that now on the 3d but i will watch again to be sure the 3d did enhance many areas later on but soon enough they started injecting the characters with life and we were off i say it all the time but once a movie has me caring about its people im able to achieve suspension of disbelief and take the ride im supposed to takethis latest version of the universe was a masterful combination of the classic films and some creative new ideas the mythology really entertained me and has me wanting to become a bigger fan of the series i will definitely watch the original trilogy again i had just watched them in 2014 but thanks to this film its time to go back already and really soak in as much of the mythos as possible fury road has created a fanboy here the picture was photographically beautiful ill enjoy looking at all that again in the near future lots to marvel at but also cinematically there were great things going on moments in the big road battles were actually breathtaking and the retro zooms and framerate speeds added the perfect touch that both paid tribute to the classics and added to the manic feel of the movie i had also heard about the feminist interpretations of this film and i was not disappointed this was my favorite charlize theron role ever and the way they sort of deflated the clich hero archetype to create this was much appreciated here i realize he wasnt super human in the originals either but here we have a character who goes lower than antihero into pitiful territory its welcome in an age where we seem addicted to writing nauseatingly safe men in lead roles the risk is taken here that will not be idolized or even identified with by a large percent of the male population and thats a refreshing change of pace,reality
let me just first say that right off the bat that fury road is one of the most insane action films that i have ever seen although the film deviates heavily from the original trilogy in terms of aesthetics the overtly orangeyellow palette the ridiculousness of the action scenes the story and spirit remains pretty much the same rockatansky is trapped in a post apocalyptic australia and does all he can to survive  while getting involved in the dangerous affairs of othersprior to watching fury road i quickly squeezed in some time to watch both the and road warrior  both great movies in their own right entering fury road i had some expectations of how the latest installment would turn out based on my rating for this movie one can say that my expectations were blown out of the watertom hardy as is just as good as mel gibson as the characters lack of faith in humanity paranoia of strangers and sense of loneliness are all brought convincingly to the screen by hardy not to mention he can be just as brutal and violent  dont worry some of the best action scenes in this film belong to despite the belief that this movie eventually sidelines for furiosathats another thing that really surprised me  charlize theron as the toughasnails imperator furiosa not only is she completely unrecognizable in the role but also imo gives one of her career bests here her commanding presence on screen is proved by the fact that she can hold her own against any of the male characters including and that she can take great risks at the expense of the group shes trying to save along the way she also makes a number of painful decisions that elevates the films emotional impact in all honestly im hoping that miller and warner bros do a spinoff movie for therons character if fury road proves to be a success at the box officethe story may seem simple and straightforward it basically feels like two long ridiculous car chases but dont let that detract you from the fact that it is imbued with a deep sense of backstory and many complex themes despite what sceptics are saying fury road is not some dumb typical popcornflick the film also lightly touches on a number of current socialpolitical issues gender equality global warming and authoritarianism recently ive been noticing a number of my reviews havent been helpful too fellow readers if anything i believe one of the reasons why they arent helpful may have to do with the fact that i assign a verdict at the end of my reviews  telling people whether or not they should be watching the film on the big screen i realized that in my short time as a movie reviewer people will make that decision on their own regardless if they take my review into consideration i also realize that heshe may actually end up liking a movie i gave a poor rating to or disliking a movie i gave a great rating to  and that i have to respect that starting with this review i will no longer be putting verdicts at the end of my reviewsall in all fury road is designed and meant to be seen on the big screen im certainly glad that i saw it on the big screen even though at first i had no plans to see it at all and highly recommend it to anyone this is a great film dont let the opportunity slip by,reality
what a grand insane work of vision is fury road this is what you wish for from all of your action movies something created out of sheer ingenuity and imagination a movie that gets rolling and doesnt have time to stop a movie in which the bright and colorful visual palette is so audacious and so fully packed that your eyes cant catch everything that the director is trying to show you the first time around half the time you dont understand everything that youre looking at but you dont really mind its so big so grand so full that it demands to be seen in a theater i pity those who hold out for televisionwhat surprises me is that all greatness happens in the midst of a modern practice that i normally despise the reboot yes george miller is rebooting the classic genre that he helped to create but hes not just slapping a coat of paint on an old fence hes embracing the new while taking us happily down an old familiar roadthirtysix years ago when miller first conceived of he effectively wrote the book on how to make a movie about the apocalyptic future his was a world gone a savage and unholy world in which the bomb had tossed humanity back to its tribal state but only far enough back that it still had trucks and motorcycles to mow each other down with the participants dressed like professional wrestlers and shot each other at will when they werent driving spiked vehicles into one another ready to wage war for a tank of juice it was unique it was visionary and it was such a riotous journey that filmmakers have been chasing his vision ever sincein fury road the mcguffin is a little more potent than just a race for gasoline the plot here is thin enough that it doesnt bungle the action but what it boils down to is the soul of humanity we meet thomas hardy a haunted man suffering with painful bouts of ptsd  he has flashes of memories of people he failed to save before we can get a good look at he is captured by the war boys a bald and skinbleached band of cultist working under the thumb of the tyrannical king immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne a fearsome being where wears plastic armor and a skull mask that is really unsettling  imagine if sweet tooth from twisted metal were a rock star and youve got the idea his cult is so vast and so audacious that his caravan travels the wastelands of australia with its own war drums and guitar solo no kidding theres a guy in this army whose function is to play guitar while strapped to truck specially designed for that purpose what follows along a pattern of millers four movies is that in each movie the world appears to be getting worse in the first the world was devastated but still resembled one that we recognized in fury road the remnants of humanity have returned to their feral state still able to drive cars and have religious rites but closer in common sense to apes then to manin the midst of this chaos one of joes warriors the onearmed furiosa charleze theron goes rogue and steals one of joes war rigs what the rig is carrying is more than just gasoline and weapons i wont spoil it except to say that fury road isnt all boys with toys as the movie moves into its second half it really becomes a story of tough women fighting for their own survivalthey exist amid a world in which every this is always moving george miller doesnt want you to catch your breath he allows you two or three slow beats but for most of its running time this is a movie that is always on the move essentially its a chase pictures but there are so many crazy images filling the screen at all times that you have to see it twice to catch them all even better is that fact that his action scenes make sense the chase scenes have an orientation so that we dont just feel that were watching a lot of nonsensical editinghis palette is refreshing in that its bright and colorful forcing you to realize how many movies these days are grim and dark and hard to see look at the trailers for dawn of justice and the fantastic four and youll see what i mean but takes place mostly in broad daylight under blazing sun we see everything and there are bright colors definitive colors every vehicle every costume every location and every character has their own texture and their own lookwhat a crazy ride this is what a unique visionary is george miller he is a man who can create something as violent and bloodsoaked as and then pull the reigns back for something as sweet and beatific as babe what he proves with is that there are original worlds to be created in the movies it is still possible to make a great action picture that moves and pops and sings and excites us he had a plan and he executed it beautifully just like his trucks he kept his eye on the road and he didnt stop for anything,reality
who would have thought that 30 years after beyond thunderdome wed be treated to an actually decent movie actually just plain decent doesnt do this movie justice it was fantasticbeyond thunderdome took the series into a cutesy kidfriendly direction thunderdome was closer to being the goonies than having anything to do with the stellar second film the road warrior thankfully fury road is ugly gritty and fast paced there is maybe a total of 12 minutes of this film that have no actionfury road is exceptional because of how relentlessly it throws images of carnage at the viewer take the infamous big rig chase scene from the road warrior multiply it by 10 and youve got fury road however its still even so much more than that i was astonished at how nicely shot and clear all the stunts were in this film i say clear because i pretty much never lost track of what was going on amidst all the boom boom coherency is so rare in modern action films of which many are full of boisterous cg effects that destroy your perception of what is happeningthe only thing i can ding this movie for is that the plot is slightly jagged however the sheer brilliance in the pacing of this film smooths even those hiccupsi highly recommend fury road if youre going to see only one film this summer get in the drivers seat and go watch this910,reality
fury road is an absolute crackerthis film will grab you by the scruff of the neck and take you through a relentless journey of carnage and by the end of it you will probably need a lie down i know i certainly didin preparation for going to see this movie i rewatched the originals but there really is no need starts here the originals will now feel like a barely noticeable gentle breeze on a warm summers day compared with this crashing hurricane of mayhemthe movie is filmed beautifully and the set pieces and action shots are utterly outstanding none of this would matter if they didnt create the perfect atmospheric backdrop but they manage that beautifully and neatly in the first ten minutes of the film all of the characters are introduced and the world feels real it feels convincing it feels utterly terrifyingthen it sets off on a car chase and it doesnt let up for 110 minutes there are explosions moments of extreme violence the odd moment of wit a despicable villain thoughtprovoking subthemes and it all adds up to a wonderful filmmore please,reality
frank miller has created a staple in the action movie genre fury road is one hell of a ride thankfully miller chose not to reboot the franchise starting with a dreadful origin story instead he chose to follow along the path of 1981s the road warrior the movie picks up after the death of his family where he struggles to survive on his own while he is continuously tormented by their deaths we know just enough about to make the character work but enough is left hidden to make him a cryptic warriorthe brilliance of the movie is of course the action sequences which were mostly done via actually stuntmen something about knowingseeing real people attempting all these crazy scenesstunts makes the movie much more exciting and authentic fury road is so fast paced and loaded with action galore you never know what miller has up his sleeve and what he is going to throw at us next though there was a moment or two where the movie seemed to be in action overload and a change of pace was needed but what really drove the movie home was how he placed all this great action in an obscure bizarre world where tyrants reign supreme its interesting to see the same things that we value today carry over into the postapocalyptic world food water and of course fuel the world may be a wasteland but some things never changed the disparity between people will forever remainit was also great to see taking the backseat and letting furiosa charlize theron and the wives lead the movie they along with the clan of women kick just as much if not more ass as and the war boys fury road is being praised for its thoughtful representation of females in the movie which is absolutely true telling this tale with women is partially what makes the movie work so damn well at the same time is represented as the nowho is caught in a war of two different parties and is doing nothing more than surviving the core of the movie may be about furiosa and her reaching for freedom but at the same time this is just another chronicle of the rogue warrior fury road will easily go down as the best action movie of 2015 if not one of the best of the past 25 years its safe to say that is here to stay especially since tom hardy is signed on for three more films style and action havent mixed this well in years,reality
i never got the chance to see the previous films starring mel gibson so i went into this with no lines to follow after hearing so much about it and reading almost every review i could come across i must say i was exited first thing first i got what i expected leaving the theater with a smile and my body comfortably numb fury road is a 2015 australian postapocalyptic action thriller film directed produced and cowritten by george miller and the fourth film of millers franchise the first film of the franchise in 30 years fury road stars tom hardy as rockatansky making it also the first film not to feature mel gibson in the title role the film also stars charlize theron and nicholas hoult instead of making this a review within a thousand words ill make some pointers belowwhat i loved charlize theron is excellent what a performance  nicholas hoult is also excellent  im not a fan of postapocalyptic movies this one i liked  anyone else felt like this was a nonstop overthetop inferno of twisted metal bones cracking explosions and gasoline i did  costuming looks great amazing attention to detail  i loved furiosa as a character  amazing visual effectswhat bothered me a biti wanted more from tom hardy  though i liked the score at some points it was too generic to me 60 of the music in this film did not feel original and it felt way to forced sometimes you ever get that feeling when you watch a scene and you think how would this work out with no soundtrack at all is this really necessary here  again the soundtrack after all the action i would appreciate a small window of silence the dialog did not always strike me when the music kind off was in the way a bit this made it a struggle to get emotionally attached to the characters  i expected even more from the action scenes at some point  some scenes felt a bit rushed and some didnt unfortunately the wrong scenes sometimes felt rushed or dragged overall a great action movie the best ever no did it meet my expectations hell yes was it perfect no i never give movies a 10 or a 1 this one for me 84,reality
fury road is everything youve never expected from a modern day action movie and if youve set your expectations low or arent into postapocalyptic movies youll be in for a surprise and by the end of it youd have wished that youd never thought so low about george millers ambitious masterpiece30 years since the fourth movie george miller sets fury road in a world where almost everybody has gone insane including its lead rockatansky the plot is paper thin and its nothing but an escort mission lead by rockatansky and imperator furiosa through barren postapocalyptic wastelands and chased by the main antagonist immortan joe and his maniac war boys this is a standalone movie and can hold strong on its own but if you do want to get into the tone and mood of you oughta watch the old trilogy as it also sheds some light on story and arguably on who immortan joe really would beits one orgasmic chase sequence from start to end and there is little room for character development but whos complaining when you are glued to your seats entertained shitless with its almost unrelenting brutal action nothing can prepare you for the intense action in fury road and this review might feel meaningless until and unless youve experienced it its all out gritty and itd help if youve got a wicked sense of humour you are also not given much time to think as you are pushed from to one action set piece to the nextas tom hardy does have an ample role to play in the narrative but this is essentially a furiosa movie set in the universe charlize therons furiosa is indeed the lead protagonist and just accompanies here in her insanely dangerous road trip and you cant help but applause at therons strong performance here i am not a huge nicholas hoult fan but in he delivers as nux as for immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne delivers and it is a real feat when he has a mask on which covers most of his face it would have been great if they had shown his face at least once at least for old times sake to see how toecutter from the original looked like nowthe visuals doubtlessly are spectacular and what adds to the sheer beauty of it are practical effects weve all been conditioned to watching and growing on cgi heavy movies this past decade and the difference here could be instantaneously felt its not completely devoid of cgi wizardry but practical effects dominates the visuals here and its nothing less than eye popping for the first time normal 3d felt serviceable and at the same time i kept repenting that i didnt see it in iyou know its good when you see your partner dodging car parts and entrails every now and then normal 3d does wash out what would have otherwise been a brilliant color palette and the end result is a somewhat dark and desaturated film exceptional sound design and junkie xls background score is the cherry on topcompared to the old trilogy the road warrior still stands supreme suffice to say fury road had me breathless gaping at the extremely well choreographed action sequences i had to wait a few hours before i could collect my thoughts on the movie and rant about it this is by far the best action movie i have seen this year oh yes much better than avengers age of ultron as for the feminism critique revolving this moviewho cares this here is a fine piece of action cinema thank you george miller,reality
i just got back from seeing an advanced showing of fury road which i was extremely excited to see it did not disappointit exceeded my expectationsit is one of the greatest movies of the decadewhere to begin with such a spectacular film the film is rated r but the action scenes which are some of the best i have seen in a very long time make it seem pg13 an amazing way to get younger kids that are in the 1315 year range to see it but just because the violence is more pg13 doesnt mean its bad its freaking amazing the movies action scenes focus was on the cars and my god it is creative and brilliantthe actors are all great and crazy nicholas hoult as nux is the performance of the year nux is an amazing character because he starts out crazy but ends up finding out his true destiny and learning from the other humans i would have never expected this from any movie tom hardy and charlize theron are amazing in this as well everything is amazing the direction the writing the effects the sound the editing the camera work the music which is done by junkie xl i was even in love with the movies color yes the color scheme of the movie is excellent blue and orange being the most vibrant and important to the whole setting of the filmi cannot express myself more to say that this is one of the greatest motion pictures of the decade if not the century if not one of the greatest films of all time this is a film that is going to define all blockbusters to come fury road is almost perfect a vibrant crazy as hell energetic joyride that deserves to be a success and should be seen by everyone even those who have not even seen a single film to put it bluntly it will be a lovely day when you see this film98100 a,reality
fury road is not the sort of film i enjoy and i after watching it i am not a huge fan though i deeply respect the filmmakers the reason i even saw it was the insane reaction the public had to this oneand the critical reviews were all surprisingly good i wanted to see what all the hubbub was aboutand try to understand why folks liked it so much my take on it is that if you enjoy a film that is nonstop amazing action then this one is for you as far as the story goes its plot is superthinbut the movie is handled so well and the stunts so amazingly insane that you dont mind worth seeingbut i sure wouldnt like to see a lot of films like this additionally it was very refreshing to see a film where so many women are not mindless objects to be killed or protectedseveral are about as strong and heroic as himselfand no doubt this is why women seemed to like the film so much,reality
this is a welldone action move end of praisei am shocked that this movie is trending at 98 fresh on another website that aggregates critic reviews but i guess that measurement is basically saying that most people agree the movie is good and not bad yet the depth and how good the movie is is not reflected in the scoreim giving it a solid 6 out of 10 it is a decent action movie more good than bad yet there is little depth to the film seriously this feels like a script that would have been written to fabricate a story to fit the playstation 3 game motostorm which is essentially a bunch of crazy vehicles racing in a postapocalyptic desert location well that is basically the plot of the acting is good but dont expect the best movie ever this is not a chris nolan style action movie folksby the way i am old and a fan of all of the original films even thunderdome this one is a fine reboot but is so overthetop i would rank it slightly behind the original series since the action sequences are pretty much unbelievable although i did appreciate that many of the sequences were true liveaction and not 100 cgi although there is some obvious cgi going on plenty of timesrecommended if you want a decent nonstop action movie without much plot,reality
the world of has progressively become madder and madder 30 years after the third film fury road presents a fresh new tale in the mythos of the legendary road warrior this time the picture the film paints of the future is far more vivid than anything thats come before against the backdrop of harsh desolation and vicious tyranny the stage is set for a new round of intense vehicular carnage what follows is a relentless onslaught of bullets fire and bloodshedthis film starts off fast and furious and it keeps the pacing up all the way to its finale it can be generalized as one twohour chase scene but thats not to say that the action ever becomes dull or that the film never takes the time to breathe like any great blockbuster experience its a rollercoaster ride so full of ups and downs that it keeps the audience exhilarated constantly the films chases are the biggest highlights there are a plethora of incredibly welldesigned vehicles that crash and burn in phenomenal ways while the characters fight and struggle across the moving cars the film is consistently loud explosive and intense when the characters do manage to catch a break the characters struggle against each other and against the elements so theres hardly any drag at allwithin and outside of the action scenes the film tells the story it needs to and it does so with minimal use of exposition very effectively showing more than it tells in the same vein as the raid dredd or duel which were simple stories centered around the situation so too does fury road use its central chase scenes as a basic skeleton from which to add on more to the characters and story the characters are a compelling bunch is reintroduced to us as a broken man still haunted by events of the past which are shown in rapidfire flashbacks and differ vastly from whats shown in journey becomes entwined with that of furiosa a tough and brave woman whose motivations are revealed as the plot moves on together and furiosa represent two characters who are broken in some way and join forces to fight their way to liberation and freedom some audiences have said that furiosa is more the main character than but i find that both share screen time equally to complement each other the same way had to share time with everybody else in the road warrior as a rogue element what might throw people off is that doesnt speak much in this film what little he says is gruff and crude and he fills the rest of the space with a few grunts and noises however remains the narrative focus of the film as it tracks his journey in and out of bondage and finally to liberation to become a legendary drifter once morethis film is captured with fantastic photography and punchy editing color schemes are very bright and vivid filling in the shoes that mel gibson left behind tom hardy plays rockatansky with a phenomenal presence and with blunt animalistic dialogue which is fitting for the primal world he inhabits charlize theron plays it tough as furiosa but with enough distress to elicit sympathy for her struggle and make her character wellgrounded and wellrounded nicholas hoult is surprisingly lovable in his role and hugh keaysbyrne exudes a phenomenal presence as immortan joe who stands as one of the most chilling villains ive seen in a while writing is concise and it gets the job done this production has loads of superbly detailed sets props and costumes all of which brings the postapocalyptic world to life fantastically it all contributes to showing and illustrating the culture of the war boys which shows plenty of well thoughtout ideas and concepts most stunts and crashes were done practically what few special effects the film has are used precisely and effectively and are great jxls music score adds to the experience admirablyfury road is easily the bestlooking film of the series and it boasts the biggest and most brutal action scenes its a perfect example of how a simple premise can be used to tell an invoking story and craft an exhilarating experience best of all it does so using the power of images and sound just as cinema should55 experience perfect  content perfect  film perfect,reality
the makers threw away so much potential in this movie that it hurts the script is very poor in terms of logic and depth and only great at creating super eye candy action scenes and nothing else the world they created holds big potential but they didnt care at all to show it and how it works the little things we see do not make much sense left alone and surely create unnecessary thoughts in some viewers distracting them from staying in the never ending action because of this action only perspective the movie could get even boring for a few people craving for a bit more than action on the road till the very end the entire plot is totally idiotic to be honest and serves only the purpose to create one action scene after the other if you manage to shut down your brain for the 2 hours running time you might be able to love this movie and i think it is sad to see how many people are able to do just that because like this there is no reason for the producers and studios to care more about the script and they will continue make idiotic empty eye candy movies i gave it 6 out of 10 because the part they focused on they did great,reality
in an era of cgifilled movies its so refreshing and awesome to see a movie like this that uses so many practical effects the cars they had to build and the explosions the costumes the makeup it was all amazing you can tell that this movie was made with love and treated with care the entire movie is basically one big action scene but there are character development moments and its never shown through expository dialogue as this is a movie that is told almost exclusively through actions the performances are pretty good and the world created by george miller feels real and its spectacular there is only one thing i genuinely dislike about this film and that is that there is a moment near the end of the film that the way it was shot it looks completely cgi and it looks like it was just there to be shown in 3d next to the entire practicality and realness of the film it really seems out of place this is a very minor detail because i loved everything else about fury road this was one of the best movie experiences of my life this movie was awesome the action was super intense but it wasnt dull lame car crashes need 4 speed the world created by george miller is amazing and it has really cool characters too this is definitely the best movie of the year so far and definitely one of the best action movies i have ever seen also by far the best a action movie that will blow your mind the score is great and the sound effects are awesome the movie is very quickly paced and its never boring great film9910,reality
when a few years back australian director george miller announced a new film would be in the works but sadly it would have taken over 25 years for the project to fly off the development stages as there was issues with production locations and even script development over the years but this year was the year audiences would finally see it on the screen in this final completed work the question is for all fans was would it be worth the wait all these years to happen and would it be worthy as its original trilogy the following summary below pretty much sums up the wait and anticipation had really paid off for both the fans and the filmmakers fury road is a worthy wild action ride that packs punch value and high quality into the trilogy that was established previously it can be considered both a reboot and a sequel but this enables miller to expand the wasteland universe and to further the life of the road warrior having seen the trilogy countless times we are immediately aware of the production value it should carry but with the film having the biggest budget to use beating the trilogys separate budget values miller crafts not only an epic film in action and storytelling but in terms of value concept and direction he gives us a shining feature that stands strongly and respectively for the fans of the franchise casting in the film was great in particular marks the first time that a different actor has filled in the shoes and duty of portraying and that actor was tom hardy the dark knight rises lokie bronson and inception at the time when it was announced of his role fans both agreed or disagreed with this casting choice as he was of british decent and it was mel gibson that defined the role as iconic for both him and the franchise with hardy he gives a solid performance that makes us feel that has still strong after so many years past since thunderdome and pulls it off without no flaws that makes him solid like gibson oscarwinning actress charlize theron plays as furiosa a character that seems to take the leading action role as much as hardy but there has been criticism from various antifeminist groups that she is more dominate and more actionoriented than hardys character on screen and thus making fans feel that is a secondary character from my perspective this is a false fact as does play a major role throughout the story as hes assisting with furiosas journey of redemption to bring the women into a safer world without assistance she may not have survived joes ambush and violent attacks to stop herthe supporting cast includes the talents of nicholas hoult xmen days of future past warm bodies hugh keaysbyrne from the original rosie huntingtonwhiteley riley keough abbey lee nathan jones and megan gale to name some in which all play great performances in their roles from my eye hoult makes homage to the gyro captain from 2 thats in the form of his wild boy character nux while byrnes immortan joe is dominate as the villain and bares the similar voice with bane played by hardy  with tension and pure bad buy quality theres barely any bad dialogue from him or any of the charactersin terms of action fury road is indeed a major contender for action quality that matches not only the quality from the previous films but takes it further in terms of stunts practical effects and choreography work from explosive crashes highwired acrobats jumping and moving along moving vehicles and fist fights on top of tankers the film does it with amazing eye for detail and realism using practical effects and stunt people whilst using minimal cgi to assist the action or landscape the fast and clear camera work and editing makes the action sequences seem so beautiful brutal and flat out insane that it leaves the recent fast and furious films in the dirt and in shamecinematography sound mixing editing and practical effects are all top notch throughout the film miller and his crew give the action story its characters and its deserted environment a style that has been missing from the genre for sometime though a few today have occurred to be solid examples such as the raid 2 furious 7 kingsman and even some of the marvel cinematic universe films but miller reignites both the genre and his style of filmmaking that make it seem possible for the film to get oscar worthy consideration in 2016 which would be nominated for best cinematography sound mixingediting visual effects and possibly direction the amazing cars featured including the signature interceptor are all real detailed and seemed so based from the minds of miller and his design team and its a true fact that 350 vehicles were used in the film but who knows how many of them were destroyed during the making of the film i hope the future home entertainment release will feature a behind the scenes look into this and the production valuesoverallfury road is an epic action ride that delivers solid entertainment for both action fans and fans of the original trilogy miller has taken so many years to get this franchise back on the screen and the results we see are the best weve seen in filmmaking and the genre itself this is perhaps my favourite film ive seen alongside age of ultron chappie kingsman the secret service and birdman but this film stands at the first position and earns itself an seal of approval for quality entertainment,reality
get ready to replace your eyeballs after this experience as rockatansky is back in his most explosive sensory overloading vehicular led journey yet fury road a petrolheads sand infused dream come to beautiful yet utterly bonkers existence in george millers long gestating action extravaganza that not only laughs in the face of modern blockbusters but blows them away by creating some of the most outstanding carnage ever captured for our screens in a modern day and age where its hard for action events to differentiate themselves from each other blockbusters that are cgi laden and shaky cam heavy fury road does the impossible and turns what is essentially a 2 hour long desert set car chase into something that is unique and refreshingly with a budget in the hundreds of millions and a crew that clearly knew how to deliver the goods 70 year old director miller has had his visions come to roaring fruition from the cars the inhabitants and the milk productions this is the apocalyptic wasteland that miller must of envisioned all the way back with the original but only know did technology met the requirements its without question that what elevates fury road to the next level of pure cinematic enjoyment is the fact that the world we enter into for these 2 adrenaline fuelled hours is a world that feels like a living breathing entity a handcrafted and often destructively beautiful labour of love there will be a constant reminder to oneself that what you are seeing is largely perfectly constructed stunts and props played out to painstakingly elaborate setups every clash of metal on metal every loud burst of exhaustive vehicle power and every swaying stunt man is a sight to behold and thanks to a thankfully strong cast of leads and supports millers orchestrated chaos is not lost by the waysideit was never going to be an easy task for the actor stepping into mel gibsons leather boots but man of the moment tom hardy does a solid if slightly unmemorable job in his new gig in what is a role that sees play wingman to charlize therons feisty and soon to be iconic imperator furiosa its a criticism of the film that it does seemingly waste an opportunity to get more out of hardy and while there are small moments of greatness and thankfully humour heading off at nighttime to take care of a car full of bandits springs to mind his turn is not a highpoint of the film while criticism can be made of this aspect of fury road its also in an opposite effect a huge win for the film that it doesnt rely solely on the charisma or bulking presence of hardy to succeed and finds great moments when theron takes centre stage and in the moments from support from nicholas hoult as bad luck war boy nux and a fantastic bandit named doof warrior who takes inspiration from jimi hendrix with his axe work an action event of recent times unparalleled equals and quite possibly one of the most purely visceral and intense action films ever made this wild and frightfully wild car chase is going to please fans of not only the universe but cinema fans the world over george miller toiled long and hard to get his ultimate vision to our screens and after all his blood sweat and tears its fantastic to be able to say fury road is the great success that it is and hopefully the beginning of an all new saga for our beloved road warrior 4 and a half dedicated guitar players out of 5 for more movie reviews and opinions check into  wwwjordanandeddiewordpresscom,reality
fury road was pretty awesomei wouldnt say that is a oscar worthy movie but the visuals are great there isnt much talking so you can really connect that much with the characters but their journey is epic as it is beautiful shots and george miller delivers for sure this is the first movie ive seen from the franchise and the world was presented in a very well done way so even if youre not familiar it you just dive deep into it you can watch in 2d as well you wont missing anything charlize theron is the most attractive woman in this movie despite her short haircut fake lips cant impress me natural beauty ftw in short dont miss this movie ,reality
written and directed by george miller we are taken on an epic rollercoaster ride down fury road in this new reimagining of a cult filmstarring a lifetime best charlize theron acceptable tom hardy and a surprisingly flawless nicholas hoult as an out of the norm war boy this picture magnificently uses every ounce of technology and special effect as well as a huge amount of real stunts and crashes to give the audience some of the best action scenes in world cinema history okay there are no real shock the action is a bit crazy the characters werent developed in depth but who caresits called its in the title my only personal disappointment is the lack of aussie actors in the leadsthe film genuinely leaves the mouth wide open throughout and coupled with music scores by tom holkenborg this really is a must see this year on the biggest and loudest screen you can findthis will finish after the hundreds of thousands of votes with an 82  85 mark my words and has a clear right to be in that top 50,reality

fury road is a high octane thrill ride from start to finish its masterfully executed cinematography is painted in icy blues and molten reds infusing this action flick with fresh fiery energy fury road engages its audience with every adrenaline infused sequence while never suffering from action fatigue by means of monotony the raspy cutting sounds and visuals of fury roads post apocalyptic landscape add to its vibrancy grit and tenacity george millers 2015 masterpiece shall go down in history as one of the greatest action films of all time,reality
this movie is like a lesson to how to filming music editing cinematography sound design acting and everything else is just freaking perfect,reality
so everysinglescene in this film is terrible writing and acting to the point of face palming but the film is one long chase scene anyways thats going literally to nowhere and back again so i guess there isnt exactly a whole lotta dialog or even much else to say anyways only reason it enjoyed so much success is due to the sheer budget they threw at the film to distract you from any of the real content to the movie,reality
of course i had heard a lot of good about fury road hell it won six oscars but of course its different to actually see it for yourself than just to rely on the opinions of othersits clear that this movie is different from the typical action movies that we get nowadays from every fking movie studio that exists theres something unique in the story and of course visually this movie beats any other action movie out there while the story is a bit dark and it has very serious themes in it theres a somewhat loose feeling to it the movie can be taken seriously but theres a somewhat relaxed feeling to the things theyve come up with the filmmakers are pros and they know what they are doing so if they want to add a flamethrower electric guitar in there they can and they should  and it will be fking awesome that flamethrower electric guitar reminds me since i havent seen the original movies i cant help but feel that im missing something why is there a guitar and war drums on a car is that normal is that a regular thing or is immortan joe just a drama queen who needs his own theme music its cultural stuff like that that i dont know but in the end that didnt seem to matter that much but at least it feels like theres a world outside this movie that the postapocalyptic australian wasteland has a culture instead of just those three or four tribes we get to seefury road may be a bit long and definitely feels longer than it is but its worth it the audience wants desperately to see what happen they desperately want a happy ending all that i was on the edge of my seat even though during the start of the movie i was indifferent towards it visually ive never seen an action movie that looks like this the editing is amazing so are the effects which might have something to do with the fact that they used cgi very little but the cinematography its astonishingly beautiful every shot seems to be careful and the colours are mindblowing also the costume department has done such an amazing job and all the vehicles look amazing everything in this movie just stands out from the typical postapocalyptic action movie and its amazingfury road is an amazing postapocalyptic action movie that definitely stands out from all the st thats out there its different original and just so damn thrilling and beautiful its a fking action movie masterpiece what are the originals like if they are anything like this i have to see them,reality
this is actually worse than the original you would think after all this time the same director would opt for a reboot to the franchise  with something more intelligent gripping etc i dont know what i saw other than a never ending car chase barely any dialog or plot development and weird things just thrown in there as if the writerdirector or anyone who was part of production was totally stonedhigh seriously a flame throwing guitar you would think in a place where water and fuel was scarce there would be massive conservation efforts not a drumming vehicle or a a driving guitar thing luckily i saw this on netflix as i would never forgive myself if i actually paid to see this movie in an actual theater this movie as well as the former  should have never been made it should have ended with the 1981 film and thats it the 81 rating on imdb also has me doubting imdb itself as this movie i dont see how 810 is possible unless its a negative number obviously the system is rigged as this was truly a awful and preposterous movie even the postapocalyptic movie the postman was better had a story plot and more realistic than this trash if i were an actor i would have been embarrassed to have starred in this movie,reality
i have a friend i dont know if he wants me to use his real name so well call him ben ben is what i would call a radical film fan we were in the same high school tv and video production class and we both love film but hes a radical film fan so when he came to school and told me fury road is the best action film ive ever had the privilege to watch in theaters i replied chill out dude im sure its good but its not that good he kept on hyping it for me so when i eventually did see it it was not even close to what i was expecting it took me three viewings of fury road for me to realize it was a great film i have now come to the conclusion that although spotlight was a great movie fury road was the best film of 2015 there has never been a director ive watched in my life that took more risks with the camera than george miller in this movie he directs the crap out of this movie it is one of the best directed films ive ever seen and my film watching career includes over 500 movies the acting is first rate and spectacular however the visuals and absolutely fantastic imagery overtake the great performances across the board which further proves my point that it is a fantastically directed movie i cant find a single flaw with this film if it had won best picture i would have been one happy camper it is a great movie and i will be upset if it does not make this years afi top 100 you are doing yourself a major disservice if you do not see this movie it is beyond what i would call a great film fury road is the best action film nay the best movie ive watched in the past 10 years watch it now but keep an open mind,reality
lacked everything that made the other movies brilliant no atmospheric cinematography just cgi and too much colour no cleverly shot action with humour just generic action x10 no just a grunting oath the makeup was ridiculous as it attempted to be styled like a superhero movie so the kids could relate and like it the demographic the bad guy was also a type of comic book creation because thats what kids like and they can cosplay easier a water shortage yet was anyone really suffering the effects not reallyblood transfusions right why are people so muscular postapocalyptic gyms the plot least have one dialogue mostly grunts and garbage unbelievably predictable in every way not stimulating despite explosions and loud noises because it gets boring 81 rating should be 18hype hollywood advertising pretension positive paid critic responses and the selfdelusion of the viewer that theyre seeing something good doesnt make a good movie a good movie makes a good movie,reality
first its important to say what fury road isnt the rich vein that was the story and world of the original movie is destroyed along with the car in the first ten minutes that effectively is the end of the connection and back story and now we start a road chase that goes for two hours out into the desertsome fantastic stunts and rare australian cars are destroyed for an audience who probably never appreciated what they were looking at in the first place as goes for a ride in a truck is a sideline character in his own film as an actor not suited to the character mostly grunts his way through a film where he occasionally tries with mixed success to carry an australian accent to be fair the whole film tries and fails to be australian as part of this film were shot in africa and its painfully obvious to those who know what australia should look likethis film is intended to be a rich visual stunt spectacular and at that it truly does succeed the story itself could have been written in an afternoon after lunch and is intended not to stretch the brain cells of the audience so their heads wont hurt it is all about the visuals and really did i mention the visuals so if you were hoping for a genuine reboot the answer is a firm no this film is in no way for you if you want to watch some well done visual stunts and you thought fast and the furious was the most realistic and well written film franchise you have ever seen  fury road is waiting for youit isnt a bad film if you part your brain but it isnt in any way and that is the problemat least it was better than beyond thunderdome,reality
fury road is a genre film of the highest order one that torpedoes through its genre conventions in an eruption of smoke and rust and would sooner perish than take a moment to dust off its shoulders it is a film drenched in gasoline and liquid anarchy splurting flames out of its umpteen exhaust pipes and rumbling so deeply the back of your skull starts itching director george miller who also directed the past three films released his last entry thunderdome three decades ago and this one seems to have bathed or scorched in the vivid gleam of his wildest fantasies for every minute of themwhile thunderdome has since garnered a reputation for being the worst entry in the series  my thoughts being the exact inverse  fury road brings a previously unknown dimension in modern technique to its proceedings that adds to the effect in ways that would never have been possible back in the franchises time millers latest is an unceasing succession of sensational action sequences a visceral circus act that isnt content with simply juggling chainsaws they must be ablaze while it walks a tightrope that is also ablazerockatansky who weve come to know as mel gibsons post apocalypse persona is recast as tom hardy whose formidable presence has not been lost upon the chaos and the madness of the world around him he is a man haunted by his past trespasses and hunted by whoever is within proximity this world brought to a wastelandic extreme weve yet to see from this series is ruled in part by a tyrannical dictator by the name of immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne a creature whose mask can only remind viewers of hardys previous role as bane in dkr his cult is in possession of a spectacular array of vehicles that make for chase scenes that set out to overwhelm and succeedjoe and his army are in pursuit of imperator furiosa charlize theron a female warrior of joes who sets out to escape his wrath with his five wives in tow here is where the films feminist undercurrent is rooted in the developments of these women who have none but themselves to look towards in the midst of mayhem in the previous films the mere presence of a woman onscreen has been sufficient cause for unease the promise of death or worse perpetually shimmering on the horizon drawing ever near with each passing moment that raw fear has since driven these women to adopt a fierce will to survive while shielding their perceived delicacy from the cruel outside they are powerful but nonetheless fragile beautiful but capable an oasis of purity in what is very much a mans worldamong those pursuing them is a war boy named nux nicholas hoult a blindly devoted member of joes army who is also captor he employs him as a blood bag and a living masthead of sorts for his vehicle nux serves his master with a raging loyalty and a belief that his efforts will secure him a place in valhalla alongside the best of them they follow the pack into battle and from this point forward the film sets a cinderblock upon the gas pedal and hunches over the steering wheel crazed and with black rings around its eyes the entire film is in essence one long chase ebbing and flowing constantly involving and always aware of its surroundings the chase scenes in fury road arent simply a means to a cheap thrill they explore all that is possible within the boundaries of their convention they have spatial awareness making full use of the depth of space around the vehicles an explosion isnt something that just happens for the sake of an explosion you see where it is in relation to everything else how it affects the surroundings whether it changes the state of play the cars dont simply inhabit the desert environment they are integrated into it which means the stunts are allowed to be as fluid and elegant as those you would expect to see in a jackie chan movieits gratifying to watch millers supercharged imagination run wild across the screen the characters are all either desperate for purpose or starved of reason with bodies painted white and faces in various stages of embellishment or disfigurement they howl they pant  youd swear they guzzle octane like oj the vehicles are all tattered assemblies of the remnants of our society tricked out in various ways that suggest a transformers rendition of frankenstein the set pieces are monuments of modern filmmaking the initial chase involves a storm which is all im willing to divulge as i can neither bear spoiling the scene any further nor ever come close to doing it justice and then the movie tops it with each new sequence the canvas is saturated with colors that would be too rich for a desert wasteland but for the vision of its artisanone who for the most part faces his inner demons in anguished silence seems to take the passengerseat to furiosa who is a force to be reckoned with as beautiful as she is unrelenting her black sheen brow shaved head and mechanical arm all tell stories about her before she utters a word applause is also due towards the wives who escape from the citadel in search of a better world that may not be and never have been they ground the events in a sense of urgency a realism brought about by the conviction in fighting for a cause which keeps the film from mushrooming into a 2hour blowout of unchecked excess and insanity well completelyi just about enjoyed every minute of fury road in a phrase it was exhilarating in another it is one of the years best films this isnt a reboot of a classic franchise or even a proper sequel its an evolution,reality
starting with the frenetic sped up camera shots at the beginning until the end which should have been within the first 2 minutes this schlock paled in comparison to the 3 preceding films and im not saying this because of nostalgia or some codger notion of the originals always the besteverything about this movie was just sogoofy unnecessary and annoyingly dumb admittedly i would have rather seen mel gibson climbing out of the car in the beginning but obviously tom hardy took the reins instead and i had no problem with that he did a good job in the tdkr so that didnt really skew my opinion and charlize theron is a good actress i had no problem with her being in the film eitherthe problem wasnt the casting choices the problem with this film was the film itself it had a poor screenplay script storyboarding characters etc it lacked all the excitement and intensity of the original films and replaced with again goofiness and half brained stupidity with the exception of the film quality hd i have nothing positive to say about this film,reality
could have been a great film if it wasnt for the buy one get three mentality of modern hollywoodwhere was the big explosion killing nux and the pursuing war party where was happy ending with a view of life after taking the citadel these loose ends will be tied up over the next couple of years through a series of increasingly frustrating disappointmentsthe lord of the rings was naturally okay as a trilogy the first matrix was great as a single film so who cares if the producers then cash in on couple of lame sequels  at least they delivered one good one hunger games is beating down the divide between movie and soap opera where as feels more like a vanilla audi it looks the part but really its just an empty box and youll soon want to buy something else if we take the whole upcoming trilogy or however many it is they plan to spit out of the sausage machine then condense them into one 253hr film then it would probably be worth the 98 fresh rating sited above so i will divide the 98 by 3 to result in an average rating of 33 which i have adjusted up to 50 as the first will surely be better than the rest shame,reality
action blasts away any urge to fall asleep through this movie car chases explosions combat and babes all interplay well so boredom ceases scenes of bad guy fortresses vehicles and weapons stack the odds pretty high against and his new found friends everyone there pushes to the limit even little crony bad guys put up decent fights even one or two of the super model ladies pull a couple ones watching this movie in 3d just amplifies all this action and the color choices just really brought out the gothic post apocalyptic setting barren and thirsty lands seem sweltering while five peoples face scarce resources and corruption each group of people showcase slight competitive advantages which band just blows to shreds,reality
i saw the movie this evening and thought it was good but not as good as mel gibson in the road warrior from 1981i would only rate fury road a 70 not the high 8s like it is nowi thought the following1 this was more about imperator furiosa and her fight against the tyrannical immortan joe she was the main character in this movie was the supporting character the real title of this movie should have been furiosa fury road2 i grew up during the original three movies i intimately know the road warrior and beyond thunderdome and are in my top 10 films of all time was this supposed to be a reboot or was it supposed to be a sequel 3 for the younger crowd who didnt see the first three movies how are they supposed to know who is there was little to no development of his character we dont know why he is out there in the wasteland we dont know his history and what happened to his family from the likes of toecutter4 in and the road warrior ford falcon xb gt police interceptor was a major character in those films however in fury road the car had very little screen time as it was flipped over in the first 3 minutes then we only saw it repaired and painted in a silver color in certain shots as the war boys were chasing furiosa5 i thought immortan joe was very interesting and was a better character than the humungus although very memorable in the road warrior hughkeays byrne was an excellent choice that face and the mask leaves a psychological impression in case people dont know keaysbyrne played toecutter in the 1979 film6 for me part of the appeal of the first three movies was the unmistakable heavy aussie accents by everyone in the filmsexcluding aunty entity tina turner and master angelo rossito in thunderdome in fury road everyone had a nonspecific british accent it was kind of a hodgepodge or a hybrid of aussie meets british accents british and aussie accents are distinctly different tom hardy does not sound australian charlize theron sounded like her normal american self except for when she said gayzzolyne trying to sound aussie7 perhaps the most memorable bad guy character in the road warrior was wez vernon wells with the mohawk and assless chaps he has lots of screen time and had that cinematic dominance on screen rictus erectus nathan jones did not seem like a dominant bad guy character in this movie he is just huge jones is 611 and 350 pounds of pure muscle8 what kind of dust storm was that supposed to be not like anything ive ever seen maybe it was a nuclear dust storm 9 finallythe chase scenes and the cars just as good if not better than the first three moviesthat is all,reality
i saw fury road starring tom hardybane in the dark knight rises sucker punch charlize theronprometheus reindeer games nicholas houltbeast in the xmen movies including the next one warm bodies and hugh keaysbyrnefarscapetv 1979this is an action packed reboot of the movies from 19791985 that starred mel gibson and no he does not make an appearance in this new one it is directed by the same man that directed the original 3 movies from 30 years ago george miller in this reboot tom plays an excop living in the dark apocalyptic world of the not too distant future where there is a shortage of resources mostly gas and water hugh is the man in charge of a place called the citadel where he dishes out supplies very sparingly and he also keeps a small harem of victorias secret super models as breeding materials a couple of them were real vs models most of hughs underlings look like baldheaded white paint covered cannibals and the movie starts with a group of them capturing tom charlize drives one of the gas tanker trucks for hugh but decides to steal hughs breeding girls and head for a safe haven in the dessert where she grew up nicholas plays one of the white paint covered underlings sent to retrieve hughs stolen property and he takes tom along as his personal living blood bankhe has tom strapped to the hood of his car with an iv needle leading back to himself pretty soon tom and charlize teamup while trying to avoid all the supped up cars trucks motorcycles and other assorted vehicles that are in hot pursuit one thing that i really enjoyed was that the stunts are about 80 real stuntsnot cgialthough there is some cgi used charlize is missing an arm and i dont think that they really cut it off for this movie oh yeah i also liked how the bad guys had their own traveling music along with them there were literally people playing drums and guitars on one of the vehicles as they were barreling through the dessert fighting the stunts are fantastic and i dont see how some of the stunt people survived some of the crashes that occurred this movie is so action packed that it is an adrenaline rush its rated r for violence disturbing images and sexual contentincluding nudityand has a running time of 2 hours i really enjoyed it and would buy it on bluray,reality
i honestly expected to walk out of fury road giving it a 10 i rarely hand out tens went all last year without a single one and this is now my second the critics love fans love the buzz has been terrific the reason behind it they did everything right this is not a reboot i hate that expression or a remake it can fit in the previous incantations stand on its own or be open to interpretation a fan rumour suggests in this film is not even the same as mel gibsons they didnt hire a new director or writer etc etcinstead the studio heads let the master himself come back 35 years later and redefine his vision there are easter eggs throughout the film that connect this movie to the road warrior the world and sets itself apart the bleak wasteland is so intricately created that half of the time your jaw is dropping at the sheer insanity in front of you does it make sense does it need to what has happened to these people to make them completely insane it is science fictionpost apocalypticaction madness and action it isim not sure ive ever seen a film that is quite literally wall to wall action it does manage to demonstrate a story but its pretty thin because this is just one event happening in this wasteland when its all over i couldnt think of anything bad to say about it it was insane and i loved itthe only less than stellar comment i can say about the film is himself if i were george miller i would have ditched as the focus of the film and changed it to furiosa but more on that in a moment tom hardy picks up the iconic role of and he is alright in the role the thing ive always found with hardy is im not sure hes a leading man hes a hot commodity in hollywood but i dont feel like he has the charisma to truly carry a film and i didnt feel like he carried this one i get that is a man of few words but you go back 30 years and watch gibson in the role and he just oozes charisma you are riveted to his hardys you hardly remember he is there most of the time you could remove him from the film and it would have been nearly as good the scene stealer the heroine the reason to see this film is charlize theron she is absolutely mind blowing amazing as furiosa her character is full of depth determination and simple badassery she is one of the best female heroes on screen in a very long time nicholas hoult is excellent as the insane defector nux his character could carry a film on his own hugh keaysbyrne returns to the universe as our main villain immortan joe keaysbyrne played toecutter in the original film 35 years ago and despite being a little underdeveloped hes make a heck of a villain this time around too the gals that play immortan joes wives are also quite good but underdeveloped still the film definitely has a lot of extremely strong female charactersgeorge miller has created a chaotic opera of insanity with fury road there are scenes in this movie that made me gowhat in the worldand yet you cannot deny the absolutely epic absurdity of this world hes created i could watch this ten times to see what is happening behind the action the film is ultimately one massive car chase and the action does not stop for a single moment and yet it is the furthest thing from mindless action i thought it was unfortunate so much cgi was used in the film but then i discovered that miller insisted on practical effects whenever possible so now i dont know what to think but all i know is that i think he may have created a modern day masterpiece much like he did back in 1979 with the original film action scifi fans need to see this immediately it is likely the best summer blockbuster we will see 1010,reality
firstly if i have never watched series before i would have voted 5 or 6 out of 10  why because the atmosphere was right but there werent enough in this movie but mostly furiosa also the story felt like incomplete characters were too shallow especially was not crazy enough he felt like a marvel hero to be sure i actually watched an old movie and really there is a huge difference sure the special effects are much more convincing but the acting and the atmosphere is more convincing in old onewhy i gave 7 is because i love series and i am hoping they will shoot more and while doing so they will improve tom hardy should receive some training from mel gibson to fit in i have watched much better postapocalyptic movies  but hopefully new movies will come,reality
to be frank this film is hard to explain by plain words you need to experience it highly thought out script with action packets filled appropriately to make the audience thrilled with out an instance of boredom the casting acting and introduction of each and every standout characters were really good especially furiosa and joemost of the instances of the film is in the desert with many highly customized carstrucks and bikes not so colorful ones people fighting for their survival impressing their lord joe by doing all the craziest things possible to gain the basic needs to them like oil from the oil town and bullets from the war town the scenarios and characters can be compared to many real time complex ones but explained intelligently without pointing to anyone specifically a set of people try to escape with assets of joe and gain freedom and hope they have a better life away from him the action adventure starts when joe and his slaves war boys try to bring them back later supported by the people from oil town and war townis used as an slave source of high octaneblood for the war boys and he tries to survive and escape doing all craziest action possible teaming with furiosa highly skilled mechanic driver and the lady to watch out in the game3d is used at its imum in the action sequences especially the 10 seconds of cliwitness me scene is awesomei watched it in the front row didnt get one on the back row and i felt myself in the desert riding one of those vehiclesthis is one of the movie after gravity which i felt is worth a watch even more than once in theaters,reality
having never watched a film before maybe it wasnt a great idea to spend my money on a action franchise that i know little aboutdont get me wrong the film is stunning i love the souped up cars and the setting of the film im glad this was filmed using practical effects rather than another cgi monster like the hobbit the car chase scenes were amazingly shot and overall the editing effects direction etc was great i thought charlize theron had a good part and acted wellon the other hand tom hardy had about 5 lines in the whole movie and read them out with the same dull expression on his face i saw very little signs of madness apart from out of context flashbacks that i may have got if i had watched the other three films this bothered me there was virtually no character development and instead we got 2 hours of a car chase i wasnt expecting much more but atlas let me invest in the characters so im not watching mind numbingly dull and repetitive chase sequences where i dont care who lives or dies the villains were also poorly developed with little incentive to chase and co down the road for days the girls that were being saved were the most dull motionless set of models they just stood therethis brings me nicely on to my next point the plot or rather lack of it basically gets captured by some white monster things he escapes into a truck with charlize therons character they try to find safety from the war boys and in the end just go back to where they came from no twists no character development no story610 i dont understand how people can give this movie a perfect 10 are they blind to the stale acting 10 lines of dialoge and a glorified car chase for 2 12 hours,reality
i have only a fleeting memory of the films from 19791985 directed by george miller and starring mel gibson these were set in the dystopian future in australia where energy is a critical commodity was a man with revenge after his wife and child were brutally murdered this setting is all the background you need to know about the previous franchise in order to enjoy this present incarnation 30 years after beyond thunderdome the last film of the first trilogyin the massive citadel a skull maskwearing tyrant immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne rules cruelly withholding precious water from his impoverished subjects rockatansky tom hardy has been captured to become a blood donor for nux nicholas hoult one of joes war boys elsewhere imperator furiosa charlize theron a female warrig driver helps joes five wives escape to the fabled green place of her childhood nux with still attached to him joins joe and the other war boys to pursue furiosa this chase leads to a major explosive battleroyale in the desert one that would cause an upheaval of the balance of power in the outback the screenplay by george miller brendan mccarthy and nico lathouris was rich and complex with deep emotional moments the cinematography of john seale with his orangetinged day scenes and yellowishhued night scenes was breathtaking to behold the magnificent action sequences with 90 actual not cg vehicular stunts with gigantic monster trucks were so perfectly planned and executed these were edited with precision by margaret sixel with awesome sound mixing to boot i thought the eye popping 3d effects for those exhilarating car chase scenes are very much worth the extra in ticket pricetom hardy was impressive in both his athletic ability and his facial expressiveness as the quietly macho he was required to underplay his role since is a strong and silent type but to his credit hardy was able to come up with a relatively silent but memorably strong performance his final scene was very haunting even without any words being spokendespite being totally bald onearmed with black grease on her face charlize theron never loses her elegant screen presence for a moment her performance so rough and physical and yet so warm and moving was the very heart of the film truth to tell she was riveting every time she is on screen even stealing the thunder from the title character himself rare as it may be for an action film i feel theron is definitely in serious contention for a best actress awardmore than anything else fury road is one gorgeouslooking film director george miller was able to mine cinematic beauty from the vicious violence and badass brutality amidst the dirty and dusty dystopian setting and that is no mean feat i am looking forward to the coming installments of this new and improved franchise 910,reality
as with 2 this latest instalment of the franchise presupposes no prior knowledge of the preceding movies the term reboot has been applied to it which is perhaps fair enough having a new star as the titular character tom hardy lends credence to this view as with 2 fury road begins with a voiceover narration setting the scene in 2 that voice was some nameless man acting as a teller of the myth of in fury road it is the voice of himself 2 struck me as more mythic but fury road does not eschew this approach but it does appropriates other stylistic genres perhaps the driver of this story is a variation on the story of the iliadall hell breaks loose when the wife of a powerful man goes walkaboutoff the reservation so to speak there seems to be more emphasis on a picture of a postapocalyptic society here than in previous films although perhaps beyond thunderdome did delve in to this aspectits just that i remember very little of of it apart from that cagefight setting etc early on in the film at least its more about creating a sense of place and society than focusing on most of the movie is one long frantic cartruckmotorcycle chase sequencewhich might sound like a bad thing but director george miller makes it exhilaratingalthough perhaps falling short of the standards he set in 2which happened to be my introduction to the franchise and made me conclude as a child that he had outdone hollywood later watching the first film in the series was a disappointment i have to say how does tom hardy fare in the role in this he seems a marginal character a lot of the timean accidentalincidental hero if you willlow intensity often too he looks buff compared to the lithe mel gibson in the first three movies his accent seems a bit weird tooi cant remember if i found it to sound south african at timesor maybe that was one or two other characters some of the other characters have weird accents tooeither theyre not nailing what theyre going for or its just a mixed bag of accents costume accessories at times recall his role in the dark knight rises sometimes predicament puts in mind daniel craigs james bond being in a similar outlandish circumstance eg being a hood ornament literally in this world its good that isnt the beall and endall quite a lot screen time is spent on charlize therons characterthe fancifully named imperator furiosa one has to give charlize great kudosi doubt that any other actor has taken the method to such an extent as to have their forearm amputated for the role she is in a way a rival to mythalso impressive about the film is the cinematography and style of it all the sea of humanity early on in the film the aesthetic which seems to draw on such diverse sources as beneath the planet of the apes perhapsfoggy memory underground american horror films about the backwoods people and freaksetcetcetc the refugee camp aesthetic has a distinct looking cast but i dont think that they have the memorability of the goons in 2 with the likes of the humungus wez and the feral kid although he is not a goon lets not forget the gyro captain in that latter camp too some really impressive visuals can be found in the dust storm sequence which seems positively of the apocalypse and one setting which brings to mind wastelands enchanted by an evil spella la lord of the rings or excalibur like the latter setting has a surreal feel to it in stark contrast to its stark monochrome colour palette perhaps for the first time in this series the part of the title character seems to be literalised he has demons which torment him to be honest i wasnt sure where to place these in the chronologybefore going into this movie i suspected that it was set some time after the events of the original movie and perhaps before or after the events of the second has numerous flashbacks which unsettle him i did wonder if one of the faces i saw was meant to be the feral kid or another was meant to someone from the first moviebut the age of the character in the flashback i fury road made me doubt thatalthough the original movie isnt clear in my mind it might very well be possible that the events of the flashbacks could be fodder for a sequel to fury roadassuming that they havent been covered in the prior moviesmy casual reading of the series is that the first movie was set in a remote violent community some time between the events of that movie and the second some sort of global catastrophe occurred which brought mankind back to a primitive dogeatdog state speaking of which there are some nice seeming references to 2from the truck driven by furiosa is that where this movies title derives from to a nice nod to the dog food scenebut turned up to 11 something the squeamish may want to close their eyes momentarily forto be honest i would have been happy for mel gibson to reprise his role as and i didnt really need name overseas stars brought in but charlize is probably less of a marked choice than tina turner in beyond thunderdome although she had a couple of great songs on that movies soundtrack id place this movie behind 2 and above beyond thunderdome which i saw before rating movies at places like this its an exhilarating ride,reality
if you watch this film and think that it is in any way interesting cool or cutting edge please take the remote control from your tv set and beat yourself to death with it you have no business spreading your dna into the general population this has got to be one of the worst films i have ever seen there is no plot no dialog and no point to any of it its as if a sadistic child got hold of a multimillion dollar special effects studio and went on red bull induced prepubescent rampage do not watch this film if you value your time,reality
this has to be one of if not the worse movie i have ever endured there is absolutely no point to this movie virgins are pregnant it is just a bunch of garbled lackluster action everyone that watched this movie deserves their money back and deserves to be compensated for sitting through this horrible,reality
let me get this straight your telling me that this winner of 6 oscars considered by people to be one of the greatest action films ever made somehow manages to achieve all this with nothing more than a story line that is paper thin repetitive and boring action scenes himself not even being the main star of the film furiosa staring at the camera 50 of her time on screen somehow makes her a strong female lead fury road is the most overrated film ever made if you want a great action flick go watch jaws the indiana jones films terminator and predator fury road is dull like a blunt knife that fails to make a mark,reality
as fast exhilarating over the top and relentless as possible fury road is exactly the film that we want and that it needs to be visionary george miller shows us that a two hour chase film can simultaneously be a jawdropping work of cinematic art in every visual and technical aspect as well as surprisingly deep and metaphoric storythirty years after the end of the iconic trilogy miller revisits the iconic dystopian world he created and inevitably defined the late 1970s and 80s boasting a new cast and making use of the best modern technology in the way of practical effects and filming techniques demoting digital effects to bare minimum despite being a character centered franchise therons furiosa gets equal if not more prominence than hardys charismatic rockatansky in a film that raises feminist issues left and right despite its high octane macho cover miller does this with such effortless insight and balance that we never feel any kind of unnecessary or forced agenda being rubbed in your facesfury road might certainly not be a film for everyone but its instant classic and landmark appeal is undeniable gorgeously shot impeccably acted and frenetically edited and scored brothers in arms by tom holkenborg is one of the best cues in recent memory fury road is an exemplary piece of filmmaking to remember for all the good reasons,reality
in 1979 george miller directed a dystopian action film which earned us100 million worldwide and held the guinness record for most profitable film for decades the film propelled mel gibson to an international cult figure called this film was followed by two sequels 2 the road warrior and beyond thunderdomei watched the sequel to before i ever saw the original the original can be considered a backdrop story to 2 i think the original film was made just to launch the more serious chapter of the film which was the sequel the concluding third chapter was generally considered a mediocre final chapter of the franchise and an average performer at the box officethe human society is decimated by a nuclear holocaust and the few survivors fight over the meager resources gasoline food and water enter a patrolman whose wife and toddler were literally runover by vicious motorcycle gang and who is now just a shell of a human being wandering aimlessly through the badlandsmillers latest film fury road can be considered a continuation of events just after the road warrior and a prequel to beyond thunderdome in fact a character called imperator furiosacharlize theron is very similar to the character aunty entitytina turnermel gibson who played in all three of the films has been replaced by english tom hardy this i find very offending is an aussie franchise and should have stayed that way also the absence of mel gibson in the film is an open insult to fans all over the world the casting of south african actress charlize theron is the final slap on the face arent there much prettier aussie actresses to choose from what about nicole kidman a veteran aussie actress why was she not considered for this film plot is captured by the war boys the army of the tyrannical immortan joehugh keaysbyrne and taken to joes citadel designated a universal blood donor is imprisoned and used as a blood bag for the sick war boy nux meanwhile imperator furiosa drives her armoured war rig to collect gasoline when furiosa drives offroute joe realizes that his five wives  women selected for breeding  are missing enraged joe leads his entire army in pursuit of furiosa calling on the aid of nearby gas town and the bullet farmverdict mel gibson fans will find their hero sorely missing in this one the only consolation is that hugh keaysbyrne who played the main antagonist toecutter in the original is cast as a new villain immortan joefans of tom hardy will be disappointed as charlize theron ousts him in every cut of the film she is the major character of the film and hardy plays the role of the sidekick the sound and special effects are very well done which is the only redeeming aspect of this latest filmmore george miller films twilight zone the movie1983 the witches of eastwick1987 lorenzos oil1992 40000 years of dreaming1997 babe pig in the city 1998 happy feet2006 happy feet two2011thank you for having the time to read my review may you live long and prosper,reality
the road warrior on steroidsat 70 george millers still got it this put ff to shame when the majority of the automotive action is real and im still not quite sure after seeing fr in 3d how tom hardy did not get seriously injured with some of the stuff he did all the action was searing and you can see cinematographer john seales fingerprint on everythingmiller and seale can truly shoot a real real action scene and put the camera in places it probably shouldnt be able to go one highlight for me was the uberdramatic phenomenally scored sandstorm scene with its flawless cgi integrationthe cgi is there but the seam is invisible this scene literally had me eyebrows raised and saying these storyboards mustve been fun to plan out the integration of the fx and the liveaction footage is truly at expert level sorry marvelbut you can always see the cgi in your movies and we always know where it starts and ends i simply cant say enough good things about mmfr but ill trytom hardy apparently signed on for 2 more mm installments under miller i cant imagine what miller has planned for us next but with george miller we should be ready for anything one thing that really sticks out for me is that for the viewing my wife and i went to last night was rather small our auditorium was only halffilled but after the last shot finished and directed by george miller appeared everybody at our showing clapped for a whole minutethat didnt happen at either avengers or f7 this movie has changed the action genre again but this time to a place where movies have never gonedirectors not wanting to shoot scenes the easy way but the best way most directors will incorporate the digital work for a whole list of reasonsgeorge miller takes that list burns it with a lighter and blows the ashes away with a leaf blower he doesnt use cgi to make it easy he uses it to turn the already jawdropping into the absolutely eyepopping using cgi so perfectly and so minimally you dont know where it is or how much there is you watch any superhero movie or ff movie and you can see where the digital work ishere dont even bother looking and thats where george miller takes us to a place where we know its there for about 2 seconds but we dont know where it started and finished and we dont care at all as good as f7 and avengers were there was a lot of areas they couldve been bettergeorge miller not only goes to that place but now he owns it and he doesnt have to give it backwith the technical aspect locked up in the hands of miller seale and crew the real reason to watch this is the magnetic chemistry of hardy and therona masterfully staged fight between furiosa and nux quickly transforms into a reluctant partnership against immortan joe and his regime and they quickly adapt to whatever the situation brings especially when furiosa gets stabbed at the worst possible moment their commitment is never to each other but to surviving and they both acknowledge that they are only resources to help that cause doesnt even tell her his name until shes almost deadbecause at no point does knowing his name help them on their journey that is until knowing him as a person more or less as well as his blood helps her to survive her injury a small detail but pivotal to their relationship as it wasnt important until it became important and enough cant be said about theron as furiosashe is this generations ripley a survivor who isnt afraid or too proud to take help when she needs it and above all will see her cause through to the end theron truly owns the role when she agrees with to head back to their compoundshe already offered to cement their partnership he goes one better and offers to go back to the citadel with them and help them retake it because now surviving isnt enough for either of themthey both seek redemption and they know they need each other to accomplish that theron owns that scene going from completely defeated then willing to take the second path and finally agreeing with suggestion because it still offers hope and she completes the 360 perfectly because she knows that furiosa has to complete her journey hardy and theron are the best onscreen pair ive seen in more than a decade and i really hope that miller has more for them to do together this movie shouldve been an epic fail on so many levelsyet george miller looks at the odds laughs at them pushes them out of his way and blows them up in the first 15 minutes or maybe that was car,reality
wow this was a refreshing action movie that i have not seen in a very long time in hollywood i am not a big fan of action but this one kept me on the edge of my seat from beginning to end there are shots car chasing hot ass women super hero with great bonding between the characters furiosa is a strong female lead and along with make a great team all the action scenes are packed but there is also a plot while the plot is not extensive the action fills in the gap i loved all the main characters and cannot wait to see a sequel also the lenght of the movie is perfect and ending is actually completing and not cliff hanger that i hate so much loved the team spirit that dominates the movie all alongall in all thanks the creators for putting a female super hero as the lead and choosing charlize theron and the guy that plays as the two leads of this movie working side by side making a great team,reality
this flick should not have worked not only is it yet another 80s remake but even more worrying yet another entry into the post apocalyptic genre that is so much in vogue right now but there was something promising about those trailers though   even from the opening credits you get the sense that this is not gonna be a conventional ride something in the lettering that suggests a time where films were made for pure entertainment the movie is set in the near future but this is no cutesy tween franchise in the making designed to capture that ever important 12 to 17 demographicoh f no there are no spunky heroines no games no mazes and no adorable robots learning how to love what you have is the dirty broken remnants of humanity trying to survive the setting is dystopian in the true sense of the word a gritty grimy and grotesque world where mankind is barely holding on their bodies ravaged by disease where water is a precious commodity and a healthy baby is valued more than anything this is a world of fire and blood life or death ride on a whim and damn if it isnt a beautiful thing to watch the mayhem starts from the opening scene and doesnt let up until its dusty breathless ending director george miller and veteran cinematographer john seale have crafted a maniacal and delirious romp through the gorgeous namibian desert and created what is essentially a 2hour long car chase scene that looks amazing vehicular manslaughter as grand spectacle the main reason for making this film seems to be the director wanting to answer the question what kind of movie can be made if you have no concern at all for stuntmen safety for most of the running time there are people jumping on over below and in one memorable sequence even swinging from poles around moving vehicles miller and seale capturing every vertiginous shot with precise expertise you are going to come out of this movie exhausted and dusting sand from your clothes as rockatansky tom hardy brings that quiet intensity he is famous for but despite the title this is charlize therons movie and the story is mostly presented from her point of view as imperator furiosa she carries the films mcguffin all lovely five of them and some of the most poignant scenes for even if this is a damned and barren place it is not entirely a mans world women are very much a part of it and can be lethal too a movie about cars violence and explosions that still manages to empower women not even all 7 fast  furious flicks can match this ride for ferocity and enjoyment now some may complaint that the story is hard to follow and to be honest i had a difficult time following the australian accents but this is mostly the gripes of a public used to having the plot spoon fed to them like delicious apple sauce there is no handholding here no lengthy exposition to ease you into this world of woe this is just not that kind of movie the director has much more respect for his audience than that the earth is fed humanity is dying get used to it not that you will have too much to ponder what is going on with all the craziness happening on the screen fast cars explosions fights a dude playing the guitar even a goddamn tornado and you want to worry about backstory naah son you walked into the wrong theater now sit back shut up and enjoy the glorious madness oh what a lovely day indeed parents brief rated r running time 120 minutes on sex and violence this is gonna sound a little counterintuitive after reading the preceding review but there is actually not that much graphic violence in the film im not saying bring the little ones that r rating is there for a reason but most of the violence is cleverly implied there is some nudity but no sexual situations,reality
one unstoppable movie where you cant even breath while youre watching because things just happens with insanity every time from everywhere you wanna just scream run and burn everything and im not kidding if you really like action thats your chance to see an unforgettable movie and if you dont like i need to tell you this one you probably will like but please dont expect a complex screenplay its just a funnyinsane movie you can easily understand what happens in this another adventure i thought this one better than the others of course and i really enjoyed tom hardy as charlize theron is awesome sometimes i thought she was the main character well she actually is even the title is joe is a terrible powerful enemy for real i wouldnt like to meet him anywhere and the feeling when the movie finishes more please what a lovely day i watched good movie to everyone,reality
i went into this film with pretty high expectations im a fan of the earlier movies and by the time i saw it the initial reviews were in and they were all very positive i was excited to see it and simply put it was incrediblei could not believe how much fun i had with this film i loved more or less everything about it i thought tom hardy did a great job as and thats coming from a big fan of mel gibsons portrayal in the first three i loved charlize theron in this movie too she was an absolute badass but at the same time she brought a refreshing amount of emotion and heart to the chaotic wastelands of fury road it really is just nice to see a strong female character after so far this year just being given anastasia steele fifty shades of grey and jupiter jones jupiter ascending the actors gave performances that were compelling but it was the man behind the camera that impressed me the mostdirectors that are making an action movie can learn from george miller as fury road is a tutorial for film makers on how to make an action movie correctly these days action movies suffer because their directors choose to use quick cuts extreme close ups and worst of all shaky cam when theyre creating their action sequences this causes car chases and fist fights to become confusing and hard follow george miller throws this lazy technique out the window rightly fury road sees miller create scenes of absolute carnage and mayhem with car crashes and explosions whilst capturing all this chaos within beautiful wide shots with no shaky cam to be found so all the glorious destruction is clearly visible for the audiences pleasure and another big plus is that the viewer isnt left feeling detached from the world of the film by poor cgi because miller uses practical effects the car crashes seem so real because they are furthermore i was clenching my fists as i watched face peril at every turn unlike action heroes nowadays that seem to be indestructible miller puts our protagonist in danger constantly he is vulnerable just like the rest of us and i worried for his life at times it was fantastic i was full of adrenaline and grinning uncontrollably throughout the entire run timeif you have not seen fury road yet i strongly suggest you fix that as this film deserves all the money that can be thrown at it you will be left drooling as you witness george millers return to the franchise that he executes with such grace and expertise michael bay take note thank you george miller,reality
charlize theron described this movie as a fever dream on jimmy fallon and i have to say thats the perfect description for the flick its like watching the fast and the furious in the stark postapocalyptic desert with psychotic minions performing cirque du soleil the movie had very little down time very little character development and honestly very little plot but it absolutely succeeded without all these elements this just shows the genius of miller the effects and stunts were about the best you can see in any movie old or new the pulsepounding action definitely kept me on the edge of my seat with white knuckles no need to be a guru as this story sits fairly independent of the previous masterpiecessure there were some parts of the movie that didnt add up and you could definitely poke holes in if you overanalyze it it also seemed like some of the characters later on in the movie were just plot fodder however you dont have long to think about these things before you see a posse of 2000 horse power monster rigs and hear 2000 decibels of screaming guitar on the horizon and anticipate another chase unfolding complete with explosions crashes rolled vehicles and flying sandi loved it and the movie far exceeded my expectations a movie has to be near perfect for me to give a 10 but the 9 stars here are certainly deserved,reality
george miller has created a visual masterpiece the movie is fast paced and never has a dull moment the scenes are a visual treat if you have watched the original series be rest assured this one will ignite your imaginationthe fire scenes where the fires are captured against the sandstorm and desert are the ones which look like they are moving hdr also charlie and tom embody the spirit of they carry the movie with very limited dialogues only through their actions and eyes tom like his other roles in lawless and locke mesmerises with acting skillswhile there are quite a few ways miller could have captured gore but he craftily leaves it for the viewers evil imagination for filling in the gaps i give it huge 10,reality
it is one glorious wagnerian song of blood and mayhem about a round trip travel to break the monopoly of power and the hogging of resources the message we screwed the world clean water should be shared with the people and pretty girls should be set free from ugly man with boils rich and operatic in sight sound and action this new version is a substantial step up from the original to more than satisfy todays jaded audience who crave for xrated heavy metal excitements i was absolutely stoked from the beginning to the end in terms of sizzling the characters with flesh blood and souls of note are nicholas hoult and charlize theron because they put so much juice and bounce into whom they played and make their characters tough and vulnerable all at once nux is a war boy played by hoult who switched side and went out on his own prophecy of dying historic and heroic sic on a fury road it was a real sad moment to see him go as for charlizes character the imperator furiosa with a name that sounds like a newly discovered species of carnivorous flower she too almost went out but story dictates she needs to return to take the helm so saved her and what about tom hardy you may ask well he is as good as any can be and that is plenty more than you can ever ask for,reality
honestly is something you would never expect tom hardy delivers a fantastic performance as and charlize theron does a pretty amazing job as well this movie was honestly in the top 10 best movies ive ever seen its different its unique its something youve defiantly never seen before i encourage you to watch this movie it was great its all perfectly wonderfully fantastically crazy amidst all those ingenious powerpacked road warrior sequences fury road contains a surprising amount of depth and character development george miller returns with his greatest ideas in his mind resulting in raising the bar in all terms for the genre  colorful characters satisfactory plot delightful setting enigmatic character and story backgrounds multiple references to other movies of the series and enough of personal and overall human drama its only may but we already have our movie of the year,reality
im not usually into postapocalyptic world movies but this movie was brilliant it had amazing effects and could not have been a better cast tom hardy is my favourite actor and he never seems to disappoint no matter what role he plays hes portrayal of was great and its one of my favourite movies now honestly i only watched it because he was in it but fury road is a movie you can watch over and over again i have never seen a movie with so much action finally a movie that doesnt involve sex or profanity just pure action i recommend this movie 100 even if you arent into this genre the acting is perfected by every actor in the movie and it just makes it all the more better,reality
the new is a great movie with non stop action minimal to no story line line but thats what youd expect from a movie like this so thats not really a bad thing the action is great the stunts and cg are awesome that being said it really seams like the director writers are trying to promote a social agenda the whole movie is about the women being the action heroes in fact there are a number of scenes where is helpless being saved by the women i have nothing against the women thing but the main action hero should not have to constantly be saved by the costar its not as simple as just whos more hardcore they actually built the entire story about woman fighting against the men who are all bad except for the two good guys in the entire movie so ultimately great action movie but be prepared for a social agenda,reality
director george miller sets the screen on fire with this visually stunning masterpiece in what amounts to postapocalyptic feminist manifesto as well a cautionary statement regarding the code of masculine violence tom hardy and charlize theron give nothing less than the performances of a lifetime both sure to receive academy of motion picture arts and sciences acting nominations for what they have achieved here the special effects stunts cinematography and story combine beautifully to create a film that may simply too powerful for the screen to contain george miller is undoubtedly set for an oscar himself for this overwhelming spectacle as well his astonishing career as the finest director of the last fifty years no one has ever been as imaginative creative and technically proficient with his cameras a motion picture of such magnitude and magnificence demands acclaim and is receiving it in spades as millions flock to their local cinemas to experience the thrills beauty and powerful message that is fury road,reality
if youre tired of films with more exposition than story then this is your postapocalyptic citizen kane fury road is the story of rockatansky a former cop with a hero complex whos slowly being driven by visions of his past hes soon captured by a band of paintstreaked fanatics who take him back to the citadel there we encounter immortan joe theocratic dictator who holds his population enslaved via his control of the most precious resources in a postapocalyptic world clean water joe is treated like a deity by his war boys a cadre of genetically damaged soldiers who live short lives and are willing to sacrifice themselves to do his bidding during a routine run to gas town one of joes most trusted war generals empirator furiosa veers off unexpectedly we soon learn that shes smuggling precious cargo the socalled wives of the dictator joe finds out chase ensues and the somehow finds himself involvedto parrot every other review for the film yes the mostly practical effects are spectacular yes the editing is great yeah the characters are interesting and of course the themes are fascinating but whats most impressive about this film is the innovative way it handles its story george miller gives us a narrative thats almost completely devoid of expository dialogue he asks us to infer things like character motivation and world status through action instead of dialogue we never get a scene explaining why a character feels a certain way or how joes regime came to be we see characters whose dialogue is meant to make situation sense and not simply serve the plot this is a refreshing contrast to christopher nolan style writing where half the script is spent explaining the other half miller has faith in his audiences intelligence and doesnt condescend with simplistic elephant analogies or examples ripped from event horizon the film wears its political leanings on its sleeve and its feministic elements go far beyond giving its action heroine so much agency theres a matriarchy depicted as being a possible viable alternative to the patriarchal joe the film deals with themes like the perception of women as property and the attempt to control womens bodies in various ways its rare and therefore interesting to see a high budget film this explicitly political so yeah watch this film dont just watch it for the spectacle but be amazed as to why simple doesnt necessarily mean simplistic,reality
taking your breath away is a sentence which i thought is clichd and cannot actually happen unless you are hit by soccer ball in your guts but this is exactly what happened after seeing this movie i was getting breathless with non stop excitementthere is no story as such to this movie it is about what a simple idea can do if the director has the vision as miller has this is directors movie period no matter how great charlize theron is she still couldnt upstage the director miller is a starthe vehicles used in this movie are out of this world and straight from hell shudder to think if something like this ever happens to the world and we start using such vehicles there is no need for guns the vehicles are enough to cause massive destruction to the mind and bodythis is a road movie for the completely deranged you will never know where you lost two hours when you see this movie it is like someone is torturing you but you are still enjoying it and enjoying it a lotcheck out nicholas hoult  the sweet zombie from warm bodies  he is a revelation and i have never seen acting like that before miller made sure he has a villain to match the grand canvas and immortan joe as villain is picture perfect1 point i am taking out of this movie  not giving it a perfect 10 is because of tom hardy he is good but not good enough for this genius monstrositybehold  madness just hit the screens,reality
george miller has bested himself and risen into a status of film maker legend such as stanley kubrick and uhstanley kubrick for his attention to detail and love of his art some movies are for profit but you get a strong sense that everyone who worked on this was aware they where participating in creating something great and millers dedication seems to have spread like a plague the post production was unrivaled and a thing of true beauty the utilization of frame rates that was experimented with in the previous mm films was honed to perfection and turned into a special effect of emotions all to its own due to the heightened frame rates and extensive frames more movie was packed into a smaller time framethe manipulation of frame rate was able to subliminally transcend the protagonist plot armor barrier if i could criticize this movie its in not easing up on the viewer throughout the entire film with this subliminal trick this factor alone makes it worthy of its r rating and fury title george miller is the man behind the mask of immortus joe and may have been possessed by similar evil spirits into creating this,reality
i enjoyed the new film it did justice to the first three films while at the same time managing to add enough new elements to the mix to justify its own existence  no small achievement tom hardy didnt bring quite the same gravitas to the role as mel gibson did and i would have preferred to see the aging actor in the role which i think could have made it more moving when is suffering nightmarish visions of his dead wife and child  thats the trouble with a reboot that doesnt ignore the previous films in squaring away the new cast with what has gone before but all things considered it didnt disappoint and i suspect its one that might be even better second time round when theres a chance to take in more of the secondary characters and the visuals 810,reality
the latest is a frenzied endless race of soupedup wellarmed vehicles across a whole lot of sand the relentless pace makes for a wildly exciting film for which the plot is superfluous and generally unnecessary there is much mayhem and madness it is quite goodthis is perhaps the best pure action movie youll see this year even the avengers and star wars have a fully developed story to get in the way this one is a shot of pure adrenaline that never lets up here the titular antihero has been captured by one of those omnipresent roving biker gangs i expect well all see in the near future is turned over to a slaverwarlord named immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne who controls water and food for everyone in his stronghold called the citadel doling it out whenever he sees fit he also uses women for their breast milk and maintains a concubine of several wives so you know hes not a good guyworking for joe  or rather idolizing him to the point where they believe he and only he can lead them into the afterlife world of valhalla  are the war boys pale zealots who pilot terrifying vehicles of mass destruction and gain their strength and energy by usurping blood from generous donors  like the war boys love anyhow every so often ol joe has to send out an imperator for supplies the imperator drives a huge rig called a war rig thats exceedingly well armed and customized to the drivers tastes the driver in this case is imperator furiosa charlize theron who has another plan in mind  rescue dear joes wives and take them to her own birthplace the green place joe quickly gets wind of this and sends out a flurry of war boys one of the boys named nux is weak and in need of blood so he straps the newly captured  a universal donor  to a pole on the front of his machine and the race is on mission for the bad guys  stop furiosa mission for the good guys  get to the green place by any means necessaryreally the entire movie is a chase across a barren wasteland it is a postapocalyptic world after all theres leaping from car to car to truck oh and the war boys they attach these long bendy poles on the hoods of their vehicles with one of their own at the top then they can bend to and fro and either jump on the war rig or maybe sneak in through the sun roof steal a wife or two and bounce back sheer genius theres an enormous blinding lightning sandstorm that accounts for much of the cgi in the film but for the most part the effects are anything but computer generated loved the visual look of the movie too with washedout landscapes and colorful foregrounds director george millers vision shows a world that appears dead on the outside but with glimmers of that most valuable of commodities  hope and all of the little details such as the vehicles themselves some hybrids of 1950s cars including an original beetle and furiosas guns and prosthetic arm add the right touch and hows his for strange  3d is put to good use here with junk and people flying off of cars and right between your eyeballs for much of the first third of the movie wears a face guard that sort of looks like an upside down pitchfork one would assume hardy is used to such gear at this point having been through the dark knight rises as bane here hes even tougher than bane even after hes had blood sapped from him like syrup from a maple tree name incidentally is mentioned only three times in the movie which is fine of course  after all we the audience know damn well who he is and the lack of a name for his traveling companions lends itself quite nicely to his anonymity hes like an even more badass man with no name but he does have compassion mainly because what haunts poor every waking moment is the feeling that he let innocent people die see previous three films in the series will that happen on fury road not on his watch possibly hardy is the figurative bomb as a towering dynamo of nonstop energy theron gets ugly again note she is not ugly even here with a shaved head big muscles and an attitude that would make ellen ripley or sarah connor weep with respect she should definitely make more action movies provided theyre more like this and not like aeon flux its always great to see a strong female protagonist and here we have several in addition to furiosa immortan joes wives arent wilting flowers but rather ass kickers who can load and fire guns pretty refreshing to see that you know this latest  and will it be the last  had me on the edge of my seat which meant that i had to hold on lest i was blown away but indeed i was metaphorically blown away anyway with a muchwelcome return to visceral violent cinema in one of the years top films,reality

this movie has an excuse plot and it never pretends it doesnt the dialogue is simultaneously flat and overthetop the actions the characters do at no point make sense and the only thing even remotely approaching a character arc is nuxs and the bulk of it is over a oneminutelong halfcooked conversationin any other movie that paragraph above would mean a rating of 2 or 3 from me what pushes it to 7well everything else the aforementioned excuse plot is there to have charlize theron tom hardy and nicholas hoult witness and participate in millers string of increasingly insane ideasthis is obviously a movie the director had been waiting to make since the 70s but the technology of the time and the budget didnt allow him in retrospect that worked in the other movies well 1 and 2 favor since the less focus on crazy stunts meant more care for the characters but i digressthis movie doesnt let its audience rest for the most part after every overthetop stunt happens something even crazier follows most of it is stuff we had seen before in other movies mind you but this movies achievement is that it puts it all together and at no point one even questions what is happening most of my objections came after leaving the theater and thinking back on the plota testament of my sensibilities though is that my favorite scene doesnt involve cars or explosions it is the perfectly choreographed adeptly directed completely believable raw and brutal fight of and his unlikely ally vs furiosa and the five wives it was almost transfixingthis is definitely a movie worth watching albeit maybe not rewatching im pretty sure most of the craziness loses its impact on second watch and one will find its lack of pathos more obviousplus theres a redclad guy on top of a truck playing a humongous guitar he also sleeps on anyones argument is invalid,reality
dear george miller i truly admire your postapocalyptic take on the future of humanity it is senseless spectacular isolated barbaric idyllic brash demented berserk refined and nonsensical all in the same breath lets try to break this film down into 3 separate plotpoints or occurrences first miller immerses us into the wondrous yet disturbing landscape of australia  a dry and barren futuristic wasteland the film essentially is one giant trackingshot for the ages a video gamelike sequence of sorts in which our favorite bad boy traverses the unknown territories of millers universe in the hope of helping imperator furiosa smuggle wives belonging to a tyrannical cult leader named king immortan joe from his utopian citadel if that sentence sounded long and absurd its because the plot itself needs psychotherapy trying to adequately sum up the storyline is an insurmountable task  thus let me skip trying to explain it all you need to know is that its a mindless carchase extravaganza that ends with good prevailing over evil the characters in fury road are all overthetop simply put they are just plain fun to look at the special effects are unfathomable in their grandeur yet after all that praise the film misses the point of what itself is trying to accomplish i was expecting a catharsis for the character of his moralambiguity towards everything he does anyone he meets and anything he tries to accomplish  is never truly explained lets take for instance his quite peculiar relationship with furiosa lives in a world filled with savages that support a madman  yet we do not understand why he chooses to protect immortans wives from being captured he feels conflicted at first and later just becomes their secret guardian angel the convolution in the plot is irreparable if like me you expected to find a poetic message left at the end of the film  you will be extremely disappointed i waited and waited for something emotional to happen that would enable me to empathize with these characters this moment never came the one underlying problem with fury road is that the ideas it presents are so farfetched and borderline crazy  they detach the viewer entirely from the film there is no background given to the characters therefore all credibility in the storyline is tossed out the window the journey and furiosa undertake is confusing the plight of both these characters is not resolved in the end furiosa will try to establish her green place in an area previously run with violence and cruelty and just wanders off into the sunset  doing whatever he does after that which is a way of saying its unclear where will end up and what tasks lie ahead of himthe practical effects used in some actionsequences are revolutionary they even hired individuals from the cirquedusoleil to perform some of the stunts this shows millers dedication to create a lifelike universe  where the viewer is expected to spend over 2 hours engrossed inside however this universe lacks any sort of human component to it all the human elements or themes of this film started to develop a deeper significance towards the clibut ultimately were left dying in the dust with car wreckage the desolate land george miller details in the film imparts us with a sense of psychological confusion the universe of is fundamentally flawed which is the point i think but miller neglects the prospect of refining it he does not explore the motives of the characters inhabiting his canvas he sets a grimy tone to the universe but fails to justify its purpose or presencein conclusion fury road is a visually pleasing spectacle but the actors playing the protagonists do a poor job at conveying powerful feelings to the audience this may or may not be george millers fault but at the end of the day no one can deny the fact that this film is and always will be a visual masterpiece consensus a soulless circus that entertains or a cartoon parody of itself no one can deny george miller as a mastermind but i feel even he lost something in the making of this puzzle was it his sanity,reality

this adds nothing to the character or the franchise it utter lacks the sociopolitical commentary of the other films the women are never more than commodities the world they create makes little sense and the chase scenes are so cliche as to be meaningless this is not the same the only similarity is the name save the 2 hours and watch star trek reruns youll have more fun,reality
the title says it all i dont know where all those high ratings are coming from,reality
i came to this movie with such high expectation the movie failed me at multiple levels a the plot is stupid they are running away and then they decide to go back to the exact same place they came from b the action is meaningless after so many bullets so many impractical weapons they couldnt stop a simple truck it was not a abram tank or t90 tank c characters are flawed cant feel the emotion for example when they realize there is not green place there is no emotion no maturity no intelligence also the women gang when they die there is no strategy in their attack i was expecting them to be wise women who would really do serious damage but they all died so easily,reality
i went to the movie with some friends i had not seen any trailers och any reviews of this movie so i went in with no expectations and no knowledge of itand it completely blew me away this is one of the best movie experiences i ever had it was so good i will not be able to recreate it again with this movie you just had to be there at that moment,reality
is probably the greatest action movie i have seen until now its over the top action sequences beautiful camera work the setting the cars and the fire breathing guitar truly create a post apocalyptic world of humans reduced to savages george miller gives you no time to adjust or comprehend the world he has created the frames are hyperactive and the scenes are accelerated the dialogue is barely audible and youre left on edge 10 minutes into the movie and it doesnt slow down from there the lighting and colors give this movie a different more exotic feel than other post apocalyptic or action movies some of the action sequences were over the top but others were very intelligently made the performances by tom hardy and charlize theron gave the film even more drive the movie never sidetracks or brings anything that isnt essential to the full on action film that it is i dont believe this film alone not including the prequels was meant to introduce 3d characters with depth or have a philosophy behind it but it does demonstrate through its madness and chaos that humans most basic instinct survival creates this chaos and in that chaos eventually comes some form of civilization i also couldnt help but relate the people in world to the ones in ours i found many similarities the core instincts of greed power need survival faith loyalty theyre all there theyve always been there the only difference is in the manifestation the more the world progresses the more complicated is the manifestation of these instincts and emotions but again this movie was probably not meant to demonstrate these things but that just adds to my point,reality
having not seen any of the previous movies the beginning of this film certainly confuses scares and freaks you out at first which i guess is what the directors were trying to achieve and achieve they did however after the first 10 minutes when youve seen all the scenes and characters you get used to it the special effects were certainly good and the plot was an interesting though rather dramatic one again having not seen any of the other series my outlook on the movie may not be accurate but as a stand alone movie and having gotten so much buzz including an oscar nomination i was expecting a wow movie unfortunately the acting of some of the main characters mainly those breeder girls was very poor and dragged the movie a bit also the random love affair between nux and the red haired girl was pretty clich which spoiled the movies realism there were some plot parts which just seemed to be added on for no proper reason but that may just be me having not been a part of the series all in all a great movie with great themes and effects though some acting which could have been improved,reality
this gets an a from me i am surprised at how much i like it fury road is definitely a fitting title most of the film takes place in a desert it is very atmospheric generally i am not interested in action films i find a lot of it boring this is the first time i have ever watched a film although the action starts right away it took a while for the film to pull me in it isnt mindless action but sometimes it was hard to tell what was happening it felt like it took a while for the story to formulate it is frenetic but not in the familiar shaky camera kind of way the effective dramatic scenes gives it a right amount of balance in the proceedings without being cheesy by the end i was intrigued by the whole thing then the more i thought about it the more i appreciate the scope of itin addition tom hardy isnt bad to look at,reality
i just want to know if this movie was influenced by alejandro jodorowskys el topo desert settings in jodorowskys case mexico apocalyptic themes arty cinematography and even the use of actors who are missing limbs have other disabilities possibly blindness etc see also holy mountain and his longsought version of dune jodorowsky was interested in aleister crowley i am not going to summarize watch el topo and then go back to i did find rather longish it also predicts the superliteral monster trucks movie now in theatres some people find the trucks the most imaginative thing in ,reality
i have always found the films and their ilk for all their sound and fury action to be boring this is because the stories are set in a world where no one who lives there would actually want to go on living a good story needs a certain amount of raison dtre for it to be worth watching until the end if i ever found myself living in such a world i would not care to go on living in it just kill me and get it over withthis is the main problem with these films i think it takes a certain level of emotional sickness to find such a world entertaining this one unlike the original mel gibson films really minimizes the backstory of tragic origins and it also minimizes his altruism we are left with pure survival for survivals sake but in a world without joy or even any reasonable prospect of longevity for ones self or ones children whats the pointperhaps the sick minds behind such films see the present world in the same terms i feel truly sorry for such an outlook but i cannot identify with it as bad as the present world is it still presents us with the simple joys and beauties of gods intended creation as well as a reasonable expectation of happiness which is the basis for most modern constitutionsthis film is finely made and acted so i give it a 6 too bad its lack of hope makes the story of no real interest everyone in it should just give up and die perhaps the only hope would be that the wise creator would just obliterate it forget about it and start over from scratch,reality
i never liked the original movies which is why i put off watching fury road i finally got around to seeing it and although better than the mel gibson films i still didnt like it very much i can see why this would appeal to people  the action sequences are spectacular and the special affects are top notch but thats just not enough for me is a plot too much to ask i found the constant action irritating and was relieved when there was a rare gap in the ensuing pandemonium  another irritation is tom hardy he seems to be reviving his rile as bane  dark knight rises by mumbling his lines sadly it has been announced that there will be another film in a couple of years time i hope im more successful in avoiding that one as i was with this,reality
i really hate this speed and heavy metal music during all what was there in this movie costumes and scenes were fine but where the hell was director who wanted to kiss everybody in the ass but instead he kicked them in the head love and new life were inserted in this movie like bad joke to a good party everybody who loves action movies will certainly agree that this was enough for 30 minutes short story not a full length movie buggy cars and trucks were to detailed designed so you can see all those pieces to be blown apart on last stage of their agonal life aggressive style and unprecedented hypocrisy was enough for me to leave this movie behind and never come back,reality
a high octane pedal to the metal adrenaline rush fury road is a nonstop demolition derby of an action movie the film is stunning to look at and has some of the best choreographed action sequences ever filmed but the film is not only a feast for your eyes and ears it also has narrative heft and two terrific performances by tom hardy and especially charlize theron therons furiosa joins ellen ripley and sarah connor as one of the great female action heroines of alltime you are not going to find a more heartpounding better looking or acted action picture,reality
this is not sexism but only a joke in response to the radical feminism that seemed to be fueling every major franchise reboot today with the exception of rockylets start positively fury road provides the most spectacular chases of all the tetralogy but the film is only the general with bigger stunts though what made buster keatons film appreciable is that he risked his neck and i still have a fondness for road warrior overthetop cliand the plane train and automobiles sequence concluding thunderdome speaking of which were talking of a 30year time span between the last movies and that he could pull effect both practical and effective to an audience raised by the digital revolution is perhaps the best stunt of all now forgive my sophism but it takes more than action to make action movies work and fury road was so stuck to the steering wheel it took its driver for grantedthe first might be the slowest or the least thrilling of the four but thats how we were introduced to rockatansky his skills his humility his tormenting hesitation between settling down and sticking with the family or hitting the road to fight the filth of the earth the whole exposition culminated with the tragic loss of his wife and baby child in the next films had won its status as a popculture hero he resented that word but that was part of his persona fury road doesnt embarrass itself with such technicalities if makes furiosa an immediate heroine a joan of arc without any characters arcthe character had potential but she was as semideveloped character as as if we had met sarah connor in terminator 2 or ellen ripley in aliens these heroines were fascinating not only for their backstory as nonwarrior characters but for the fact that they werent handled like flashbacks but as true plot drivers furiosa is strong and badass already and god forbids mel gibson would be an aging playing her mentor too controversial or for her to show any semblance of vulnerability too tabooand as the emotionless shavedheaded heroine  la joan of arc indeed she displays traits that play like ersatz of masculinity clich even by guymovies standard tough hardly talking always right furiosa doesnt even shed a tear when one of the breeders die or when she discovers the sad truth about the green place i simply dont get what is so appealing in overly confident characters think of many icons michael corleone didnt want to be a mobster travis bickle started as mr nice guy rocky was a bum characters who are perfect from the start might kick ass but theyre ultimately boring and a 120format with 10 minutes for dialogues made of 90 of grunting doesnt helpstill one can appreciate the postapocalyptic elements violence regression the rarefaction of oil and water but the first films covered all these speculative aspects fury road just takes one step forward after settlers vs gangs then marauders vs migrants then new glimpses of civilization its fair to imagine a neofascist world ruled by men and relegating women to their primitive functions breeding and nurturing theres something visionary in the way the film switches from the usual horizontal struggle nomads vs settlers to vertical domination but it also implies that in order to survive women must display the same skills as men elevating driving and fighting as darwinian assetsthe film suggest matriarchy and selfdetermination as salutary options after all the plot is about selected women being freed by one of them so basically the alternative from being locked away by men is to be their own master the problem is that unlike the previous films where children were present among settlers fury road is rather pessimistic implying that couples wont exist and since the feminist take doesnt disregard the necessity to have children for the survival of mankind one must consider how they will have them if not by exploiting or using men as well this feminism ironically depends on power perceptions inherited from men is it such a coincidence that all the fugitives are beautiful and the obese milk providers are left to their conditionthe film contains some epiclooking images and thrilling sequences but with a rather thin and manipulative plot served by very onedimensional characters and that goes for furiosa too she shares so many skills and personality traits with that i kept wondering what was role exactly except to be a foil for furiosa exactly what happened between han solo and rey when she told him she could handle herself and the film ends with the same acknowledgement from the original hero foreshadowed by the name of charlize theron put above tom hardy in the opening shotthis is not a hierarchy to trivialize once again we have a film where every man is flawed weak and ironically this is something i wont complain about because the war boys were touching in their twisted away and i liked immortan joe for even that scary dude had a weak spot but fury road works exactly like the force awakens the new ghostbusters movie toy story 4 or even blade runner 2049 it recycles plots with that radical antimale perspective its like the sole purpose of these reboots is to cure classics from misogyny they didnt havebecause even the first films had strong female characters the old lady in the first wife that he failed to save and tina turner who spares his life at the end of thunderdome another thing they had in common they were fun to watch i wish one character could make us smile or chuckle at least oncea product of its preachy and pedant era the film takes itself too seriously and this is why its my least favorite,reality
back when this film came out there seemed to be a big love affair with it the critics loved it and those who i talked to who saw it in the theatres loved it and said it was the best film yet i sort of couldnt believe it you mean its even better than the road warrior2 after my dad and i rented it and watched it we were both blown away and yes i must say that this film is the best in the series everything that was great about the road warrior is amped up even more in this entry and done even betterthis time tom hardy plays the title role in he does very well in the role and i have no complaints about him in the role just personally and this does not take anything anyway from this film he does not outdo mel gibson in the role i think i liked gibson more in the role but there is so much action and other characters that you should enjoy that mixed with the fact that he more than fills the role i never really compared the two during my two viewings of this filmwithin the timeline i think this is supposed to happen before the road warrior anyways there is action right from the start and it does not let up the beautiful and ever so talented charlize theron plays imperator furiosa and she has been given the task of driving gasoline for the bad guys but she has thwarted their plans and is on the run from themalong with the wives of the main baddie immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne who returns but dont really now it is him under the mask he wears more than enough story to mesh with the truly spectacular actionthis film also has some great modern music from tom holkenborg or junkie xl that really goes well with what george miller is putting on the screen really it is just a giant chase that in the end shows that miller has out done himself incredibly and if you enjoyed most importantly the road warrior2 you must watch this film written by miller brendan mccarthy and nico lathouris,reality
fury road is an overload of an overload of extravagant action set pieces metal soundtrack and postapocalyptic setting it relishes in all its glorious action but isnt enough to carry the film on an emotional leveldriven by characters who battles for survival in a barren and waterless world fury road touches upon themes of loss higher purpose tyranny and surprisingly feminist message tom hardy playing the titular character is haunted by the loss of someone who constantly appears in his imagination driven by guilt and or sadness he seeks survival as the tyrannical cult regime of immortan joe forces the people around him to beg for water charlize theron stars as furiosa the leader of an escaped group of females who seek the green place nicholas hoult plays nux a fanatic member of immortan joe who would die willingly for his cause the characters are driven by their respective motives each being revealed as the film progresses however there is too much action for the drama and character interactions to settle and majority of the best emotional moments are placed near the end leaving the rest of the film lacking much in substance7510,reality
fury roadmiller has taken things too far even for this franchise are we supposed to chug it all up as much as passionate and meticulously driven this post apocalyptic world is i would like to think that the genre scifi which so it blatantly claims to be is either misinterpreted or taken for granted in here this film is far from being thought provoking this raw ruffian ideology that george miller the writerdirector thrives upon is more admirable than overwhelming his utter fierceful confident in his vision is frankly dangerous to pull off such a heist if i could call it at this scale is purely inspirationalit is so bizarrely grand that the narration or characters or even the cinema itself gets lost into the dust aforementioned it can be difficult for some viewers to swallow in this whole tale swirling around in a pathos unapologetic world there is barely any host for us to root for and this very three dimensional take is what helps the cast to portray a fluid creamy persona in this bumpy road charlize theron as the most lethal and convincing among all is more than a match for tom hardys one instinctish iconic character in fact if anything hardy has to try hard even snatch a gun in order to helm charge on her a fatal attempt as theron refuses to share the steely cold looks with anyone on screen another fascinating factor is the supporting characters and how invested they are in telling this story crossing boundaries and showcasing a feat of bravery and commitment this ensemble of cast defines the term teamwork to a whole new level fury road iterates the theme of the world in its long action sequences a game of chess not the sacrifice or the head scratching tricks of it but a succession of winning attempts,reality
everything about the film is perfect except the meaning at the end the film doesnt give us a message,reality
2 april 2017 this oddly puts definitely in second place as tom hardy takes over for mel gibson hardys character seems to suffer from post traumatic stress disorder with strange flashbacks that are never explained and never support the movie rather they just distract from the storyline instead charlize theron in the role of an imperator whatever that is has the lead position and perhaps the only reason the movie wasnt titled imperator was because to make money under the brand no wonder is likely really through out the moviewhat this new version and reimagined movie has going for it is its dazzling visual effects along with great new look of the various action sequences the hyperspace of the photography sped up though seems more like one of number of gimmicks used in the movie instead is all flash with very little in the way of emotional substance with a thin storyline and not much in the way of character development what redeems this movie in part are the few scenes were there really is an emotional connection between characters and there are a few except for the requisite kill offs of a few prominent but secondary good charactersfor those who love video games this movie is for them but for the rest of the audience who look for something in the way intelligence and meaningful plot well just be like is,reality
i didnt even have time to poke holes in the storyline or characters very entertaining lots of action good good,reality
great writing 4 didnt like the backtracking but it was greatsuperb production 5 sound visuals and design are all amazing,reality
so much action so much excitement all thrills awesome ride of cat n mouse,reality
so dont put yourself in that position to earth dwellers with the sustainable arrangements of solar and reform in mind and heart because our direction is towards the opposite sex,reality
fury road is confusing its unsettling and its absolutely entertaining even though this is a sequel george miller has given us the most unique film of 2015 it really is like nothing youve seen before plus this movie is filled to the brim with impressive practical effects and remarkable stunt work this is an adrenalinefueled ride through the mind of a crazy person and i was happy to be a passenger,reality
from the very beginning till the endthere is always action plus tension through outmiller boy  greatest director we goti can say he delivered splendidly,reality
fully loaded with action sequences beautifully shoot great acting and great plot the one that we already knew didnt think they could make a remake this good but they achieved itits good in any way that i can think of the only thing that doesnt quite keep the good job is that the plot is more around furiosa than it is on but hey i cant lower my rating because of thatenjoyable for the whole family,reality
its incredible how the director packed so much details in his shots every scene is like a feast for the eyes the story itself was tbh a little blad for my taste even sometimes a bit feminist but boy did it look good what a ride,reality
so ive assessed this as a standalone film i just loved it the action sequences were amazing its an adrenaline rush from start to finish the cinematography and cgi where it was used was amazing visually and aurally a great film,reality
brutal over the top rediculous 2hour ride of v8 action,reality
the vision of this postapocalyptic setting is very detailed and feels authentic with a range of disfigured characters beautiful maidens and a world that looks and feels as though it has died the music is great and well used adding a bit of tongueincheek to the proceedings although there isnt much to the plot and the dialogue is minimal this adds to the strong atmosphere everything is just a little bit it also does become a bit repetitive and it lacks some of the impact of the original film but still a thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining film,reality
this film had great production values george miller directed the cast well in what little dialogue there was the story was simple and the car chases and costumes were essentially the bulk of appeal here,reality
loved it  the costumes performances and car chases were action packed and exciting to watch the story was simple to follow  a good film to veg out to,reality
the story may not be the deepest but there is constant adrenalinedriven fun in a dystopian world with fast cars outfitted with spikes the costumes and set designs were amazing never a dull moment,reality
i love love this movie u just wised it was longer and had more body,reality
dont expect anything too deep here its a great fun watch but you watch it for the action special effects and sexy ladies the actual storyline is fairly basic and the dialogue isnt much to rave about im glad they made this after so many years in any case,reality
interests in every momentwhat do you need more to enjoy a movies every second from first to last,reality
i liked this movie but at the beginning of it it didnt seem very well so my only problem with it that it was boring at the beginning but i really loved it and ill watching again and again and againcause it really was good the characters was amazing story was good cgi great,reality
i remember watching this in the cinema for the first hour or so i just sat in bewilderment at what i was seeing on the screen i wasnt sure if it was good or crazy or both halfway through i just accepted the film for what it was and let it continue to take me on a nail biting crazy ridethis film takes the previous films and cranks it up to 11 importantly though i feel that miller didnt just do this to get bums on seats he did it because this is the natural progression for the series this is what happens when people have lived without civilization for so longid love to see where the franchise takes us next it would be a travesty if miller was unable to make any more films,reality
cant believe it  just when you though hollywood was out of ideas millers masterful reworking of the original premise is a masterstroke of ironic surrealism the acting is solid and complete lack of story and character development just could not be better i will be forever in debt to the deftness with which millers addition to the corpus honors every aspect of the satire genre  completely coloring within the lines of vapid meme rehash endless regurgitation of thematic tropes to cue audience to his earlier work while at the same time cheapening and satirizing the arc to a degree to which pales in comparison to lucass utter destruction and posthumous capitalistic disney rape of the the past two installments of the star wars franchisejust stunning,reality
tom hardy takes over the role made famous by mel gibson in this fourth film in the series the plot has reluctantly team up with a renegade female trucker transporting the abused pregnant wives of a tyrant to safety distrust turns to mutual respect as the pair fend off attacks from the tyrants underlings right from the opening monologue fury road feels like a decidedly different film add in cutaways to memories of a young girl and the action hero is more conflicted and haunted here than ever before the film additionally does something different by giving charlize theron much screen time as the gutsy trucker with her own insecurities as she searches for her hometown as a safe place for the wives these two angles do not mesh all that well together with oddly relegated to a supporting character despite a deeper than ever glimpse into his psyche the limited exposition also leaves open unanswered questions regarding blood transfusions whether fertility is an issue and what everyones obsession is with painting their teeth some elements a rock guitarist strapped to the front of one truck also come off as simply weird for the sake of it and yet if never entirely successful there remains something to like in george miller taking the material in new directions rather than just recycling what has been done before,reality
to escape the dungeon of a tyrant a guntoting loner teams up with a rebellious princess in her flight to paradise pursued by thousands of mutant baxtards115 minutes of car chase with a brief interlude to reflect at the start of act three the pace is amazing the locations spectacular as the hunt whizzes along  assault vehicles that look like prickly dinosaurs wan warboys celebrating their jihadi death wish and bizarro guitaro licks from a ships figureheadthe first part of the chase is like an old sea battle as the tanker galleon heaves across the desert ocean under heavy sniping fire the second part is more like an aerial dogfight with polefighters raining bombs from the airfor all the fury there is an attempt to set up different zones different civilisations as in any epic quest  but it doesnt work simply not enough care in the plotting and characterisation although there is a degree of development the actors are ok but they cant deliver much to care about and the interlude where the action gives way to motivation is very poor in the end even the locations turn out monotonous and a scene where the green place comes into view is far too brief and i think misplaced and all the time i was thinking about one of the anchors of the plot  the water supply  that doesnt make sense in its steampunk setting also the epilogue is disgustingly reactionary  reminds me of pans labyrinthmusic is hectic nothing specialoverall pacy and bland definitely not worth the oscar hypeps i guess all that milk should turn into human cheese weird but tasty and nutritious,reality
i watched the first three parts really banging framework felt only on the first im not going to last i would say that this part of the course with an interesting world and charismatic effects that infuriates me she does not have my style it does not feel like it was in the first the first was tedious but it was an innovation it brings amazing from the first view inexplicable world and this  predictable and tightens its effects and beauties of computer processing the script is also interesting but the superhero template which comes from all the movies about the characters created it eclipsed in general nothing spectacular  people i certainly understand im too critical  but excuse me these films filled film distribution  you do not feel sorry for money for a smartphone in another shell the film bears no moral component i mean from our lives and our universe  it is useless to society only continuous boom damn shit  from the film can be taken only visual experience its good but what the hell he must have a good grade its not worth it,reality
i loved this film i give fury road a solid 810but i want to play a little game with you also my vote of 110 is not going to affect the ratings dont worryi want to tell you that which i did not like of this film1 while this is a film in the milieu it is not a film about as the first 3 were is not even a main character nux is much more of a lead than is and has so little dialogue they could have made him mute for all it matters2 they changed the character of despite his moniker is quite sane and nice he would not be so aggressive towards the wives also pretty much everything does is somewhat out of character3 character changes without any development when he decides to charge back to the citadel character arc is complete without any motivation as to the change to me these 3 sins are very bad however i got to say the writing is exceptionally good verging on the scientifically realistic i wouldnt vote this as best film of the year but i do recommend it if you want to see something really really different than what hollywood normally does810  should be called furiosas road and drop name,reality
i grew a huge fan of the original trilogy ive seen road warrior too many times to count when i heard that a new movie was being made i was thrilled that it took so many years to make only built on the anticipation of finally seeing this the trailer was incredible the reviews came out calling this a breathtaking mindblowing 2 hour thrill ride i bought my ticket for the 7pm screening and sat downan hour into the movie i checked my watch to see the time that is never a good sign as a pure stand alone action movie it succeeds the stunts were spectacular without giving away spoilers the new ideas miller introduces to a chase scene were great to see i read that there was very little cgi used i got that for the most part even though there are some scenes where it looks wildly out of place the cinematography is fantastic the cars they built to eventually destroy are great to look at charlize theron does well as essentially the lead character but thats where the positives end for mefor me what separated the franchise from the rest of the flock is the story it succeeds by combining great action with a simple yet good plot blowing up cars and chasing people only impresses to a point if youre not invested in the story and dont care about the characters i didnt care whether any of them lived or diedi get that is not supposed to say much but they went too far really not giving him anything to work with so in the end the movie amounted to bad guys chasing good guys in 1 direction then bad guys chasing good guys in the reverse direction thats it,reality
fury road is one of the best action films ive seen in a long long time george miller is back with after beyond the thunder dome which was 30 years ago directors who usually return to a franchise who started it dont end up really good some examples are george lucas for star wars the phantom menace or steven spielberg for indiana jones 4 but george miller proves that he can bring a franchise back to life this is probably one of the best action films of the summer so far tom hardy as did a fine job but charlize theron as furiosa is amazing her character kicked some major ass the story was also great and it was very simple its just getting from point a to point b the action was amazing and there wasnt any of that shaky cam george millers direction is amazing because he uses some wide shots which looks amazing the movie is also very intense i also felt hot while i was watching this movie because it takes place in a desert like area i really loved how much of the action was done practical because today action films do cgi for tough shots but in this film it was all done with practical effects which made it feel real this film isnt for everyone the film is very weird and crazy which most people cant take if your a fan youll enjoy the hell out of this film fury road is one of the best films this summer and one of my favorite films this year i really hope we get to see more films in the next couple years because this film deserves all the money it needs and sequels it needs i would say that fury road is considered a action masterpiece,reality
first of all i cant understand why some people walked out of the theater some of them after 90 minutes some other are saying that its only action with no storyline and therefor hated it others are saying that the trailer seemed like a very different thing and much better than the movie this doesnt make any sense at all if you saw the other movies you should know what to expect if you saw the trailer the deduction is the same and if you appreciate solid movies with great storyline you probably should watch drama and not action you go to see a movie with this name you saw the trailer you probably watched or at least have read something about the previous movies and still you wanted to see a movie with a great storylinesomething is escaping mewhatever well i loved itthe action is great the sound superb the scenarios and color wonderful and all the actors delivered oh and if you could wait 1 hour and a half to walk out you probably could wait another half hour and see it through the end thats just my opinion,reality
fury road is an exciting movie but for longtime fans of the series this latest effort is simply the last twenty minutes of the road warrior expanded into a twohour time frame and the number of bad guys increased by a factor of ten and is not even the main character it should have been titled furiosa fury road worth seeing once but not a classic like the road warrior charlize theron does a credible job but tom hardy is very disappointing as this is probably not his fault hardy is a decent actor but does not have the imposing and threatening presence of mel gibson george miller and the other writers havent written enough of the character into this script,reality
music score was fantastic you dont really have to have had to see the previous sequels of excellent as one of my mates says you werent short of action plot was not as clear but from what i could get was furiosatheron was asked by immortankeaysbyrne to deliver or collect cant recall she instead went off course to east where hardy comes in i dont understand i take it was captured and he escaped but was recaptured so while immortals men were after furiosa nuxhoult said hed keep blood something like that one thing i never understood was why was getting vision of a young girl etc etc,reality
i dont think i can come up with any original praises for fury road people have complimented it far better than i ever could so my short review of the restart of the series that begun in the already distant late 1970s is that i liked it more than i have liked any action movie in a long while george miller has managed to create a movie that manages to grab you from the first minute and doesnt let you go until the end credits start to rollnow for a bit different view i saw the movie with my older brother who said that while he liked the movie he also thought it wasnt as good as people have made it to be as he put it he was glad that he saw it but he wasnt in a hurry to see it againwhat is undeniable though is the amount of insanity miller has managed to bring to the screen this time played by tom hardy is more feral as a character than he was when mel gibso was playing him is also not the only competent road warrior as furiosa brillianty bad ass charlize theron makes the life more than enough difficult for the villain immortan joe hugh keaysbyrnethe world of has gone even more insane in this new installment every scene is filled with oddity and madness immortan joe rules with an iron fist and water but has also surrounded himself with his slowly mutating children and insane troops of drugs sniffing war boys furiosa steals something of his the wives and breeding stock of joe and this starts the relentless feverish chase across the desert sands the plot is simple and people dont talk much thins are explained with few words that dont always even end up being sentences but the looks and the expressions of the characters are more than telling the main driver is the visual storytelling that movies can be at their best and in this miller has managed to create a modern master piecefury road is an action movie that shows modern action directors how action should be done action is clear and easy to follow yet it makes you grab you hand rests the settings despite their wasteland bleakness are stunning and instead of over use of cgi most of the daring stunts have been done with practical effectsi cant promise that mmfr is a movie for everyone no matter how much it has been praised doesnt automatically mean that it is a movie that everyone would like but at the same time i do recommend to give it a try as even if you dont end up loving it you may end up liking it,reality
wow what i have just seen there must be another word for a blockbuster because this movie is beyond that visuals so amazing every detail made to perfection soundtrack goes so well with this movie that it feels like a musical wow amazing george miller and the cast its the best action movie since the matrixgeorge millers fury road is nothing less than utterly astonishing from frame one miller paints the cinema screen with a gleefully vibrant vision of chaos and elemental fury every performance every shot every ingenious switchup of narrative it all comes back to george miller and his prophetic revitalization of cinema stupendous clarity and craft on display mainly because fury road showcases a sense of confidence that hasnt been seen in cinema in a very long timethis isnt your ordinary postapocalypse film in terms of the look and that essential difference comes down to one word color whether its the powdery flares the shimmering stars or the dusty deserts seale demonstrates a masterful eye for dynamic images and their relation with one another the editing is absolutely wonderful in terms of pacing and the flow of the connections between shotsall of these fantastic forces combine their talents to support george millers vision george millers latest is a supreme force of cinema combining every individual aspect each of exemplary quality into something of a rampaging behemoth of destruction and lunacy its the best feature length film of the year the finest summer blockbuster in decades and an instant alltime favorite put the petal to the medal race to your nearest multiplex and join me in valhalla again and again and again,reality
fury road is directed by george miller starring tom hardy charlize theron and nicholas hoult and is a continuation to the series making this the 4th film ladies gentlemen fury road was mindblowing i havent seen such amazing action sequences in a movie since movies like the indiana jones trilogy aliens die hard terminator 1 and 2 kill bill vol1 and 2 and the matrix this movies action is unbelievably revolutionary and original that it will make you so pumped to see the movie again and again now what makes this movie feel so unique and so action packed is its beautiful shots and smooth paced action shots the big plus is that most of the action in this film is made by practical effects lately we have been watching lots of movies with unbelievable amounts of cgi which is not a bad thing in some ways i enjoy cgi once and a while it can sometimes be amazing and sometimes terrible i recently saw avengers 2 which was full of cgi and i hugely enjoyed the film but the practical effects in this film were by far better than any of the cgi effects ever released out in the cinematic universe characters  tom hardy plays who is a man mentally troubled by his past trying to find a path of hope through a futuristic post apocalyptic deserted world tom hardy as i felt was a really good cast especially since hardy has been doing hugely well in his career i didnt though feel like his character wasnt too impressive but he still did a great job as charlize theron plays furiosa a women who is trying to escape with a special group of i wont spoil what cargo she was a really badass character in this films and was a surprising addition to the universe nicholas hoult plays nux who was honestly my favorite character in the film because i found him the most relatable too nux is a member of immortan joes settlement known as the citadel but later tries to ally himself with and furiosa nux is corrected man who believes that he is destined for something great i felt nux was the most emotionally touching character that you can truly care for hugh keaysbyrne plays immortan joe who is the main villain who i felt was a pretty badass villain in the film he wasnt anything real special to the film but i think he is a terrific addition to the seriesplot  the plot is overall pretty simple furiosa is trying to get away from the settlement the citadel with a special cargo when she later runs into who doesnt know whether to ally with her or not while this occurs warriors from the citadel chase down furiosa throughout a straight through action packed consistent film this movie is straight forward action theres not a ton of dialogue but it works and leaves the audience drooling with ahhhscoresoundtrack  im not really big on listening to a musical score in a film but in this film the score is so pumping and exhilarating you cant help but notice it like in indiana jones there is consistent music that just pumps you up and makes you really really excited this film had that kind of score that can greatly improve your enjoyment for the filmaction sequencesspecial effects  the action and effects in this film is what makes fury road fury road the action in this film is so well directed with smooth and beautifully paced camerawork amazing stunt work that just cant make you not geek up and get excited there was a man with a electric guitar that shot out huge flames playing on a truck with huge surround sound tell me thats not awesome the practical effects in the film made me so amazed every shot you saw in this film could be a humongous poster that you can put on the movie theater walls every shot you see you can look at with wow because its so beautiful and awesome theres this one shot in particular that shows most of the vehicles lined up with a very mixed color sky background that was probably the most enjoyable landscape shot i have ever scene in a film i am going to see this film in theaters so many more times just to see the action in this filmpros great casting fabulous action unlike anything amazing effects great casting motivating original score beautiful landscape shots interesting narration very unique to many action films of todaycons i couldnt find anyguys if you miss fury road you will be missing out on the 2015 ride that you need for this year it is by far the best film in over a decade and by far the best film so far and i will be quite surprised if this film beats any of my top films for 2015 fury road gets a a 1010,reality
if an earthquake starts to shake your home whats the first thing to come to your mind survival should your car break down in the middle of the desert and you have no phone to call for help what comes as the first instinct survival i may be placing a lot of emphasis on the word survival but we take for granted how much it takes just to survive we hear stories of starving children that are teetering on the brink of death yet they manage to survive for at least another day what makes us want to survive protectionso what is it were protecting whoever it is we want more then anything to see the new day no matter what people of think themselves no matter how much of an egotistical jerk they are there will always be someone that their going to put more importance on then their selves maybe their a child that might have a better chance then you had or maybe an older persons who holds an important bit of information thats needed for everyone elses survival when a major disaster strikes we drive ourselves to save everyone when the world has fallen apart like it has in fury road then everyone else matters more then youplayed by tom hardy is still drifting around the austrian outback dessert in the same post apocalyptic wasteland weve seen in the previous movies hes captured by an army of the infamous leader of a thriving city immortan joe played by hugh keays byrne where hes being held as a prisoner and a universal blood donor of one of joes sick henchmen nux played by nicholas hoult meanwhile a famous driver named furiosa played by charlize theron has been assigned to take a large vehicle to collect gas which is very hard to find in this worldin the middle of the escorted transportation furiosa makes a sharp left into the desert where its made clear that shes going rouge taking the rig along with the four wives of joe with her escaping their slavelike roles she manages to loose the rest of joes army in a sand storm all except for nux who still has with him taking plenty of clean blood from them escapes once they catch up with the rig and joins furiosa and the other women to get to safety in a rumored land of green where there is hope for the future of humanity it has been thirty years since the last movie and i wasnt sure what to expect as i wasnt sure if people were still hungry for the road warrior not only does director george miller prove he still loves this character but has pulled off one of the greatest action movies off all time watching fury road is like watching one continuous car chase that runs through out the majority of the movie you would think that would become boring after a while but miller kept its focus not on the action though its great but on its characterstom hardy does well as still making him likable even though he doesnt have much dialogue in the film but he does not need it the real stars here are charlize theron and the rest of the women its not just their characters personalities but how much they play a part in the story always helping out and working together to flee away from the men you could say that fury road may be one of the most feminist movies ever made yet the guys still work on an equal levelill give this five vehicles out of five get ready to ride into hell as we watch interesting characters drive through an interesting world the characters are great the story is great the design is great the car stunts are great it is truly a lovely day indeed,reality
i wouldnt usually watch films of this sort of genre im not always a fan of the image that they create and the in your face advertising which usually disappoint with it lives up to the reputation the whole world that is created in this film is marvellous real aesthetic is built up before the torrent of violence occurs while of course the film is never going to be heavily character based with complex layered story lines for what it is it is a widely enjoyable film the costume and design is very absorbing in itself with realistic props being created i do feel the film needed a little more dialogue the characters often became unrelatable or cared for due to the lack of development if something bad happened to certain characters often the feeling created was less than sympathetic overall however it remains a strong film with good aesthetics created and enough fast paced drama to ensure the film progressed at a good rate,reality
in a post apocalyptic world tom hardy helps imperator furiosa get 5 young women selected for breeding away from a brutal army one of many settlements following the overall collapse of civilisation although this is my first film that hasnt damaged my enjoyment of the film at all described as a 2 hour chase sequence that it is but its a lot more than that it may be a stunning sensationally made action film with more destructive force than an armoured tank blasting through a power station and boast dazzling stunts jaw dropping cinematography and break taking bone rattling visceral thrills but thankfully there is also a soul while the film is called fury road the film belongs to charlize theron her strong well rounded furiosa is the main character in many ways and the other female characters are strong as well tom hardy is typically excellent though fairly silent as while nicholas hoult puts in a gleefully nutty performance as a villain who the film also gives an interesting story arcon a visual level the film is impeccable and george miller thankfully doesnt resort to shaky cam the stunts are daring the stakes are high the explosions are beautiful and each set piece gets bigger and better than the last the tension continues building right until the end so in terms of thrills mmfr pulls out all the stops the film creates a compelling cinematic world with many fascinating details mind blowing production design and a glorious sense of insanity thanks to the films focus on character and story as well as action one becomes emotionally wrapped up in the storyline and occasionally the film is even genuinely moving for sure one to see on the big screen mmfr is a grand tapestry of explosions high octane thrills humanity and post apocalyptic heaven which doesnt waste a dollar of its 150 million budget lets hope george miller makes those 3 sequels tom hardy is signed on for as soon as possible itll be difficult to live up to this though1010,reality
this has got to be one of the best if not the very best movie of 2015 from the get go miller takes us on a rollercoaster ride of visual sound and gore that pays full compliments to the original trilogy and then some hardy is excellent in the role of if anything he should have been given a more prominent role with furiosa taking most of that glory but i can see why miller did it and when the going gets really tough its that comes and takes it to another level so it really bodes well for the next chapter on the series what really got me in this movie besides the stellar acting was the superb stunts and special effects that finally update the story and bring it fully to the 21st century but without overdoing it with cgi and all the better for it,reality
fury road is a movie that revolves around rockatanskytom hardy in the future humanity as we know it has ended in a desert landscape people are fighting over earths basic necessities a ruthless leader named immortan joehughkeays byrne has total control over the water of the desert now it is up to a rebel named imperator furiosacharlize theron with the help of to put an end to immortan joe  his dictatorial rule to bring back peace furiosa also wants to return to her childhood home fury road is one of the craziest films ive ever watched  im stating this as a compliment the action  special effects of the movie have been superbly crafted there is not a single dull moment in the film the constant car chases  brawls on top of these cars is the highlight of the film in fact you cant even call these vehicles cars they look monstrous  are fully battle ready  fit perfectly with the tone  theme of the film except for maybe 10 minutes of the film the action is nonstop  the i3d puts you right in the middle of the action  mayhem on screen the only flaw in the movie is the lack of character development i would have really liked it if  furiosa were given more detailed back stories we should have been given more insight into traumatic past better character development would have helped the viewers understand  sympathize more with all characters performance wise this film ticks all the right boxes tom hardy is excellent as rockatansky despite being given minimal dialog hardy makes the iconic role of his own charlize theron is outstanding as imperator furiosa theron portrays various emotions as the mysterious furiosa with panache nicholas hoult is great as nux hughkeays byrne is menacing as the antagonist immortan joe josh helman is good as slit nathan jones is effective as rictus erectus zoe kravitz rosie huntingtonwhiteley riley keough abbey lee  courtney eaton are brilliant as toast the knowing the splendid angharad capable the dag  cheedo the fragile respectively john howard is effective as the people eater the supporting characters are impressive as well fury road is one of the best action movies of all time a unique experience its a must watch especially on the big screen,reality
this is my first review of any movie on imdb but i can not stop myself writing something about this movie wow what a movie wow what an action simply amazing best action movie i have ever seen tom hardy is one of my favorite and he displayed why theron is excellent in every way and lives the character 100 the plot is very basic and simple and there is no need to watch previous movies 3d action effects are awesome and just doubled the entertainment no one will ever regret after watching movies like this i have seen all transformers marvel movies but i bet this alone movie can beat them in action and effects the locations and background music were great you should not miss this movie and most probably you will see it again,reality
my husband loves this type of movie so he talked me into attending not my favorite type i did not view the first however i liked the characters and development in this one  big fan of ms theron and in this movie she excelled big time i really liked all of the roles for the women after they busted out on their own for an adventure and a dreami left wondering if there will be a sequel i could not keep a body count but when main characters were injuredi worried the settings are amazing quite a contrast lots of spare auto parts out there in the desert lots of noise interesting conceptually,reality
every decade has its defining action movie the 1970s had the 1980s had terminator and die hard the 1990s had terminator 2 and golden eye the 2000s and 2010s have fury road i for one am not a fan of modern day action movies they are lazy cgi clusters that are just made to look good and they cant even do that right modern day directors simply dont understand how to make an action movie thankfully george miller hasnt forgotten millers remembers something that all others seem to have forgotten the fun aspect fury road is pure fun it doesnt let story of perfect development get in the way of that the story remains simple as it should be the other major problem with modern day action is the overuse of cgi fury road has an astounding lack of it the amount of practical effects in this movie is amazing the movie simply looks great if it had all been done with cgi this would have been much more disappointing i highly recommend fury road to all action movie fans out there as it is the best one in decades,reality
4 should be titled apologies for thunderdome while the third movie wasnt completely awful it diluted the power of the american titled road warrior or as we called it in england where i first saw it 2 by the time the third movie came along in 1985 i could actually see the damn film without somebody telling us it was a video nasty and something we shouldnt seefast forward 20 years to 2015 and a massive marketing campaign for fury road first thought  thank you george miller for this movie its as good as an apology for thunderdome as i could hope for do i like the movie as much as the pinnacle of the series road warrior i do not why isnt so much as imus as minimus to charlize therons imperator fursiosa shes the real hero of this movie plays a supporting role and you know maybe thats okfirst off despite being an action movie this is an adults movie it feels more like a 70s movie with adult themes reactions and action than every other action movie this year its a testament to this film that i watched every trailer before the movie minus the hopeful ant man and thought theres no way im watching that shy movie the best movie this year is it follows but guess what fury road is a solid 2 things i love the plot has no story arcs its like a japanese kurosawa movie and a bunch of ladies have to escape an evil daddy figure and thats it simple set up then  action what follows is all logical minus the way gets kicked up onto another vehicle to help save the day people die when you dont expect them too not because you want it or its appropriate just because s happens i loved the noncalculatedness of isnt the hero youve been looking for furiosa is the mission is righteous but geez this is an imagined and detailed world where barely anything makes sense my favorite thing was how a bad brainless goon becomes the ultimate selfsacrificing hero without it feeling forced thats good movie making in conclusion american audiences dont often see this kind of movie it doesnt follow format its exactly why avengers age of ultron failed joss whedon is super talented but he was contained by rules of his own making george miller has none he made a movie about a sometimes great sometimes victimized called who helps a truly heroic and hopeful being called furiosa make the world just a little less shitty for the authenticity and trueness of the story and acting i give this movie a high 810,reality
ive gotta say with dystopian futures having become so commonplace its really cool that a 35yearold franchise can come along and make it all feel fresh fury road deserves that honor and a sweeter breath of fresh air you can not ask a return to lean rrated action where practical effects rule the day its veins coursing with highoctane gasoline and attitude to spare hell balls might be more apt to describe it it unloads the thrills but sneaks in the human sadness unsuspectedreally this is just the kind of bigbudget summer action movie ive been asking for noisy and propulsive but not as a mere formality its manic wildly imaginative and   simply put this is one hell of a ride910,reality
the pitch of the film is not very complicated  a car chase in the desert the world in which george miller takes us is a hostile world a world that is no longer the world as we know it and the film may lack some elements staging the madness of this worlds individuals outside the action scenes  indeed although they are visually impressive we are finally getting rid of cgi for most of the film we can not prevent this tendency of fury road to repeat itself in identical sets we could almost be tempted to say that the film lacks madness  and finally it should be noted that is not the main character of this film  his character is always a witness of the scene in which he is located and indeed it is a bit all the approach taken in the film  the viewer is projected despite his will and his ideal in this world without landmarks without sufficient reason as is thus the vision of miller seems diminished since it never takes enough space in the narrative but the film remains a very decent  entertaining piece of work and deserves the praise it gets,reality
this is not a movie it is pure mindless action no plot no story no background we see only 10 sec of intro it has like 10 sentences bam into action i guess this is where cinema is shifting it is just a marketplace for high tech action scenes selling million dollars of explosions and stunts it started with god damn boring stupid superhero movies  the idea age is over and tech age has started i do enjoy action scenes but mindless action is just not doing it for me plus what was the deal with people walking on sticks in acidic lands do they burn or some sort of mutants are they it is just a action packed version of old movies,reality
fury road is one long hyperkinetic violent chase scene it has received overthetop reviews thats why i went to see it the reviews insisted that fury road is so good it transcends its genre teen boy action movie  video game i was hoping for something like 300 a violent action movie that is better than it needs to be in fact fury roads star tom hardy costarred with 300s star gerard butler but fury road really isnt any better than any other violent teen boy action movie  video game its not exceptionally smart or funny or cinematically aweinspiring theres no challenging thought or interesting history its just the same old same old manmade apocalypse humans in a devastated landscape evil men doing despicable things with lots and lots of chasing punching kicking ugliness and loudness after i walked out of this movie the world was an uglier place as i passed cars i saw the soupedup cars of fury road everything seemed menacing and everyone seemed to need a punch in the face i dont think its a good thing that movies peddle nihilism as a drug to teen boys fury road takes place in the future the landscape is desert an evil and very ugly ruler joe who wears a skull mask and a darth vaderstyle breathing apparatus hoards water joe uses the water to support his population of war boys barechested muscular men in white body paint joe also harvests breast milk from captive women and impregnates other captive women breeders with his offspring  future war boys some of his subjects make a break for it joe sends out his war boys to catch the escapees the escapees are trying to make it to the green land of many mothers the entire movie from start to finish is one long chase scene its so fast moving and stimulating that it actually gets boring you dont know or care about any of the characters none of the characters are particularly likable its so horrible  the quick scene of womens breast milk being harvested for example  that it becomes laughable its very loud and your ears ring after you leave the theater tom hardy as spends the first twenty minutes or so of the movie being bound and tortured pretty passive for the star of an action movie charlize theron carries the action and she is very good not bad for a 39 year old woman nicholas hoult is poignant as a war boy who undergoes the closest thing the movie has to character development my favorite scene in the movie lasted about thirty seconds tom hardy says my name is its a tiny oasis in a desert of violent chase scenes men are bad and destroy and exploit women are good and nurture i suspect that this aspect of the film will arouse controversy the future is full of white people in the large cast only zoe kravitz who is half jewish and half black is a bit darker skinned this aspect of the movie will also arouse protest the future may be a dystopic noexit hellhole but black people should be allowed to suffer in it as much as whites the war boys are eager to die for their malicious leader joe joe promises them that when they die they will go to valhalla i wondered if this might not be an allusion to suicide bombers dying with promises of 72 virgins on their minds,reality

i think the actions was okay and the setting was put together well but my biggest problem was the lack of a solid theme there are environmentalist messages feminist messages politicalgovernment messages and more just littering the film any one of which if focused on singularly would make a solid and engaging story unfortunately this jumbledup mess of themes makes the film a jack of all trades and a master of none,reality

fury road has been overly hyped throughout years since its released in 2015 for the most part the hype and overly success from the box office and critical acclaim is warranted within the film these are stories that comprise larger legends avatars emerging from the mists of history now and again and changing everything in fury road he takes a minute to tell furiosa his this is not even mentioning or that the allies furiosa and the brides encounter who propel the third act are old women armed with army rifles and bags of seeds that says pointing at a naked woman suspended in an open enclosure up in the air weeping for help is bait he gets it women are not kittens stuck in trees the overall action and stunts is what makes fury road a unique and one of a kind film there isnt much though many long car chasesas a rewatch 080617 fury road remains one of the greater action films of this decade this film feels better and more entertaining on a second watch truly one of the rare films in hollywood today it delivers on what it was meant to and that is entertainment value incredible stuns and visuals and great performances by the leads,reality

fury road is a film that can be read in many ways all of which are valid the one that was the basis for its 6 oscar wins is that of a female empowerment tale i am writing this review viewing it a dystopia adventuretom hardy fill the shoes of mel gibson and brings his own take on the role he plays the role in a manner that will remind you of clint eastwoods man with no name who when the time comes decides to make a difference this comes in helping to dispose a despot this results in perhaps the most eye popping scene to hit cinema screens in years as pumped up cars trucks and other forms of transport crash into each other in a frenzied chase that forms the cliof the filmperhaps i view fury road in its most simple state but for me is still one of the best films i have seen in recent years,reality
despite a great cast and top acting here the vast majority of the credit goes to a monumental direction when i started watching this masterpiece i had no idea what i was in for as i always religiously do with any movie before pressing play on my dvd player i had avoided to read any review on the movie other peoples opinions are often influenced by those peoples expectations and in turn risk to influence my expectations and my judgment besides all the experts opinions and seasoned critics views what after all matters the most to me is the answer to did you like the movie i did very much so i vaguely recalled the original but after watching this 4k uhd movie all my memories seem like an old fading polaroid picture spectacular action sequences amazing special effects a futuristic medieval background and an out of this world somewhat turneresque photography left me begging for more fury road a visual feast strangely romantic and brightly dark thanks george for the ride,reality
slow uneventful boring and subtle these are some of the words youd never hear from any sane person describing 4 before i dig deeper i should probably let you know that im a twenty yearold man who only recently watched the original trilogy so i dont have any nostalgia attached to them the first film is genuinely considered mediocre by most people apart from proud aussies and my opinion was pretty much the same it didnt leave a particularly lasting impressionthe road warrior however is generally considered as one of the greatest action movies of all time i was expecting a fullon action fest much like fury road but unfortunately what i got was a ponderous seventy minutes involving titting about with a colony of people protecting fuel before ending with a spectacular car chase i was quite disappointed and can name several older action films that are far better than the road warrior terminator 2 and hard boiled to name two beyond thunderdome is generally considered as the worst of the lot but to my pleasant surprise i actually enjoyed this the most out of the trilogy it might have something to do with me being a massive tina turner fan but i thought there was more action and better characters than the other two filmsafter being largely underwhelmed by the trilogy i had my expectations for fury road lowered pretty much every review ive read has been astonishingly glowing with many hailing it as one of the best action films of all time but didnt they say that about the road warrior fury road is directed by the same george miller a man now in his seventies who hasnt directed an action film since beyond thunderdome and whose recent credits include happy feet and babe pig in the city 4 is bound to be pretty weak right wrongbelieve the hype fury road is an incredible feat i have no idea how george miller managed to pull out something so utterly spectacular out of his bag fury road is the best action film ive seen since the raid and has some of the best stunt work since the dark knight rises in my opinion it leaves the original trilogy lying face down in the dust fury road is the great big throbbing war machine whilst the original trilogy is some old rusty bicycle the first ten minutes of fury road is far better than anything from 13 and the entire two hour film definitely contains far more action than the first three films put together fury road is amazingit opens with an epic monologue from our new tom hardy mel gibson never did anything for me as in fact the character of never did much for me i much prefer tom hardy as his accent may be as muddled as stus tan in mrs doubtfire but i think he has much more of a presence than mel gibson ever did his famous interceptor is destroyed within the first five minutes which is obviously symbolic just like james bond getting shot in the opening of skyfall and a tv exploding in the opening of twin peaks fire walk with me the interceptor getting totalled represents a new era of george miller has completely cut the ties from the original films and quite rightly so we get thrown into a huge world and feel fully immersed the imagery is huge and epic it feels like something from lord of the rings with some powerful masked weirdo sitting on a giant cliff and spilling gallons of water to his loyal palepainted followers the villain in fury road is basically aunty entity on acid and curiously similar to tom hardys very own bane hes a brilliantly memorable villain who has his very own breast milk farm and an army of seriously sexy wivesit occurred to me about three quarters of a way through the film that i actually cared about the characters on the screen which ive never felt before during a film apart from tina of course the action still comes first but theres still some character development to keep you interested in the thin plot some have complained that charlize therons furiosa character takes over from but that didnt bother me at all i love strong female characters and furiosa is definitely that i cared about the clan of oddballs and their goal enough anyway to make me care about who is in the actiontalking of action fury roads action sequences are every bit as amazing as youve heard its a total intense onslaught of revving action from start to finish within the first thirty minutes were plunged into a fiery sandstorm with a furious army of vehicles in hot pursuit i sat there completely mesmerised by what i was watching theres a jarring moment shortly afterwards where slowly awakes from a pile of sand and the slowness of the scene is so bloody jarring ninety minutes of fury road is just pure fullthrottle action its amazingly executed with so little cgi and jawdropping stunt work the final chase sequence is completely exhaustingfury road is eye popping i felt like toe cutter before he collides into a lorry in 1 for most of it lets just hope that the sequel will be like the raid 2 it could easily get better by putting as much focus on character development and plot as well as the action the raid 2 did exactly that and produced one of the best films of the twenty first century as it stands though fury road is a gigantic towering achievement you can almost feel the testosterone sweating off the screen the fast and furious franchise can well and truly sod off,reality
moviegoers old enough to remember the 1980s may cherish memories of those gonzo postapocalyptic bmovies where humans struggled to survive in either an urban or desert wasteland against gloomy odds those lowbudget rrated schlock sagas with gladiatorial looking psychotic freaks careening around in beatnikstyle buggies straight out of an auto graveyard were both drivein movie and vhs favorites these lowbrow actioneers were definitely an acquired taste exploitation classics like 1990 the bronx warriors warriors of the wasteland 2019  after the fall of new york exterminators of the year 3000 and warrior of the lost world proliferated during the 80s after surprised hollywood and generated a market for this violent slambang dystopian nihilism according to dvd times was shot on a budget of 400000 australian dollars which is a tiny budget for such an action packed film up until blair witch it held the record for greatest profit to budget ratio it grossed 100 million usd eventually not only did director george miller make a superstar out of mel gibson with 1979 but he also ushered in the grungy lowclass genre that eventually inspired bigbudget replicas does anybody remember kevin costners waterworld the studio that produced waterworld sought to remake but they wanted to stage it on the high seas thirty years after he wrapped the third entry in the trilogy with beyond thunderdome 1985 george miller has revived the postnuke warrior in fury road with tom hardy taking over mel gibsons role about four years ago paul millera michigan native no relation to georgehelmed a fan film renegade that filled in the gap between the first and 2 the road warrior if you arent a 1980s movie aficionado you may have trouble appreciating fury road with charlize theron taking star billing over tom hardy when we first see tom hardy of the dark knight rises he is standing with his back to the camera on a craggy zenith overlooking a parched desert in voice over narration he explains that he used to be a policeman furthermore he reveals that his past still haunts him as much as his doubtful future troubles him an agile twoheaded lizard makes the mistake of scuttling too close and gobbles it down no sooner has he climbed back into his car and driven off than a phalanx of cars pursues him with a vengeance crashes his car and his dastardly captors take him to an unspecified place in the desert where a collection of buttes towers over the rugged terrain this place is known as the citadel my chief complaint about this spectacular looking soupedup action thriller is the lack of information not only about our resourceful hero but also the people and places in it the lunatic mutants who shanghai are called warboys these barechested brigands cavort about in trousers and boots and have painted torsos flourwhite from the waist up cleanshaven skulls complete their ghoulish appearance they worship a sadistic tyrannical  immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne of the original who decks himself out in a plastic outfit with what appear to be oxygen hoses sprouting from a grotesque face mask with a billows on his shoulders miller never divulges why joe relies on such a macabre apparatus joe rules from one of the buttes and controls the water supply do not become addicted to water he warns it will take hold of you and you will resent its absence meantime he maintains a harem of young curvaceous victorias secret models with which he procreates while another harem of corpulent cuties yield buckets of breast milk from pumping units in citadel indeed fury road is not your conventional runofthemill road trip joe has constructed an elaborate system of elevators as well as massive tanker trucks that he dispatches to fetch fuel he has assigned a driver imperator furiosa charlize theron of monster to cruise into the wastelands with an escort of warboys to replenish their gasoline supply at the last minute furiosa goes rogue and swerves her vehicle offcourse into the desert initially her heavilyarmed escort believes she is complying with new orders an alarmed joe assembles an armada of bizarre vehicles to pursue furiosa one of joes warboys nux nicholas hoult of xmen days of future past desperately wants to commandeer a pursuit vehicle but he has to take his blood bag with him since his capture has suffered with warboys tattooing his back and suspending him upside down to furnish blood to nux during the feverish pursuit of furiosa manages to escape nux and negotiates an uneasy truce with our heroine learns furiosa is searching for her utopian homeland and a quintet of joes wives have chosen to defect and accompany her one of the harem is poised to give birth and joe is incandescent with rage when she shields these treacherous fugitives basically fury road amounts to an adrenalinelaced testosteroneladen highoctane fantasy boasting outlandish hybrid vehicles and amazing motorcycle aerobatics the narrative unfolds in an anonymous desert in the distant future at one point a gargantuan dust storm teeming with twisters engulfs everybody sits out the early part of the movie as a prisoner in the citadel hardy wears a face mask a little more revealing than the one he sported as the maleficent bane in the dark knight rises hardy proves every bit as resilient as mel gibsons and he is constantly running a gauntlet surprisingly charlize theron steals the show although minus part of her left forearm she brandishes a creepy mechanical contraption that enables her to steer her big rig despite its scarcity of exposition fury road qualifies as an entertaining often surreal but ultimately fastpaced demolition derby,reality
i went to the cinema with small expectations since i remember that i kinda enjoyed the first three movies but they didnt really stuck with me but it sounded like this would be a classic action movie with a lot of real stunts not so cgi heavy like all the super hero movies nowadays and just a bit different boy and it is i havent had such a blast watching an action movie since con air or terminator 2 theres just a certain raw velocity that this movie gets right like few of them do i wont tell you too much about the story i certainly liked it and its a nice postapocalyptic one with great characters all over the board is great not talking much at all but it fits him perfectly and then theres the mentally and physically scarred furiosa marked by the harsh conditions of this cruel world shes the character you will be rooting for the most played brilliantly by charlize theron which might just be my new favorite actress for her portrayal of furiosa her screen presence is just so strong the rest of the cast is really wonderful as well and cast spot on all in all a movie with fantastic action sequences that get you up on your seatliterally a very cool post apocalyptic mood strongly played and likable characters and just great pacing it gives you time to breathe every now and then so you can fully enjoy the next part of this wild ride910,reality
oh what a lovely day it was whenever i got to enjoy this film the beginning monologue gave me chills and once the action started i couldnt stay off the edge of my seat this movie is pure chaos and i loved every single second of it i had been waiting for a movie of this sort for years and my wish finally came true where some people may think some aspects of the movie are stupid such as the guitar player i thought it was perfect people think these bad things about these small aspects of the characters but in the end that is the point the movie is madness everyone has gone crazy no one cares that is what makes me love this movie so much not to mention the action is 1010,reality

this film starts as we see being chased by a group of bandits called the war boys get cage him up like and torture him with their self styled leader of a dystopias future immortan joe who looks like

fire and explosives wanders into the dark to confront the bullet farmer returning to the rig with guns and ammunition what is it with face mask with tom hardy also in batman doesnt he like talking

swampland and desert eventually coming across a naked woman identifies it as a trap but furiosa leaves the rig and states her former clan affiliation the woman summons her group who realize that furiosa is a member of their clanwho steals the show from intentional or not with one hand kidnapped with her mother when she was a child furiosa is distraught to learn that the swamp land they passed

behind but after seeing visions of his dead daughter he convinces them to return to the citadel which has ample water and greenery that joe keeps for himself and trap joe and his army in the bikers canyon so with fights high rise acts flying over furiosa rig that all going on around its one epic car chase you will ever see its like the circus but crazier one musical masterpiece act in the movie comes in the form of the guy the mask furiously shredding a flamethrowing electric guitar while dangling above a mobile wall of speakers that roars through the desert imagine that when all hell breaks loose only accompanied by that as the background music epic is truly an understatement as a descriptionand a rock star in all off this its one ride you will never forget a surprise hit the group begins the journey back to the citadel eventually encountering joe joe positions his car in front of the rig to slow it while fights on i leaving the rest there so i dont ruin the rest 2hrs of pure hell and back well done to everyone 910 an epic crazy classic but charlize as next time high five for feisty women everywhere she stole the show this film deserves to win 10 oscars for its visuals ott acting and craziness thats all round,reality
fury road is easily the best movie this year to many people who dont know about these movies think about if the video game borderlands had a escort mission the action in this movie was always high octane and always intense i found myself easily glued to the screen and on the edge of my seat the visuals in this movie completely blew my mind the performances in this movie were really interesting and great from all of the actors this movie also had some scenes that really unsettled me which is very hard to dodo not watch this movie if you are not okay with these types of scenes in movies other than that this movie is the thrill ride we have been waiting so long for,reality
so trailers promise a nonstop car chase through the desert and this is what the movie delivers is back and he is less and more insane haunted by the ghosts of lost loved ones he has only one motivation in life to survive he finds himself captures by one group of baddies in this movie he escapes and joins furiosa and some innocent girls in a quest for freedom and the green landwhile the movie merges together the desire for many different fluids guzzline water blood and mothers milk makes commentary on the sociopolitical landscape of the world that we live in and has lots of awesome actions sequences in the end it fails to deliver the characters do transform and overcome the tables are turned and the good guys beat the bad guys but it is not done with any great dramatic flair or to put it another way it started with great dramatic flair and had nowhere to go so while it ends on dramatic flair it doesnt build to it also while it is a 2 hour long car chase it is still a nuanced movie it was fun to discuss some of those nuances after watching this movie but could have benefited by being more explicit about it,reality
the dusty and dirty environment that george miller bring to us its a mindblowing experience youll bite the dust behind the wheels in a riot for fuel and water with a clearly badass tom hardy in his role of and a strong and beautiful charlize theron the movie it self its so full of contrast between the warm and cold color palette the effects are outstanding and the use of cgi takes a third place after the performance of the actors and the practical effects youre never seen an post  apocalyptic world with so much energy action and colorfull with the perfect balance of speed and interest in the evolution of the main characters situations,reality
for at least the first hour of the movie i sat there thinking this is nuts its such an unimaginably bizarre world every character has a weird quirk about them from a bronze nose to a breathing apparatus with teeth across it from the white tattoos to spraying silver paint into their mouths i mean you reach the precipice of wtf when the convoy drives out with a truck in the middle mounted with a wall of speakers fronted by a blind dude suspended by rope playing a triplenecked guitar made of car parts and carrying four massive war drums on the backimperior furiosa is tasked with the latest gas run but she has something else in mind as she smuggles out immortan joes five young wives so begins an epic car chase to get them back that takes up pretty much the entirety of the films runtime yes you read that right fury road is pretty much a two hour car chase a car chase through canyons and swamps and sand dunes and saltlakes for miles and miles theres even a catastrophic sand storm complete with sand tornadoes and lightning that gets in their way immortan joes warband is joined by other local warbands as well leaving furiosa and their charge of young women fending off a horde of crazed lunaticsacting is of pretty high quality throughout as well charlize theron was the perfect casting choice for furiosa with her difficult past behind her and her hope of a brighter future ahead shes driven and smart but not completely unreasonable rosie huntingtonwhitely as much as it pains me to say it wasnt too bad either even with a fake pregnancy bump weighing her down she never lets it get in the way of being a born leader of her fellow wives nicholas hoult was even quite good despite the somewhat cheesy dialogue and blindedbyfaith attitude tom hardy was also admirable as always im a big fan of his however this was far from the best performance ive seen of him mainly because his quiet brooding is a little too similar to his quiet brooding portrayal of forrest bondurant in lawless in fact if it wasnt for the starkly different settings it mightve been easy to allude to them being the same personwith all that said though lets face it the real reason anyone is going to go and see fury road is for the visual spectacle oh and what spectacle it is everything is grimy and barren the world they inhabit is a wasteland devoid of green devoid of water a lot of the visual effects and stunts are in camera as well in fact theres only one bit that was obviously cgi and thats when the debris of a massive crash comes hurtling towards the screen you know just to make extra good use of that 3d that i didnt watch it in other than that though all the stunts and car crashes and explosions look so real and natural because they really were done live in camera the choreography of the various segments of the sprawling car chase are meticulously thought out and the actors and stuntmen hanging from car doors and hanging on to rooves for their lives adds such a massive sense of urgency and tension i literally gasped at least once as tom hardy got just a little too close to the ground for my likingoh and lets not forget the cars oh my the cars the fast and furious franchise has plenty for the lovers of actual cars whether theyre super cars or classic cars but fury roads cars are something completely different each and every one is an individual botched together of various car parts in order to make the most outrageous and extravagant vehicles theres double stacked cadillacs with monster truck wheels a truck fronted by three stacks of sedan grills a camper bristled with spikes resembling a porcupine a pontiac with caterpillar tracks theres elements of all sorts of vehicles from every time period from the modern to the classic from the practical to the sporty theres massive overthetop wheels and exposed engines and open backed boots and its not just the fourwheeled variety that gets dolledup to the with skulls vents chains pipes and spikes the various motorbikes that appear all look uniquely bizarre as wellfury road is just plain good adrenaline fuelled fun it looks great its got a great story and some great characters brought to life by some great acting its superficially tense and yet the worldbuilding and character development makes it hugely engaging there are a few things that are hard to swallow with scrutiny like the shortage of fuel which is best met by driving lots of gasguzzling vehicles for miles and miles and miles somewhat recklessly throwing petrol bombs all over the place obviously but with something as crazy as fury road its not hard to just ignore that and let yourself get taken in for the ride i give fury road a bristling 910 bring on the sequels,reality
saw it today seen all 3 previous movies loved road warrior and 1 been waiting for this ever since it was announced saw the trailers read the hype worried it wouldnt live up it lived up and some george miller is a great action director  his movies have a charming weirdness i loved this movie its like road warrior  beyond thunderdome mixed up and boosted beautiful well imagined fantasy world charlize theron is fine as furiosa tom hardy good as  not like mel gibson but good in his way pounding music 3d is just right not overdone one thrilling action setpiece after the other its great will see again recommended to fans of the genre fantasyaction,reality
disclaimer the reason this is an 8 and not a full 10 is purely because i found some nitpicky things with the world building and also because it was a bit too intense and nonstop for me please dont kill me for thisi have seen the first and the majority of the second didnt see the third but the first two were amazing as part of an amazing series worth a 30 year wait for this latest insane installment seriously the action in this movie  both fight scenes and car chases  is some of the best ive ever seen if not the best action scenes shot the way they should be with proper choreography shot in a way that creates intense moments where the hero is invariably struggling and being victorious  just like a real situation has always been a hero that deals with injuries and setbacks in ways that would actually happen and its great to see of that happening herespeaking of we have a new actor in the lead role partly because mel gibson is now almost unhirable but mostly because he is now too old replacing him however is someone perfect for it tom hardy if you read my child 44 review youll know that whilst i hated the movie i commended hardy for rising above the st script to give a performance that was pretty much brilliant inspite of everything in though he gets less lines to work with but his body language says all gruff tough angry not a hero willing to care or show any humanity towards others and being at his best in dangerous situations the most character development is shown by nux played by nicholas hoult who starts off as an antivillain but later becomes a sympathetic lonely broken man who helps the heroes after he builds a relationship with one of the bridesone character who is receiving huge buzz is furiosa played by charlize theron bold tough determined in her mission to rescue to brides from the movies terrifying villain immortal joe in a nonstop drive to the green land theron plays a character who is not a typical im affected by a terrible path type of heroine and brings a matter of fact toughness purpose to the role that make this the best work shes done since monsterin terms of the story it is pretty much what you read above the main plot is furiosa helping the wives of immortal joe escape from his people the war boys who have captured and enslaved at the start of the film and tries to get revenge whilst ending up helping furiosa the few breaks inbetween the intense action are great as they setup the others breaking down the barrier between them and and getting him involved in their mission its hard to talk about the breaks because honestly there arent that many and most development actually comes through the fight scenes which is amazing to even saymy only words for you  see this movie it deserves your full attention and if you dont youll regret it,reality
its typical of action movie advertising to promise that the thrills never stop in a trailer with clips from the 2 or 3 best moments fury road has the rare trailer that accurately depicts the experience that you are going to get walking into that movie theater its almost nonstop action with a minimalist plot now i have seen some people complain about that aspect of the movie  the plot of the film and little character development and i have to admit that it did grate on me a little my more accurate score would be 85 but that is a very minor nitpick because a movie that is a visual spectacle would only suffer in having a complicated plot the story in fury road is simple but it works typically saying much action little plot would be an insult but george miller manages to create a masterpiece that similarly to last years lego movie puts to shame the inferiors and shows just how glorious things could be when done right,reality
yes winter movie season here in australia but still what a way to start off with avengers age of ultron that was awesome pitch perfect was alright and now fury road which is awesome so first off this movie is kind of like a mix of a rebootsequel to road warrior and it is my favourite of the moviesfirst off the actors they have chosen for this movie are awesome tom hardy did a great job as he was just as good as mel gibson charlize theron as furiosa she was the strongest part of the whole movie because she made you feel for her and she was just badassalso nicholas hoults character seemed like a villain in the trailers but he was also a very unique and interesting characteralso the part of the movie is the fact that all of the stunts preformed in the movie were all practical and that made it look better then any cgi that any director could have donealso the villain immortan joe was awesome he was intimidating and villains that are viewed as gods are my favourite types because it is basically an underdog story from that point onso overall if you havent guessed it you should go see this movie because it badass and one of the best action movies that isnt a superhero movie in the past couple of years,reality
fury road is a fantastic film the action scenes is crazy and the characters are badass this movie is enjoyable to watch and it is definitely an action blockbuster the premise is simple but the execution of the movie is fantasticgeorge miller did a great job directing the moviethe action is pretty sweet and i can still rememberthe movie had some ridiculous moments but it didnt bother me this a movie worth watching again wit great action and great characters joining together to make it my favorite movie of 2015this is a 2 hours action sequence that may be good for the average movie goers but if you dont like explosions and post apocalyptic movie this isnt for you anyway this movie is awesome and i recommend you to watch,reality
situation alerti watched it in 3d on am iscreenthe first scene ripped my eyeballs off from their sockets and plastered them to the screen and there they stayed resolutely unwaveringlymeanwhile somewhere else in the upper cranial regions my mind was being pounded into synaesthetic pulp at what was a surreal visceral sensory orgasm of a moviei have never watched a single movie i have never seen a single trailer or a promo photo of this movie i just went in and at the end of the movie i stayed back to collect the atomised remains of my mind before i could walk outhad i walked out earlier i would have been a gawping drooling retard trying to find the meaning of what movie making is only to return once more to the screeningif a picture speaks a thousand words an movie speaks a million madwith its barelyalegalsheetfull dialogue mashes the dictionary into pulp and writes a whole new oneif there is one movie you could watch this entire year this should probably be itto the makers of the movie i take my hat off what a ride it was what a lovely day,reality
its the most action packed movie ive seen in years literallythey sum up the story in about 10mins of the film and the rest of the 2 or so hours is spent racing through a post apocalyptic dessert all actionbut what i loved most is the retro feel of the movie it looked like it was made one or two years after beyond thunderdome i can only conclude this has to do with the right decision to let original director george miller direct it the old school filmmaker crafted a film that looks like all the special effects are done on camera with no cgi tom hardy takes the wheel as the title character but in fact his role is very secondary to charlize theron who plays furiosa whose trying to help the wives of a cult leader escape his clutches and make it to what they call green land the movie has very beautiful scenery that completely contradicts the insanity of the action on top of that was a killer musical score going through the whole thingfury road is a blockbuster that lives up to the frequently quoted phrase thrill ride cause it truly is nonstop thumbs up,reality
while it is difficult to believe in a world where people start wars over fossil fuel people are into suicidal extremists by being misled and wealthy white men controls the wealth  waitis brilliant it is beautiful in all its disgusting glory and it holds on to you for almost its entire runtime there are some spots left in so that you can catch your breath but mostly its all just chasing and being chased mostly the latter despite its postapocalyptic setting the movie manages to burst with color in every scenethe movie did slow down a bit in the last act or maybe all the action exhausted me but it never got boring the only parts of the movie i did not like was when they tried to connect their world to ours some parts of it worked like how they reused old technology their religion and how they spoke but especially one scene shows was jarring,reality
good points well filmed good action sequences well made props and costumes basically the visuals were pretty good except for the fact that the camera work was actually too soft and sterile for that kind of moviebad points very predictable script bad dialogues shallow characters poor acting even from seasoned actors like charlize theron who has in the past demonstrated high skill vide monster the remaining actors tom hardy included need to attend workshops at the very least some of the supporting cast should change jobs altogether the experience of this movie was overall shallow based on visuals and clichs i expect a little more quality from the writer and director of something that cost an estimated 150000000 to make result 6510 rounded up to 7 as the rating system doesnt take 12 points,reality
i watched couple days ago it was brutal yet entertaining being hunted is unbelievably scarybut i think the right title should be furiosa she stole the whole scenes she was the crazy one was only in the place where he should help them charlize theron nailed it tom hardy not fun at all in this movie compare to the old one i think mel gibson still better i dont know am i the only one who think that furiosa is more than himself and i just wonder what makes the one if he was the one who helped those girls from beginning he might be the maddest one but he didnt he only helped furiosa and the girls to runawaybut it was entertaining fun but bit brutal thinking about pregnant girl and hit by a car hard to imagine it feels the pain in the assi think charlize theron is the main role here i cant think who could play better than her she is real star,reality
following 1979 2 the road warrior 1981 and beyond the thunderdome 1985 thirty years later the same writer and director australian george miller now aged 70 offers us not so much a sequel as a re imaging of the eponymous hero with britains tom hardy taking over the lead role from mel gibson the result is a triumph there is a plot  but it is a simple one of escape by and attempted recapture of the five beautiful wivesbreeders of the chieftain immortan joe played by hugh keaysbyrne who was in the original movie as a character called toecutter there is dialogue  but it is minimal and himself is so laconic he does not even announce his name until almost the end but never mind the story or the words this is supremely a film with an utterly thrilling vision of nonstop action and excitementif the 15th century dutch painter hieronymus bosch were alive today this might well be the fantastical nightmare that he would conjure shot in the glorious deserts of namibia this is a postapocalyptic world inhabited by wonderfully bizarrelooking characters and incrediblyinventive vehicles with war drums and bass guitar supplementing the roar of the gasguzzling trucks cars and bikes the road they race along is properly named and many characters die and many vehicles explode in a fury of conflict and conflagration with barely a pause for breath  and all achieved with the minimum of cgi is aided by two very different warriors the onearmed feminist freedom fighter imperator furiosa a shavedheaded charlize theron and a barechested tumourridden nux whitemouthed nicholas hoult who exhibit more life than the emotionallywasted and with loss apparently tom hardy has signed on for three more films which is fine by me,reality
fury road is a non stop action thrill ride that barely pauses and never disappoints i would feel remiss if i did not mention that if youre a person who dislikes the wacky and weird this is not for you the characters are all very interesting and well developed the action sequences are amazing the pacing is almost non stop and the villain is almost like a combination between darth vader and a possessed santa claus while the film may not be quite as good as road warrior it comes very close which is an accomplishment in its own right in essence fury road is a great time at the theaters one that i suggest you see in theaters because its such a great experience,reality
i was a huge fan of the road warrior it was one of the best actionadventure movies set against the backdrop a dystopiapost apocalyptic civilisation the series was tarnished somewhat by the peter panesque beyond thunderdome considering how some of the recent rehashes were total recall robocop i wasnt sure if this one was going to be any better however once tom hardy joined the project i was certain it was going to be epic and i was not disappointed it was far better than what i had imagined by looking at the trailer an edgeoftheseat thriller that keeps you entertained and mesmerized doesnt waste any time in setting up the pace and somehow manages to keep the tempo up excellent work from george miller looking forward to the trilogy ,reality
i needed this movie it is so fresh the action scenes are unique and the characters are batshitinsane and distinctive this is the movie ive been waiting for it is visually stunning the desert surroundings and the rusty vehicles and weapons really set the postapocalypse atmosphere the old trilogy had but in a fresher and more modern way it is not the most impressive when it comes to story but hell it doesnt really matter it is fun it is insane it is freaking the villains are twice what the original villains were and the same goes for the chase and action scenes the one thing i would want to complain about is it simply doesnt have enough i really hope this isnt the last weve seen of george miller and tom hardy,reality
makes the fast and the furious look like little kids on tricycles making motorcycle sounds needless to say i loved this movie i saw it with my dad not knowing what to expect after the movie ended i talked my dads ear off about how awesome it was not knowing how much he hated it if you like action you will love fury road the movie is a constant car chase that is never boring george millers use of practical effects brings a level of realism to the screen that recent action movies like the avengers and the hobbit failed to create i havent shown it to my friends yet because of our busy schedules but they are already tired of hearing me talk about all the great things about it is the closest hollywood has come to creating a western punk opera even without the format of a broadway musical unless you count the badass flame throwing guitar player the score will keep you captivated from beginning to end what a day what a lovely day,reality
i went and saw this with mrs sankari last thursday we bought tickets for the 1845 showing and i expected the place to be packed it wasnt there were probably 12 people in the entire theatre including ourselves so we scored perfect seatstwo people walked out after the first half hour i still have no idea whymmfr has rather idiotically been described as a feminist movie and socalled mens rights activists have reacted to this with the well practised impotent rage for which their tribe is notoriousneedless to say the whole thing is a manufactroversy just off the top of my head the prevailing culture is unequivocally partiarchal  the only known matriarchal tribe is on the verge of extinction with less than half a dozen members left  nearly all of the fighting is done by the men  when the women fight the men they are invariably overpowered  furiosa spends most of her time driving while spends most of his time fighting so that she can stay alive long enough to keep driving  five of the main female cast members are helpless sex slaves  the remaining members of furiosas tribe dont even have names or did i miss themthey were interchangeable characters anyway  all of the women end up being rescued by men  by the end of the movie men are still in charge of everythingif thats a feminist movie im natalie portmanso anyway this is one huge knockout blockbuster a hell of a ride with all kinds of crazy shizzle millers direction is superb within the first 10 minutes he uses broad strokes to paint a complete picture of his postapocalyptic world and by the 15 minute mark youre fully immersedeverything feels real and utterly believable the deliberate use of practical fx including fully driveable vehicles places this film in the upper echelons of cinema leaving cgiheavy wannabes like avatar in the dust the main characters were extremely well drawn and properly fleshed out my personal favourites were and nux with the latter particularly impressive due to his development throughout the filmi could go on and on there is just so much to describe and appreciate it is hands down the best film i have seen in years and i will definitely be seeing it againi rate fury road at 2997 on the haglee scale which works out as a jawdropping 910 on imdb i got so much more than i bargained for i had to share some with my wife,reality
just marvelous and more marvelous george miller just teach a lesson how to connect to the audience and turn on the dying flavor of true movie magiche ignite the flame of new taste that is so needed in today movie industry some people give it one ratting they have donkey brain and no nothing about movie but pretending to be smart just go watch thats all i can say when i first watch without expecting more i was just shock with amazement you just can feel and understand something worth enjoying when somebody put their best effort on something this is kind a movie you will feel an hour is like one minute,reality
after hearing so much good feedback about this movie i finally broke down and headed to my neighborhood theater to see it though in the back of my mind i was thinking it cant be that good well its been about an hour and half after walking out of the theater and im still feeling blown away the reports of the movie being almost nonstop action are true  its basically one action sequence after another now normally i would probably object to the fact that all this action doesnt leave much room for story or character development but the action is top notch and filled with much variety so my interest was always up also in this age of cgi and quick edits the action in this movie goes against the norm for the most part using practical effects and more relaxed editing so that its very easy to follow all the action however i will admit that the movie is not perfect here are a few quibbles i had with the movie1 a substantial amount of dialogue is hard to make out due to a combination of thick accents and lots of background noise2 the character actually is up and center a lot less than you think in the first half hour hes mostly pushed to the sidelines he does get more to do in the subsequent portion of the movie but even then theres almost a feeling hes a supporting character and not a lead character3 i did not understand the visions the character had several times of an unidentified female character who was he thinking of its not explained4 the chief villain of the movie is not fleshed out enough and the complaints ive read here from other imdb users that hes more or less a clone of the villain in the road warrior do have some weightdespite those quibbles i did enjoy the movie a lot i will see it again when its released on bluray though i will certainly turn the english captions option on first,reality
i am totally speechless looking at the trailer i thought i will be watching a dumb mindless madness personified vehicular mayhem action movie take the first two adjectives out this is fugging incredible a kickass brainy dystopian story set either before or after the time of thunderdomegeorge miller has lifted a bgrade story concept to master class level i am not just talking about the stunts which used minimal cgi miller has never forgotten that the action serves the human element and that is kept front and centre with superb pathosthe action is out of this world and it wisely stayed rooted to real world physics every vehicle looks like a frankenmonster stitched together from waste metal the weapons primitive and deadly the desperate race across the desert is exhilarating and a symphony of sounds excesses and madness each crash and explosion of twisted metal more jawdropping than the preceding one yet through all the crazy mayhem millers hand is steady and the orchestra of madness is conducted with superb clarity and pinpoint accuracy not once did i fall out from the story i was pulled in immediately and the action is so relentless that i forgot to breathe thank goodness for a short respite 30 minutes incharlize theron turned in an outstanding performance and tom hardy as the renegade of the wasteland and the road warrior is fantastic after a while my mind was thinking mel whonot a good review the words here cannot begin to capture the grandiosity of what miller has achieved i apologise mr miller lets just say after the movie ended me and my wifey felt like buying another pair of tickets to see it this time with more inquisitive and observant eyes like how the heck were some the scenes filmed hands down the best action movie we have seen this year,reality
once again a do not look away can not look away movie very realistic picturization of the movie in the post apocalyptic zoner camera work is amazing unbelievably fast pace worth a watch fight scenes are very realistic and breadth taking while watching the movie i feel that i am watching 4 action movies in one movie this is the first movie i ever watched however when compared with other post apocalyptic movies such as book of eli cloud atlas it is second to none every one has done a fine job story is good sensible and going on a good pace as expected there are hardly any emotions in the movie but still chemistry between characters is there and in the quantity needed,reality
like an aliens sequel without sigourney weaver or like a rockys sequel without sylvester stallone it feels like it lacked something something big i missed him a lot the guy is a huge star and he also directed braveheart apocalypto and starred in the best one of the series 2 1981 on the other hand fury road 2015 could easily be the second best of the series george miller knows his stuff and delivers great action sequences very cool ones indeed the action and charlize theron performance are the very best of the movie tom hardy is a fine and intense actor but he is not a star in the level of mel so if you can ignore this fact or youre too young then you will enjoy thoroughly one of the best action movies of the year,reality
is visually stunning film most of the movies special effects and stunts are real and you really can see it looks like a movie which wont produced any longer today most of the special effects are made with computers even the quality of todays cgieffects still never looks so good like the old type explosions and stunts like they were done in this movie frank millers visuality is beautiful to watch and movies redbrown landscape looks almost magical movie is full throttle action from start to finish that can be a strength of this movie but it is also the weakness of it because of all the action thru out entire movie its ending wont blow your mind also there are some weakness in its script script isnt very clever but its weakness is buried with all the action tom hardy is good choice to play even the story wont give to him much enough to shine in his role despite its weakness in story is still one of the best action movies this year so far with better script it would be perfect,reality
 warning spoilers in the second half of the review 1i am now writing this review after i have watched the movie twice first time with friends who really liked the movie and another time with ones who dislike the movie as i said after seeing it twice im giving it by far 1010first of all this is a pure insane action movie the plot is not the main issue in this movie many can call it a shallow opinion but in this kind of movies you dont need an amazing plot to make an amazing pure action movie a symphony of pure actionmany may say that a great movie have to have mainly a great plota great acting and a deep somewhat feelings for the characters i think that a great movie is the one that synchronizes all of the above in just the right way even without the great elements of the above  which this film did with an outstanding waythe movie is not connected by anything to the old trilogy only by its name and some guiding lines and the car of course the most common mistake is to come to this movie with an expectation to a deep plot and overwhelmed dialogs  dontthis is a surreal dark brutal apocalyptic  high cgi effects movieno unnecessary dialogs that cut the extremely high pace of this move and no too emotional explanations about the background of the characters only the necessary information is included to know and sympathise well enough the characters also included is a spiritual cause no long and brutal journey is worth the price without a spiritual cause2 spoilersthe characters imperator furiosa  a character that seeks for redemption for joining the bad side and mostly have guilt feeling about her past and a high commitment to free immortan joes property the most beautiful girls in this film led by splendid the amazing rosie huntingtonwhiteley a dialog that i can compare to jean claudes dialog from the 80s and 90s movies almost no dialog the deepest sentence in this whole movie was saying his name twice on the other hand hes just not the main figure hes just a tormented force tool that helps furiosa to escape immortan joenux  a well developing character in the movie he literally evolves from the dark side to the good side he helps with his handy hand and brilliant mind furiosa to escape from immortan joe his character does get redemption even he almost didnt feel it a great supporting act by nicholas houltimmortan jow  a dictator controls his almostdead subjects by water the water gave him the power in a world that politicians like him destroyed it hes obsessed by having his property like dictators obsessed by power he wants his propert the girls to be returned no matter the costs and thats his weakness he forgot to protect his own citadel in his madness a good and needed evil to make this movie a super fast paceafter seeing it for the second time i was as enthusiasted as i was in the first time although theres a lot of holes in the plot like the path in the canyon that miraculously repairs itself and the arrow that hit in the head as vanishes in the crowd at the end seems like the injury is not that serious  an arrow in the brain the fast pace of this film will distract you from that kind of stuff and you know what the movie is so amazing that ill forgive the production mistakes to keep the movie running high,reality

what an insane film unlike the disappointing beyond thunderdome and more like the first two movies this takes the craziness to a brilliantly high level with constant mindblowing and explosive action throughout epic visual effects and cinematography and a pretty exciting story too this is an absolute thrill ride that cant be missedthe main thing about this film is that it is totally and utterly insane but deliberately you see how severe this apocalypse has been by the way that everybodys just gone completely out of their mind making for a world of total madness and insanitythe fact that this film approaches this insanity with a good sense of humour to the extent where you see a guy with no eyes playing a double guitar that shoots flames out of it whilst in battle this film is quite simply a hell of a lot of fun to watch however the drama and excitement in the story is not at all cheapened by thatthis film has a very simple plot being set around what is effectively a twohour car chase across the desert but the success here is that it manages to bring in proper drama and intrigue for its main characters along the way played excellently by tom hardy is as enigmatic as ever and although he doesnt have the sense of extreme anger like the first three films hes still a solid action hero that you always want to supporthowever the standout character here is by far imperator furiosa who claims what is effectively the position of main character being the one whose ambition and drive pushes the entire story along whilst shes also a very strong and totally badass action heroine thanks to a brilliant performance by charlize theronone of the best parts of this film is the visuals and the onscreen vibe that it gives off the special effects both practical and cgi are stunning to behold whilst the cinematography of the action sequences throughout is flawless taking a very simple approach to filming the fight scenes that makes it much easier to watch than a generic shakycam lookthis is also the first film where you get the vibrant colours of the desert world shining through in 2 theres a little bit of that however this film is simply beautiful to look at whether its at the wide golden landscape shots of the vast desert or the gloomier bluer night scenes that add to the eeriness and tension of the story even moreoverall ill give this an 8 because of its fantastically exciting story strong characters and performances stunning visuals and the sheer insanity that prevails throughout,reality

this is one of the most visually amazing movies ive ever seen it makes most movies appear dull by comparison the yellowy orange sand contrasts with the blue sky and white clouds and overall the landscape is gorgeous and really well filmed night scenes have a blue tinge so that we can see everything and it feels like moonlight or the twilight hour the vehicles are extravagant and spiky and bulky and have all kinds of gadgets attached with cool things i havent seen before there is a cliff and an artificial waterfall with poor people stuck on the land below the cast of characters look crazy like a freak show or something this is not a movie going through the paces its hugely imaginative and creative and the passion of the filmmakers comes through in every framefury road is not weighed down by anything unnecessary it is dominated by action throughout and it focuses on that exposition is achieved through chase or fight scenes we figure out what is going on as the movie progresses there are no sappy moments characters rarely cry and the movie doesnt bother to dwell on their feelings too much its more about survival but the characters are human enough to relate to and care about tom hardy is stoic and hardly says anything as he communicates through stares and gestures charlize theron is really good as imperator furiosa shes tough and determined but you can tell she still has fears and hopesits a great achievement that the film makes use of so many practical stunts and effects it feels far different from other action movies of recent years it will not date the way cgifests will the editing makes it easy to follow the action it can be chaotic but we know who were looking at and what is actually happening the way scenes play out is highly original people can get snatched out of nowhere explosions happen haphazardly vehicles get crushed or flipped harpoons lodge into trucks and have to be removed with boltcutters but theyre not arbitrary montages theyre planned out sequences of events with logical consequences that build tension and excitementthe music adds to the strange ominous brooding atmosphere of the film it uses a range of styles there are powerful low pulses on strings crazy electric guitar and tribal drumming stuff which parallels whats on the screen and just generally lots of good music that i found hard to categorisei wish more movies could be as bold and imaginative as fury road i love the stark imagery throughout the bad guy looks so cool and bizarre it seems deserving that it has received 10 oscar nominations clearly a lot of work was put into it and it isnt imitating anything but is reaching out into new possibilities for cinema why cant a 2 hour movie be one long action chase scene with real stunts it was also nice to hear so many australian accents in a movie it feels like homethe visuals in the movie suggest a kind of hell or purgatory for the main characters will they find heaven or at least a stable happy life what is the right path to take riding off into the unknown or against the odds for a real chance at redemption perhaps there will be a nuclear war and maybe this is what humanity will become but even with this extreme environment there are parallels to modern life for me this world actually makes more sense than real life i dont understand people that need a coffee every day and who enjoy chatting about reality tv shows send me to fury road where my life has meaning  survive,reality
this film is great funi dont understand the number of negative reviews here on imdb admittedly a significant portion of this movies runtime is action but what where you expectingan important thing about this film is that the action is genuinely well done this is impressive considering that many of the blockbusters of recent years transformers recent die hard movies wrath of the titans etc often contain action sequences you can fall asleep watching despite being stuffed to the brim with cgi in areas this film clearly relies heavily on cgi but its never over done the action in this film is essentially all part of one huge car chase with few diversions which allows for a continual steam of exhilarating carnagethe main characters in this film all look very distinct and have vibrant and entertaining personalities tom hardy is brilliant as and as many have pointed out charlize theron is great as furiosa too also worth mentioning is hugh keaysbyrne who is very effective as a menacing presence in the form of the tyrannical warlord immortan joe there could be more dialogue in this movie but it wouldnt be necessary if anything it would remove from the awesome nonstop insanity of the film i would highly recommend this film to anyone who is into action films and feel that general moviegoers will likely find a lot to like here too,reality
i have always liked the films i like george miller as a director because he created a vision of a apocalyptic post nuclear violent future world with films i respect him for the fact that he never let anyone else direct other sequels of mm films other than himself miller returned after 30 years for this long awaited sequel and among all the directorsscottspielberg lucas whom attempted to do sequels with cgi miller somehow managed to refuse that option and went old school with a real crew stunts in the desert and at 70 years of age he created a masterpiece with fury road i just saw this recent fury road with tom hardy which at first when i read he was casted as i thought it was a odd choice but now having watched this film i am sorry to say that i feel he was a terrible choice i hate to compare one actor to another i liked mel gibson because he made more interesting and charismatic on the screen where as tom hardy seemed lost or confused with this role i have seen hardy playing these very oddball sociopaths roles like bronson or bane in batman or the simpleminded bob in the drop i think his acting ranges only between those types hardy seemed to only to play the tough brutal i heard in a interview there was not full script for him and it was mostly story boarded but that is an actors dream to improvise so he can blame there was no script but that missing script had more lines for charlize theron and the other characters like nux than whom the movie was suppose to be about this was a great action film a true masterpiece of its kind miller not relying on cgi was what made it great however it lacked a coherent narrative in parts also the casting of these super model looking girls as breeding mothers dressed like they were in some vouge magazine shoot out in the desert just didnt fit when it came to casting the photography had a comic book look compare to they way miller had that barren landscape in road warrior which complemented the theme of a post apocalyptic world rather than this primary colors glossy blue sky that looked like a disney movie although the sets and cast of characters of these various characters like nux and the bullet farmer were very interesting and he really got the comic book look come alive on the screen this movie was disguised first with action then with a feminist theme but it was really more of marketing strategy to appeal and draw a wider female audience to have female hero furiosa a freedom fighter battling against an oppressive male regime theron made this character tough she looked like a an action figure compare to sigourney weaver in aliens as ripley with nonmodel looks was only wearing a unisex workers uniform was smart and forceful this was suppose to be a film but furiosa became the center of this film the action disguised the viewer to forget it was a movie he was just a passenger it was like a houdini magic act to suddenly convert this movie into a feminist action film sorry to say that was another cloak to think someone like furisoa is a feminist role model in road warrior and beyond the thunderdome there was a lot of more dialogue spoken by than this film miller was the person who cowrote those first 3 films stories and scripts so how come this there was no lines for the new i feel the that i knew was missing on the screen hardy was this mute brooding and angry that felt he didnt want to be in this movie that scene where he first find the girls washing with the water hose by the truck he was just moaning to get the wire cutter those fight scenes with theron were stupid in a way because furiosa saw was a prisoner and tied up and used as blood bank he was not part of war boys so why fight the old was more smarter in how to assess the situation around him with humor there is no sense of humor to tom hardys at all he is more muscles than brains the plot would have been more interesting if had captured and returned these women with nux to bargain and exchange to get his car and fuel and then rescued them backoverall i liked the film itself the visuals and most of all charlize theron as furiosa who really carried most of the weight of this film but i cant call this a movie i hope mr miller either finds a new or breaths some life into tom hardys version of with a script that hardy can read and follow because casting should not just be about how big a star is to sell the film my choice for would have been either another australian actor like sam worthington who has been in a number of action films like clash of titans or luke evans who was in dracula untold that really surprised me as how good an actor he is his reactions has more depth than hardy could ever conjure a grin the films are now made for a new generation who probably dont care about depth or acting but more about the action so i hope miller started a trend for films to be shot with a real setting and crew instead the illusion of cgi,reality
i went for this movie with very low expectations as off late there have been many apocalyptic moviesthe movie starts with tom hardy in back drop having very rugged look reciting the prologue and mind you those are the only 5 minutes of sanity we getthen starts the long ride of action that will keep you on edge of your seat for whole of the movie cars chasing trucks exploding insane shooting stabbing gore violence is on your plate which will blow you awayacting wise both leads do not have much to show case as direction and action take front seat and do most of the talking story is nothing more than kind of redemption and salvationmy final take go for it as it is bang on your buck and will leave you insanely amazed,reality
this film is nonstop action start to finishi have to admit when i saw this at 910 i thought that would surely come down in the following weeks but it has barely shifted  i have to say the score is justifiedive not seen the original films but i most definitely will now i am a massive fan of tom hardy although he doesnt speak too much in this it is still a top performanceeven nicholas hoult who i usually find annoying was actually really goodthe visuals are great the storyline is ok its massively ott but that doesnt detract from anything i cant wait to watch it again,reality
i really enjoyed this movie it was so colorful and eye popping from the opening scene up until the end of the movie the visual graphics were completely breathtaking it was full of action and suspense and drama i also thought the story line was simple enough to follow charlize theron is an awesome actress and she played this part perfectly as she does all of her roles i dont want to leave out the other cast members especially tom hardyzo kravitz and nicholas hoult they were all equally amazingafter seeing this version of the movie i went home and found the previous versions of this movie on demand i grew up watching mel gibson play there are some movies you know cant be remade like conan but i can honestly say that they did an extraordinary job with the remake of this is a must see,reality
i will be quick on this review like alwaysi finally got around to see this movie and i have to say fury road is the best action movie this yearit has a simple scriptget to one place and then a lot happens in betweenit works for this kind of moviei thought hardy and theron did their roles pretty goodthe thing about this movie is your interested and engaged about whats going on the entire movie unlike the marvel full comedy hour avenger moviesthe moviegoer feels the action and wants to see what happens nextthis is not the best movie made or a super perfect masterpiece like some reviews are raving but its the best movie out right nowif there is a second movie to be made this kind of formula and filming would be great for this kind of series,reality
79 a remakesequel that really really goes for it full force in the face and in doing so largely impresses yet doesnt quite take the crown of the very best of the series which is and probably always will be 2 tom hardy fills the role that mel left behind in the mid eighties though this time hardly has more than a few lines of dialogue in the entire film but then he was never a big talker with a bulk of the attention and lines left for solely charlize therons character this is a visually epic looking film with tons of loud fast well shot action though i missed the more subtle elements of the other instalments that this doesnt have as much of plot wise this is a near remake of beyond thunderdome with a few different ideas running through some of them good some not so great in terms of allout action this is a must watch its hugely entertaining and very well made its also worthy of the name which is probably its biggest accomplishment,reality
firstoff i never watched the original films so seeing the bizarre insane world of for the very first time i couldnt help thinking what the heck i thought the movie walks on a thin line between sick and brilliant but now i know that its both every shot of the movie is needed and pitch perfectyou must admire it not only the vision of george miller but the relentlessness to put this gigantomatic vision into reality i bet not one single soul except miller expected such a movie could ever exist until they actually saw itthe music often reminds of an orchestra and thats pretty much what it is an orchestra of blood bones dirt absolutely breathtaking action unique cinematography and epic heroismthe ending literally brought tears into my eyes not only because it was such an uplifting heartfelt conclusion but also because it was so pitch perfect like the entire movie was pitch perfect and like probably no other movie will be in a long time ,reality
wow you really thought that 2 was the ultimate chase film but it really has nothing on this it got to the point that it was utter sensory overload but never boringly so because you cared about the characters the ultimate secret to any action filmokay first off i see this as a reboot occurring just after the original we see with his iconic last of the v8 interceptors police car at the beginning and as that was destroyed in 2 we must assume that hardys and gibsons one day came to a fork in the road and one went one way and the second went another therefore gibsons is happily living out his life with the feral kids after returning to them at the end of beyond thunderdome staying right there living a long time and being grateful hardys by contrast is still looking for redemption before finding his new family and purpose at the end he walks away from the celebration in true cowboy style just as gibsons chooses not to go with the settlers to form their new colony the great northern tribe at the end of 2 he isnt done yet we see the beginnings of moral comeback here choosing to risk his own life when he could have walked away finding in furiosa and her sisterhood something worth fighting for and living for when he finally reveals his name to furiosa it shows that he is beginning to remember who he once was and who he might be again no longer just a nameless drifterall credit to some extremely brave stuntmen who made this film really beggars belief that no one was killed in the filming amazing special effects too the idea that furiosas missing arm was created using purely cgi is staggering a feminist film i guess so we have both the brides and the milk cows rebelling we have the motherhood taking over at the end in the previous films wed had rape a formidable female warrior who was then killed off and aunty entity in many ways an admirable figure but also the quasi villain staggering that this got a 15 rating the caesarean scene made me cringe like nothing else all told pretty damn brilliant and definitely up for another sequel,reality
fury road is definitely one of the most phenomenal movies ive seen this movie has everything you want and more from an action movie  suspense gore thrill explosions and much more from the beginning till the end you feel like you are apart of the movie it captivates you in a way most films fail to do the film leaves you with emotion and suspense the whole way through not to mention the acting is superb this film has such a different tone and feel but different is good in this films case george miller as yet created another masterpiece in the franchise congratulations to the cast and crew because this movie is superb,reality
technically this movie was incredible and my opinion of it increased when i read that about 90 of the stunts were real not cg the acting was superb im not a fan of charlize theron but she was exceptional here and it was great to see women kick some ass in spite of that this movie made me so uncomfortable  especially that highly intense opening scene  that while i can say i definitely appreciated the movie i did not enjoy it the setting and behaviour of some of the characters is really gruesome and theres no preparation at all  youre just thrown in head firststill worthwhile to watch but be prepared for some horrific scenes,reality
fury road is no doubt one of the best films this year it stands out among the rest because of its complex and twisted world building strong and compelling heroines stunning visual effects and action scenes and most especially its unique and moving story this film literally has the most dangerous and explosive car chase ive ever seen in any film and i saw the whole fast  furious film franchise george miller is indeed a genius to create such a twistedly beautiful story of survival and to actually sell it is not easy i am very impressed with the world building the details the whole atmosphere and feel of it got stuck on me i imagined i would not last in that dry and disease infested world where everyone has to fight for food and water tom hardy and imperator furiosa charlize theron are two compelling characters that clearly have different agendas caught in a brutal world they are forced to be on but because of a common enemy undecidedly became the strongest of allies watching these two heroines exchange guns and the steering wheel is nothing but exciting and thrilling everything about fury road is mindblowing an edgeofyourseat experience that doesnt flood you with too much script this film is all about the goods its wildly actionpacked oozes with pure adrenaline and it doesnt run out of surprises really what a lovely day,reality
oh george you know what you do dont you is really tom hardy nails it but the looks on therons face is beyond hot the looks could only be explained as i guess for the ones looking for what they are expecting to see after watching the trailer youll find it before going to the movie i hope george is not going to disappoint me but hey he didnt my expectations were already very high from the trailer looking all for the big fans is back and i never exaggerate when it comes to movies scenes just do not let you sit back and lean on your back it just doesnt let you breath for a second which is well planned and exercised by miller good job,reality
fury road is exactly how an old movie franchise should be rebooted all the old es mashed into one stamped with an unpredictable script and pumped full of steroids and speed jurassic park 4 and terminator 100 whatever number it is now lol should take note dont make a movie franchise because it has a history and you can make money from the name make a film because you have a great story to tell has quite a story to tell possibly even seeing a glimpse of what humanities future may even be like when oil and natural resources have run dry defiantly go see this film for the sheer cinematic brilliance,reality
fury road there are almost no words to describe the sheer brilliance of george millers latest effort the finished product speaks for itself the action is high octane and nonstop it is a beautiful film to look at and that largely has to do with the fact that almost all of it is achieved through practical effects i read somewhere that director george miller spent 17 years to work on a script for fury road and his effort has paid off tremendously another thing that makes this movie a masterpiece is that you dont even need to be familiar with the original story and film to enjoy it all the groundwork is established right off the bat and the characters develop much deeper throughout the course of the film that you feel as if you know them truly a spectacle and achievement in filmmaking bravo george miller 1110 that extra one is for the guitar player with the guitar that shoots flames,reality
stunning non stop action tour de force from miller seat of the pants superbly choreographed stunts without the obvious fakery of cgi leading presumably to many injuries from the consummate casthardy is outstanding as the jittery haunted a man of few of words many regrets and plagued by visions of a violent and heartbroken past therons moody portrayal of the rebel furiosa whom reluctantly assists with escape is equally excellent reminiscent of a young ellen ripleyvisually fury road  with the help of 2000ads renowned brendan mccarthy  has refined millers post apocalyptic dream to perfection it is glorious to behold and sets makeup and costumes are incrediblelike previous outings for rockatansky little is discussed about the why and the how and much is implied through snippets combined with meaningful gazes between the main leads this adds to the mythology of the franchise the modern day western the man with no nameless is more is done very well yet again by miller and this insane romp of a car chase exploding across a parched land consisting of the broken diseased and insane remnants of humanity is presumably what he envisioned in 1979 then he had the talent in gibson but not the money but still managed to produce a reasonable facsimile of his minds eyein fury road the vision is finally realised and hopefully in further installments we may discover who killed the world in an attempt to untangle the past and give hope to future,reality
oh what a day what a lovely daydirector george millar returns over 30 years later to add a new story to his original trilogy but this sequel fitting right in with all the previous entries pushes the already full throttle franchise to nearbiblical proportions fury road is an epic race of humanity versus the utterly insane and it is stunningly beautiful a visual feast indeed every aspect of it is over the top fun from its color palette to its extreme costume and mechanical styling this is definitely a modern day operathe landscape is empty and bleak like a blank orange canvas being splattered with white zombie torsos and spiked hedgehog cars ive never actually wanted to be inside of a dust storm until now i have never wanted dirt in my mouth as much as i did watching this movie to be in the thick of all the parched craziness its a testament to the visual designers of this film that such extremely hot and dry conditions look gorgeously appealingas the dust kicks up and the action starts fury road will not let you forget that this franchise is best known for its car chase scenes if youre a car person this movie will absolutely make you lose your mind but if youre not a car person well this movie will still make you lose your mind the high octane high speed action here is unreal its all just absurd in the best possible way these scenes are so engrossing that they sweep you right into them and just when you think it couldnt possibly push any further it does this is like watching gods fight which is fitting as the film has an overall mythological feel to it by the time the very first car chase scene ends youve already been taken on several loops and thrown to the ground left to ask yourself what did i just watch and thats just the first one all while fully establishing our main charactersthe cast is absolutely on point tom hardy as rockatansky is a great succession to mel gibson quiet and strong but still growing madder and madder after all these years on his never ending odyssey nicholas hoult is quite inspired as nux hes feral and tasty both sour and sweet the true strength of the films characters though comes in a different formthe women of fury road are more than just pretty faces in fact they are extremely important to the survival of anyone in this film they are mothers wives daughters and sisters they plant the seeds of life they offer the milk of growth and strength they release the waters to replenish they are goddesses the core group of women here whose perfect supermodel bodies are covered in only wispy pure white cloth are furies not to be reckoned with they are sirens and they are oracles and they will certainly be the end of youcharlize therons imperator furiosa is the leader these women need shes ruthless and does want needs to be done to get the job done at the same time shes haunted and not without heart shes the female equivalent of himself only better even realizes he wouldnt make it without her and it is a wonder to watch these two work togetherthey are aided by junkie xls down right dirty score it sounds grimy and savage in itself with a harsh drum line and textured electronics if you could get the musical equivalent of rust brushing against itself in an epic thematic score this is pretty much itit doesnt get much better than this as far as action flicks go this is george millers masterpiece with all the high profile movies coming out in the remainder of this year im already calling fury road my movie of the year i would be thoroughly surprised to see any other sequel or remake coming have this much style originality and symbolism ingrained into such strong charactershis name is and his movie is brilliant,reality
witness me from the word go this movie has jawdropping sanity grabbing pulsepounding action sequences which all makes sense hardy does justice to the legacy of the road warrior man this guy knows how to act charlize theron is just amazing and gives a stellar performance take a bow mrmiller direction is nothing but just sheer brilliance for an action buff  this has to be their wet dream a visual treat in all ways hands down the best action based movie since 1999 this movie is the epitome of epic madness awesome action sequences and how a complete package is delivered to the audience this one is not to be missed,reality
if you havent watched one of the best action movies this year go to the nearest 3d movie theater and correct this mistakeits been a while since i have watched a grand cinematic masterpiece with lots of quality action sequences maybe since prometheusanyway i want to say a few words about the 4th movie which is a true heir to the old movies and especially to the first one the exhilarating survival story is concentrated on the desert pursuit of our main hero rockatansky who is helping imperator furiosa and the beautiful women who happen to be running from the diehard immortan joe this being said  there is no more story setting no time for prehistory for building characters in the beginning  the action starts immediately and it is fueled with relentless strive to overcome dire situations with desperate measures what strikes me most is the visual perfection of the execution of each action sequence it is real it is scary it is fast and it is furious yes the dialogue is not much and is not that good but the presence of each character and hisher traits are true visible and charming we get to see each of the main characters pursue their way of survival but in the end only together they can achieve survival and fulfillment only is the ever estranged and wandering lonerthe truth is that this film is not about the depth of its plot or the growth of a character in it it is about the unique world in which this survival story is set it is about the weary road warriors who battle each other over the only true and meaningful things left in the world  water gas and procreation because there is no green place no end destination no other refuge than the one of the mind and as the main character is driven by his guilt and the ghosts of his lost relatives the world in which he lives and wanders is driven by the desire to survive to live to prevail this may seem and sound crazy as crazy as the man with the flame throwing guitar but more or less im used to see this same battle over and over again in our daily life we may fight over more elitist values but survival of the fittest is the most common theme in each argument in each battle we fight in our lives because one can leave hisher legacy only as a victorno matter how primal it may seem the message behind is vigorous  through the ecological collapse and moral decadence one can survive only through constant refueling of the inner values and fighting for them we can truly see the family metaphor with furiosa and the five wives and war boy nux in one truck and the dream of reaching home as a journey back to the beginning after escaping from itit is very important for me to note the excellent soundtrack and colorful visuals i very much like this post apocalyptic desert world of the desperation is tempting the solace is futile in order to achieve something better one has to accept the gritty nature of this aggressive world and fight it in every possible way heshe canthis is a weird but grandiose roller coaster journey for the eyes the ears and the mind a long expected treasure for the road warriors out there,reality
when i first heard that there was going to be another movie i felt like it wasnt necessary i really liked the previous ones but i thought that something similar to the new robocop was going to happen then the trailers came down and they looked really good but i never imagined just how great this movie was going to be i left the cinema with my mind blown it was such a masterpiece the visuals of the move where great they looked like real art the music characters the world everything was perfectly crafted its such a mix of action visuals music tone characters that feels like perfection one of the best movies i have ever seen in my life thats what an action film should be,reality
rarely do you find a movie that outdoes the original george millers finest movie to date i love the stolen children a reference to australias aboriginal children who were taken from their parents perhaps the reference to people subjugated by white painted overlords who literally suck the blood out of people is absolute genius the science fiction is very grounded in a believable backstory of how the world turned to dust its a high octane thrill ride from start to finish a treat to the eye it balances scifi and drama in the way youd expect from masters such as jj abrams i cant wait for the sequels,reality
fury road is a one big breathtaking lunatic car chase through a surreal looking australian desert its its madder its fckn george miller surpassed himself 30 years after he had let mel gibson fight in the thunderdome for survival and he reclaimed the very essence of the franchise which is furious speed violence freaky characters as well as rough handmade action scenes with extraordinary vehicles and amidst all this accelerated ferocity he still found one or two quiet moments for character development narrative depth and beautiful even poetical imagerytom hardy is an excellent replacement for mel gibson who would be too old for the role by now and charlize theron gives a worthy female counterpart as furiosa she is smart and strong and not the only woman in this movie who steps up to the men in a harsh misogynic postapocalyptic wastelandthe score the drums the electric guitars its bombastic this is how an action movie should feel like,reality
simply outstanding cinema experience worth the 3d admission beautifully shot by miller and acted by cast the special effects are breathtaking and the films scope operatic i really enjoyed nicholas hault abbey lee and riley keoughs performances and the villain hugh keaybyrne was decidedly bonkers the desert chase sequences are truly jawdropping and should be watched on the big screen to take it all in in the last decade not since nolans inception has the the blockbuster format been so well utilizer as a visual artform fury road will be mimicked for years to come highly recommended i am looking forward to a repeat viewing,reality
fury road starts off with an insane view of the nowbarren landscape and that is perhaps the only point during the film where you can take a breath and soak in the sights what follows is two hours of breathtaking action and surprisingly coherent layer of drama that ties the movie together other reviewers have written about the creativity and novelty exhibited in the action sequences so i will not get into them they are all memorable and topnotch what george miller has possibly achieved with this film is far more greater focusing on the strong core elements of the story that make this much more than a 150 million summer blockbuster the franchise is about a postapocalyptic earth where there is little reason to hope and precious little means to survive but it is also about the consequences of human greed and the power struggle that overcomes a person beyond the cost of his or her existence why share something when you can control it and rule off of itthe acting from the female cast is brilliant and is ably led by charlize theron in her second postapocalyptic outing after the road tom hardy exudes a quiet intensity through his eyes but unlike the gibson movies is given precious little to do in terms of acting maybe the plan is to save his role for a future sequel the background score is pretty intense and never feels out of place in a crazy movie experience full marks to this one and let a summer of moviedom commence,reality
ill begin by saying i loved the old movies loved watching them as a kid watched them so mush that i just couldnt anymore lol and i have waited so long for another one to come out for many years when i heard about this movie i was excited but had to deal with the long wait for it to hit the movie theater and when it did boy what a day what a lovely day it instantly became my favorite movie the only thing i can say about fury road is that it is nearly nonstop action from beginning to end its insane and i loved it if i had the money id see it a few more times the vehicle are awesome they are what you would expect in a battle driven apocalypse wasteland and there are some you may not expect the plot for the movie was short sweet and had a twist or two the characters and acting was great they drove the story like they stole it and never crashed once im sure they may have a few times but we will see that in the making or gag reels the wasteland was even awesome and a offroaders dream anyways if you are thinking about going to see this movie then just walk away get out of here and go see it,reality
ok so to start off i didnt really click with this movie at the beginning i was actually quite bored and it was just a bunch of stuff happening i was like what is going on right now haha but once it got into it and by the end i was loving it it was really good i absolutely loved the characters all of them i loved the look of the main bad guy he looked amazing and i think the character that stole the show even tho he wasnt in it a heck of a lot was that awesome guitar guy attached to the front of that truck y  i dont know haha but he was pretty cool the story line was good and there are a few wow i cant believe that actually happened moments like i cant believe they actually did that but yea over all it was a good full on action packed movie right from start to finish literally,reality
the movie has got brilliant action scenes  breathtaking action sequence daring change of charlize thorny  some good voice of hardy and a robust bg scorebut the movie keeps u so focused in action scenes tat u dont get to know tat the plot is not strong enoughyoull love it in all way from action to girlssome of the good movie released this summerwant a plentiful o action with cars and flames and girls and half life people and hardy and chasing  this is your right pick for nowit has good action comedy scenesexcellent acting by houltafter warm bodies  he took a great rolethe entire crew of half life and their team work was goodbut couldnt understand the logic of the acceptance of hardy and his team after their king is dead,reality
first off i need to state how much i cant stand that imdb lets anyone rate movies before their release dateanywaysi liked this movieif you are looking for an in depth plot look somewhere else if you are looking for 5 star acting look somewhere else if you are looking for a fun friday night action flick watch the good the cinematography in is down right amazing blends gorgeous landscapes and gritty bad ass vehicles better than any movie in its genre the explosions are amazing and the roar of the engines feel just as good the actors feel like they fit in the setting and the struggle to survive is seen throughout every characterthe bad acting is sub par the random scenes of emotion felt out of place not much of a plot line likable characters but not attachableby far the worst aspect of this film was himself he just didnt feel like honestly he didnt even feel like the main character all in all i gave this movie a 7 out of 10watch with some friends and enjoy the carnage,reality
what a terrific movie as a fan of the first 3 movies i was not expecting what i saw in this one this movie can stand on its own but is very enjoyable to franchise lovers as well there are a lot of little water eggs from the previous movies that are great additions also this is the most gunaccurate movie i have seen in years im pretty picky when it comes to firearms in movies and get peeved easily at them this movie did everything right proper nomenclature gun manipulation and no added cocking sounds whoever managed the firearms on set knew what they were doing they clearly shoot guns and know how to use them its refreshing to find a movie that does it right,reality
i think ill begin with what fury road gets wrong because theres not much if youre looking for a film that contains thoughtful and provocative themes youre in the wrong place if youre looking for character development and plot exposition youre in the wrong place if youre looking for motivation in your villain that you can relate to on an emotional or psychological level youre in the wrong place if youre looking for a swaggering charismatic hero who spouts oneliners not that theres anything inherently wrong with that youre in the wrong place but honestly whos looking for that in a moviewithout a doubt fury road delivers exactly what was promised incredible long pulsepounding action sequences frantic cinematography gorgeous yet practical visual effects and steady stable performances by hardy and theron juxtaposed beautifully against the unbridled overthetop madness of the horde that relentlessly pursues themin short everything you could ever possibly want in a filmin terms of the performances i must admit that i had my reservations in regard to how theron and hardy would fare in this film particularly with theron as i had never seen her in a film like this i have to say that i was pleased with both therons portrayal of furiosa as a tough yet sensitive warrior for basic human rights while a bit of a clich these days was more than adequate for this film and endearing in its own right as far as hardys portrayal as or more specifically the role that was written for him i felt it was both different and fresh yet true to form for the iconic role says very little mostly mumbling throughout the scenes in fact spending a surprising amount of the films time literally muzzled his cold stare across the desert sands is really the main prerequisite for and hardy does it well he wont win any oscars for the performance but he does the role justice its kind of refreshing really to watch the hero play second fiddle to his female lead and just kind of stand to the side and let the action speak for itselfwhat really impressed me the most about the film was the fact that i think its very clear exactly what kind of movie george miller wanted to make its 85 action sequences basically being equivalent to a twohour long car chase an apocalyptic demolition derby in the desert and although the action begins to peter off by the third act of the film or rather seem less profound perhaps for a film to go as hard as it does for as long as it does is definitely noteworthy our hero speaks mainly in mumbles and takes a back seat in my opinion to furiosa and the film uses mostly practical visual effects which im sad to say is against the norm in todays film making a welcome change that i hope echoes into other films it doesnt really break any new ground but its operation within the parameters of the kind of movie that we would expect is nearly flawlessbottom line george miller takes risks delivering a movie like this to the cynical film audiences of today and it pays off big this film is long on action visuals and bonecrunching sound and short on pretty much anything else and thats perfectly fine with me its been thirty years welcome back we missed you,reality
i was lucky enough to catch an advanced screening of this movie after  watching the trailer i was really excited to see this movie and it did  live up to my expectations to a certain extent  tom hardy is a cop on the run in a postapocalyptic world which  is now a barren wasteland he is captured by captain immortan joe and  his gang for his blood there they seek to turn him into one of their  own by branding him immortan is an evil lord in charge of the only  water and oil supply he uses his reserves as a means of power over  other humans and he has a large gang war boys to keep everyone in  check  furiosa charlize theron is working for immortan but then decides to  make a run for it with a few other women fertile women are in a short  supply as well to a greener land she makes the escape in a truck  filled with 3000 gallons of guzzling water or oil to make a deal with  a small pack of motorcycle riders in the desert  as she is chased by immortans gang she unwittingly takes who then  offers her help to escape the gang the rest of the movie is then set  of the various chase scenes and the attempts of furiosa and the  girls to escape to the green land  the cinematography and the visual imagery is certainly stunning worth  experiencing on an iscreen the chase scenes and the landscape  especially a few scenes in moonlight were absolutely amazing the  various concoctions of war vehicles is amazing as well there were a  few elements of humor as well paired with some really weird things  womens milk supply the various outfits and characters including a  guy playing a fire breathing electric guitar throughout the chase  scenes the music definitely adds to the atmosphere as well not to  mention the various stunts the action really gets crazy towards the  end  on the other hand there were some things i found lacking character  development is certainly missing and theres definitely nothing  significant there to make a connection with the various characters the  dialogue is ordinary and clich the ending is predictable and certain  things dont make sense like how a gang with tons of ammo and better  equipped vehicles is unable to stop furiosa and  one thing is certain it was different and entertaining hence a 710,reality
was decent road warrior was pretty good thunderdome was ok this had great acting and a good plot,reality
a new revolution among action movies a masterpiece that everyone should watch,reality
this movie was beautifully shot and the overall cast was amazing action packed and did not disappoint,reality
i agree with the opinion that its just a superficial action movie that lacks depththe whole movie story could be put in one sentence  just a bunch of cars driving up and down the desert too much effort on the look of the cars looks very superficial take and no effort on the story what a shame and by the way that guy with the guitar  idiotic how this movie gets such a high rating is a mistery to me,reality
i thought this movie was not worthy of the name there was plenty of action but no thought on story line or character development a couple of the supporting characters die off and there is no impact the story line was rubbish basically it was lets run away from the bad guy oh well we have to turn around and go back i thought the actor who played was a good choice and i would like to see him being able to play again but with a better script and story line,reality
this was a bad movie in an exciting package i am really surprised about this high score people give it this movie is all action and no story or depth anywhere in it now dont get me wrong i absolutely loved the action scenes the practical effects look so amazing and it is the best action i have seen in years and that is it that is the movie there is literally no story they drive to point a pick up some random woman drive back for well no reason at all other then to get another encounter with the enemy but at least we have interesting characters to watch oh wait we dont the characters have no backstory any life in them or any sense of purpose other then fighting the enemy or look pretty for the camera the action scenes had me hyped but the rest of movie was just a challenge not to fall asleep fun to watch for the action scenes but that is a bout it,reality
it just seemed like one long car chase with no character build up it doesnt hold a patch on the first ,reality
i love this movie because the outstanding action is so rewatchable i have seen fury road at least 10 times now and it is just as awesome every time i watch it while the movie is called the true protagonist is furiosa and her fight for redemption is just there for the most part still tom hardy brings a likeable charm to the character that keeps the fighting riveting most people have stated that while the movie is enjoyable and thrill enduring the plot is very thin i like to think that while the main plot is thin so much is going on that it truly doesnt matter such action and beautiful set pieces bring joy even if it is a basic plot overall this is the sole movie i have given a 1010 and it deserves it best movie ever,reality
i really do not know what i expected but i reallized i just do not like movies at all it is probably one of the most pointless movies i have ever seen technically it is a very well done movie visually probably 910 and the acting is also 910 but this is not enough for me you can really just sum up the story in one sentence i really do not understand why so many people do like this movie i really just is nothing special anymore i really dont get it,reality
well in my assessment i found the movie road of fury a movie full of action and adventure with a very good story the scene of action with cars in the middle of the undesirable and too much the actors acted very well the scenesi liked it very muchi want director keep producing another ,reality
a surprising excellent v20 i had low expectations going into this remake knowing its missing mr  mel gibson but i was pleasantly surprisedexcellent visuals and all star cast and although tom hardy was excellent i still would have loved to see mel gibson reprise his roleits kind of like ordering your tasty mcnuggets but getting no dipping sauce with themstill a surprisingly 1010 from me,reality
remarkable for its stunning visuals fury road is part of the canon that started with mel gibson tom hardy plays in this film but his role is overshadowed by charlize therons performance as imperator furiosa a driver for a tribal warlord she goes rogue stealing his property and dashing through the desert hoping to find freedom and sanctuarythis is an action film that is nearly nonstop action the story has twists that prolong the suspense so the chase never becomes boringwith stylistic references to snowpiercer star wars dune star wars and gladiator films fury road is basically a retooling of the classic western imagine the wagon train speeding for safety while being chased by the indian war partythe dystopian setting for the film is a brutal world where those who control the resources have all the power theron does a great job of portraying the tough warrior who can survive in such a world her physicality is totally believable and the product of months of training undoubtedly aided by her dance traininghardy provides a strong performance but the script especially in the beginning inhibits his ability to express himself the mythology of this film is pervasive and convincing the settings costuming and the design elements combined with a dramatic and impressive soundtrack make fury road a beautifully choreographed dance of death the editing is tremendous deserving of the oscar one of six awarded to this film,reality
people who are critical of this movie im guessing in large dont understand what a movie is or were never fans of the original franchise in the first place if youre expecting a deep profound study on human behavior and richly developed characters youll have to look elsewherewas never this nor does it pretend to be is a hit you in the face rollercoaster ride of an action movie set in a scifi post apocalyptic future world the elements of this movie are quite simple just like the first 3 installments fast paced violent action centered around situation survival complex character development and rich dialogue arent needed here nor does the film suffer from it fury road like its predecessors doesnt pretend to be anything other than what it simply is and thats the beauty of this movie in a cinematic landscape full of thought provoking profound films that often tend to be too highbrow for their own good fury road was a welcome breath of fresh air a guilty pleasure i loved every minute ofit should go without saying that the special effects action sequences editing and cinematography here were top notchthe academy agreed as well giving this film nominations and awards in many of those categories frankly based on the weak competition that year i feel the only reason fury road didnt receive best picture was because the academy didnt have the stones yet to give it to a film like sure this wasnt any thoughtful film with a deep and profound message nor was it claimed to be but it was a damn good movie that blended all of its own elements together flawlessly to create an amazingly entertaining viewing experience and in my opinion it did so far better than any of its beat picture competitorsgeorge miller went out on a limb casting somebody other than mel gibson in the role of is certainly a movie character that is very strongly tied to the actor who portrayed him using mel in this film wouldnt have worked for a large number of reasons and miller knew this having said that the character of isnt a particularly complex or deep one had fewer than 20 lines of dialogue in the road warrior any number of actors could have pulled the role off reasonably competently but mel gibson did bring an important intangible quality to the role that made the character strong tom hardy was an excellent choice to replace mel gibson as he succeeded in bringing that same intangible value to the character if miller would have chosen a different actor who lacked this subtle quality he wouldnt have been able to pull it off nearly as well as he did nor would fans have been as accepting of the new lead hardy did a wonderful job as and i hope we see more of him in this role in future filmscharlize theron delivered her typical outstanding character performance here stealing every scene she was in she demonstrated why she is considered such an amazingly talented character actor able to handle such a wide spectrum of parts if youre a action sciif fan or if you just enjoy very well done films fury road is a must see,reality
i work in the south african film industry and im also an awardwinning screenwriter so i have the insiders perspective on film its with an industry professionals perspective that i sat down to see fury roada lot of my friends worked on this film during most of a year of principle photography in namibia on both sides of the camera and what a hell of a film it has turned out to be its a slapdash riproaring runaway ballstothewall anarchic rollercoaster juggernaut that rides roughshod ruthlessly and deliberately over pretty much every hallowed scriptwriting rule in the book then it throws them the finger in the rearview mirror as it roars away yet somehow it manages to get away with all of it its less of a film than a cataclysmic event and make no mistake its highly entertaining in the way of far too many hollywood blockbusters you might want to leave your brain at the door and dont worry about such niceties as sense or a plot because there is none yeah thats a major spoiler right there having said that theres no denying the entertainment value of fury roadthe downside of course is that if you begin to make a habit out of creating films with essentially no plots by shooting a bunch of footage and then trying to make a story out of it when you get to the editing stage then someone might start to think that scripts are redundant maybe even decide they dont need scriptwriters at all which couldnt be further from the truth but lets face it that has never stopped people in the past unfortunately i think this might be the beginning of a new phase in the film industry and im afraid that we might start to see an even greater dumbingdown if thats possible of hollywood film in general which is a crying shame because despite all the ways in which hollywood craps on film as a higher art and their habit of aiming their releases at the lowest common denominator they are still the biggest single influence on the medium and the hollywood tentpole films tend to define the genres in which theyre releasedso my 8 out of 10 is scored for high production values good performances decent music and high entertainment value but not for intelligent writing or direction,reality

id never seen any of the previous films but after everyone talking about it i decided to watch it the film is visually stunning with its particle affects adding to its art the film is an action film and often i get bored but keep me entertain all the way through the performances are great to although its called charlize theron carries the film with tom hardy only playing a secondary character he mumbles through the film but adding the madness of his character the way the future of this world is really good showing the type of world we could live in im not surprise how many oscar noms it has and welldeserved too,reality

modern remakes of thirtyyearold movies are often disappointing for many reasons one of those reasons im sure is that our expectations are higher  we want a movie that is not just as good as the original but better by thirtyyears worth of improvement in the art and science of cinematographyin this respect at least fury road confounds expectations it is better in almost every way than the originals theres no question that its thirty years ahead at least in the technological aspects of filmmaking problem is  the originals werent all that wonderful themselves no really they werent to be fair mel gibson did a decent job given the constraints of the writing and managed to make his character at least slightly believable  something that cant be said for tom hardy but thats probably not his fault given what he had to work withaside from mr gibson however the original films were pretty soso not the worst movies i ever wasted my youth on but not all that memorable either so it shouldnt be all that hard for a modern bigbudget movie to improve on them and mostly it doesrealizing that the original movies didnt have much of a plot to start with fury road seems to have decided not to bother with one at all what we get instead is a riot of fastpaced brutal violence in what seems to be a computerenhanced version of the australian bush the cinematography is utterly captivating  its impossible to look away as one alltooconvincing act of gratuitous violence follows anotherthere are some interesting peculiar touches however that suggest that this is a bit more than the usual bigbudget macho bullshit fandango first theres a measure of symbolism the whitefaced stunted characters that operate the tyrants machinery are strikingly similar to the subterranean workers in fritz langs metropolis langs workers depict the drudgery and soullessness that modern industrial society imposes on ordinary men and women fury roads mutants  or whatever they are  could be seen as playing a similar role like langs workers they are utterly disposable nothing more than a sacrifice to the great machine moloch in the characters search for the lost green place the film hints at our quest for a utopia that we know can never be achievedsecond the female heroine or antiheroine furiosa played by charlize theron has a physical disability this is shockingly rare in a mainstream movie even set in an environment where such things might be expected to be commonplacethird the attention to detail is incredible its so good in fact that you dont notice it there are so far as i can tell none of the distracting continuity errors that plague most blockbuster movies that are made for audiences with a fivesecond attention span if a character gets a bruise in one scene its still there in the next one props dont just appear out of nowhere this may seem a small point but in a cinema industry that is increasingly complacent and contemptuous of the audience it isntif fact given what it is its a great movie unfortunately what it is doesnt amount to all that much relentless fighting with no underlying human interest gets old very quickly i wouldnt have minded if the movie had been an hour shorter  everything it has to say could be said in an hour,reality
this film truly captured the spirit of the first to me but with charlize theron perfume commercial lady being the tough guy it is just amazing i mean hardy is the guy the tough guy but i think she is shown to be tougher odd i liked this it was really good too much violence for violence sake as in all films but still awesome the story line kept my interest lots of the crazy in it too hardy is almost too silent and not enough content from him theron is the enduring hero thoughwholly crap i guess she has done roles like this though the fire spitting vehicles crazy ruler tribal followers are all to the ,reality
the story is flimsy and the only thing that kept me from stopping to watch is the action the shots are good but its a nobrainer brain is not needed to watch it the actors did there best to keep the story going overall it kept me of the streets justmy conclusion 2 hours of action and thats allif you like an action pact timekiller this is the film i guessthe above was really what i wanted to say about fury road it wont get any better if i have to write 10 linesmaybe this film was not for me but it had a high score so i watched it,reality
imdb review section has been a solid source when it came to figure out what the movie is made of this time it is just way off with an 81 as off now but not only that it is either a 10 or a 1 what is to make of this first of all the movie is a solid action flick which lacks a credible story and a proper script the reputable actors can not save the day and with the exception of charlize theron the acting is not what it could have been tom hardy has no room to develop in this role that been said you might understand why i can not understand the extreme voting and none of which is accurate so here is my impression some people have figured out that having a high rating just helps them to get more attention and to fire up the hype serious reviewers dont give this flick the proper voting either because they feel they have to even out this unrighteous high voting result it seems the highvotingtrolls are trying to attack this system it wont help this movie to become better and even damages the whole industrie in the long term,reality
its a good idea making an all action movie thats all explosions and chasing but without a story it was just straight repetition i didnt love how there wasnt a story but there might not be one single scene that was boring i like the and furious movies better but this certainly could be just as good i think other people would like this more than me as i was personally tired while watching so that might have taken away from it but i would definitely recommend it to most people i would rate this a 6710 but you might give it a 10 perfect if you like exciting or action movies or if you just want to be entertained,reality
wasteland postappocalyptic world tom hardy original director of trilogy and the whooping score of ratings 8510 from 203536 users  too good to be real but let it be that good i love fallout carmageddon and everything that is postapocalytpic this is the closest thing of that magnitude i can get at the moment let the show begin6 minutes  starts with a high octane action right from the bat actually too fast and too much for my taste 13 minutes  disgusting and beautiful at the same time so much work have been put into this film it looks incredible 17 minutes  the amount of epicness and the imagination of the director is indescribable 22 minutes  this film is the visual description of craziness awesome 25 minutes  what a feast for eyes you watch it and cant get enough of it and it is constant high octane action of the best quality the only thing i dont like is tom hardy he does not fit in here 30 minutes  of a film and i could stand up and walk away satisfied with what i have seen so far this is how good it is 37 minutes  even the fighting scene looks on the highest possible level it is incredible what this film has achieved 51 minutes  up to now i have not mentioned the music and sound effects but they are sick as well 1h  how often does a sequel reboot or a remake of a film get better than original one of the best films in years 1h 3minutes  and i cant point even one single thing i do not like also the acting is superb like everything else to be honest 1h 32minutes  and it still surprises you with new action coming and coming 1h 40minutes  up until know i have not realised but there is almost no cgi bullsht minimised to bare minimum everything you see is real like in 90s great kudos for thatthere are almost none films i want to watch again after i finish them only the best of the best this is one of them the only thing i didnt like was the voice of tom hardy it sounds like it has been added in studio room cut off from all other sounds too clean and out of place like a narrationtgchans rating 910,reality
i recently saw the movie and like every movie i liked i logged in to imdb to read a little more about it i saw that overall has a very good rating when i open the reviews surprise i only saw 910 or 21 stars why is this i do not understand you sit down to watch a and you expect to see something else people is saying about the plot and the depth and things like that come on people is a movie its like wanting from a porn movie to have good dialogue and screenplay for me was 2 entertaining hours without a minute of boring time great music great stunts grate visuals in and a pace,reality
fury road is the definitive sequel to road warrior that thunderdome should have beenthe true star of the show are the vehicles all of which are practical and built for the purpose of the film and the world the survivors inhabit the visual style and aesthetic is beautiful to behold all of the characters are unique and well designed cgi is minimal reserved for the radioactive weather and a few shots when the road battles are taking place even the story which is more or less just a reworking of road warrior fused with thunderdome but on a much bigger scale is well executed too the imagery and imagination behind it is fantastic very inventive the dialogue is pretty good too hardys hes very subdued and underplayed here he takes a back seat in this film but the mm series was never really just about he was just the relatable conduit into the post apocalyptic world for the viewer so in that respect its definitely in keeping with the tone of the ot hardy does a good job of conveying the tortured but i will always prefer mel one thing i disliked was the batman voice tom uses seems all films try to copy that now the furiosa character very strong female lead even tougher and ballsy than shes the real hero of this movie in one scene she almost kills twice and if it wasnt for pure luck shed have killed him theres a really great moment when wrestles the gun off her and he shows her that he too could have pulled the trigger but doesnt its my fave part of the film had her in a position where he could have killed her and taken the war rigbut he was the bigger man refusing to kill unlike the heroine who as no qualms about killing which shows that despite his original quest for revenge as grown matured and evolved as a person even though he is tormented through his years in the post apocalyptic worldthe terminology used in the film is vintage mm phrases such as war rig war boy half life full life mothers milk gas town etc fans will recognise it and it fits perfectly with the world already established in the original filmscompared to most hollywood films ive seen in what oh at least the last 5 years its a masterpiece if there are flaws in it i couldnt spot them i think what makes it a cut above the average hollywood fodder that comes out now is the fact they got the original creator on board george miller a guy who can actually write a 3 act script and ensure that its directed properly all the scenes are executed flawlessly too the pacing is spot on none of the scenes or character interaction feels forced and there is no fast cut edits which give people headaches its just left to naturally unfold as it were theres no sloppy forced love sub plots here well there is a smallish one one of the breeder girls sort of gets the hots for one of the albino half life war boys that falls into their company who then sacrifices himself for them to escape at the end my one gripe because i need to find one is that the main villain who is the most original and unique villain of the whole mm universe immortan joe had to look that up on wiki thought it was immortal at least in the way he looks is killed off pretty easily at the end by furiosa that guy should have definitely been in the next movie which has been confirmed by miller to be in the pipeline and if that doesnt convince you to watch this film then i have three little words that will sway you to do soflame throwing guitaryes a flame throwing guitar and theres a war drum vehicle that is a huge subwoofer and most amazingly the vehicles are all real built for the film outstanding design and workmanship in their realisation in closing fury road is an excellent and well made addition to the universe it fits perfectly alongside road warrior in this age of rehashes reboots and rubbish cgi infested sequels and prequels fury road is a cut above the rest its great just to see a film that actually just tells a three act story and is paced correctly a piece of story telling that is well thought out and executed on screen to pitch perfection dont be expecting the lord of the rings plot wise its a simple tale but just the fact it is done right gives it an 8 out of 10 in my book,reality
i would recommend this movie to everyone it really is like nothing ive seen at the cinema before the movie is just a 2hour long car chase but its so much more than that tom hardy gives a brilliant performance without actually saying much and charlize theron who is the main character in many ways is equally as spectacular the plot is very simple the god guys are being chased by the bad guys but the action scenes are shot beautifully and watching hardy and theron in action together really is amazingthis is such a unique film and theres no doubt it will be remembered for many years to come easily in my top 10 favourite films of all time already do yourself a favour and see this unbelievably brilliant film,reality
fury road is exactly what i expected from a prequelreboot of the saga action from the beginning to the end with a dense emotional core which brings substance to the chases and creates interest for the laconic characters who say little but express a lot fury road basically consists on a 120minute chase in which the vehicles rarely stop however the perfect screenplay creates a fascinating dramatic arc for the main characters offering them emotional moments which end up being as memorable as the magnificent action sequences some examples thumbs up the bag of seeds an old ladys hussy smile they are very brief details but their accumulated impact makes the film hugely more satisfactory than other blockbusters full of special effects what takes me to the amazing chases and stunts from fury road director george miller has wide experience with these frantic chases through australian outback even though they were shot in the namibia desert this time having made the three previous films however it is possible that until now thanks to the invisible fusion of digital effects and practical stunts miller could finally translate what he had imagined many years ago and the result is truly extraordinary not only due to the explosions bodymachine combats and exuberant vehicles design but also because of the beautiful cinematography and absolute clarity in the flow of the action and the development of car battles even though we might have to call them otherwise because the only automobile recognizable as such is interceptor all the other vehicles are insane mechanical frankensteins each one of them more bizarre than the previous one and even like that beautiful in their twisted primordial aesthetic and then we have the excellent performances it can be said that the authentic leading role belongs to charlize theron as imperator furiosa with tom hardy in the supporting role of but i dont see the point of establishing hierarchies their characters are equally essential to the narrative and their perfect performances immediately capture us into their adventures and disadventures hugh keaysbyrne brings an appropriately grotesque attitude to the villain and i also liked the performances from rosie huntingtonwhitely riley keough abbey lee courtney eaton and zo kravitz on the beginning they seem to be employed as mere eye candy but eventually the actresses make those characters feel like credible human beings with well defined personalities something which hooks us even more into the narrative and makes this 2hour chase a genuine tale of freedom and personal redemption not to mention the strong feminist subtext which is apparently bothering some people i dont understand them but they are entitled to their opinion in conclusion fury road is a violent and somber movie but with abundant spirit and humanity which compensate the cruelty of postapocalyptic life this is definitely one of the best films i have seen in recent years not only because of the action and the characters but also because it triumphantly reestablishes a fascinating world which is simultaneously simple in its needs and complex in its evolution i hope fury road earns the necessary money to make the planned sequels become reality there is a lot of dramatic material to justify them besides i need more doses of visual poetry with claws and a flamethrower which never runs out of fuel,reality

the good out of all the 263 titles that i have rated on my imdb page only 8 of them have earned themselves a 1010 rating from me those movies are in no particular order the matrix back to the future star wars a new hope star wars the empire strikes back the good the bad and the ugly my 1 the lord of the rings return of the king cloud atlas and 2001 a space odyssey but jovan ol jolly ol chum why do you say this because my beautiful amigos i have a 9th to add to that list i really didnt think that this film would reach such a status you guessed it folksfury road is a masterpiece of cinemai honestly cannot believe it myself i am still speechless when i talk about it i dont know what to say first i cant even begin to describe what i even watched now that i can actually write my review and elaborate on what needed to be elaborated on i can finally put my thoughts to words not only is this probably movie of the year star wars is a top contender but it could be movie of the decade the action was mindblowingly awesome and the best part about it is that most of the stunts were practical as a film guy i always appreciate anything done in practical form also awards bonus points but for what i saw it was almost hard to believe that the stunts that were practical were practical of course there was cgi when it really called for it but if things could be done practically they were done so george miller is around 70 years old and he puts the whole entire fast  furious films to shame with these stunts everything was also shot excellently and i must add that fury road continues to prove that there is no need for shaky cam whatsoever to create a megaawesome pulsepounding action scene unlike bayformers of course when the action stops there needs to be dialogue and character development to further the plot and the characters were terrific not a single hollow character was seen in this film every character main and supporting protagonist and antagonist had at least one badass moment nobody was neglected for a second i also must start talking about the new spotlight character furiosa played by charlize theron she stole a lot of scenes from but i had no complaints whatsoever because she was one of the coolest heroines in a film to date ripley from alien is still 1this films visuals are some of the coolest most badass most grotesque in any film to date character designs were excellent top notch and definitely worthy and the car designs oh my goodness the car designs are the coolest to date nothing beats these cars not even a fully pimped out fullyupgradedanything car in any video game can beat the designs in fury road unless the game coming later this year can rival them i mean theres a literal stage on wheels fully rigged out with speakers with one guy on a custom electric guitar that can shoot flames out of its neck how much more metal can you get the soundtrack i almost forgot to mention but now that ive been reminded i cannot get it out of my head the soundtrack is also fantastic its composed by junkie xl and he did a fantastic job capturing the pulsepounding action of fury roadthe pacing was great sound design was excellent trailers were some of the best in a long time and i love this goddamn movieat this point im just gonna start rambling so ontothe bad no film is perfect as many of you may know and there probably never will be a perfect movie with zero faults my main concern is tom hardys portrayal of the character i dont know if he was trying to pull off an aussie accent but at some parts i could feel a baneey tone coming from him thankfully this wasnt consistent im actually happy with toms but he couldve done better a lot better mel gibson still stands as the og and best there will ever be speaking of aussie accents i am happy to at least hear more than 10 characters speak in the straya tongue but the mains like charlize theron and nicholas hoult shouldve at least try to go for an aussie accent i really hope that this can be addressed because were in the aussie outback for christs sakethe conclusion fury road is now marked as the best sequel and return to form of any franchise ever and it more than deserves this 1010 that it gets i saw this film in iand i cannot recommend enough that you go see it there too the movie was made for 3d,reality
intense visceral perverse brutal exhilarating  fury road is all of these and much morea simple storyline without any frills or backstory the movie grabs you right from the start and doesnt let go set in a dystopian future where wars are being fought over water the movie follows imperator furiosa charlize theron as she attempts to escape from the clutches of the despotic immortan joe hugh keysbyrnes taking his harem along with her of course immortan finds out and proceeds to unleash an allout pursuit of furiosa and his harem of five wives so where does come in you may ask well the fact is that the titular rockatansky tom hardy actually plays second fiddle in this movie it must have taken hardy a certain amount of courage to play an iconic role that ends up being secondary to that of the female protagonist the movie has a strong yet nonstrident feminist tone that does not detract from the rest of the action and seems like a very natural extension of it the movie opens with a highoctane chase when immortan joes war boys take captive in the citadel on finding out that he is a universal blood donor they hook him up as a blood bag to nux nicholas hoult a war boy afflicted by tumors and therefore running on halflife still hooked up is taken along in pursuit of furiosa during which he is able to escape antagonists at first furiosa and become allies in their quest for the green place her homeland every highintensity chase sequence is immediately followed by a higherintensity one every time you think that it cant get any better it does every time you feel that you can now start breathing something else comes along to knock the breath out of your lungs the best part is that there is no shakycam or inyour facecam which is what passes for action nowadays the action sequences actually seem credible and effectively tread the fine line between glorious spectacle and complete insanity theres actually a pretty good reason for this  it seems that the use of cgi was kept to a minimum and stuntmen were used as far as possible the movie is not just highoctane action and incredible pursuit vehicles the themes of freedom sacrifice and redemption form a strong emotional core for the movie stellar performances from theron hardy and hoult elevate this to much more than a mindless action flick hardys monosyllabic is tortured by a past he cannot forget while theron is splendid as furiosa willing to kill and die for a childhood utopia she can barely remember hoult is unexpectedly able as nux in a role that calls for equal amounts of viciousness and tenderness no matter how high your expectations are believe me this movie will meet them all and then somewhat a day what a lovely day,reality
whether it is the beautiful cinematography and stunt work that fuel the incredible action sequences or the surprisingly welldone dramatic content infused among the onscreen insanity you simply cannot take your eyes off of fury road george millers labor of love was released earlier this year in may but due to extremely unfortunate circumstances i was unable to see it as intended in cinemas shrunken down onto a 55 television with a suitable surround sound setup the film manages to offer an incredible experience nonetheless considering the genre at hand here you know what to expect or do you miller has created one of the most exquisite action films i have ever seen easily rivaling the likes of classics like die hard or t2 im being absolutely serious i credit my intense appreciation of the film to many things the first of which being the absurd amount of practicality that beautiful explosion you just saw was real and it lends to a feeling of rawness and authenticity that very few other action films have achieved this man knows that a wideangle shot of a practical stunt is much more engaging than an actor interacting with a green screen in your typical blockbuster resulting in lifeless action and he pulls it off effortlessly watch as a warboy throws a dynamitetipped spear into a rival car and it be destroyed in extravagant fashion with a beautiful color filter highlighting the billows of fire and smoke that fly from within action bliss but amidst the incredible sequences of fury and fire there is a strict moral compass for the main character while this is a film this is imperator furiosas ride portrayed rather brilliantly by charlize theron she is a fiercely independent woman with a rebellious and righteous mindset she will not continue to stand for the oppression that our main baddie immortan joe has placed upon the people of the wasteland and this is seen through her desperate protection of a particular group of the oppressed you really care about this mission as you learn about her motivations and it places a great amount of thematic drama at the center of the action setpieces there is a sense of urgency to her actions heightened by the incredible spectacle placed into the filmas for the title character rockatansky he is done justice in more than a few ways obviously it hinges upon tom hardys performance and although the script does not demand too many lines of dialogue from him he does a fantastic job mostly dependent on excellent use of emotion from simple facial expressions this film appreciates the image speaking of the script it had the bright idea of being at the short end of the stick haunted by his past memories of failing to protect those he loves he has become mostly broken and destroyed and is rarely firing on all cylinders without any sort of advantage throughout the movie he is a very vulnerable and human hero and the film is much better for it the tension is ramped up to an alltime high due to the constant adversity faces by the time is granted a moment to catch his breath he is pitted with the decision to either join furiosas cause and continue to deepen the consequences termed by immortan joe or return to the madmans clutches who may grant him a small possibility of redemption into this wastelandthis movie simply does not break the immersion into this world making the trip one you will remember and one you will compare to future action titles the rather seamless pacing despite a minor hiccup in the second act keeps the experience going along at a fantastic pace simply put the action is exhilarating and rich the performances are much more grounded and subdued than any typical action film has the right to attain and the passion for filmmaking put on display for our actionhungry brains is absolutely impeccable this is what action movies are meant to be this one shows us the impostors that have hidden in plain sight for years now at least someone in hollywood is listening to our pleads and cries for action that returns to the roots of its onceremembered ferocity mr miller you are that someone and i couldnt be more excited for the future state of action filmmaking as for right now though we can enjoy this modern classic in all of its relentless glory,reality
fury road stars tom hardy in the title role of along with charlize theron as imperator furiosa this film features a fairly simple premise two rebels unite in order to escape the tyranny of an evil ruler who goes by the name of immortan joetom hardy has long since established that he can be an action star in great films like inception and the dark knight rises but as we get something a bit different hardys character requires him to become believable to us without an overload of dialogue or the use of flashbacks midmovie and yes it is a success through the use of actions speak louder than words we follow in a chase scene from the beginning and we are immediately invested in how his character will fare against the bad guys no thirtyminute epilogue requiredwhile tom hardy may play the title character this is truly charlize therons film much like we arent introduced to furiosa through the long and timeconsuming usual process we are just dropped right into her story and she takes the movie over rather quickly from the first moment that the villain is introduced we completely understand why furiosa is taking the course of action that she is theron has always struck me as a fine actress and definitely an action star but her role in this film took her to a whole new level on both countsfury road features a great deal more than two fine acting performances with likable characters though as it will without a doubt be one of the most visually beautiful movies to enter theaters all year yes it is greatly in a wasteland but it isnt just any boring greenscreened desert youd find in some other movies something about the way that the scenery and landscapes are shot just adds so much to the film as a whole because it draws the audience in in a way that almost feels like its members are also in search of a place unharmed by the wasteland along with the films characters along with the scenery the action sequences are wonderfully shot also a complaint that many people including myself have with certain action films now is that theres no possible way of following what on earth is happening during action sequences because of the way they are shot they are difficult to follow and you have no idea where anything is exactly taking place in fury road with the way the sequences are shot these problems are not present with quite a great deal going on in each action scene its very difficult to get lost with what exactly is happening because of how the film is presented to the audiencewhile the action sequences alone are enough to get just about anyone excited another excellent puzzle piece this film has to offer to amp up the excitement is the music it is nearly impossible to not feel the tension build as the antagonists group of vehicles are in pursuit of furiosa and company but that tension is coupled with intense bloodpumping music that is being played on a vehicle with drummers and a guitar player by itself insane the purpose of this was no doubt to also excite joes pack of vehicles but instead does just as much for the audiencewhile everything in this film is unbelievable the main thing that is absolutely breathtaking is that the effects are for the most part practical to see just ten percent alone of the things in this film and think wait that was not a computer doing all the work is mindblowing even more mindblowing is the fact that its far more than ten percent of the movie finally no cgi fire effects or a computer taking the place of makeup artistsfury road is made with a feel of dedication both with that of the franchise and that of the obligation to give the audience a wellearned great film in a world full of reboots and sequels fury road will stand alone as not one fans of the original series will have to ignore later because it let them down george miller has brought his franchise back to life in a major way and created quite possibly the actionspectacle of the decade tom hardy sales yet again that he is a great action star and charlize theron shines in one of her grandest performances to date the involved created a magnificent action film that will without any doubt whatsoever be one of the most intense and gripping experiences that audiences will have in theaters all year,reality
okay im just going to be honest that i didnt watch the first three installments of and i wasnt too enthusiastic with scifi movies though its actually not i just prefer more realistic movies however after i finished fury road i enjoyed it very much fury road barely has a plot its actually very simple the characters travel from a to b then returns to a however its the visual effects that explain the whole story of fury road all of the little things in the movie are made delicately and is designed uniquely this highlights that things can still be beautiful even though its set in a wasteland i can guarantee that everything in the movie is exclusive and cant be found in any other movies the character development in fury road is done extremely well though there is not much on the talking throughout the movie you can see the development through their decisions actions and even through their facial impressions and thats what makes the characters stand out because every character has their own personalities i have nothing to doubt on the credibility of george millers directing its incredibly and beautifully filmed in most action movies that i have watched most of them failed on using shaky cam which is just a lazily filmed technique used in action movies however in fury road you cannot find a bit of shaky cam every shot is either filmed from a distance or set in a point it not only highlights the massive view but clarifies on every action of the characters the sound effects sound magnificent just by themselves its explosively loud but in a good way though its filled with heavy metal it applies to the soundtrack extremely well overall fury road is action packed and explosively stunning fury road is so beautifully filmed that its close to flawless this is absolutely a masterpiece constructed by director george miller,reality
 fury road is a very good action movie that makes you realize that physical stunts give a kick that special effects just cant quite match no matter how good they are not that there isnt cgi here but during the chase that makes up the majority of the movie there is a sense that youre watching something real and tangible even if its taking place in an obviously fictional and farout contextthe context is a trek through the dusty postapocalyptic world seen in previous movies the original director returned for this george miller but thankfully the titular role is no longer filled by the deeply unsympathetic mel gibson who has been replaced by tom hardy funnily enough its not who takes the lead though hes mostly tagging along and ultimately helping out in a story revolving around imperator furiosa charlize theron whom he begrudgingly becomes an ally to this has made some of the fans of the series grumble but works really well for the movie it remains to be seen if could carry another movie by himself unless they go a lot deeper than simply painting him as a traumatized loner unable to move ontheron has received a lot of praise and it seems her role is headed for iconic female action star status on par with ripley from the alien movies i would be surprised if they dont make her part of the inevitable sequel assuming she doesnt get her own spinoff hilariously the focus on her and a few other strong women has made some insecure males get into a huff they dont like that someone has taken what should have been a total sausage fest in their opinion and has turned it into feminist propaganda again their opinion still as critics and audiences have embraced the movie in droves i doubt warner bros will care much about this wacky minoritythe movie is not flawless since it is basically one long chase with a few short breaks in between it does feel like there is some repetition going on but the trek gets peppered with enough variety that it doesnt really get old as said the reliance on stunts over special effects for the majority of the time makes the action more involving add some sly humor and weird vikinglike cultural proclivities witness me and the mix keeps you intrigued and entertained for the duration you may like or dislike some of the campier elements my personal highlight is the evil camps soundtrack truck which has four large drums on the back and a metalplaying guitarist on the front with a flamethrowing guitar suspended on bungee cordsthe ending seems a bit naive resolving things more neatly and faster than makes sense but because of the goodwill that the movie has created by that time by being thoroughly enjoyable you wont really care,reality
from the moment this relentlessly paced film begins it never lets you go the rapid editing and pacing makes the whole experience from start to finish invigorating george millers trademark method of speeding up fight scenes has never looked so good amid the gloriously bombastic setpieces the tumultuous and cartoonish personalities the characters embody are very pleasurable rectifying any overseriousness that the film may inhabit and the action scenes arewellrevolutionary most of the action in this film mixes itself up and tries to take fresh turns i was very surprised at how varied the deaths were crazies perish by explosions crushing falls gunshots and stabs in magnificent scenes that comprise most of the film people complaining about the plot is very silly this is a film to experience much like gravity or birdman it feels like its got the fluidity and excitement in its one scenario while adding emotion to their unwantedly twistfilled stories charlize therons character adds emotion to the mix and tom hardys portrayal of adds a gritty and mysterious depth that mel gibson couldnt bring to the table overall this is an intense visceral and highly entertaining film that may be the years best so far,reality
saviour of the summer action movies this movie totally blew me off i had zero expectations and i have to confess that i have seen original so many years ago that i barely remember anything from it after being hugely let down by avengers  age of ultron i also didnt have much hope for this one trailer looked like one boring chase across the desert and i usually dont like any car chaseshowever this movie is pure rock and roll pure raw energy if you are looking for some great conversation and deep thoughts from a movie then this one is not for you but you feel that you just want to buckle up and ride the ride then go for it probably the best action movie of the year even if there are some good candidates coming up,reality
just as my title suggests i felt everybody else in this movie was except tom hardy his character was just plain  overshadowed by furiosas character charlize theron she seemed to be the main character in the entire movie out to save the day with playing a supporting actor seriously except a couple of dialogues and plain fighting that too overshadowed by furiosa there is nothing that did in the movie to consider him as weak storyline but enjoyed the music and the desert chase of vehicles that is the only thing you will see in the entire movieoverall i feel this is a onetime watch movie so you can give it a shot,reality
wonderful photograph an electrifying story characters who steal the film but they know to share the screen miller youre a master you can do happy feet and this masterpiece charlize has a fascinating performance and tom hardy is a more humane that gibson has very good looks and seems to have improved his performance every days the film does not let you rest and two hours fly by i really recommend it for those who enjoyed the first three films and for the young people who come to know the universe of miller i went with my daughter aged sixteen and was fascinated a world that can dream but the film shows what a surreal grandeur and rawness that can not imagine,reality
avengers was decent but was amazing i left the theater wanting more explosions blood killing nonstop action amazing stunts and driving scenes explosions soundtrack as awesome matching up i was on the edge of my seat the entire movie no idea what was about to happen next great character development great makeup and costume designs action scenes were some of the best if not the best i have ever seen cinematography was phenomenal you left as feeling you were there in each location go 3d if you goit was made for the effects great ending i hope george miller comes back for another round of madness,reality
theres no way to give less than 10 stars if i would do that i would be unfair because movies are getting hard to made as almost all stories had been told before in all imaginable ways  so when you watch in 2015 a movie that made you feel some heart pounding and that movie made you enter a new believable stylish amazing surreal barbarian but beautiful world you have to surrender i didnt felling that for some time i would sayits a kind of indiana jones star wars mixed up with the best of road warriori am amazed by how some people are complaining that theres little dialog because its part of the beauty it is a painted picture a story told by images and theres a lot of subtext over the images i like mel gibson as actor and director but the new guy has the sight the madness the biotype of what i feel more happy is for george miller the man fought against the odds to bring this to the screen some time ago this movie was destiny to fail and now the reviews put it into classic status well this is not a broad audience movie i recommend if you are fan of robocop conan the barbarian heavy metal cars adventurenow the film is a cult i just want not to wait many years to see the next,reality
what a beautiful piece of modern entertainment although george miller decides to completely abandon any narrative structure and apparently didnt even have a script but just a storyboard when he started the project he has crafted an energetic character driven story that simply interests you from the first to the last minute charlize is absolutely brilliant but its not the individuals its the powerfully orchestrated summary of all players and elements that makes fury road an instant classic i especially loved the music the original films somehow got lost in the style and stardom of the 80ties fury road translates the franchise into a 21st century context while at the same time preserving the essence of the original and probably good choice not to recast mel gibson chapeau,reality
fury road is directed by george miller and stars tom hardy charlize theron nicholas hoult and hugh keaysbyrne and tells the story of a woman who rebels against a tyrannical ruler in postapocalyptic australia in search for her homeland with the help of a group of female prisoners a psychotic worshiper and a drifter named fury road is one of the better action movies ive ever seen and it has now become one of my favorite action films of all time the action is breathtaking and visually stunning george millers directing is beyond superb deserving of his oscar nomination the cast is pretty solid tom hardy was the right actor to taking over the iconic character that is originally portrayed by mel gibson charlize theron portrayal of the female truck driver imperator furiosa was very well handled although i cant really find a major flaw in the film i wasnt always invested in the overall the plot or in the characters therefore not giving it a perfect 1010fury road is a visual and stunning film and deserves to be seen on a big screen with a great sound system,reality
this is an excellent addition to the postapocalyptic beyond dystopian world of there seems to be an organized effort to downgrade this fine movies user rating judging by all the onestar reviews belowbut no amount of myopic hatechatter can change the fact that this is filmmaking at the highest level and the message we are headed for a world where the only things that matter are petrol water and milk is compellingthe effects are mostly practical which is refreshing and the stuntwork is mindbogglingnone of that would matter if the story and acting were not at a high level but charlize theron and tom hardy are excellentso dont believe the haters anytime you see onestar reviews it should send up red flags that a campaign of disinformation has been organized why who knows,reality
fury road is directed by george miller the director of the original trilogy and stars tom hardy as rockatansky and charlize theron as imperator furiosa this movie hit theaters on may 15 2015 and i made the stupid decision of waiting until february 2 of 2016 until i saw it after renting it from redbox i really regret not seeing it in theaters this was definitely one of the best movies of 2015to start fury road was beautiful the cinematography was absolutely amazing especially combined with the amazing wide shots that george miller used throughout most of the movie to capture all of the action while still focusing on our heroes the second great thing is the acting tom hardy definitely lived up to gibsons however didnt exceed it which interested me he did as good yet gibson is still charlize theron also did really good which surprised me because ive never seen her in a role like this beforeanother thing great about this movie is the action factor this movie lives up or even exceeds action movie legends such as predator the matrix or the dark knight although there are breathing points the action is nonstop edge of your seat material i truly feel that this movie will later be compared to movies such as t2 or die hardalthough ive done nothing but praise it there is one bad trait about this movie its substance i would say this films equal to the road warrior but not better the reason being is the substance although fury road has much better and more action than the road warrior you dont get the relationships in it yes befriends furiosa and you can feel their friendship their but it isnt much when compared to the relationship between and the gyro captain from the road warriorout of the best picture nominations for this year i hope either fury road the martian or the revenant wins these three movies are all great and id be fine if any of them won the award they all really deservedespite its one problem fury road is a near flawless movie and i would give it an a or a 10 out of 10,reality
i am a fan of the first two entries of the franchise but i went into this one not expecting too much beyond hopefully good car action sequences this movie was visually quite amazing the way the wasteland isnt muted in color and is vibrant and almost bright fit better than i could have ever expected some of the camera techniques used i was also a fan of i thought they did well to fit the context of what was happening on screen and the score helped to emphasize that the score was another highlight very high octane forgive the use of octane and loved the drastic change from heavy riffs to heavy drums from one sequence to another i picked this film as my first review on imdb because it was that amazing to me its a very simple plot just as simple dialogue but the movie speaks volumes with its visual style and distinctive score the performances were top notch the one thing that i think stood out as maybe a universal negative were a few bad shots of cgi that stuck out in contrast to the practical effects used and to my knowledge cgi that was mostly used to enhance those beautiful backgrounds this is my first review period something to do to pass the time i will try to be as practical as possible if i dont understand something i wont pretend to i just wont write about it i will write about the things i enjoyed or didnt in films hopefully without winding up being someone who compares a fantasy film to a dramatic novel these are my opinions if you disagree cool if you agree cool i really dont care either way these reviews are to pass time not appease people who goto movies making an assessment before seeing it im also not a film expert and i dont care if you think you are just because you study film and the process of creating one does not make you an good at it plenty of people are horrible at their jobs they have been doing their whole lives thats why this is to pass time i dont think im that good at it but i enjoy films and im bored that said enjoyor not,reality

this is by far the best action film of the year a feast of action and drama fury road rips through conventional action movie norms to provide a visceral experience millers choice to use practical effects pays off well as the stuntmen and pyrotechnics deserve as much recognition as the perfect cast tom hardy is a man of few words but delivering none the less and giving a strong performance showing he is more than a worthy replacement for mel gibson it also provides plenty of strong female characters such as charlize theron who is pure power theres no secret here fury road delivers what is expected of it,reality
i love cinemaand fury road is an undiluted example of the formpure visual languagelike a painting i see here there are plenty that argue theres no story sure there is but its a sentence longwhich is just perfect for mei also love silent movies and one of the reasons i love this flick so much is that you do not need to know what anyone is sayingthe direction does it all for youmuch like kubrick and hitchcock this is pure action cinemaits rare that the genre gets turned into artbut make no mistakethats what is going on herethe color choicesframinglayers of costumingvehicle detailingevery facet of the production is pure artbeautiful and astounding this story is not about but about an adventure he was caught up ini loved this approachreally refreshingwhy cant furiosa be the star is still therewhats the big deal i see the negative reviews and feel sad for those that were unable to get behind george millers visioni think its a masterpiecearguably the greatest pure action movie in historyno talkingjust movementpure 100 cinema and its f glorious,reality
that is what my friend wrote to me when i proposed as a good choice for a night at the movies and on our way out he said it was one of his favorite movies of all time i have already seen all the previous films and will try to compare them with this fuel pumped masterpieceone of the downsides is that you really dont follow as much as i thought compared to the other films this was quite a change instead it lays a lot of weight on furiosa who i would assume was going to be the second main character of the film but it seems more like she is the main and is some sort of sightseer who is really just around and then again when has he not been that since the first movie of course he always does his part but think about it road warrior is about a group of survivors trying to fend of a gang of crazy or people and in beyond thunderdome it is about those weird cave kids who dont have parents for some reason unlike the first movie has always been some kind of mysterious figure who shows up when he is needed and from that point of view i think it is very well delivered in fury road but we would like to see more of him in upcoming sequels and please make sequelsthat is not to say that character is badly delivered that is a completely different talk watching tom hardy delivering the role of was an amazing experience the body language is done so well i wouldnt be surprised if he could explain the theory of evolution through it anyway jokes aside tom hardy knows how to be and it is great chalize theron acts out furiosa as a very cunning thoughtful and tough character to be fair everyone in the movie are tough no one are downright cowards just as you would expect from people in the wastelandnow i have heard a lot of people coming up with stuff like bad character development stupid plot and to be honest probably yes but that was the first thing i knew on the way out of the theater people would say stupid plot and of course it is it is about as kindly informs you over the start of the movie people reduced to the basics of humanity they are desperate that is why they go on a hellride through the wasteland and back again they hold onto whatever tiny bit of hope they got and that is a plot worth a watchand in terms of character development it is awesome we have nux the warboy striving for hero status and developing his character from there through the story learning about other things such as freedom and love and what is worth fighting for furiosa was born in some sort of green eden and that is where she wants to escape to with the women sex slaves she is determined it is this or death something inside her says it is justice in a world where it is needed the most the pace in the movie is simple and awesome it is a hundred miles per hours through the entire thing one thing can be said this movie is the wildest action movie ever produced it goes fast with stunning visuals fire and madness everywhere and it is brutal the movie has a very different character so maybe many people think it is overrated but i cannot imagine anyone going out of the theater without being a little impressed over the action it delivers because it is fking great 9 out of 10,reality
fury road is a movie about a post apocalyptic earth and rockatansky hardy reluctantly joins imperator furiosas theron crew to have a chance of survival against the relentless immortan joe keaysbyrne and nux hoult immortans former slave just increases the intensity of the journeyit is a fun thrilling and adventurous movie possibly my favorite apocalyptic themed movie with suspense at every turn i really enjoyed how would be classed as an insane person in todays society but he was the most grounded character in the film and the producers very subtly showed us that was psychotic but simultaneously sane which is a very difficult task to achieve the chases with the trucks lorries and heavy artillery were very fascinating to watch since we are all used to the car chases with dodge chargers and bugattis in urban streets it was very refreshing to watch vehicle chases with hefty vehicles which dont move very quickly and cause lots of damage to its surroundings in the middle of the desert also the soundtrack and costumes were perfectly crafted everything felt authentic and suited the genre however a weakness in the plot was that we had no introduction to the earth before the apocalypse we have no idea of what happened and why the apocalypse occurredis a fantastic movie and would recommend it to any moviegoers grade  a,reality
the reason why was great was because it was all new low budget film created in an era that just started getting over movie censorship with completely unknown actors by completely unknown film makers and in a different style it shocked the studios it brought mel gibson almost accidentally in the film business and shot george miller through the stars the reason why it all happened in the desert was that it was an australian film and because it was cheaper it showed guts originality and created true art in an otherwise classic revenge scenariothe sequels were different better budgeted more post apocalyptic more action packed with more action and frankly that is what most people remember about unfortunatelyfury road is better acted better written and better directed by the same george miller the huge budget allowed for all types of wacky things but it was nothing but a rehashing of the two sequels it was not a reboot of but a reboot of the tribe car chase wacky racesall the well designed characters all the wonderful scenes filled with tension and nitro all the epic scenes of people worshiping the guy who gives them water by pouring it on the dry rocks they all fail when one imagines dastardly and muttley in one of those cars chasing the war rig the various weird vehicles and attack methods were just rehashes of scenes from 2 and 3 even the bad guy was a rehash from the original at least this might have worked back then in 81 and 85 but it doesnt work now it all looked so over the top that it was impossible to feel any real thing it was just like watching cartoonsbottom line the movie entertained me and it was better than average but i have to penalize it for wasting obvious talent in writing and acting on pointless scenes of ludicrous road carnage and on rehashing the silly part of the universe it gave people what they wanted but not what they needed and turned into yet another comic book character,reality
both good and badthats how i define this remakethe film is visually a joy it can not be denied his photography staging installation chase sequences are shot with force and showmanship by george miller no doubt its commitment to offer adrenalin pace and tone really delusional crazy and wildbut in counterpoint i have to say that history is guilty of being extremely simple he says pointlessthe film itself is silent a succession of stunts explosions amid a deafening noise but here its all over there is no real storytelling a sense of adventure emotion is as if they had been too afraid to be sliced head with an original story some witty dialog and situations that really impact no the whole film is a continuous evolution of sterile action the end usual with the dead and the living and bad heroes end not that i seek a philosophical film not a melodrama or anything like that but at least a story to tell me something i could get involved with the characters or with which they could identify but has not been well everything is pure artifice circus show for the masses a film seeking our approval with blows of effect as if to hypnotize us with their action tirelessly to not see the disturbingly empty content that really treasuresthe performances  charlize theron is notable for its makeover but his performance is all horrible poor lighting with little charisma and strength tom hardy is a flat actor head to toe is cold and not transmitting anything and certainly not reach wing gibson and soles of shoesbut i can not stop this new because the truth is that his delusional and crazy visual style of futuristic western his furious and wild rhythm well shot action gets my approval a very entertaining and estimable b series but nowhere near the i consider as they are already doing hundreds  a work of artno waybut i like it mind you,reality
long story short this movie is fun the story is too simple in fact its just one car chase stretched over two hours but its still fun detailed review for those who are interested this movie is an absolute visual treat the images of the film will stay in your head for weeks if not years if a world were ever to witness an apocalypse it will not look like the one in and muscle cars will probably not make it but dont think too much and enjoy the ride nux driving around as his bloodbag on his car is both hilarious and disturbing but these images stick with you this movie has what it takes to make that visual impact and even make smartphone addicts stop and look up most people would think that fury road is furiosas story and has no contribution to the film on an emotional level but this is not true the bedrock of this movie is the relationship between and furiosa i found this the most appealing aspect of the film i was afraid that there was going to be some unnecessary romance but their relationship is so much more than that its one of mutual respect admiration and even need of each other they have something bigger than romance they are truly comrades in war brothers or sisters in war of course this is hollywood and they may just screw this up in the sequel but right now i was just pleased to see such a platonic relationship between the two leads both tom hardy and charlize theron are in peak form in here however my personal favorite was nicholas hoults nux and furiosa seek redemption and are tortured by it and nux achieves redemption faster than them both he is a great comic relief which is surprising since he is a homicidal hormonal teenager but it works nux is also the medium through whom the director is communicating to the viewer how screwed up the wasteland of is he is the craziest character among the good people who are all normal he is the constant reminder to the viewer that this world has gone to hell also he says the iconic line what a day what a lovely day almost every time he attempts to kill himself to achieve glory in battle what a nutjob i like him the villain immortan joe is visually intimidating and some parallels analogy may be drawn about him being an abusive pimp who is trying to reclaim his property as he puts it this simple motivation is enough to make joe a bad guy and be hated sex trafficking is a theme quite prevalent in but its understated its upto the viewer to figure out in an otherwise starightforward movie joe on top of being all that is greedy too but the film doesnt focus much on that one of the things that really bothered me was that how easily nux turned on his former boss all it took was a red head supermodel it was quite lame why is furiosa even attempting such a wild mission warboys and the entire army of immortan joe are hormonal young men furiosa may just as well say  we got supermodels the best women for breeding on this wasteland here boys let us up bam immortan joe dead the boys let the girls in overall i liked the film my personal favorite film still remains the original 1979 because its still to date the only which shows character development wife and child die in that film and its referenced all throughout fury road via ptsd nightmarish visions of also mel gibson just does a better than tom hardy who is quite good himself but he doesnt portray enough of like gibson did over three movies,reality
charlize blows me away as imperator furiosa this was a great reboot of the earlier movies which met and exceeded the high speed mayhem of the earlier trio of movies the major difference to me was that the earlier movies had as the primary focus while fury road gives charlize nicholas hoult and many of the other actors a chance to shine and it works i was on the edge of my seat through most of the action which included most of the movie im guessing that if this makes enough there will at least be one other it might be interesting to see more of the destroyed world and some of the sharp contrasts that must exist,reality
one thing i noted while watching fury road was its simple story told with fascinating execution and commendable action scenes and that is the beauty of this film which was overstretched in the clibut was saved by outstanding scriptfury road is a followup to the hugely popular series in which is captured by cult leader immortan joe he gets the chance to runaway when joes imperator furiosa rescues wives imprisoned to joe it has been 30 years since george miller directed the highoctane series and he switched to kid flicks like happy feet and babe probably the inseparable love brought him back to the popular franchises and he gave his best as both director and writer the opening scene is probably one of the best scene with wellexecuted chasing scene will take away your breath away the story unfolds showing the desperate postapocalyptic phase with weird and crazy characters you would not even imagine in your life once the action rolls out there is no turning back this is probably nerve breaking  ears splitting and eventful action stunts which is jaw dropping hats off to both action director  stylish camera work and astounding art direction capturing the rough and tough terrain of namibia desert screenplay is engaging and will not let you blink for a second charlize theron carries the film on her shoulder she is indeed amazing and will be loved for her tough role tom hardy as is wasted an actor of his caliber should have better characterized nicholas hoult was surprisingly gooda kickass action which will pump up your adrenalin astounding 455,reality
after 30 years returns to big screen this time played by tom hardy who does do not do mel gibson but plays it on the same level that gibson played it on the film is so intense with its acting and action i mean it almost never lets uptom hardy finds himself helping a tough female named furiosacharlize theron who is trying to get some females who are the wives of cult leader immortan joehugh keaysbyrne trying to get them to safety with joe not to farm from there trail the question is will they make it although it is titled fury road but is not the main focus its like he is a side character in his own movie charlize theron is basically the star and i liked her tough female character and hugh keaysbyrne is pretty great has immortan joe playing another villain also nicholas hoult who i did not know it was him at first action scenes are the best youll see around george miller direction was incredible he knows the character better then any of us,reality
fury may just be my new favourite film mainly because it has epic action battles along with explosions and a fantastic plot that really didnt match the previous films this film only uses two special effects and they are for the dynamic weather in sand storms tom hardy did a very good performance again but that wasnt performance the best performance came from charlize theron and nicholas hoult and the fact that this film has strong women makes me like it even more because i just love when a woman can fight her own battles if you dont know the plot basically it is an australian post apocalyptic film series set in the desert so many years after civilization the first three films with mel gibson were just as good as this was when i first watched the trailer i saw all the action that it had but i never thought that seeing on the big screen could be so epic but it would have been better in 3d three points on why this film is awesome and spectacular and well a must watch warning spoilers1 epic story and scripting the script in this film couldnt have been any better and it fit in well with the postapocalyptic setting george miller wrote the script just right for this film i also love the fact that there isnt much dialog in the film but the dialog you do get is just wonderful and story driven in such an amazing way2 setting the setting of the film is in the desert around 45 years after civilization has ended and there are just a few thousand survivors left and they must do their bit to survive and also fight the people in the film are starving and thirsty and ruled by a kind of dictator who keeps most of the water for himself and his five wives3 the third and final point is wonderful and brutal action sequences the action sequences in this are one of a kind with beautiful explosions and actors doing there own stunts and it all just looks very real the short dialog is definitely worth while because then you see five epic action sequences all ending in a few peoples deaths mainly from explosions the action sequences can range in time most of them very long but they are glorious to watch in full spectaclethose are my three points on why this film is absolutely awesome and a must watch there is a reason why critics loved it all in all this film is excellent and action packed in every way 1010 a must watch in all its action packed blood filled glory,reality
fast pace action and beautiful apocalyptic pictures i was perfectly satisfied with this movie i expected action but there was far more then i expected while the film keeps its insane speed there is some humor sprinkled invery strong female lead and a epic soundtrack  when you can hear it because of the loud engineswhile world of is very sandy this movie is full of beautiful scenes and images in orange and bluei recommend watching this on a big screen  go into your favorite movie theater because this needs loud speakers and above all a very big screen i watched in 3d which was fine but not necessarily better i believe,reality
i loved all the trailers for this movie in fact they were so good i was beginning to suspect that the actual film was going to subpar boy was i wrong this movie hit every button promised in the trailer stunts over the top action choreographed car chases and a small but engaging story line lets face it if you were going for a heart wrenching deeply moving story about a misunderstood man this aint it this is cars cars furiosa cars explosions women who can stand up to bad men cars and a killer storm thrown in even mel gibson would be approving this upgrade while it is rated r its on the tame side of r and that does not mean you can take your kids its still r be the responsible parent and enjoy this with your friends now with your kids when they are 18 i plan on seeing it a second time with some more friends,reality
thematic spoilers it has been 30 years since thunderdome and still roams the desertbut he is plagued by flashbacks visions and voices tom hardy plays formerly portrayed by mel gibson and charlize theron takes second billing as imperator furiosa the majority of this film involves vehicle chasing which most diehard fans will appreciate dozens of soupedup industrialized militarized and modified vehicles tear up the desert with a mix of explosions gunfire and flamethrowing the ongoing train of mechanized war machines are painted against a picturesque desert scene filled with dust storms and lightning flares as with the earlier films craning and tracking camera shots keep the action up front and intense even though is the title character the films secondary themes are those of fertility paternity and maternity has very few lines in the film which allows time for these secondary themes to take shape much like thunderdome fury road deals both with the innocence of the young as well as the desperation and conflict of the old this latest entry is probably the best of the series highly recommended do you smell that its aerosol inhalant and diesel fueland this is fury road,reality
honestly speaking i wasnt going to go to theater to watch it but the initial ratings had me wondering how can a movie which looks so full of wild looking people whole trailer filled with sand and other things mainly of the shade of orange and brown and every scene of the trailer shout at the top of its voice that it is just a chase can have a rating like this and also the meta scoreout of respect to meta critics and the trust over the people who rated it before me i went to check it out nobody in my circle for ready for this so i have to practically force some people to go with me and then they came out of the theater with satisfaction and respect of the ideathe idea behind this movie is to convert a car chase into a high octane thrilling jaw dropping and applauding sequence of action packed masterpiecethe actors were good like tom hardy has done a great job with a handful of dialogs given to him but the movie belongs to charlize theron her expressions were too good this movie from start to end present a chase on the road and nothing else but i have never experienced this feeling of satisfaction and admiration after watching a movie with such a little story i dont mean that there isnt anything worthwhile to follow during the film because their was but it wasnt the center of the movie the movie revolved around the action and violence every scene contained and not the storyi am glad that i watched it in theater and you should do so too would always be suggested in the greatest action movies from now on,reality
in a world desolate arid populated by horrible freaks driving amazing machines only the divine beauty of five women can redeem us or get us irremediably lost furyroad could be the most powerful feminist manifesto ever done by a man in fact in the last frantic george millers movie we have time just to give a glance at the beauty of all kind of women mothers accomplices lovers without them men are only arid souls in the wilderness exactly like rockatansky who lost the women he used to love his wife and daughter for the rest of you guys who love pure action crazy crashes amazing fx and unbelievable stunts dont worry has got all of it too and it rocks the picture is technically flawless and it try to give to a new generation of audience the same strong crazy visual impact that the original movies gave in the early 80s in that way we can say mission accomplished bravo geroge miller,reality
mmfury road has no pretenses of being anything other then what it is a nonstop over the top completely ludicrous thrill ride and very possibly the longest continuous car chase ever filmed with the early establishment that the enemy warriors travel with their own engineenabled rock band miller makes it clear that you are supposed to just suspend any hopes of plausibility and come along for the ride and if you do that its a great onethe movie does make some brave moves it dares to open with an easily defeated and clearly insane version of its a rare movie where the title character spends his first 30 min of movie time as a helpless victimin many ways however this movie isnt really about him he is just the traveler traveling through the situation while what plot and character growth there is all centers around those actually in the situation and if miller wants to make this a franchise that might be a good way to go make the perpetual outsiderobserver and let the stories be about the situations he discovers as he travelsif you are looking for deep story or characters though this isnt your movie if what you are looking for is goofy high octane violent spectacle the movie delivers in spades,reality
definitely something new visually impressive not much cartoon cgi but freaking exhausting there was only like a couple of lines of dialogue in the whole movie amazingly the plot progresses nevertheless you get invested in the characters and it works the pacing is brutal almost nonstop action suspense only problem for me was that it was almost about to go hollywood over the top ridiculous all the time it kinda did too and it was also legitimately funny at times but somehow the rest of the package redeemed it and the goofiness made sense a weird experience but refreshing to see something original for a change totally recommend,reality
film making on meth or jebus what did i just watchseriouslywhat did i just watchan action packed car chase musicalits as if george miller had channeled baz lurhmann in the throes of a postapocalyptic meth bender searching for a come down whilst watching the blues brotherstweakedand then someseriously insane film was there a plotprobably go see it again as we walked in a little late think i must have lost something by missing that first 2 minutes of the film,reality
very disappointing if youre seeing the movie for anything other than the racing and crash scenes you will probably be disappointed as well and furiosa speak little and act even less they have this aura about them that says well try not to do too much to alienate loyal fans of the franchise but were getting paid to take our best shot at it so here goes why so many critics and viewers here alike are so enamored over the film is beyond me miller can still hold his own when it comes to apocalyptic carnage whether dealt with a front fender a sawedoff shotgun or a hideous looking blade but thats all i can recommend to potential viewers of this film save your time and money folks and rentstream some of the previous films instead better yet have your kids dress up in some old rags and face paint and ask them to reenact a scene or two of beyond thunderdome that would really be entertainment,reality
wow what a total thrill ride i came out of the theater quite limp with exhaustionthe heat of the chase and the tension barely let up and was so wonderfully executed by peter weir and his talented team as to beggar beliefit was immersive and had great mythological traits running through itcharlize did a most wonderful job as did tom hardy of whom i am a big fanhowever beyond the action and the brilliance of the story telling i quite simply missed mel gibsonhe is capable of bringing to a role a deep guttural element that transforms acting into being and i could have easily imagined this being centered 20 years on from the last with a grizzled bitter that only mel could have impartedan opportunity missed i truly do believehowever that does not in any way take away from the massive undertaking and brilliant adrenaline fueled film making that fury road issee it and be amazed,reality
saw it in 3d as someone whose absolute favorite movie growing up was the road warrior i felt disappointment in the direction miller took with this movie by itself mmfr is a very good summer blockbuster but it really had nothing to with the character of or the world occupied in the previous 3 movies the movie came off to me as a bit too cartoonish in regards to many of the characters and action sequences in my opinion miller could have completely removed the character of and it still would be a very successful movie without the franchise tagged to it in the first two movies mmbt gets a pass since byron kennedys death affected millers enthusiasm on the project was in my opinion a far more layered character someone who used his intelligence reflexes and resourcefulness to help prolong his own survival or to exact his revenge a man who in a classical sense was wronged and had to walk his own path in order to make peace with himself i felt there was a depth in those films largely due in part because gibson had the incredible ability to express how his character was feeling to the viewing audience using a broad emotional spectrum with virtually no dialog which greatly enhanced some beautifully composed scenes it was so refreshing to see this pulled off successfully in films that had some of the greatest action sequences in movie historydue to the extreme rapid pace of mmfr their was no place to demonstrate those prior characteristics i cannot tell if hardy has the chops to do what gibson did because when he is asked to lend emotional weight to his character we the viewing audience are bombarded by cut scenes of people we have never seen before chanting his name haunting him in an over the top movie shortcut kind of way to show his emotional damage this new interpretation of in my opinion is displayed as more of a surviving castaway who is stranded in a deserted wasteland continuously seeing the crying ghosts of those he could not save as the ship went down this seems to be losing his grip on reality behavior which was never exhibited in the prior films in mmfr he lacks the emotional subtlety that was shown in the previous films as much as he lacks the screen time in this movie he is literally along for the ride in furiosas story hardy then grunting through half of his lines did not help eitheronce again i just want to reiterate that miller made a great popcorn summer blockbuster movie i am just disappointed that i felt it really did not have to have in it to be successful it was furiosas story i went to a film because after 30 years i wanted more more v8 interceptor more of him surviving alone in the wasteland basically more depth of its title character i think the younger generations who did not see the original movies will love mmfr but those who grew up with the originals may feel the wanting disappointment i experienced great action movie though and i am glad i saw it love george miller,reality

and i thought the road warrior would remain the best of the movies wrong enter fury roadjust saw fury road for the 6th timeand once again when watching this insanely amazing action film a full spectrum of adjectives flows freely through my mind id say overwhelming is probably the most appropriate of them no plot rundowns here if you want to know that then watch the freaking movie i will say that its plot is an extremely simple one that even 6 and 7 yearolds should have little difficulty in understanding that being said this movie is really not for 6 and 7 yearolds oh and to the legion of soccer moms of america take little timmy to a screening of bambi instead  the nations tired of frivolous lawsuitsfirstly the most prominent aspect of this film is obviously its amazing levels of violence and surprisingly minimal amounts of gore its mostly one big ongoing series of the most mindbending vehicular stunts ever to hit the screen director george miller is a verifiable genius even after a 30 year hiatus from such films and his wife margaret sixeli who handled the editing well over 2000 cuts no doubt an extremely involved painstaking process won an oscar for her contributions the level of expertise thats evident in its cinematography is probably the most impressive of the films technical aspects this was no easy shoot filmed almost entirely under a blazing sun in the deserts of namibia the sheer amount effort and stamina it must have taken to capture all the highspeed dustcovered firespewing action is well an effort thats rarely undertaken  and never achieved so brilliantly with great technical aplomb miller and crew artfully capture the vast desert expanse of a brutal and gritty world and margaret sixelis awardwinning editing shines with much spit and polish i saw a preview for this film 10 months in advance of its may 15th 2015 theatrical release and never had i gotten such buzz from a movie preview  as a whole fury road not only met but exceeded that grand initial buzzfury road stars tom hardy as charlize theron as furiosa hugh keaysbyrne as immortan joe and 6 foot 11 nathan jones as rictus as some others have said i also didnt find hardy to be quite as charismatic in the roll of as gibson was but ultimately everything gels so perfectly it doesnt really seem to matter theron may have actually acted out her role better then hardy did  in any case they were a great duo no doubt about it for charlize theron this proved to be the role of a lifetime now speaking briefly about the hardware i happen to love all the automotive modifications seen throughout this film and in that respect fury road is easily the best of the series some of these vehicles qualify as characters in and of themselves  see oscar win for best production designas for its oscar tally fury road was nominated 10 times and won 6  and should have won several more including best picture which usually goes to lame movies  as it did in 2015 and best director and to all the idiotic trolls and brainless blabbering jackasses that claim fury road is overrated not hardly and if a movies overall gross is anything of a reflection of a movies quality  then fury road is in fact underrated as it pulled in only 375 million  well below what warners anticipatedand so not to pontificate too much  ill wrap up this review with this fury road is a bombastic hyperkinetic thrillride thats very well worth seeing at least twice and is a treat a triumph and a treasure for nonpompous film aficionados and adrenaline junkies everywhere except for china where its bannedthanks a million to george miller and warner bros,reality

only a few moments in cinema have made me grip the seat in excitement and i have to admit i wasnt expecting much but this is the best film of 2015 and the best action film in what 20 years i cant remember the last time i was enraptured so completely by a film this visceral and exciting sure the storys not much but yknow what ill take action and visuals this good over a story any time im so tired of the ugly post 911 grays that every single action film has looked like everything in this film was so colorful and amazing the yellows the reds it was a feast for the eyeballs the soundtrack is incredible the cinematography is amazing and once again tom hardy vanishes into a another great role we all love mel gibson but well yknowhe went a bit too far beyond thunderdome charlize theron was amazing she almost stole the film from hardy nicholas hoult was fantastic and hugh keaysbyrnes as immortan joe was such a scary villain and the doof warrior rockin hard so awesome after years of mediocrity this is a kick up the arse to action cinema what else is left to say george miller took everyone to school with this kick ass masterpiece i saw it 5 times in the cinema and it got better every time suck a fat one michael bay george miller is the king all hail to the king baby,reality
not many would expect it to be this good sequelsprequels to classic trilogies are at times bad and deemed to be pale in comparison to their pasts but fury road developed differently it is one of the best action pictures ever made and now a modern masterpiece fury road is not just a great action movie it is a great movie in generalthe world is nothing but a desert wasteland and fresh water which lives in it becomes scarce furiosa charlize theron is one of immortan joes hugh keaysbyrne a tyrannical cult leader biggest associates she is sort of like a knightess of an empire joe sends off furiosa with a great truck in her control to collect gasoline but she goes offroute only to betray her leader by attempting to smuggle his five wives for their freedom joe unleashes his army the classic rockatansky tom hardy allies himself with furiosa and thus the great battle of fury road beginsgeorge miller creates a picture that never heavily relies on dialogues but actions to tell a story fury road is already a masterpiece in that artistic aspect and obviously it opens up for more openminded intelligent views of the film furiosas possible love interest the chemistry between the two lead characters joes cleverness and the relationship between the five wives are being uncovered through showings but not words instead of singlemindedly telling audiences george miller challenges themjust like alfonso cuarns gravity fury road is short on content but excels fully on filmmaking the film is an energetic high pitched and thoroughly detailed masterpiece there is no chance of it being a bad film people who never understand movies would despise fury road mighty action sequences sharp editing and beautiful cinematography move run through the running of the film charlize therons strong performance as the damaged heroine mainly helps to maintain the significance of the picture nicholas hoult and hugh keaysbyrne too did fine as the delusional young soldier and the evil lord respectivelyi really hope that fury road will at least be recognised for its editing and cinematography in the upcoming 2016 oscars although a nomination for best picture is near impossible with this triumph my anticipation for its sequel grows strong it is being written not inexplicably in history that fury road joined the greats george miller exploited his admirable visions that it surpasses his classic movies george miller with his fury road has brought us to a stage of ideas that have given in unparalleled motion pictures,reality

even at the beginning theres no hint fury road is going to a stop right at the very start the engines are already rewing gathering furious fires of vengeance and redemption and before the audience could snap out of the sheer moments of brutal grittiness and exhilarating highoctane drama they are surely already held hostage within the confines of a postapocalyptic world where everything is horrendously scarce not that its a bad thing no its not i tell you this is like being hurled into the space in a rollercoaster ride its dangerous but its also thrilling witnessing this dystopic world and all its hellish drama unfold might make you grope for seatbelt under your seatthe film shares rockatanskys tom hardy adventures is an ex highway patrolman hes been haunted by the past by family he never saved he meets the imperator furiosa charlize theron who is being pursued by the dictatorial wasteland leader joe furiosa reaches for for help in keeping the five wiveswomen she brought with herinto safety as joes deranged breed of warriors called the war boys that are barely humans are raging across the desert to capture them this pursuit throws the unlikely partners into the whalloping dangers of bloody escape suddenly sending them into a game of survivalafter a riproaring opening chase sequence is held captive in the citadel the city where the ruthlessly totalitarian leader joe is ruling over the grotesquely brutal lord maintains tight grip of every valuable resouces across the land this brings the entire populace crippling under his control as for he becomes merely a blood bag for nux nick hoult one of joes war boys who is a fatal devout to the cause of their fascist leader who has promised them the glory of getting into valhalla the promised landeverything in this cinematic behemoth screams grandeur even the feverish chase even the dark erubescents spurred from the ruthless violence miller has molded a world where darkness is an escape from the stream of clichs and retreads surging into the cinemas today its a visual feast but surprisingly with sense its explosive in every unimaginable ways but its not devoid of a human story which in this case is propelled by stellar performances from incredible actors on the movies payroll tom hardy is utterly capable as the main hero but the emotional spine of the narrative mostly runs on therons character at some point there would be a sense that isnt the only one playing under the spotlight as it gets evident furiosa is equally as massive as his role is hardy here is singularly stunning playing his role with utmost credibility as he is required his mission transcends past his emotional torments and hes never pulled himself free from the ghosts if his past same can be said with furiosa who is not only running from joe because she wants to get herself free from his cut throat grip but also to bring every woman into safety back to freedom where they belongmuch of the movie is spent with furious speed chases that goes from end to end of joes subjugated land while also taking surprising twists and turns along the way its like it doesnt know how to stop and if it does thats surely only to allow us breathe and catch up with the next electrifying action setpiece theres an enigmatic style miller has employed to provide distinctions in his fantasy world and it keeps the momentum in tack if not ever progressing the tone of the movie all those vividly dark colors that magically shifts from something to another imparts a drowning experience only its enjoying and looks festive to the eyes this makes every eyesquashing spectacles take mammoth forms of visual extravaganza turning all those burning combustions metal blasts and endless pursuits from mere technical marvels into a hairraising escapadeamid these sanitygrabbing action sequences though is an emotional streak that keeps and furiousas humanity alive this prompts them to survival into carrying out their similar humane causes clinging tightly to their only mission even if they get hurled into the barbaric hostilities of their dystopian society this turns the movie into something visceral cathartic in some ways that probably only a small fraction of the audience could understand it will not be enough to merit this achievement with merely a splurge of superlatives this needs to be experienced felt and forever cherished fury road ignites eternal fire and it will keep burning through the stretches of cinematic history what a lovely day and what a lovely movie this is just beyond expectations there is nothing easy or predictable about what george miller delivers with fury road a stonecold action master class beautiful and brainy and startling in the ways it throws off the current definition of the blockbuster there is gargantuan excess here to be sure  and no shortage of madness  but there is also an astonishing level of discipline come for the blistering fulltilt action stay for the thoughtprovoking consideration of the postapocalypse the world of has always been welded together from bits of whatever was lying around and the films brilliance has always been in their welding  the ingenious ways in which their scrap metal parts were combined to create something unthinkable hilarious or obscene and often all three,reality
very few movies attract my attention where i must watch over and over again like terminator 2 aliens but this far surpasses those this one takes the cake on everything the setting was like a post holocaust in my opinion a huge meteoric impact not nuclear war definitely some looked like they suffered radiation burns be that as it may this movie had very believable characters both protagonist and antagonist had depth sensitivity emotion even though the main bad guy was tyrannical leader imortan joe you could kind of empathize with what he was doing i especially felt moved when he held his dead wife one of themin his arms and he was genuinely saddened i felt for imortan joe his cause was noble he was a family man a dad he had to make do with what he had he had to ration and control the water he had to maintain and harvest the crops he was trying to produce superior human beings so that they may have the strength to lead in order to establish a society emerging from a wasteland to speed things up you dont have time for democracy you need slaves these slaves all seemed like happy slaves probably because there was food shelter they seemed cared for the backgrounds in this movie were so believable the action sequences top notch edge of your seat nonstop im ready to watch it again and hopefully they will make a sequel,reality
fury road is the fourth installment of the franchise and the first film in the series in 30 years to call it the best action movie of the year would be an understatement this is easily one of the best action movies of the decade it successfully breathes new life into this classic action film series and brings it to a whole new generationin the year 2060 australia and the rest of the world is in ruins after a huge apocalyptic event occurs as a result humanity is broken and food water and fuel is scarce so much so that violence and murder is common from those seeking out ways to survive rockatansky tom hardy replacing mel gibson is still adrift in the desert many years after the events of the third film when he meets furiosa charlize theron a tough no nonsense woman of action who is searching for her homeland furiosa has captive with her the five wives of king immortan joe a vicious military leader who rules over the desert kingdom known as the wasteland reluctantly and furiosa along with one of joes former soldiers nux nicholas hoult ally together to fight back against joe to free his wives from his clutches and try to restore order to the wasteland and its peoplethis is easily one of the most badass movies i have ever seen the car chases are extremely well filmed and choreographed much better than any of the ones in its predecessors i also liked how it kept its gritty atmosphere which i felt was very lacking in the third film tom hardy is a decent replacement for mel gibson playing as i feel that mel would be too old for some of the stunts required in this film although his accent did keep drifting between australian and british throughout the movie but the real surprise was charlize theron as furiosa she channels some of the more badass female film characters like ellen ripley from the alien franchise into her performance theres never a dull momenti rate it a solid 910,reality
hunted by scavengers and haunted by his past lives on the run like a lone wolf reduced to the single instinct of survival things however take a turn for the worse once he finds himself a prisoner of a citadel tyrannized by an evil warlord and must join a group of strangers in hopes of escaping out alivefrom director george miller the original mastermind behind the franchise comes a new postapocalyptic tale of vengeance and solidarity fueled with stylistic chaos and amped with 150 beautiful insanity fury road is like a nitroboosted adrenaline rush straight to the head every shot was flawlessly staged lit and framed like an artistic photograph that simply screams pure genius this goes without mentioning the awesome heavy metalinfused orchestral score by junkie xl now some viewers might feel a little awkward accepting some of the steampunk attire eccentric props and unquestionably weird characters but they shouldnt be too quick to judge everything in the film no matter how odd has a sense of logic and a functional purpose to support its existence not only does this sensible approach make things feel more realistic but it also couldnt look more genuine thanks to the abundance of practical effects and real stunt work even more impressive is the clear dedication from our leading actors who performed the majority of their own stunts one fight sequence even resulted in tom hardy breaking his nose but judging by his interviews its pretty clear that everyones proud of what theyve accomplishedputting the films obvious strengths aside one of fury roads most impressive aspects is the technical brilliance behind the cinematography and editing itself regardless of how fastpaced some of the scenes were and how many quick cuts they included i never once had to struggle to process the visuals its safe to say that the director knew exactly how to frame the characters in each shot to ensure everything flowed together without nauseating the audience regardless of its highpaced action too bad most modern action movies arent competent enough to film and edit sequences this way maybe taken 3 rings a bell keep in mind viewers may find disappointment through the films relatively thin plot and lack of dialogue but one could easily argue that miller effectively makes up for this with his clever use of visual storytelling techniques i for one felt the characters actions spoke for themselves and am confident his storyboard based script had a lot to do with why this approach worked so wellthis might be the 4th chapter in a preestablished saga but millar has proved his concept is far from dead and fury road completely justifies all the critical appraise its receiving with just enough nods to the originals to please diehard fans but more than enough fresh material to engage new audiences anyone getting on board is sure to enjoy the ride if its unique style or genuine originality isnt enough to catch your attention the high octane and unquestionably explosive action sequences are sure to blow you away,reality
in a movie where the expectation would be that only the men or leading man would be the star the movie surprised me by showing the females as bad asses even more so than the men in this film equality love itin addition i was expecting or hoping for some similarities to the original after watching this movie i found this not to be true it kept my attention by showing a very different story line one being that the woman were equally as compelling as the men as i mentioned abovelastly im looking forward to a sequel i was left hoping to see more the more being that the lead female would come back as the leader of the people not a grotesque man as was in this moviethough he was grotesque i was thrilled at what happened to him in the movie,reality
im one of the few people who wasnt a huge fan of the original trilogy so i didnt rush to see this movie however i started this movie intending on watching the opening scene and it hooked me for the entire movie action action action its a chase movie surrounded by chaos and madness the colours bounce off the screen like a comic book the golden day scenes to the blue night scenes are beautifulcontrary to what people say there is an exciting story and plot with heavy character development hardy is a solemn character similar to leones man with no name its his actions and decisions that define him as always theron goes above and beyond and truly holds the film together for me nichols hoult was the biggest surprise ive scene hardy and theron over the years always delivering but i was only familiar with hoult from skins and xmen this is without a doubt his best performance to date fury road is more than a popcorn flick so treat yourself and watch it,reality
i had been anticipating this movie for a very long time and of course it didnt disappoint theres a lot here to enjoy its not just an action movie its the biggest car chase of all time george miller created a world that feels like its alive and above all else it looks incredibly cool the movie uses a lot of practical effects and they look stunning theres some cgi in there but its barely noticeable the details in this movie are mind boggeling the bigger the screen the better the movie gets dont get it on dvd or watch it on your phone get it in hd and watch it on the biggest screen you can get your hands on,reality
fury road is obviously about the story is pretty basic and not hard to understand at all tom hardy and furiosa charlize theron have to get a truck filled with women to one place the green place but these women were important to immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne immortant joe is the leader from a gang so now he has sent a big group of his people in cars to get the truck with the women and kill and furiousa this movie is basically just a long chase scene but an amazing chase scenethe directing of the movie was so pretty sometimes i just sat there stunned by how pretty it was really everything was just beautiful i also really liked the colors they used even the fighting scenes were good no shaky cam just wide open shots of the people fighting another thing about the fighting it was very well choreographed i think that the fight scene in the beginning between furiosa and was one of my favorite fight scenes the car scenes were very well shot too but here is a thing that i didnt really liked that they sped up the camera movement if you know what i mean i dont really know how to express that in english i enjoyed when they let things fly in the direction of the camera for example when someone spoiler sacrifices himherself there fly a steering wheel and a guitar in to the camera i think it would have been cool if you watched it in 3d no spoilers the use of practical effects surprised me i knew that there would be some practical effects but there were a lot and i think that it was really cool that they used them because now a days you only see cgi these practical effects added something more to the movie in my opinion the special effects were also very well done the mechanical hand of furiosa george miller the director made good use of slow motion now something more about the acting tom hardy was very good as first you dont really know a lot about of course if you have seen the previous 3 movies you know who is but then with the short flashbacks of this little girl you start to see that is a damaged man who has been trough a lot a short thing about these flashbacks i thought that it was very creative that they switched between the faces and the skulls of dead people when they blame and that the little girl had impact on begin narration was very good charlize theron is just a total badass as furiosa i very much liked her character and i loved that they didnt make her invincible also liked her dedication by shaving of her hair my favorite character is nux he is played by nicholas hoult i like nux because he is this interesting character nux is so interesting because he shows that his people care and that they werent all weird violent people the writing is overall very goodhere are some more things that i liked about this movie i very much enjoyed the realistic sense to it it felt very realistic and i think that is due to the use of practical effects the sound and music was nice to listen to the costume and makeup design is just amazing and maybe the thing that i loved the most about this movie is that i wasnt bored for a second now last but not least there is a freaking guy playing the guitar which spits flames if you dont think that that is cool there is something wrong with you and here are some individual scoresdirecting 9810writing 9510acting 9610action 1010that is a total of 38640 which is a 9710 and if i would round it it would be a 1010 i would definitely recommend watching this movie it is just pure fun,reality
i confess that the movie plot didnt get me going but the action scenes are spoton and beautiful to watch every action scene is detailed in an impressive way making it impossible to find a mistake in it of course the movie is not realistic but i think thats the purpose the makeup artists were amazing and all the scenery is absolutely breathtaking its fun to watch and to appreciate the art in it one thing i would criticize is the lack of deep emotional scenes in the script the story is actually good and the flow of the events is great but somehow it was not possible to connect with the great characters i dont know why i felt that way but reading others reviews i realized that im not the only one anyway i recommend the movie because it is admirable but is definitely not even close of being one of my favorites,reality
i have finally got the chance to see the much acclaimed new film fury road and i must say that it is fantastic the premise of this film sees get kidnapped by a warlord and tries to escape with a group of refugees tom hardy plays and he is great in the role he doesnt have allot of lines but i see that as being true to the character and he nailed all the action scenes that he had to do another great character is that of charlize therons character of furiosa she was an interesting character and she was an even better fighter then which made her the real star in this film in my opinion nicholas hoult plays a crazy in this film and this is really unlike anything he has ever played before he was crazy as you expect but he was also a really interesting character and his development throughout the film was one of the best things in this movie the villain immortal joe also had some character to him and was cool even though i do wish they gave him a little bit more to do the narrative is simple yes but it works and the character development really is good in this film and makes these characters really interesting and fun to watch the script is the one negative as some of the dialogue feels one dimensional and doesnt hit the emotional impact that would make the characters really stand out but there are some fun and emotional dialogue that does help the style is fantastic this film is crazy but it makes sense in this film and makes it great the action is all insanely cool and is easily the best part of this film and the use of practical effects mixed with cgi really worked and makes all the stunts look fantastic overall this is a fantastic film and if you are looking for an action film to watch this is one of the best around,reality
this movie was really big on action and had a lot of explosions and violence i read that all of the stuff in this movie was actually stunts and very minimal cg i just hate it when a movie hides behind cg now onto the movie there are a lot of things i wonder about like the warboys and what their deal was it seemed like the really loved joe how did joe get his first name what does immortan mean i am so curious also as to the back story of joe id like to see the next movie maybe be a prequel and talk bout what joes back story was and what he used to be like could be really be goose i am not sure but his horse tooth mask was really neat as for well lets just say he didnt talk too much i like his way of speaking though kind of reminded me of bane from batman actually haha the rest of the movie was good i noticed that they never really stopped almost ever even to fix the vehicle they would just keep driving this was really neat did you notice that there was a big difference in color between night and day shooting this was a nod to the old school which i really appreciated so if you like your movies packed with action you will like this movie there are also some new techniques of fighting introduced into the fold in i am talking about the pole vault fighters that was neat so was the scene were the motorcycles were jumping and throwing bombs so much action i give this movie to gas tanks of guzzling up,reality
as of this writing i still havent decided what vote to give it i enjoyed the movie lets start with that as expected there is a lot of ridiculousness in this movie the vehicles the peoplewell theres not a lot else in the movie beyond those two like many americans i suspect i saw the road warrior first i fell in love with it then i saw and that helped some other things make sense in the road warrior as i understand it fury road is supposed to fall somewhere in between the two wellok i still enjoyed the vehicle chasesactioncombat stuff the very odd community from which it all starts and the fact that i think this movie had a lot more story resolution in it than the road warrior trying not to add spoilersthe cirque de solei folks were wonderful of course the doof warrior was a very interesting touch hes the guitar player as a nod to throughout our history troops in the field communicated with drums and horns and so on this just seems a modern extension of that and knowing that the vehicular stuff was not cgi but real i really appreciated that part so the story focuses mostly around a woman and a decision she makes charlize therons character from there we get to see everyone else spring into action in some form or fashion and with that ultimately they kept the story fairly simple and it made senseit is at least an engaging story and a cohesive telling of it for myself i didnt read a whole lot into the plot but im sure if you really went looking for anything from save the planet types to militant feminists you could probably find it to me in context it all made sensefor things i didnt particularly care for there arent many however 1 just like in road warrior apparently nobody who makes these movies believes that stackstyle exhaust pipes get hot both movies have people crawling around them after theyve been running a good while2 hardys particularly near the end with furiosa just doesnt seem asdetachedas gibsons when he tells her his name at the end of gibsons had already snapped like a freeze dried rubber band but he still had a code he worked by hardy while taciturn gets some flashbacks here and there but doesnt seem as damaged hes brutal yes and by necessity he just didnt come across as being as damaged as he should have been but then thats simply my opinion so sit back and enjoy the ride,reality
you know an action movie with a budget is good when the stunt credits roll longer than the cgidepartment does at the endbasically its all you want in an action movie cool stuff happening on screen that gets you exited and that you can tell whats going on a story that makes you actually care about the characters oneliners fury road is absolute fireworks just falls a bit short on that last aspect but has a few subtle and not so subtle chuckles in store for you that are delivered nonverbaloverall fury road forms a very believable world with incredibly love to detail and practical effects and fitting musicgo see,reality
tom hardy nicholas hoult charlize theron three reasons i went to see this film but very little of the reason i absolutely adored this masterpiece the action is second to none one majestic and massive chase sequence running two hours long is difficult to perfect and there is only one action genius that could get it right george miller his absence from live action has finally ended his return is what i hopeis also the return of good action filmsthe visionary directing is delightful the screenplay was written around the storyboard thats right george miller story boarded the movie and then based the script about it clever is a understatement miller has taken the idea of a predictable action film and twisted the concept into something specialthe story is very emotionally engaging which once again is rare for a action film the story revolves around legendary warrior furiosa charlize theron freeing the oppressed wives of of immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne taking a beast of a tanker furiosa goes off against immortan joes whole army of joes halflife warriors furiosas goes on a massive car chase but is later joined by the road warrior the halflife warrior nux nicholas hoult betrays his master and eventually joins the team they race to the green place to find salvationnicholas hoult was the stand out actor in the film his crazy off his rocker betrayal of the effects of the apocalypse are unbelievably convincing tom hardy and charlize theon also break rank with completely engaging performances no acting in this film is bad for me every actor fits in beautifully with the style and atmosphere of the moviethe biggest visionary aspects of the film arethe cinematography to have such a bright and vibrant world for a apocalypse film is interesting and incredibly cleverthe directing the long takes and absolutely abnormal angles of the directing are transcendent to almost all other moviesthe concept to think up the whole one long chase sequence takes time and creativity that almost all action films lack and most films altogether forget about also thinking of the storyboards before the screenplay is difficult and hard to master yet miller does it perfectlythe only problem i had with the film is the lack of dialogue but the movie manages without it i love how they managed to put so much character development with very little dialogue the hidden meaning of empowering women and never bowing down to dictation are expressed strongly without too much dialogue i do love long conversations in movies but i was deprived from that feeling in this film still minimal dialogue and nicholas hoult showed off a higher quality of acting that actors in films with nothing but talking still do not manage to showto finish i found this film a instant classic that can never be forgotten and can truly compete with the originals i do not know whether it is better than the old films but it is easily as good but more visionary and more meaningfulthe action nothing like anything you have ever seenthe concept original and has good interesting deeper meaningsthe acting hoult is sensational and manages to stand out against hardy and theron who also blow you awaythe screenplay may not have dialogue everywhere but when character speaks it is meaningful and incredibly important to the strong development the story hascinematography not clich for a apocalyptic movie usually dark but here it is bright and vibrantlittle dialogue meaningful when used but i wish there was moreratingacting10action10screenplay9music9pace8story9cinematography9overall9110,reality
a triumphant return to the reckless mayhem and guiltfree indulgence of the early 80s actionadventure bubble puts foot to floor right from the opening bell and never lets up somehow topping itself over and over again even when it seems like theres nowhere left to go its joyous anarchy a world that thrives on all of societys dirty secrets completely postapocalyptic crazy but also a little more familiar than wed like to admit of course its a visual powerhouse  a glowing example of art direction stunt driving cinematography and character design thats damn near unrivaled in modern cinema  but its also an audio behemoth like inceptions deep bellow or terminators ominous rumble fury road can convey a looming sense of dread through its frequent effective use of bass you feel that rumble the rides starting back up again junkie xls accompanying soundtrack is a perfect tonal match the right blend of fuzzy edout guitar licks and incessant pounding tribal drums perhaps most impressively the film doesnt feel obligated to dig up every last bit of backstory on its way to the finish line if anything it revels in leaving that to the viewer whose imagination is bound to fill in the blanks for such a broad wildly eccentric cast of characters far better anyway its a raucous success a lethal dose of sensory overload that hits like a twohour surge of adrenaline i loved it constantly shaking my head at the experience and laughing at myself like a little kid at his first rrated movie loved every minute,reality
following the underwhelming and disappointing beyond thunderdome 1985 makes a spectacular comeback with a big bang 30 years later this time tom hardy takes over the role from mel gibson as director george miller returns in the directors chair having directed the previous movies fury road was a exciting action packed bonanza from beginning to endset in an unspecified period in the future the world has turned into a desert wasteland and all civilisation and humanity has collapsed one of the survivors rockatansky tom hardy continues to roam around postapocalyptic australia is later captured by a group of scavengers called the war boys imprisoned and kept as a live blood bag to keep the scavengers alive immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne toecutter from the original is the leader of the war boys and also the ruler of the community of survivors struggling to keep alive at the same time imperator furiosa charlize theron has been sent out in a huge war rig to collect gasoline from gas town but unbeknownst to immortan joe furiosa is smuggling out his five wives that he has impregnated immortan joe unleashes an all out pursuit to take back his five wives and to take down furiosa amongst the pursuers is nux nicholas hoult rictus erectus nathan jones and the people eater john howard after manages to break free he assists furiosa and the five wives which include the splendid angharad rosie huntingtonwhiteley toast the knowing zoe kravitz capable riley keough cheedo the fragile courtney eaton and the dag abbey lee in order to make it safely from immortan joes clutchesi found myself a bit cynical when mel gibson was not going to return as unfortunately far too much time has lapsed and mel gibson is too old for the role not to mention all the controversy that has plagued mel gibsons reputation tom hardy did an excellent as rockatansky charlize theron was also suburb as the one armed female warrior imperator furiosa i honestly could not recognise hugh keaysbyrne as immortan joe having always thought of him as the infamous toecutter from the original the entire movie can be described as a spectacular non stop fired up car chase from beginning to end i enjoyed that a lot now thats what an action movie should be like while fury road may not be a classic compared to 1979 and 2 1981 it certainly erased all the underwhelming disappointment of beyond thunderdome 1985 a sequel to a violent franchise should not be a watered down children friendly movie fury road was certainly a spectacular comeback in the series george miller should be commended on resurrecting the seriesheres hoping there will be further sequels and tom hardy will return as 710,reality
it has been nearly 2 weeks since i saw fury road and im still trying to recover it is the sort of film you forget to breathe through much like interstellar but for an altogether different reason unrelenting from beginning to end this postapocalyptic saga is virtually one long explosive chase sequence albeit one which seemingly has new ideas on tap the action ie the whole film is utterly bonkers conceptually and in execution that writerdirector george miller and his team concocted such ferocious set pieces is impressive enough but being able to pull it off with extraordinarily daring stunt work  augmented by gritty cgi  is simply aweinspiring visually it is vivid and spectacular the searing desert landscape offering a dirtfilled grime so tangible your throat will dry up within seconds whilst the vehicles are creative and wonderfully preposterous the heartpounding score by junkie xl in which he blends orchestral and heavy metal music accompanies millers on screen splendour to create a visceral experience for both the eyes and the ears the vehicular carnage may be the drawcard but the committed cast elevate the overall product tom hardy is savage as charlize theron is compelling as imperator furiosa and nicholas hoult remember xmen is gonzo as nux whilst a plethora of recognisable aussies show up in deranged cameos theres an intensity here you just dont find in majority of the big budgeted blockbusters an inventiveness in all elements that drives this movie from great to mesmerizing miller hasnt played in the world since the dreadful beyond thunderdome back in 1985 but by god he has redeemed himself and then some fury road is a rollicking ride that carves out a piece of cinematic history all for itself considering the wave of terrible 90s scifi sequelsremakes weve had fired our way in the past few years terminator salvation robocop total recall etc fury roads success has been more than a pleasant surprise in short it is a grungy masterpiece,reality
this was a truly amazing movie it surpassed all my expectations and left me with a warm fuzzy feeling inside tom hardy slayed as and charlize theron as furiosa kicked major bad guy ass 1010 okay there were plot holes like a lot of plot holes some things definitely didnt make 100 sense like the weird bog men in the greenplace that were never explained the chrome spray applied to mouthsteeth during battle was also never acknowledged nor what exactly furiosa was seeking redemption for a lot was left open ended and unexplained such as the greenplace becoming polluted is it to be assumed that the fertile land was poisoned by the people who kidnapped furiosa and her mother as the land only started to decline after they had been taken was furiosas arm a natural abnormality not an obvious conclusion considering none of the other women from the greenplace had similar abnormalities or any discernible abnormalities at all or did she somehow lose it during her upbringing at the citadel what was her relationship with immortan joe how did she become an imperator and was the intent behind her becoming one always that she would rescue the girls from sex slavery there was a lot of background information and world lore missing that could have added a whole new depth to the movie and i found myself afterwords wanting to know their back stories wanting a prequelbut more so than any of that fury road had a recognizable and complex plot that action movies just dont typically have it had an actual story to go with the flaming car race from hell and it was so completely refreshing that i honestly couldnt complain about the minor faults in this movie,reality
the film is about a destroyed world where human beings were reduced to extinctthe film is so brilliantly directed without unnecessary lines many performances by facial expressions because it is what it is a search for change we should seek to change and understand about the world we are destroying for us and for other speciessurvive changegreat direction and beautiful action that george miller was never able to do in the 80s  i just do not understand these haters explain to me pleasedumb comments  not even close to hw0rr dw0rrrnot even close to the that it was in the past funnysilly stupid movie that it was supposed to be good so many things that dont fit just the name will not bring the old fame back and to top it all with stupid things there is half flying guy with guitar  i mean  really  wouldnt recommend giving any money for this movie only good things are special effects beside that i would vote it worst movie of this year beside kings man lowest score possible beside kings man what idiots stupid haters can only be marvel fanb0y  another feminist idiocy they just keep on making all these idiotic movies about strong women in a harsh mens worldwhat a bunch of bs  ,reality
stunning action film which pretty much does everything right visually striking great cast great motivation and development of characters the main characters face real danger and that shows excellent effects and dream action sequences all completed with a great thunderous sound trackthere is not a lot of story here but you dont really need this i think to make a great film in a sense it is a chase that this film is about and in that way similar to terminator 2 and of equal quality i would sayperhaps the only thing missing was driving his car but im sure there will be some of that in the sequels that will follow i cant wait to see more of this vision and hopefully of similar quality much better than previous incarnations and has brought the series completely up to date one of the best films ive seen at the cinema this year fans of the series and new comers should both enjoy,reality
so when it comes to the story it might seem like there really isnt anything special when it comes to the story the plot is about going from point a to point b and back to point a again now the franchise is considered cult films and although i am not a big fan of this franchise but i thought it does have certain imageries that make it stand out although the third installment was the weakest and is probably why there wasnt a new movie for many years i will say fury road is one heck of a insane experience filled with chaos and madness again what makes this movie stand out is the crazy imagery and atmosphere if you are a fan of steampunk style genres than you will probably have a blast with this one this movie is wild and crazy and yet there wasnt really any shaky cam and yet the cinematography is really well done and super cool now i still think mel gibson did a better job of play mainly because of the insane look in mels eyes but tom hardy bring something new he sort of reminded me of his character from lawless a bit which is this confused badbass although the title says the really title for this should have been badass chick with the metal arm because charlize theron seemed to be the main protagonist throughout most of the film and she is badass as a badass female lead can get call me blind but i never really found charlize to be attractive sure i could understand why she is known to be one of the most beautiful actresses in the business but man she was really hot in this one which shows that sometimes more than appearance how you carry yourself can really bring out the attractiveness this is a exploitation film for the mainstream audiences that is a fun thrill ride from beginning to end without it dragging out overall this is a film that almost every movie buffs can have a good time with i usually dont watch the same movie twice in theaters but i did for this one once in regular and the other time in 3d8510,reality

is back on the road to success after years of being off course dont get me wrong the original ozxploitation film franchises 1979 to 1985 by george miller is probably the most famous postapocalypse films to come out of the australian new wave of the 1970s but this film series hasnt aged well first off main star mel gibson fell from public grace due his controversy statements against jews women and homosexuals second off the film series hit a road bump in 1985 when the movie beyond thunderdome tries a more kid friendly approach by going pg13 it got released with mixed feelings from critics and audience members the 1985 sequel also didnt yield the box office results that the producers wanted it was only moderate successful so any plans for sequels went into development hell for thirty years due to those reasons the film series almost seem like it run out of gas it wasnt until its driver george miller repacked as fury road a continuity reboot did the engines start to move again fury road once again tells the story of rockatansky now played by actor tom hardy who must teams up with the a mysterious driver furiosa charlize theron to help a group of sexslaves flee from their capturer the evil warlord immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne and furiosa must cross the postapocalypse desert world in hopes of reaching a mythic place call the green place can they make it to the safe haven or will joe recapture them watch it to find out without spoiling too much of the film the film is visually impressing the cinematography for this movie is just as amazing they made the namibia deserts seem as colorful as possible in order to differentiate the film from other postapocalyptic movies which typically have bleak desaturated colors it remind me so much of 1962s lawrence in arabia with how visually appealing it was to watch this movie is a must watch in 3d for that alone still there were some things that were too gimmicky or corny the doof warriors guitar as it flies towards the camera in fury road is jarringly poorly done especially given the utterly flawless effects throughout the rest of the film another thing that i love about the film is how over 80 of the effects seen in the film are real practical effects stunts makeup and sets cgi was used sparingly mainly to enhance the namibian landscape remove stunt rigging and for removing charlize therons left arm the stunt work is intense its extremely violent with nonstop car chase scenes explosions and hand to hand combat this movie is a good example that the academy awards need to have a category for stunt work still the movie does go over the top unrealistic at times its funny how many bullets are wasted for a postapocalypse film the acting is pretty good as well charlize theron is great as the female lead she shows that female action heroes can be awesome the film is driven by strong women and can be seemed as a feminist movie is pretty much a supporting character to be honest still you see a lot of him tom hardy really gets the character of a man of action and of few words he was build to be an action star still the character has a confusing origins story the writers try to suggest that this origin is the same as the original films but clearly something were changed while yes he kinda wears a nearidentical outfit while wearing a leg brace as he did at the end of 1979s and the entirety of 2 the road warrior but the movie gives him some really haunting flashbacks that we havent witness before i dont know where his hauntings came from or who the girl was it wasnt in the original films there was a few other things to nitpick i wish he drove the modified police interceptor more and he looks a little more like mel gibsons the movie has a lot of oddlooking supporting characters at much as i love the character of nux nicholas hoult i cant buy into his heel to face turn and his love story with one of the sex slaves it was a bit forced another weird moment in the film is the freaky looking sidecharacters it remind me of 2006s 300 in a bit when it comes to the grotesque still this movie makes more sense since it take place after a nuclear holocaust but there were some really over the top grossvillains it makes me wonder if the water at the citadel is honestly safe to drink in my opinion it seem poisoned overall this demolition derby testosterone full film is a lot of fun to watch its amazing that miller has been in charge of the series for so many decades and ill be looking forward to the next series of films from him this is a mustwatch you have to be crazy not to watch this film,reality
wow nonstop action that starts accelerates and never stops fury road is not for the faint hearted or those looking for a cerebral film experience but definitely for action seekers who still want a movie with intelligence and a sense of style although the fourth screen appearance of and the first without mel gibson director george miller who helmed all four movies ups the action quotient this time out as before the plot is irrelevant but serves as a vehicle for violent chases and clashes between a savage group who hold survivors of an apocalypse hostage for water and a small band of women fleeing sexual enslavement escaping his own imprisonment joins the women headed by the onearmed furiosa in their flight to a green area where furiosa grew uptom hardy is a solid and dispels any nostalgia for gibson tough laconic yet human hardy recreates in an updated image refreshing in an action movie the plot revolves around women and imperator furiosa is equal both physically and intellectually with head shaved and her usually porcelain complexion soiled charlize theron is captivating and mesmerizing as furiosa a leader in every respect she holds the eye in every scene in which she appears furiosa is a dimensional action character with depth and a past the vast supporting cast of colorful characters with shaved heads powdered torsos and deformed bodies are all professional to outstanding with a special mention for nicholas hoult as nux whose loyalties shift over timethe music by junkie xl is pulsepounding to use a clichd term and enhances and punctuates the action john seales brilliant cinematography of namibian deserts creates an otherworldly apocalyptic universe and the use of 3d is arguably the most effective yet not only do objects fly from the screen but rifles aim into the audience and armored vehicles sail overhead from behind the kinetic editing by margaret sixel screams for an oscar and creates a kaleidoscopic montage of images that is literally eye popping to use another tired but appropriate phrase the art directors had a field day and also scream for oscars the vehicles are mobile sculptures assembled from old vw beetles rusted oil tankers and vintage finned sedans a heavy metal rocker perches in front of a fantasy truck while enormous audio speakers blare the beats of a half dozen drummers riding in the back bandits strapped atop long flexible rods dangle over the fleeing vehicles to snatch the escaping women from the truck cabs skeletal beings with dark flapping cloaks walk across an eerie landscape on stilts a dictatorial ruler flashes an evil grin with a leering mask of huge animal teeth skulls abound everywherefury road may have been conceived for action junkies but the creative art direction impressive special effects stunning landscapes a newly embodied and above all a riveting turn by charlize theron as arguably the best female action character yet broaden the films appeal wow the best of the series a movie to be seen in theaters because it will never have the same impact on a small home screen highly recommended,reality
omg two days later and im still buzzing from this spectacular sensory feast as a person who grew up watching movies in my childhood and early teens i went into this movie full of confident knowing george miller would not let us down and he didnt in my humble opinion this is the best installment of the series i was entertained from the beginning to the end the sound affects and music are done brilliantly the visuals are memorable the story is simple but you are given plenty of time to understand the characters even though there is not a lot of dialogue half of the story is in the characters eyes there is a lot happening in this movie i will be watching it a second time i hope you enjoy it as much as i did,reality
read the title it is my honest review this movie acceded my mountainous expectations by delivering me an action movie without equal fury road does not try to be a great action movie it just is instead of saying i dont say much as he did in road warrior he simply does not say much instead of giving us a protruded flashback into past it is told in ptsd jumpbacks instead of furiosa saying that she can do it being driving using the sniper fixing the engine etc she just does instead of delivering silly jokes like the road warrior it is just funny instead of fleshing out characters through long dialogs flashbacks or exposition the characters are naturally fleshed through actions you get it all of the character do have distinct unique and likable personalities even and in some cases especially the villains this movie functions as a character arc for some while a character study for others the sets and locations also set this movie apart in my mind the long outback vistas the canyons the dunes everything the distinct burnt orange color palate enriches the hues of the blue water green foliage and humanity in their eyes all of the acting was really top notch too the camera work was also solid with jumpy cuts and speed up moments that really got the heart racing oh yeah the best part though is the action the majority of the movie is chase scenes and they are absolutely intense the whole time i was totally juiced on adrenaline the weapons the costumery the vehicles it all seems so authentic the creativity is just bonkers and even though there are tons of explosions it does not feel like a mike bay wet dream because of the well grounded camera work and the focus on practical effects i literally can think of one four minute scene and one ten second scene that i noticed cgi not bad cgi but definitely cgi the rest of the two hours felt very real there were also some cringeworthy grindhouse moments which felt right at home to me it is all so much fun if you enjoy this kind of movie overall if you want some nonstop pulsepumping badass fun with the subtlety of an exploding spear watch this movie,reality
hope is a mistakemadness unleashed two hours of orgasmic insanity taken up on the vanguard by mind numbing action melting music of highoctane engine revving breathtaking inane takedowns colossal beastly war machines that only speak of destruction flying rad bikes that skim the dunes with pizazz and the unceasing adrenaline rush that doesnt let you settle down even for a sec ice that with crazy visuals topnotch 3d and exceptional score and witnessthere is madness in the air and you could literally see it it is the right amount of dark that doesnt touch gore but still goes on to show a lot of death with dope visuals and swell 3d fury road becomes a rare coup it breathes on an outstanding plot deadly stunts and constant punishing annihilation right from the prologue the movie starts packing in exquisite action it further inches into more lunacy with its unique storyline that would beat your imagination george millers beauty is less and more furiosa just happens to run into her muck primarily the tale of the furious furiosa who is on her way towards her origin driving a charging war machine hatching a secret in the beast and keeping her greasy eyes of hope wide open for redemption charlize theron imparts furiosa an apt depth something that only she could have done justice to nicholas hoult does a memorable nux who is downright nuts tom hardy sways in the boots with his laconic act that entails kicking a lot of assmillers subtlety plays extremely well with the score as suddenly the vibrant beats stop for to reveal his name you can also perceive the adroitness in his direction when he shows things from furiosas perspective by manifesting return after taking care of the bullet farmer it is not his blood with the flick being an action feast a lot of things remain unsaid however miller makes sure that people still fathom and connect with trivial things like nods and gestures by slipping in the right amount of gravitythis movie is one of the best action films i have seen in ages which not only carries an awesome storyline but also a throbbing joyride into mechanical awesomeness on the relentless fury road i am planning on watching this beauty again loco stuff,reality
a lot can happen in 30 years the world of 2015 is a vastly different one from what was the reality of 1985 when the last was released let alone 1979 when the first one first hit theaters down under during that time came a noticeable change in what film audiences expect in front of their screen while the 1980s was arguably the peak of action packed films the early 90s being a top contender the movie going public today is much more comfortable with zany comedies or drama the constant bombing no pun intended of action film after action film at the box office gives only further evidence of course there are exceptions to this and one could point at super hero films but that is quickly becoming a genre in itself but pure action is nowhere near its peakso in this new world three decades later how does speak to the public thats where tom hardy charlize theron and nicholas hoult lead by george miller come in just as our heroes are in constant movement away from immortan joe the movie never stops going there is not a second wasted during the two hour run time no filler or throwaway scenes everything is part of the story even when there is no dialog there is narration be it in the form of a gaze deep breath or fight miller who returns to the franchise that made him famous proves to be just as much a visionary at 70 that he was at 35 giving us remarkable direction that uses the talents of the cast to its fullest potential for all the nonstop action that this film carries the characters are never over looked hardy is proving himself a highly versatile player who can believable adapt himself to what the story requires of him just as hoult fully embraces his role as nux while theron as furiosa keeps the whole story together music of course plays a fundamental part in every film and this is no exception i have always considered hans zimmer the best in the game and no doubt that jxls work with him in many other films including the dark knight rises has been a big influence every piece of the score accentuates the adrenaline rush that is fury road an adrenaline rush that will leave you questioning yourself if you really just spent two hours sitting in the theater as it was so entertaining and engaging that you will hardly notice time going by,reality
incredible so different weird and creative action is impeccable not only great but had a very real feel to it probably because of how much practical effects and real stunts were used surprisingly deep for this kind of movie phenomenal original score might be my favorite so many intense suspenseful and epic scenes i was on the edge of my seat throughout i said thats the coolest thing ive ever seen about 47 times during the movie so much about this movie is elite the directing the action the score the cinematography the acting by the three leads hardy theron hoult the imaginative world that was created the creativity of the characters on my 8th viewing i was so blown away that i decided to give it my imaginary 11 star rating only other movie ive given that to is interstellar as of now fury road is my second favorite movie of all time it makes me happy  10 viewingsspoilerswitness me the sandstorm scene is probably my favorite action sequence ever same with the jumping motorcycles and the final battle,reality
with exhilarating action and a surprising amount of narrative heft fury road brings george millers postapocalyptic franchise roaring vigorously back to life,reality
this is one of these movies that you cannot rate objectively what i can say is that i in a long time havent seen such masterful execution of action scenes its like a big puzzle which is put together rapidly in front of your eyes action in this movie is so great that you sometimes cant register all thats happening on screen tom hardy is a great replacement for mel gibson and charlize teron is great and deserves her share of praise too in fact far more than her atomic blonde 2 years later miller knows what hes doing and there is something passionistic in this movie the whole idea which carries through the series of roaming the wasteland like some sort of a limbo looking for redemption and hope this is how you make a good action movie everything is in its place and you care for the characters and the action will give you wet dreams i give it 1010 and im not exaggerating it deserves it if you havent go watch it and see for yourself if i was being a nitpicker only thing i can think of is little blah are the 3d effects which are not needed but like i said its just nitpicking,reality
this movie seems more like a remake of waterworld with dennis hopper and kevin costner than it does about ,reality
i really dont understand how this gets an 81 i enjoyed the original but could care less how it compares to the original the characters are clich the scenes predictablemonotonous and the main characters hardly talk tom hardy just grunts the whole story revolves around a long drawn out chase scene with over the top dopey tripped out vehicles by formula characters then turning around and making the same chase back again it was just such a waste of time,reality
after a disappointing 3rd entry with beyond thunderdome george miller had interest in the series again and he created a film that might as well have been a massive middle finger to cgitom hardy is the new and he delivers a performance to rival mel gibson as the leading man his characterization as is based on the road warrior with being silent most of the film but this is the best part as the series is visual imagery and not dialogue heavywhilst the last film was ruined by having american funding and having an american headlining the cast in that cast tina turner who isnt an actress this film has charlize theron as imperotor furiosa someone who is worthy of sharing the top billing playing a large part of the movie and a great character whose on a journey of redemption and is a strong female lead who doesnt need a man to defend hera real treat for the fans as the returning actor from a previous film is used to the best ability and his name is hugh keays byrne who played the toe cutter in the original 36 years prior hes back and playing the new villain imortan joe and whilst delivering a menacing performance and unlike most action movie villains who are shown to be super human in someway imortan joe is shown to be the opposite needing an air filter to breathsince miller is again interested in his work the action scenes are top class each scene is practical effect and actual cars getting blown up and destroyed with the minimalist cgi used the stunt work is fantastic with it being practical effects and the only cgi is to remove the equipmentthe supporting cast whilst comprised of lesser known names creates a better performance than if it was made of better known names as miller chose ability over a top namei would recommend this film to anyone if youre not a fan of the series you will be after this film,reality
fury road was my most anticipated movie this year the franchise has always been best known for its atmosphere and car battles mel gibson made the first movies classics and made the role iconic we dont talk about beyond thunderdome so tom hardy has pretty big shoes to fill with fury road this film is one of the anticipated movies this year and did it live up to expectations oh yeah it didfollows our hero rockatansky who is captured by an army of men called war boys who torture him the war boys leader the immortan joe is in control of the biggest water supply in the wasteland he also has a many wives who with his help produce more war boys for his army and mothers milk but he is betrayed by one of his war rig drivers furiosa who steals some of his wives and makes of for the promise land and eventually meet up with they decide to work together in order to reach this land of green the films story is amazing and is easily the best in the franchise with twist and turns and many different moments that are iconic make this the best story out of all of the films the story is also propelled by great performances from tom hardy who plays the road warrior and furiosa who is played by charlize theron they both bring great life and emotion into the characters which is hard to do in such a chaotic move they are also supported by a great supporting cast immortan joe might be the best villain yet with his menacing voice and skull mouth the star of this show is the action scenes and boy are they amazing when the trailer was revealed most people thought they used way too much cgi but as time went out we found out that 80 of the film was practical effects with cgi being used for the furisoas arm and the sandstorm yep real stunts real explosion these stunts are the most insane stunts i have ever seen in a movie and definitely help this movie have some of my favorite action scenes ever my number one worry i had about this film was if it would feel like a movie this movie feels like a movie just as much road warrior was it has the perfect blend of crazy and action and puts them perfectly into the best action movie in the past decade i am not kidding when i say this fury road is not only a amazing movie worthy of the franchiseit is the best movie this year and is one of the best action movies in history this movie has everything everyone wanted a great storygreat main characters and amazing action scenes and the score is one of the coolest scores ever in a movie this movie truly is a masterpiece and when you are done watching it you will truly feel that you say an action movie like no other amazing action scenes great story fantastic atmosphere tom hardy and charlize theron 9510 masterpiece,reality
cinema audiences are getting sick of all the reboots remakes and recycling of classic films and franchises with good reason they are equally weary of cgiladen effects for the sake of it and endless safe homogeneous blockbustersadd to that the way even venerable film series like die hard have been reduced to pg1312a fodder where the hero cant even say his own curseladen catchphrase any more and you would be forgiven for not expecting too much from 70year old george miller returning to his old character after a threedecade absence the film industry today cant do justice to the adrenaline overload of the road warrior rightwrongsomehow george miller got one hundred and fifty million actual dollars to make an rrated action film filled the screen with insanity and grotesques and delivered on all the empty words other filmmakers have used before like breathing new life into a classic franchise genuine reboot practical effects instead of cg weightlessness and great action great story just for good measure he made it into something of a feminist action film and picked up 6 oscars in another year he might have had a shot at two more best director and cinematography by some utter anomaly it lost out on best visual effects as well so you can safely say this has been a successthe film plays out as more or less two unbroken hours of fullon action mostly on fastmoving machinery the likes of which you will never see elsewhere amid the flame dust flying bullets and broken bodies flying through the air you also get a coherent story told mostly through the kinetic forward motion of the action this is pure cinema absolutely brilliant succeeding on every level its not everyones taste to be based around extended car chases and some complained about the minimal dialogue of who some thought was sidelined by the other lead characters but in my humble opinion it is entirely consistent with 2 where mel gibson had just 16 lines of dialogue and the story of the other characters struggle was seen through his eyesthis is absolutely essential viewing if nothing else just to wonder at the thrills violence apocalyptic worlds and cannibalised motor vehicles flying across the screen its so wild at a preview screening a member of the audience stood up in the middle of an action sequence turned to miller and shouted how the hell did you do that it was fellow action director robert rodriguezyou really cant afford to miss this film,reality
director george miller picks up his 30year dormant trilogy for a fourth instalment which replaces mel gibson with legend star tom hardy as rockatansky costarring are charlize theron monster and nicholas hoult kill your friendsif you like me have never seen any other films the basic idea is that in a postapocalyptic wasteland fuel and water are scarce commodities and humanity has regressed to a tribal dangerous race desperate to survive as fury road begins hideously scarred dictator immortan joe is ruling the desolate populace with an iron fist and cruelly controlling their water access indoctrinating men to become cannon fodder known as war boys and stealing healthy young women as breeders when furiosa an imperator saves 5 of these women called toast the knowledgeable the splendid angharad cheedo the fragile capable and the dag these are some of the most normal names in the piece she attracts the full force of joes war crew including a prisoner named this plot setup all happens within 1015 minutes and from there the action begins continues continues and continues and never lets up it is in effect a gargantuan car chase with a few short actbreaks in between and its the best goddamn car chase ive ever seencalling fury road is like calling lord of the rings epic fantasy well yes it is but its also basically the definition of the word its been in development for many a year and it shows the intricacy of every aspect of this film is mindblowing with 6 deserved oscars including editing costume design and production design the look of the film is unique and spectacular instantly iconic characters will be cosplayed for years to come and images such as with the muzzle furiosas shaved pate nuxs emaciated visage and immortan joes classic appearance will not be forgotten soon the effects largely practical and stuntbased with appropriate and nondistracting cgi are topnotch and despite the academys decision are simply better than those of ex machina the wasteland is flawlessly depicted as harsh ruthless and an environment which demands that only the best survive acting topnotch it says a lot about therons performance that she overshadows the title character but as effectively the main character she carries both her infilm cargo and the actual film itself conveying her pain and desperation expertly and she was definitely passed up for best actress by many awards not that hardy is bad  he is truly with few lines yet that makes them better with his subwoofer voice and unexpected comedy first they take my blood now they take my car in addition to increasing his serious survivors instinct and speaking of quotes those from fury road are truly magnificent predictably yet often wonderfully darkly funny there are far too many to list theyre certainly not mediocre but the best part of the film is undoubtedly the action this is quite possibly the greatest action film of all time with octane going through the roof and edges of seats sat on more often than not a visual feast for the eyes ears and general senses with an unexpectedly progressive feeling that the new ghostbusters could only dream of female characters are represented properly and fairly without making it the sole focus you really cant rave about it enoughi feel theres very little bad to be said about this film though due to the incredibly high pace the slower moments make the pacing seem slightly off though only trivially and while it is marvellously quotable the dialogue amongst the brides is less inspired theres not a great deal of character development either however these are small complaints in an otherwise flawless masterpiece which fury road is also shoutout to musician iota as the doof warrior my new favourite character who redefines what it means to be metal playing his aweinspiring flaming guitar through thick and thin and leading joes war charge along with the drums of war adding to a fabulous pulsing soundtrack overall its a 94100,reality
when you see 97 on the tomato meter than youre expecting a bit every previous had at least some sort of plot not this one they are just fleeing from the mean boss in order to save his wives this one takes place on the road for 99 of the time sure its still fun and interesting but you expect a whole lot more after it was hyped so immensely the 3d is decent but as for the movie its only mediocre worth a blu ray yes because it makes a great demo disc but mostly for that reason only the movie itself really feels like a bmovie or rather like a movie where a bmovie director was handed 150 million which is how much this one cost and he didnt know what to do with it so he made the exact same movie just better looking,reality
i watched this movie in the theater on my brothers request since i have never had any relation to the universe and to be honest this movie is not going to plant any seeds for me to grow into a fan at some points during the movie i just though to myself this it too muchbut that aside it does contain all the basic ingredients for a great action flick weapons cars explosions violence women and more cars dont watch this movie expecting a long sophisticated and well thoughthrough plot but watch it for what it is a fast paced action packed story of a mans fight for survival in a future wasteland where dominant warlords rule the few habitable areas lefti did consider giving it a lover rate due to the lack of a better plot but then i remembered how it was to watch all the best action movies of the 80s  90s and i realized that none of them had a better storyline and i still enjoy rewatching rambo,reality
this movie has amazing action sequences and awesome computer graphics however the plot is lacking along with dialogue between characters it is good mindless fun but not a cinematic masterpiece if you are looking for a great action movie this is the right movie for youperhaps for any sequels they could go more into how the world became the way it is and into a little more depth regarding the character backgroundsotherwise i was very entertained and loved the beauty of each scene its definitely a movie that is better to watch in theaters so you get the full effect of each scene,reality
great visuals great production values  lovely detailing that fleshes out literally life in the futuredesertworldthing its very ludicrous but fun the actionstaging is as good as ever but there are only echoes of the earlier heights of suspense because we dont care too much about the characters particularly  once a clever and resourceful character now just sullen despite frequent flash back cuts to show him as haunted hes more onedimensional than ever as portrayed by the sparse and strangely accented mumblings of the usually reliable tom hardy charlize theron gets only a little more to work with and its nicholas hoult who gets the standout character which could be parodying our current preoccupation with religiously radicalised youth the plot is very simple and calculated only to provide imum chase scenes visually inventive accomplished and well integrated with effects but the film is missing its usual humour any basis in drama and perhaps therefore our engagement with the nonstop action,reality
fury road is admittedly a pretty tricky film to analyze postviewing i will preface this review by saying this is one film to see on the absolute biggest screen possible the action alone merits an eightstar rating i will admit that most times i take the meticulous cg effects and practical wizardry of movies nowadays for granted but its worth saying that my jaw physically dropped during two or three of the films action sequences no doubt it would be an understatement to say that george miller has an eye for staging action my only gripe and it certainly doesnt detract from my enjoyment of the film is that the movie is mostly lacking a compelling narrative hook before the inevitable comparison is made to 2013s gravity which was almost entirely propelled by the absolutely outofthisworld action i should say that the characters are much more interesting this time around charlize theron is very good as furiosa even while her arc feels a bit forced nicholas hoult is lots of fun as nux and hugh keaysbyrne plays a very solid villain but i must say it was tom hardy who really stole the show i dont think ive every heard less lines from the supposed main character but thats what really made him special otherwise junkie xls score was absolutely electric and it makes me very excited to see what hes got planned for batman v superman the cinematography was very good and perfectly captured the onscreen excitement without having to resort to the gritty handheld style favored by lots of filmmakers nowadaysso while the story is not entirely serviceable george millers confident and 100 competent direction elevated this from a fun but forgettable actioner to a potential oscar candidate,reality
i didnt watch the earlier movies i just went with an empty page and brought back a lyrical note with george millers signature all over it in a postapocalyptic era when mere survival is a luxury an ex policeman tom hardy tries to evade a pack of blood thirsty demonic destructive men who work for the most formidable of all warlords named immortan joe haunted by his past humane memories fails to escape and gets embroiled in a heist led by a revolting commander in chief imperator furiosa charlize theron what follows is an intense thrilling real steel by real i mean real battle between an atrocious seemingly invincible army of scavengers and a handful of strong willed and not so scavenging people the magic of this movie lies in depiction it beautifully brings alive the horror of apocalypse that palpable vigor to kill evident among all characters suggests the utter desperation to live and yet feel the agony of it all action sequences are superbly crafted while watching this in 3d i ducked a couple of blows to avoid getting hurt in this absolute mayhem the least of all nonchalantly deals with the worst physical blows a person can imagine hardys intensity is a treat to watch charlize theron portrays a role of a fierce warrior with a womans heart occasional sights of water and rosie soothed the eyes in an otherwise dusty and violent story of ,reality
finally heres a sequel for hollywood to be proud of george miller returning with his mind child promised us an action packed movie and god what he delivered was the apex of action about two hours of mindless ass kicking with eyewatering visuals the only problem i had with this movie was that it never gave me a second to catch my breath once again we are invited to the postapocalyptic australia where there is no cricket or kangaroo we are introduced to a long haired besides his beast of a car that was destroyed in the second part he gives us a monologue so that any new viewers wont get confused from there on its hard to explain what was happening probably the best action movie ever produced in hollywood in the past decade fury road actually showed its middle finger to all those comicbook movies that we thought were delivering action we got ourselves a new metric to scale them withon the acting department quite frankly i miss gibson as hardy may be a badass but gibson was cool as well as badass like a whole package if anyone im so impressed with that will be theron as furiosa ms theron proved herself to be more than a pretty face with movies like monster therons portrayal of furiosa was strong and subtle after ripley and sarah conner we might have found our new kickass female protagonist through furiosais a character that needs to be in a complex situation miller knows this fact more than anyone so he structured this movie in the same way he did with the road warrior he gave him conflicts and let him to solve them his usual way explosively sure this movie may not be a masterpiece but its sure is entertaining and it is loyal to its characters,reality
ive never seen such relentless spectacle george millers long awaited long delayed fury road is a total carnage ballet and yet despite its pedal to the metal pace and bare bones plot it somehow gains enough emotional purchase by the end to give it all some meaningmuch has been made of its feminist subtext too much as it turns out by the time i went into the theater i was expecting a two hour long andrea dworkin manifesto whats here is nothing more than a plot device and it even comes free of preaching and finger pointing ive seen greater feminist subtext in a skineflickto my complete surprise the hype is justified,reality

warning spoilers ahead specially in the third paragraph actually make this a seven and 12 stars because the action and special effects are that well executed the acting was not that bad ether in fact the acting was rather good other than that the title of this review basically says it all what little story there was was mostly contained in the garbled section of the first few minutes of the film and starts to develop only a little more and slowly after i guess the first fifteen minutes of the car chase and then only to set up the next section of the chase and the chase begins right away the film is wall to wall action from beginning to endwhat is nice about this film is that it ties the previous films together by having gas town reappearing in this film 2 the road warrior the masked warlord immortan joe closely resembling the insane masked humungas from 2 the road warrior and being haunted by the memory of his dead daughter or child of another film there is at least one kid in every film and beyond thunderdome i even think but not sure bartertown from thunderdome shows up on a map is making in the film the first few garbled minutes of the film is basically that tom hardy is captured by a band that fallows the insane and sick physically and mentally orders of a masked warlord named immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne and is taken to a fortress called the citadel is branded as property and is used to provide blood called a blood bag in the film to a young warrior named nux nicholas hoult who believes joes twisted theology based on norse mythology and cars nux was led to believe he is dying and wants to go out in a blaze of glory in service to joe immortan joe controls the people of the citadel by controlling and rationing out the abundant the water supply at the citadel he tells the people not to get addicted to water and to do without isnt he a nice guy  not joe keeps a harem of wives because he wants a son that he can rise as a warlord and heir to his kingdom the wives do not want to live with him and had arranged to escape in a secret compartment inside a tankerwar machine driven by imperator furiosa charlize theron while on a supply run to gastown joe finds out about the escape and decides to give chase nux convinced a friend to let him join in and let him take his blood bag with him well there you have it the first five to ten minutes of the film as best i could figure it out from there on you are on your own i will say that there is one inescapable silly element in the film it is that one of the chase vehicles that joe has with him is a rig with a group of drummers pounding war drums in the back with a heavy metal rock guitarist in front playing a guitar with a flamethrower attached to it it looks great at first but it becomes a sick glitch as the film wears on and how the director spends way to much screen time on it and all it was for was to give a chance to get his hands on the flamethrower i have seen this movie in 2d but i can tell you if you are planning to see it in 3d a lot and i do mean a lot of things are thrown at the audience if you like that in 3d enjoy,reality
i wont say anything new about fury road that hasnt been said before so ill just be preaching to the choir while tom hardy is good and all it is charlize therons furiosa that ultimately trumps the titular character in an unexpectedly significant role that is handled with grace and gravitas that one can expect from theron the character of furiosa herself is a revelation someone you dont normally get to see in a big budget action blockbuster she is on an equal level playing field as both important and one helping the other when the situation calls for it shes also the more interesting character going through a deeper change and a more emotional journey its a good thing then that is resorted as a background character which may anger some people but it works hereon the other hand the action scenes are something to behold in a era overreliant on cgi director george millers throwback to practical effects makes the action scenes come quite literally to life theres a sense of verve wonder thrill and rhythm that you dont usually get from modern action movies save for tarantinos death proof and the fast and furious movies even then those films look insignificant in comparison maybe fury road is millers way of reminding us what weve been missing out on for the past several years maybe its his plea to get action movies back to their roots or maybe miller just wanted to show the world the visionary he really is after all the road warrior had inspired many action films since its release and one can expect fury road to do the sameagain,reality
i will say up front that i am not the biggest fan of the trilogy i didnt grow up with it and saw it way too late in the game for me to fully appreciate it i see what it did for its time but i cant really say i enjoyed it that much watching it yet i could not be happier to have seen fury road opening day in all of its gloryits really hard to start pinpointing the positives of such a fluently put together film it plays with such a fast pace you arent giving time to catch your breath and that is what made it absolutely stunning there are a couple maybe three moments of character talk but they are brief and stitch together a narrative that uses action to its advantage the film molds storytelling and action seamlessly and that is why every single frame works so well and had me on the edge of my seat that is the difference between great and good action films you dont fell you are watching action you feel as if you are watching the story unfold you there with the characters rooting for them and the fact that the action is the medium through which you experience it makes it all the more riveting there is really no two ways around describing the spectacle miller pulls off here it is modern action at its very most extreme best there are no fast cuts there is no shaky cam it is all there for us to witness alongside the beauty of the cinematography the mouth dropping set pieces and obviously the george miller postapocalyptic weirdness that is back and better than ever if you thought the first three movies were weird just watch this and forget the other three it also manages to pull off some surprising dramatic storyline which has many different aspects to enjoy and gives a very very big emotional punch at the end this is thanks to an all around great cast with two central performances that are some of the best acting of the year across the board tom hardy by now doesnt even need for me to talk about him i was a fan of his before people even knew who he was and he once again proves his talent here with some fantastic nondialogue acting he really proves he is simply a star and one one the greatest actor of our times yet i think that the better performance and actually the best thing of the whole movie is charlize theron this is oscarworthy work in my opinion every time she is on screen she owns that this isnt just some throwaway side role this is some stunning acting that elevated the film to another level she sets the screen on fire from the first time she appears on frame and throughout the whole duration of the film she adds subtext to her character with very little quips that i absolutely loved there isnt a negative that can be pointed out there isnt a gawping hole than detracted from the experience the film satisfies every single thing it wants to do and does it with absolute excellence i will even say that this film deserves both oscar nominations for best picture and director the reason it simply doesnt rank higher for me is the fact that as much as i wanted it i didnt have the experience i was expecting now granted my idea may very well change but what im saying is that there is nothing that made me jump out of my seat or make me physically engaged that is in no way a negative as i said it is just what i search for with higher ranking movies and it simply and unfortunately did not to that for me it didnt reach that level of absolute mouthonthefloor sweating experience this may be due to the fact that it isnt doing anything revolutionary with the action medium there are some very original ideas but there isnt nothing that hasnt been seen or exceeded before it is doing action at the very best excellence someone could ask for but it didnt reach for anything more and it didnt give me that chilling physically engaged experience that i crave for when watching masterpieces moreover there are very little things dispersed around the film that keep it from being the masterpiece it could have been for example the storytelling is great it simply lacks that edge that could have elevated everything around it yet that is really enough i dont want to give the sensation that i still didnt have an amazing riveting and exciting time i look forward to checking out this one again and suggest for everybody to see this film go watch real action and not the fast cutting crap we are generally served,reality
fury road is the next installment in the franchise after a thirty year gap in this film a damaged man named runs into a group of people trying to escape an evil cult leader and is forced to help them escape before i enter the review i want to mention that i have never seen any of the previous films in the franchise from that perspective i found the film kind of exhausting from a technical standpoint it is just about flawless the action scenes are absolutely incredible to behold the visual style is unique and the character design that goes along with it is perfect the world building of the postapocalyptic wasteland is really good the film clearly shows an in depth society of people that have rallied together to not only survive but to live most of the action looked practical which only made the action even more enthralling the problem i had with the movie is that there was so little plot and character development and what was given to us was given way too late that i begin to ask why i should care about these people over the other survivors sure their adventure might be more exiting but i know so little about them and what i did know was so generic that i just didnt connect with them this might not be an issue if you have seen the other films a possible exception to this is furiosa the main character of the film do not let the title mislead you is not the main character he just shows up and helps out the entire plot is driven by furiosa and all of the big characters moments where with her there were some interesting moments dealing with a cult member but it felt like all of that character development happened off screen most of this development is done though body language grunts or generic responses of questions i had been asking myself for more than half an hour the main villain was well designed but other than being an abusive cult leader i know nothing about him i dont even remember his name some might praise the minimalist plot but since the other two hours of the film was pure action i began to become desensitized to it i love to eat chocolate but if i only eat chocolate for a week ill get sick begin to want healthier food the same goes for action in movies action scenes mean more if there was build up again this is not a bad movie but i just could not get invested in what was happening enough to really care while this might be a landmark in terms of visuals and action it is lacking substance in its plot and characters,reality
i just finished watching fury road and boy am i tired not tired in the sense of the movie being boring but exactly the opposite the movie is exactly the opposite there is just so much going onfrom the opening scene you get propelled into this world this world of survival this world of no breaks in action this world of pushing forward i dont know how else to describe it except to say that in a 2 hour movie there is 1 hour and 45 minutes of solid action you dont get to take a break it is exhaustingi could talk to you about the great cast charlize theron is her usually fantastic self shaved head arm missing covered in dirt and she is still just the definition of beauty tom hardy as usual puts his own spin on the character where is almost more animal than man more than sane he is a perfect fit for this world that exists at the end of humanitybut the real star of this movie is not the actors and actresses but it is the dessert it is a world in which everything hurts everything is a struggle existence is pain the action sequences just help to highlight the fact that there is no life at all in the dessert it is just you and your carin the end is short on pot short on dialogue every word seems to be a struggle coming out of the characters mouth but i think that is by design because in this world there is no small talk there is no joy there is only survival and to survive you must keep moving and that is exactly what fury road does from the opening scene to the closing credits it keeps moving,reality
fury road is an excellent action movie its visceral beautifully shot and has a heartpounding soundtrack that perfectly matches the offthewall action on screen it is not a great movie however despite all the high scores its received from critics and fans alike in fact i think its overrated leave it to me to be the one who picks it aparti have no allegiance to the franchise or advertisersfury road starts with a flashback accompanied by voiceover from tom hardy as he provides a quick rundown of his haunted past and the postapocalyptic world that he lives in water and resources are scarce the world is a desert wasteland filled with packs of psychopathic bandits running rampant in supercharged custombuilt muscle cars and buggies if youve seen the previous films or played any of the fallout or borderlands games youve got the ideaat the center of this wasteland is the citadel the kingdom of skullfaced warlord immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne which runs like a welloiled machine of human slavery powered by joes cannon fodder minions the pale war boys who are indoctrinated to believe that the greatest glory is to die on the fury road and meet joe in valhallaafter a caravan led by imperator furiosa charlize theron one of the fiercest warriors in joes legion embarks from the citadel on a seemingly routine mission and war boy nux nicholas hoult join forces with furiosa as she attempts a rebellious plot to flee with joes five wives and escort them to safety to her childhood home known as the green placeof course this plot enrages joe and he immediately calls his banners to take down furiosa and recapture his wives the rest of the movie is basically a huge chase scene as we watch furiosa and company traverse the wasteland in pursuit by joe and his thugsso what are the problems with this movie that i alluded to above the main issue lies with tom hardy and the second is with the actiontostory ratioi am personally a big fan of tom hardy but he is honestly characterless in this movie and lacks charisma yes he was written to be a man of few words a true strong silent type but i never believed that he was this legendary hero named sure tom handles the action fine but there is nothing noteworthy about his performancefurthermore he lacks chemistry with charlize theron which is not surprising considering the two stars apparently had major problems on set im not sure if this was tom hardys fault or george millers the writerdirector but overall i found his performance to be underwhelming as he mumbles his lines in an unintelligible nonaustralian accent and comes off as a mindless brute not a good guy who used to be a cop and had a family but resorted to violence because it was necessary like mel gibsons portrayal in the previous moviesto put it simply this movie may have taken place in the universe but never showed uphowever despite my problems with tom hardys performance i have the exact opposite opinion of charlize therons i thought she was excellent as furiosa a skilled and strongwilled woman with just enough vulnerability to make her human and not just a man in a womans body she is the real star of the movie and is just kind of there to fight bad guys he has no real purpose or motivationalso nicholas hoults performance as nux is excellent and he is the only one who has any real character development as he transitions from being another countless minion to a man with a soulmy second issue with the movie is the lack of background story for newcomers youre never given much context to understand the motivations of the characters and what is going in the world youre basically just thrown in and expected to go along for the ride which makes it difficult to care about anything other than furiosa and nuxs arcs the only interesting characters in the movieproscharlize theron and nicholas hoults performances are excellentthe visual effects and music are greatthe character development occurs through action rather than words which is refreshingconstom hardys portrayal of is flat and underwhelming and he lacks chemistry with charlize theronthere isnt enough background story and context to give the story much gravitas thus there isnt much to care about other than furiosa and nuxs arcsa lot of the lines are inaudiblewhile the action is well done it becomes excessivethe violence is pg13 for all the killing going on you never really see any blood or gore which lessens the impactso with all this said do i recommend fury road yeah absolutely its a damn good action movie highly entertaining but if youre looking for another movie this isnt really it if it was called ine fury road that would have been a lot more accuratepeople are giving this movie 9s and 10s on imdb and its now 25 on the imdb top 250 list right under the silence of the lambs the usual suspects and se7en if youre seriously telling me this movie is as good as those classics then i think youre crazy fury road is fun but it has nothing on those movies which are all oscar winners and nominees i give it an 810lastly i saw it in 3d and i dont recommend it see it in 2d instead,reality
first of all i loved the original and the road warrior  not so much thunderdome miller has a unique vision and really knows how to amp your adrenaline button i am going to divide this review up in what i liked and didnt like about the new film i will keep the content vague enough as to not give spoilersfirst of all i loved the creativity and art direction you really do feel pulled into this world it doesnt matter where on earth this takes place you recognize the pieces of the machinery and it screams apocalyptic assimilation five stars for the creative vehicles traps weapons etc this is what the universe is all about i really loved the fact that the trailer contained mostly scenes from the first 15 minutes of the film so there is a lot of new footage to behold i hate when trailers give away all the best parts of the film that leaves you just wanting to watch the trailer again and skip the full feature price miller can direct an amazing sequence of action time and time again through the film i could feel the adrenaline rising and my heart pounding  it is rare to get such a rush from films these days there are a lot of surprises in the action classic miller unpredictability as for the violence yes there is plenty of guys getting shot blown up and run over however there isnt much graphic carnage i am not complaining but i not sure how they got the r rating granted there is a little bit of boob nudity but no cursing that i could make out i have seen more carnage on the walking dead so not sure what the r was protecting teens from dont take your kids ffsloses points for poor script and character development as to not spoil anything i wont go into explicit detail but you really dont care much about the characters is plagued by visions of the dead throughout the film and there is a lot of talk about redemption but it never really resolves there are many attempts to inject some sense of humanity into characters but for the most part the audience doesnt care shouldnt we be blowing something up right nowthe film score is often right on the mark and then way off track the beating drums and wailing guitar will hit their marks and then all of the sudden we are not doing anything terribly exciting and the score sounds like the excalibur theme its like they decided that when the action is brought down to a calm we had better amp the music up somehow tom hardy was terrible as honestly i dont know if it was the direction they were going or the lack of dialogue for but vin diesel has shown more emoting as groot the film didnt even seem to need him all that much it could have easily been called furiosas wild ride this was either poor casting or poor scriptdirecting because i love hardys other workthis film was geared for 3d and although i prefer to see films in 2d i could tell there was too many attempts to feed the 3d machine can we agree that 3d is dead and just make films for audiences to enjoy now stop making everything come at me bro i was also a little disappointed by the clearly excessive use of cgi i loved all of the practical vehicles and stunts so when i see crappy cgi it takes me out of the moment keep it real dont get lazyoverall this film is a heart pounding thrill ride i enjoyed my experience but it did not leave me wanting to see it again once you see the action sequences you are pretty much done,reality
after the dark knight we havent saw action like thisits just too incredible that 90s action in now daysfirst movies are great but they are not perfect like thiswe all know problem of now days action movies slowmo bad script too badass leading role and nonsense villainsthis movie is make things just too perfecti dont need to write about storyline i cant spoiler you guysi glad trailers did not give us spoilersjust go and see and feel the perfectionthank you for reading,reality
the devil is in the detailsis one of the first movie franchises to have shown audiences gritty and original postapocalyptic scenarios that have now become cult classics since the first installment in the franchise in 1979 made with a small budget of 400 000 many movies and games have been inspired by george millers vision such as escape from new york 1981 the fallout game franchisethe new movie had to face a lot of scepticism before its release many pointed out that it would do what most actionscifi reboots do that is to come up with a mess of blend cgi playstation action have poor character development and a stereotypical storyline fury road 2015 does not tackle all these issues entirely but at least proves that it is still possible to witness original and meaningful bigbudget movies for rrated audienceshow does it do it by caring about the details george miller grants us the thrill to have practical effects instead of cgi in almost all the action scenes he is not afraid to leave the audience outofease by not having the characters explain or showing what is currently going rather by giving us the chance to try and piece it together the movie is stylish but that is not the main focus the action scenes are gigantic but everyone is expendable as the protagonists are not invincible stereotyped superheros there is also no doubt that tom hardy and charlize theron were great casting choices as their coldminded characters have very few flaws of performancethere would be only reason why this film would not be remembered as great if it was all about the explosions action and sex there is indeed a message underneath the madness and it can interpreted as a fear of whats to come postapocalyptic movies warn about the dangerous survival nature of man and about how tyrants would yield all the power and use whats left of man for their benefit this movie depicts this as the villain and his source of power over the masses water fury road does give us enough to think about enough so it doesnt feel like a waste of thrillsthe only hick there is too much in one movie to be only 2 hours long455,reality
ive never written a review before since no movie has been worth it but maybe interstellar well i had never heard about before it launched this year and i did watch the trailer as i was on avengers 2 and didnt really think it would be that awesome since i thought they had revealed all in the trailer as most movies do todaymen was i wrong this movie has the perfect ingredients for a movie which really leaves you so speechless of awesomeness and surprises even is funny how crazy things get and that kind of makes it so much more real since its all build on the foundation of broken people running big egos and what noti cant stop thinking about how a starwars movie would be if it was in this intense form of epic style as fury road i really hope that directors from now on will stop whining and making a drama movie about feelings all over again and start to make movies that is not a broken record on the same subject like all the 1000s of movies who really suck because they lack true originality this movie is a form of art 9710 from me,reality
this is not a movie its energy its fury and fire in audiovisual form action that hammers like drums paced with machinecrafted rhythm a script that flows like lyrics verse chorus verse the same three chords but thats all you need its virtual joey ramone its beautiful it rocks this movie stage dives out of the screen this movie rocks,reality
this film is just wow i cant explain the feeling it left me other than i must watch this again the stunts the biggest part of the film by far were brilliant tom hardy was amazing as the title character and i didnt realize that venom and bane played until the end so props to that but that doesnt take anything away charlize theron was pretty good as furiosa my only complaint if you want to call it that is that the film doesnt need to be rated r it was a hard pg13 but no rto sum up if you get the chance watch fury road or as the posters call it madfury road ,reality
can it be a great film without much plot well pulls it off you wont be bored at any time despite the writing being minimal and heavily dependent on postproduction,reality
its a postapocalyptic movie which features an enormous wasteland where many fight for survival using highly modified petrolfueled war machines the plot is pretty good having an interesting premise and being nonlinear an mostly unpredictable its filled with complex characters each with its own problems and purpose who ultimately end up fighting for their lives the scenes look great the action is intense generating plenty of drama and suspense while bringing something new from time to time just to spice things up and keep the story interesting the actors are great doing a very good job in impersonating such unique characters making them likeable but also crediblein terms of downsides i think that it could have had a bit more pace in some scenes as it tends to turn things to the boring side it doesnt get there but a bit more pace could have done it much good also the wasteland presented might be the perfect place for its vehicles to unleash their power but it seems a bit predictable not leaving much room for something unexpected maybe a different choice of filming locations could have helped a bit in this department but by far what let me down the most was the wowfactor it wasnt able to produce something that will blow your mind something that will make you jump from your chair or chew your fingernails in tension its very good in all these aspects but not amazingoverall its a movie which i enjoyed thanks to its plot its characters but also thanks to its quality acting the action plays an important role while some drama helps build up the great atmosphere it could have done a bit more in terms of pace and predictability limited of course to a couple of scenes which could have been improved but overall it managed to be good and even very good in most aspects providing a quality time watching it still its a bit far from impressive fact which makes it a bit shy from the imum rating,reality
this one is my absolute favorite among action movies filmed in 2015 i never enjoyed the original movies with mel gibson except the first one which is alright and went to the cinema mostly for a piece of dense postapocalyptic atmosphere i was awed shocked amazed and thrilled all at once roaring diesel engines endless sands savage people fighting to last a little longer under the burning sun than their neighbors and of course the vehicles they are the main characters of this movie not the actors although the latter did well especially charlise theron an exclusive big thanks goes to the director for the flamethrowing blind electric guitar thrasher i might be wrong but this was something not previously shown in action movies,reality
this is my first review on this site and wanted to do it mostly to thank all the people involved in making this great movie a truly classic masterpiece with over the top action and one of my favorite movies all time,reality
this movie is an amazing addition of the stories it is definitely a great chase movie it has all the action and enjoyment to keep the viewer entertained with the acting and visuals to show the real madness of the wasteland that the movie is set in,reality
this is a nearperfect action film that deserves to be seen never have i seen this much action and in one film that at times can be surprisingly emotionally stirring the highframe rate cinematography fits to pace the film dont be surprised if this gets technical nominations come awards season a great soundtrack complements it too that is sure to become iconic along with the film so superb movie it mixes action with thriller whose intensity is driven by emotion as much as it is by motion my rating 910,reality
first off let me start off saying that people who are giving this movie one star and claiming that its mindless action is not only wrong but mindless themselves its true that fury road is a movie that can be enjoyed without thinking too much its also true thats its a movie which has required an insane amount of work to produce there are so many details in the movie that one could watch it ten times and still discover new things its a visual masterpiece and probably without exaggeration the best looking action movie ever made to people claiming that its not well written that is partially true this movie wasnt written it was story boarded  but writing good action sequences is one of the hardest thing to do as a screen writer and this movie has one amazing action sequence after the other the plot is simple but works a henchwoman rebels against a tyrannical leader and frees his concubines and a chase ensues its a minimalist plot but it works brilliantlyso do yourself a favor and dont listen to the critics because this movie is going down in the ages,reality
my rating  910pure postapocalyptic action from start to finishfury road is intense and feels like going to an amusement park ridenonstop action,reality
really the movie is just one big car chase and its all good characters are pretty simple but the action is where it truly shines if you like fun simple dumb fun you should watch this movie,reality
a very sensible science fiction screenplay is also a great action film directed by george miller day starring tom hardy and charlize therongeorge miller is not getting the gaza come to the film watching the movie so well usedthe film shows us how the world is and what it is,reality
fury road is the perfect movie for any action movie lover brings nonstop action with the perfect mix of world building however the movie does not put much priority on character development however it makes up for it through all of the amazing things that this movie does throughout with intense really well done car chase sequences is perfect for any movie lover that does not mind the quirky nuclear fallout world and events that happens through the film,reality
very boring not much sense and a disappointing ending as it built up but ending like a fart instead of the explosion it should have been,reality
1110 best movie of all time great action great story great visuals best movie of all time,reality
where do i start  im part of those very few who hadnt seen fury road to this day were in 2018 for whatever reasons while i had some definite interest in it im also part of those few who havent seen the original trilogy logically when the fourth installment aired on french television i was beyond excited well fury road definitely lived up to my expectationsevery character has a real purpose and follows through with itjunkie xl as the soundtrack i swore all along this was him junkie xl is also responsible for soundtracks such as 300 rise of an empire  which was admittedly way better than the film itselfthe imagery the artistry its a splendid film which we dont see often in the action genre the color palette is incredible as well as the contrast for most of the run theres a lot happening on screen but the viewer is never lost in itthe editing is just as superbpractical effects everywhere  another reason why it all looks so good according to director george miller 90 of the visual effects in fury road were practical the stunts are impressivei was left a bit perplexed as to why norse mythology was mentionedused by the war boys i might have missed something but this felt a bit out of place to me especially since one of their opponents was actually called the valkyriefury road was an exceedingly satisfying experience i felt like all my senses were tingled and the first chasing scene with the war rig the buzzards and immortan joes war boys had me sitting on the edge of my seat  i was literally leaning forward towards the screen almost squinting by the end and letting out a little sigh when it did the person i was watching it with had the exact same reaction and did exhale too we were just that immersedthe film manages to keep you interested despite a linear simple story its all about survival redemption resurgence and hope nothing original nothing we havent seen before but george miller succeeds on making it feel new on creating empathy from us viewers for its although numerous mains also and as the poster shows the real main in this film is none other than furiosa charlize theron rockatansky tom hardy is a good nearly silent second leadultimately fury road is proof you can make a beautiful movie with complex characters female leads a feminist subtext violence and a whole lot of action all of that while appealing to a large audience 1010,reality
to quote yourmoviesucks its a lot of funin fact it is very fun mainly because of the breathtaking action sequences and the genious score by junkie xlthe story may be a bit thin but it serves its purpose and it connects the storydriven and action scenes very well overall 810i would recommend this movie especially to fans of action movies,reality
this film felt like the full realization of george millers original postapocalyptic vision from aesthetics to adrenaline if anything it improved on the formula adding a dash of mystery and caper along with all the effects that are now possible in 2015 and the extra dose of feminism did not hurt either if you want a great summer action movie this is it,reality
this movie gave me chills due to the thrill and excitement of the moviethe stress on doing the film more the of the old way meaning less cgi really should be considered as an achievement due to the abundance of cgi used in movies in the past 12 decadethe first is a under appreciated movie but this movie is in a whole new levelthe soundtrack is out of this world and borderline amazing and characters performances were spectacularthis could have been a masterpiece and an easy 10 but the middle part of the movie was slightly stretched to my likingoverallafter watching this movie you would saywhat a moviewhat a lovely movie and surely not say mediocre ,reality
this movie is a great example of why directors of action movies should show dont tell shouldnt craft uninspired overthetop epic narratives and shouldnt try to make the audience care about bland characters and their motivations by showing us 5 minutes of their life before the actual movie startsgeorge miller cut out all the unnecessary bits and by doing so delivers something a million times more engaging than most action movies ive seen in my life the world of is completely absurd and rich with details its visually stunning and the action is well choreographed and never fails to entertain and characters seem like actual human beings instead of onedimensional stereotypes ive seen this movie 6 times already and will probably watch it another 5 times in the coming year its awesome,reality
a few little things here and there but my main problem with it is that it isnt really my type of movie this dystopian thing  that kind of action if you like that stuff this movie is incredibly great it looks beautiful the action is really well done  the acting is great and it has some emotional stuff as well and i can say that i still had a lot of fun with it i just cant see myself rewatching it many times because of the reason i mentioned before so rating this is difficult but i feel comfortable with a 45,reality
i wouldnt have thought that george miller could overcome himself after the trilogy with mel gibson but just look this 4th movie is really superrascal i have no words to describe what pleasure i felt watching it for the first time great director great story ill have to revisit it many times and in much better conditions on a larger screen not on the laptop and with the right bigger sound why because the movie is great real show it lets you breathless everythings supercool starting with the setting of the namibian desert and ending with charlize therons amputated hand this woman is beautiful even without a hand and with no hair on her head beautiful and gifted i was just waiting to see an action movie and nothing more but george miller manages much much more is far more profound than an exceptional action film its the highest quality adrenaline plus a simple touching humanist message once again charlize theron is a gorgeous extraordinary actress the scene when she realize that the green land where she was born doesnt exist anymore is very strong the whole movie is emotional i was expecting to be more punkrock but its a supersymphonic drama each frame is carefully filmed the installation is staggering everything that moves on the screen is thought with great craftsmanship and attention every character every actor everyone is great unique show supershow of great days all is impressive the bad guys the young girls the older warrior women all the madmen all the schizophrenics are all out of an overwhelming world of the gloomy future of the planet earth and the cars those metal monsters the motorcycles everything is super super great music and breathtaking shooting and editing i would give it 11 but i cant,reality
i dont understand what the hype about tom hardy is from what ive seen i can barely understand him when he grumbles and mumbles but maybe doesnt like to talk maybe is a man of action so if the guy keeping all the water from the people learned to distribute it better drank some himself and gave some of the milk to the peoplemaybe theyd have fat to burn off in the hot sun and he wouldnt have been so clogged up where do these people live what do they eat,reality
im going to have to be that guy and admit that i didnt like this as much on second viewing i dont think my opinion about any of the parts has changed but my relative weighting of their importance has shifted ill say right up front i dont think this is a bad film a lot of it is more than a little exceptional the action scenes especially the final chase are incredible its pretty much everything else about it that i could do without the story and characters are pretty dumb thats not a new thing  its pretty much true of all the films in this series and its what really buries the 3rd one but in past films none of the bad elements are amped up to absurd levels through the use of excessive cgi and a ridiculously frenetic pace if you consider the road warrior that films grounding in a very real seeming physicality gives its broad sketchy characters the aura of archetypes its like a post apocalyptic western this film feels like a cartoon or maybe a video game a really really good one but still  a video game,reality
i wont say that this movie took me on a wild ride because that would be the pinnacle of uninventive writing but well ok  it did being familiar with the old installments i had trouble imagining where a new one could go but of course like everybody else i got excited by the teasers as well as all the hype that started building around the release and  to quote my summary line oh my god isnt it amazing how much fun can still be had with a movie that isnt much more than trucks chasing each other and here and there explode in a big ball of fire it goes to show that a dreamlike quality  in this case a nightmarish one  can go a long way compared to so many movies nowadays that are too talky or that are just too much like literature or even more often like the comic strips they were made of this is a movie that doesnt tell us anything  its a movie that is mainly just showing us stuff and what great stuff it is,reality
fury roadan action movie that sets the standard for all that follow fury road sets the pace very fast and doesnt let off the gas pedal at all set in postapocalyptic australia tom hardy is a drifter whose being sought after by the tyrannical forces that rule the land he gets mixed up in the fate of furiosa charlize theron a rebel woman looking for her homeland a group is formed with these two seemingly as the leaders among a radical worshipper and a group of female prisoners the party of misfits travel across the martian looking terrain coming across hordes of criminals under the tyrannic ruler immortan joewhile is a really fun and enjoyable experience it most certainly has its flaws my first and main problem with this film is the paperthin plot while most viewers across the nation are satisfied with the brilliant action sequences and lack of story i am not so easily pleased i admit that i am a huge sucker for a great story who isnt so i may have somewhat of a bias on this topic of conversation but falls extremely short of any sort of intricate plot the film sprinkles bits and pieces of plot points among the influx of action scenes but leaves way too much time in between plot points to really connect them and form a flowing story line story aside the characters themselves seemed a bit transparent as well with his name headlining the title of the movie you would think the camera would shine the spotlight on tom hardy this is not the case hardy stays extremely quiet throughout the whole film now i understand that character is a big bad silent brooding tough guy but why would you waste hardys immense talent on such a role that would have sufficed with almost any other tough guy actor it just seems like a ploy to have a popular actor as the lead role in an effort to fill seats in the theaters with hardys performance fairly wasteful charlize theron as furiosa seemed more like the main character than furiosas character is explained in much more detail and she is given somewhat of a backstory while has these visions throughout the movie that are literally never explained its simple things like that which make the plot feel very choppy and superficialwith my plotrant out of the way its time to begin my praise for how magical the visuals setting and action sequences are in this stunning film id like to start with the amazing setting in which this journey unfolds the landscape shots in this film are an absolute treat to the eyes and leave you wanting to explore this barren wasteland in your own killer vehicle since i already brought up the vehicles i must say they are one of my favorite parts of the movie every car and truck brought on screen is designed to be an offroad fighting machine focuses more on practical effects than cgi much unlike other action films these days this somewhat risky approach absolutely pays off in originality and creativity making this movie a bright example of what action films should be in the future as far as the actions sequences go they are second to none with stellar editing and proper framework showcases the action exactly how you want to see it while there are an obscene amount of explosions its an action movie what do you expect they are a bit more tasteful than some of the other movies we see these days cough stahhhp michael bay coughpersonally fury road didnt really cut it for me the lack of development for the plot did not sit well with me at all with more attention to detail i think this could have been an amazing film that being said i cant say i didnt enjoy the beautiful landscapes creative costumes and the rugged vehicles with stellar visuals and unprecedented action sequences its no wonder was a huge hit and undoubtedly one of the best films in the genre fury road sets the foundation for how action films should be made in the future if you enjoy action movies or just like seeing stuff blow the hell up go watch this movie if you really liked it get ahold of me and ill sell you my copy,reality
this film is an okay entry into the action film genre it has lots of fights and things blowing up there is also enough of a balance of slow points to advance the characters development and keep the audience interested the problem is and its a big one the titular character doesnt seem to share any of this development if youre going to title a movie it seems obvious that the from the title should share in the character developmentthe titular gets captured by a group of warriors led by a psychopath warlord and used as a blood donor for the troops meanwhile furiosa a driver for the same warlord takes a bevvy of women being transported to a nearby warlord off toward her homeland this is an excellent setup which could allow for many and varied opportunities for character development for both furiosa and supporting characters unfortunately the character development seems reserved for furiosa the women being transported and a member of the warlords soldiers we learn of furiosa and the women being transporteds past we see the soldier coming to the realisation that he has dedicated his life to a lie we see the women change from frightened and defenceless to fighters and the soldier from villain to champion even furiosa grows from a runner into a leader when she learns her homeland is gone on the other hand stays the same throughout the movie right up to the very last few minutes when his character is thrown a meagre scrap of a bone in the form of trusting furiosa enough to tell her his name and give her a transfusion he has unexplained visions and nightmares nothing else from his past is revealed those not familiar with the franchise are left wondering who this is and where he came fromthere is a gaping hole left in the story the one who opens the movie and whos name is in the title is a mystery we learn almost nothing about him and see almost no character development from him this ultimately leaves the film feeling unfinished to the uninitiated viewerin the end this movie is good not great the visuals are impressive the stunts amazing and the cg where used seamless the same cannot be said of the story which unfortunately should have been sent back to the drawing board a few more times,reality
already guns have started to talk in wasteland usa remenber wasteland is a video game not reality but still miller tries his last film with the last same tools filming the last fellow and last girl u imagine u can live with in the dry wasteland before the real huge strike beginsthis is another appetizer of whats coming in every ones garden so 30 minutes is what we shall look at before trucks and morons start destroying everything in our saloon so enjoymany things we have seen in these last fifteen years show up in a funny way here the pleasure is mostly to see them painted again with dramatical talent and action looks like a harsh and fast but fun and rich drawing of very sad memories  but the first 30 min are very very entertaining,reality
i remember as a kid watching the old movies the ones with mel gibson and tina turner and they were pretty good fun and entertaining with a lot of action and adventure good guys against bad guys a thrill ride thru a wasteland of a desert universe of different people in a different time so just recently i watched the new entry fury road and i must says it was okay for a modern day action film a journey of action and adventuredirector george miller goes to great measures to show this film as a battle of the different classes of rulers a story of rich against poor and a rebel class of female warriors who come to save the day tom hardy is the renegade whos captured by the evil and dangerous people of the desert land only to be rescued and joined in battle by a pack a group of female rebels all lead by charlize theronthis film may not be everyones cup of tea as i didnt find it the greatest still it entertains with action and shows the new class of rulers being females which makes a strong gender statement and i guess if your a fan of the series its one to watch,reality
in some postapocalyptic desert a guy is captured by a bunch of guys hes kept as a source of blood for ill citizens of the citadel in charge of it all is some old guy whos wasting away hes controls the water in the area and keeps the population below the rock in misery and thirst occasionally he opens the floodgates and lets water run down to the masses who adore him at least that day one day he sends some select few to gather weapons in exchange for waterbut on the way to this exchange the girl driving the truck a charlize theron ruined by a super short haircut changes routes and goes rogue the rest of the entourage is confused until they realize what shes doing and go after her among those driving after her is a sick guy who has the guy from the intro chained the the front of the car eventually the guy has his chance and frees himself this is at a point when he and the other rogue truck are by themselves turns out the girl is transporting a bunch of nymphs to safety the ruler enraged goes after them himself with a convoy of craziesthe girl aims to reach the green place and our hero joins forces with her of sorts after they realize that they are no threat to each other first they have to escape the the other gang with whom the deal was going to take place more violence ensues the girl meets a couple of girls to whom shes related and they decide that the best course of action is to drive back and take over the citadel and eliminate the rulerthe first 45 minutes or so of are quite exhilarating it could have been even better if our lead character werent bound and wearing a mask that wont allow him to speak but only grunt but dialogue is definitely not a strength of this movie there is very little of it and what there is is rather adolescent storywise its absolutely mindboggling how 23 of the way into the story they decided to turn things around and basically repeat the first 13 making a good chunk pointless for a moment things do pick up as for a while the movie had lost plenty of steam so we have a movie thats 30 minutes too long and completely wastes a character that should have been a lead what youre left with is wondering at the visuals and this neat world they created for an rrated action movie this one is rather mild and could have benefited from gorier sequences and some nudity,reality
trips you up because is not the centre of the movie  furiosa is once you figure that out the film is much easier to digest just really goes along for the ride but doesnt seem to drive the action in any meaningful way technically the cinematography is very well done and the bendy poles swinging in and out of the frame was inventive the electric guitar shooting fire was wonderfully bombastic and signals that subtlety will play no part in this film immortan joe was a little too derivative of batmans bane and the romance subplot between the harem wife and the fanatical war boy pushed credulity to its limits its a big loud sumptuous postapocalyptic opera of a film and pretty much delivers on what it promises pure escapism designed to sell popcorn and does it very well,reality
i felt sorry for billy connollys character he looked after those nice young ladies kept them fed and watered and all babied up then they reject the high life style  race across the desert in search of something that isnt there wasting fuel water and milk along the wayand loads of people die as a result of their ungratefulness they kill his unborn son and wife and then rip his face off billy connolly is well loved in the british isles  i dont think he deserved such a harsh outcome the film does have some extraordinary action sequences its a testament to these aging actors that they can pull off such high octane stuff,reality
first of all before i get to the movie itself some of reviewers here call this a reboot or remake and it is not it is the fourth movie in the series one earlier review stated i saw the original he is supposed to have a dog etc by original i assume the reviewer meant the second ie the most popular in the us the road warrior heshe is missing the continuing story and the point entirelyanyways on to the moviefirst off the visuals are excellent as you would expect in this day and age with such a budget unfortunately the story itself follows the trend started in the road warrior and continued in beyond thunderdome in the first movie started out as a police officer in a lawless but recognizable time i personally cannot make the logic leap from that movie to the ridiculous dystopian world portrayed in the followups i have enjoyed watching the second movie not the third it was just a sad tina turner 80s vehicle complete with her singing the theme song as a mindless romp but i could never suspend my disbelief as good fiction should allow you to dothat said if you loved the road warrior as i know many people did then you will probably enjoy if not love this movie it feels a lot like that move with better effectsi give it 4 starts because it does fit the franchise and look good but it lost point on this story writing some silly effects flamethrowing guitar and the lack of good character development,reality
with a budget of nearly 100000000 or should i say nearly 100000000 more than the original 1979 you would expect this to be pretty good  so just as well its absolutely fantastically brilliant and barking then tom hardy is becoming one of my favourite actors he is so versatile charlize theron is brilliant as usual nicholas hoult yes you might say i recognise him from something shows he has come a long way since about a boy and theres a great bunch of baddies the assortment of vehicles are the real stars though they have taken the cut and shunt to a whole new level  wacky racers look like normal cars in comparison  i think the 3d effects were pretty good too not overdone and well worth seeing in this format doesnt really compare to the first which looks quite dated and cheap now but does resemble the better mm road warrior so if you looking for nearly 2 hours of action packed fun set in a deserted dystopian future you must go see this defo one for the blu ray list this crimbo my new favourite of the year so far,reality
those people likes this movie who are they not understands of one movie tehyre likes just action  choses their favourite actor  actresses they are not verify movie categor,reality
i am not an action movie buff i prefer movies about average human experiences mainly foreign movies like the ones iran makes still quiet movies which focus on character development and the narrative this movie blew all my preconceptions out the window i was mentally and emotionally exhausted by the end of it i could not forget the movie for months went back to the cinema and watched it 4 times the world and the characters who inhabit it are all believable and relatable the cinematography the speed at which the film raced the music costumes storyline character development it all blended perfectly the best part of this movie was seeing physically challenged characters on the screen with furiosa and one of the sons of the overlord you rarely see that in todays movies thank you for acknowledging their existencein my 40years i have never watched a movie any movie that has affected me the way this movie did bought the dvd still watch it every so often and every time is like the first time watching it,reality
for many years it appeared that george miller had retired the franchise which had fallen into disrepair well leaving the series for thirty years is bound to make it all the more difficult to return with fury road the fourth and now greatest film in the franchise miller is firing on all cylinders and the film is cinematic spectacle of the highest ordermy name is my world is fire and blood the opening line delivered with gusto and grittiness by tom hardy tells us all we need to know a the characters name b this is a world we are familiar with and c it has collapsed as a society but enough about the ins and outs of the film what does fury road offer in way of plot i can sadly imagine many unengaged viewers mumbling something to the sum of nothing yet thats not at all trueremember that 80s action film the one you loved when you were an adolescent and as an adult still do it had a plot a simple one which is all that is required not garbage a la resident evil or gibberish and confused drivel with its own agendas like recent deluge white house down the film that was succinct straight to the point and did not wait for any man die hard predator and the terminator chances are if youre an action fan you have seen all three or at the very least heard of them fury road abides by the same principle its not dumbed down and its also not a bloated mess running at a streamlined 120 minutes its not three hours long because it doesnt need to befury road is the story of furiosa and the tyrannical leader of the oppressed people immortan joe the crux of it all is enslaved little more than a blood donor to the sick dying war boys of joes citadel breaks free and begrudgingly teams up with furiosa who is stealing immortan joes five prized wives in search of the fabled green place to find rest water and food on this journey they attempt to outrun joe and endure the heat of the ravaged australian wasteland but what makes fury road stand out from the crowd what stops it from being the next embarrassment to cinema like hitman agent 47 or the robocop remake is it at all worthy of a 97 on rotten tomatoes empires highest grade and my recommendation in short yes but let me explain whats wrong with action films nowadays 1 no character development when was the last time you cared about the fate of a character good or evil the emotions they harbour the chills they give you the love you inhabit for them fury road ensures that every character counts the five wives have their own traits and definable personalities furiosa is the strongest female character that hollywood has given birth to and despite so called evidence to the contrary is never overshadowed and all the characters work in harmony with one another building upon and breaking relationships throughout the natural progression of the story2 too much cgi the best example superhero films they look so fake that you wonder is this what passes for realism miller throws cgi out of the window and pours gasoline over it for good measure 99 of fury road utilises the limits of what practical effects can do the other 1 colour grading and the melding of several key shots together what you witness on screen is all real from the rusting metal trucks down to the very dust that settles as they whizz past in and out of frame3 subpar acting or as i refer to it  the sam worthington effect whereby the action overshadows the performances not that they were terribly great to begin with anyway its not the case here charlize theron excels as furiosa tom hardy grumbles with gravitas as and hugh keaysbyrne toecutter from 79 is as riveting as he is horrifying as immortan joe there is no way that miller allows this trio to get lost in the mix and he handles the performances with due precision4 frenetic editing the killer of any hope of an excellent action film is all in the editing too many tak3n the expendables and transformers live or die by the hands of the edit fury road doesnt just live it breathes new life into the action genre we can tell in any given shot space of time or singular moment what is going on when and why each frame is sped up or slowed down ensuring we never lose focus and the film throttles along at a considerable pacebut wait theres more the music is loud and hefty in the thrilling action set pieces and quiet in the subtle character driven scenes of which there are a great many the cinematography on the other hand deserves its own review its a cinephiles wet dream with john seale capturing the expansiveness of the seemingly never ending desert and the tragic note of hope that furiosa so desperately clings tohold on somethings not right i havent mentioned the action think of the most heart thumping scene you have experienced from a single film times that by twelve subtract awful editing and add enemies on nitro powered trucks bikes polecats and throw in a guitarist operating a flamethrower for good measure that should give you an idea of what awaits you and how much adrenaline will be coursing through your veins after witnessing george millers action masterpiece thats the cinematic jewel of 2015 and one of the greatest action films of all time the review ends here theres only one thing left to say see the movie a,reality
when first started off you can see the wasteland and a man the only things you really need to see in a film i am going to be honest i have never seen a full movie until this one came out it was the stars and action that drew me into the film stars such as tom hardy the dark knight rises nicholas hoult x men days of future past and charlize theron men of honor are this day in age necessities when i saw the trailer i was instantly involved with the landscape of the film when those poles had those people just hanging on and along with the intense sound its enough to buy this film on dvd i just loved it its a movie you cant miss,reality
in todays world action movies are chock full of bad acting worse dialogue and overused computer effects now dont get me wrong this film has its fair share of cringeworthy lines and some computerized embellishment but what it brings from the long gone days of action is substance within the high octane thrills i came into this film knowing very little about the history of and where this film fits into the timeline but the opening scene paints enough of a picture of the dystopian world it is set in that you dont feel lost on the journey the blinding orange of the desert makes you almost feel the dry air and blazing sun and the roar of the engines is so intense you can almost smell the exhaust this film is a sensory immersion from start to finishthe best part about the film is how deliberate each action sequence is too often do i see random explosions and destruction that just seem to be thrown together for the wow factor but like a carefully choreographed dance millers action sequences and fight scenes grab you and hold you all the way through it reminds me of fight scenes and action sequences from indian jones and the epic battles from peter jacksons tolkien adaptations you can look back and recall specific moments from these sequences that make you say now that was cool each high impact scene holds its own yet flow perfectly together while still making you wonder how did they plan this out the intentionality and thoughtfulness put into the choreography of actors effects and sets with the almost perfectly framed shots and fact that primarily practical effects were used make for an truly awesome visual spectacle taking traditional action archetypes of the rebellious hero the deformed madman dictator villain the traitor and the lonegun fury road fills all of the expectations you would have going into a film like this while at the same time breathes new life into them furiosa becomes the unexpected hero of the film and charlize therons performance brings female action leads to a whole new level like matrixs trinity without the male character obsession immortan joe has some of the most original villain design i have seen since darth vader himself and like vader his costume and overall design beg for his backstory to be told on the other hand remains a very static tormented character throughout with really no overall effect on the plot if you are a fan of spectacles and fresh action this is the film for you i hope this film leads to a new trend in the genre that doesnt have to do with superheroes and inspires studios to give visionary directors the budget to pull off visual masterpieces like this more and stray away from the stale summer blockbusters we have become so accustomed to see,reality
fury road my score 810i dont get to say that very often but this story in every way was better than the original film there is quite a lot of story 1  in citadel youve got the haves and the have nots 2  the military who are brainwashed and drugged up think they are working towards valhalla they are being used this creates relevance and empathy for them 3  the woman are owned as breeders a lot of people in this society still want that 4  a strong female lead who outshines the male lead in nearly every way but he does perform well a good egalitarian balance overall 5  totally bad ass and great cinematography 6  guitarist was very cool 7  disillusionment redemption development of religion comfort lies and courage this movie had quite a lot of substance more than i expected it was emotionally satisfying and follows through rather well its not perfect but few movies are and ultimately its far superior to the original films,reality
with movie tickets getting more expensive these days its extremely rare for me to see a movie more than once especially when there are other movies i want to see the moment the credits started rolling however i knew i had to see it again i sacrificed seeing two other films so i could go to this a second timefury road is a movie that in my opinion everybody should see at least once from my point of view it is a metaphor of the world we live in today theres violence and chaos everywhere people fighting and killing each other over the most ridiculous things and evil powerhungry men who claim to be messiahs and to whom the demoralized masses flock but no matter how grim and bleak everything is people can remain decent human beings other more damaged people can improve themselves and they can unite in common humanity to improve the world even if only in a small way the film signifies this in a subtle but powerful way and it is some of the fastest two hours i have ever experienced in my life i would recommend it to absolutely anybody even the people who believed certain misconceptions of what its about definitely one of my favorite movies of all time,reality
man this film has breathed one heck of a breath back into the action genre dont get me wrong there has been quite a few decentgreat action films coming out here and there but not very frequently however this film stands above all of those previous in recent years action wise heck this film isnt just a masterwork of action film its also an incredibly masterfully made filmnow i shall elaborate one of my favorite aspects of the movie is how well its shot say goodbye to shaky cam for this movie and i assure you that you wont miss it take your pick of a crappy action movie out nowadays and you can see how badly the action is filmed the actions screen time is cut short by many cuts and the camera hardly ever catches all of the chaos that ensues well now you can rejoice because this film has excellent wide angle and smooth camera work and catches every aspect of the destruction making sure you witness every bit clearlythe effects are spectacular the stunts are spectacular and although its not a major key player in the film the acting is good to in case you havent heard this film is probably 90 action and in that 10 it still keeps your interest and uses its time wisely to build the characters if you also arent aware this film lives up to the films title of being because this film is absolutely crazy and whether or not you can either enjoy or tolerate the craziness can determine your enjoymentin conclusion this is easily one of if not the best action films of the last decade and maybe even back before that but should be given time before its determined for sure if what i talked about in this film review catches your interest on the movie than id say go see this film unfortunately just as every film has there are some that dont enjoy this film if you end up in that category some how than im sorry if you end up enjoying it like i hope then you can join in with a lot of other people to experience one of the best films of the year if i missed key points in my review i hope you catch them in someone elses review thanks for reading my review and i hope you enjoy the film,reality
simply a masterpiece miller is a genius the wait was worth it a must to watch and rewatch so many details acting atmosphere picture music mister miller places the boring general cinema to another level a special mention to charlize theron who brings so much intensity in her acting tom hardy hasnt much lines but his animal presence is amazing all the cast is stunning even the extras in this movie there is no room for imperfection some people criticize the plot i disagree read between the lines and youll find how deep it can be about human being once again this is a masterpiece and the movie of the year so far sad about one things how many years till the sequel ,reality
its been a long time coming for diehard fans and boy has it paid off personally i wasnt such a huge fan of the series until having seen this movie mainly due to my young age not reaching the glory days so this can come as a somewhat unbiased opinion about the movie  it is spectacular and glorious bold and shockingly gooda friend of mine told me that fury road is one of those movies that you can fearlessly call flawless i too would bet my money on such statement the cinematography in this movie is out of this world i am not kidding you the creativity involved in filming the highaction scenes is something that will leave you impressed for days to come the acting is superb tom hardys performance comes as a surprise in a very busy year for him the characters and story are once again topnotch the development actually takes a deep and philosophical route despite the incredibly intense action  which is present in about 85 of the movies runtimeif you like action movies even moderately i highly recommend watching this gem its worth your time for at least 3 repeated viewings,reality
i have to say i could write for hours about the geniality of this movie but ill try to be as brief as i canfirstly this is the new modern so forget about the old sequels the movie itself unlike the previous sequels doesnt go that much into the story but instead is based on variety of characters and crazy nonstop adrenaline action the very detail and the sickness of the post apocalyptic world is beyond comparison to any post apocalypse movie i have ever seen i mean nothing comes even close the dialogs the antagonists the action scenes and every detail in this movie is absolutely crazy sick and therefore perfect for this kind of a moviesecondly i have to praise tome hardy although he is not mel gibson nor is he trying to be tom hardy is perfect for these kind of roles and does very well accompanied with charlize theron a little younger version of in seek of a somewhat redemption which makes the story involve more around her and is a silent helper in that mission also hugh keaysbyrnethe legendary toecutter is back in a new arch enemy role and he is equally amazing as immortan joethirdly cinematography is absolutely incredible and i honestly dont know how the half of the scenes were even filmed during the movie somehow i remembered stanley kubricks legendary dr strangelove and it seems to me that this is exactly how he imagined the post apocalyptic world would look like after the end of dr strangelove to sum up if youre a fan its a must see and if youre not youre gonna have a tone of action and fun so i encourage watching this movie to everyonei have to say that i honestly dont believe that there will ever be a better post apocalyptic world than the one created by the amazing george millertwo thumbs up,reality
well it looks great  and theres even more of those marvelously costumed and madeup bad guys that helped make road warrior so memorable albeit that there it was done in moderation naturally it being a george millerhelmed movie the editing and shots of vehicles powering down that outback highway are to marvel at although as with a rollercoasterride the best rides are when you get some relief even if you know thrills are just splitseconds away cinematographywise it rivals nic roegs walkabout in its use of barren desert  except roeg employed thousands less people to tell his story  and more tellinglyi dont know exposition is considered by many to be a fourletter word and in cinemas case its absence is often justified with the dictum a picture tells a thousand words im a great believer in exposition though in both film and written storytelling blanks need to be filled in and an optimal harmony can be achieved of show and tell id read about the films feminist subtext and been somewhat wary of it particularly when its defenders had cited charlize therons furiosa heroine as being more critical than himself now having seen the film i dont see that as being a particular problem at least hers is a more plausible characterisation than sharon stones turn in the quick and the dead for example my main problem is with the basic script itself  and the somewhat muddiedhalfbaked feminist agendasub plot like what really was the journey really about and why did they ultimately make the decisions they did how critical were the travails of the rescued supermodels and their pouting and dresssense and especially what was the deal with those holdout female warriors  what exactly were they holding out for and from whom how did they survive for as long as they did with regards to basic plot elements i was put in mind of the animal farm mantra four legs good two legs bad in the films divide of men and women characters and indeed of the nursery rhyme the grand old duke of york as regards the journey is that really all there is and then theres archvillain immortan joe a welcome return for chief villain hugh keays byrne  albeit in a different guise how did he survive as long as he did and surely there would have been at least one ambitious successor waiting in the wingsit looked great it just needed even a halfdecent halfthought out semi plausible screenplay to make the ride that bit smoother ill be returning to the road warrior and but ill pass on rewatches or the dvd of this one  unless the directors cut gets to tell the whole story,reality
i kind of had set myself up to like this film as most films of this type i like what i didnt know is how much i would like it  why did i like it so much  simply because this is how you reboot an old film series you get the original producerwriter all the madness of the old films is here captured superbly with the war boys and immortan joe i think some people are saying this film is bad because of tom hardys performance  i disagree while i dont think he is anything spectacular as he does what is said on the tinto convey an image of a broken man who is just surviving what was really brilliant here though was the performance of charlize theron she outshines tom hardy and the film is all the stronger for her being there  the only downside to this movie is i wanted more more more,reality
the timing is excellent social issues discussed focused on equality and the fight of the feminist movement are very well worked also criticism of religion and the industrial society are very stronga film that shows a couple without any sexual tension women protagonists and sisterhood is a slap in the face of society that has its macho rootsit is also necessary to point out that the symbolic language is stronger that written language not underestimating the viewer the fast pace leaves us restless to watch fulfilling the action movie functionexcellent film witness me,reality
this fast paced postapocalyptic movie is a welcome change to your standard nowadays clich shoot emup with creative vehicles equipment and screen writing this movie is truly rather hard to fault the movie also consists of over 90 of the effects being practical and includes multiple stunts being performed by real people that could actually be believable unlike having a man jump from a falling train onto the back of a mustang with a 10 metre jump being the only thing in his way this movie is directed by same man george miller that directed the previous 3 and helps give fury road that wacky outside the box style to the action genre as touched on briefly the vehicles themselves in this movie are a reason alone to go and see this film with modified cars that still have the retro feel of the original movies from the 80sthere have been reports from multiple fools that this film promotes feminism which i must thoroughly disagree with i myself entered the studio to watch this film with those words in mind and yet as i try recall anything in the movie involved with feminism there was nothing at that could justify the statement those that say that this film promotes feminism are only butt hurt chauvinists that would burn a poster of lara croft or hate someone that is team kahleesi in a heart beat the second main character in this film is imperator furiosa charlize theron who is a strong willed woman that is second in command to the main antagonist and can kicks as much ass as in this movie she is the only reason that this film has been unfairly targeted for such accusationsmy only concern with this movie and i must stress this is only picking at straws is that there is so much action in this film that there isnt really a true cliat the end of the film im not saying that theres no big fight at the end trust me there is its only that in some ways you become so used to the literally action in this film that you still want more and more better and better explosions and fightingi highly recommend this film to anyone that is considering watching this to anyone who has seen the original 3 i can describe this film as the part in road warrior where theyre driving and escaping from the antagonist but with much more action and the driving is for the whole movie a definite 910 and a congratulations to george miller i only hope he can keep this up and better fury road with the next three on the way a hard task but certainly a possible one thank you for reading i hope this has helped,reality
the cars we drive say a lot about usthe recreation of the series caught my eye by accident and after watching actionpacked trailer i had to see the movie not only the experience was completely worth it it also brought forward a rather unusual way of presenting a movie two hours lasting car chase with exploding bikes people and twisted and tunedup vehicles from hell interwoven with displays of hot chicks running from rotten despotic sociopsychopath crowned by the performance of furiosa and  could it get any better than thatif you are a fan of experiencing new ways of film composition or a fan of from the older times or just love exploding cars heartpounding action and post apocalyptic crazy worlds then this movie is highly recommended to youride eternal shiny and chrome,reality
yes that is right storytelling in full use of his genius im serious about that george miller created what i believe should be syllabus to anyone who is interested in the art of motion picturethere is one director i put above the rest this is personal opinion of course and that would be stanley kubrick now i have to reconsider my personal best that alone is fantasticfury road was the first movie since a clockwork orange where i was a mess afterwards on the contrary while watching both movies i was in cinema heaven a long wait since a clockwork orange to encounter something like it i never thought that an full scale action movie would give me the exact same experience one precious surprise both movies are not made for everyone but at the same time for all of us thats my viewfury road has very little exposition most of that is in the very first minute alone for an action movie i think this is groundbreaking because it works perfect winding refns drive comes to mind where i think this is kinda similar the difference is fury road is constructed and filmed in a way it appeals more to the mainstream action fan more worldwide accessible i believe the cinematography and edit are key they are following a plan the camera tries to focus on the main point of interest at any given moment and while the action is really going there are no cuts longer than 3 seconds the frame rate is adjusted and most of the time you wont notice it all serves a purpose to engulf you its like a painting technique if that is working you can concentrate on a lot of other things like emotion story and character the story is not driving from a to b and back that i would call the linen the canvas the story is about a mislead man who just wants to be approved or loved for all the wrong reasons he brings the two anti heroes of the movie together as he crumbles he encounters something unexpected a human who happens to be a female who gives him what he needed the most just like that big spoiler at first the only thing that felt forced to me was nux falling so easy in love with capable after talking with my girlfriend about that scene i feel that it is the only acceptable reaction from someone like nux in that situation brilliant love on first sighttouch the first time i could buy that in a movie as a guy i can understand it completely but it needed time to click this young man stands up again the approval of his being gives him energy he is the one who saves all and more than one time at least 3 times and the most important is of course his last one he gives the movie the title after all while he foreshadows his intentions in the beginning the result is the same but not the meaningthe sound and music is really important to here you can hear that this is not done in hurry its like a high tech action operatom hardy and charlize theron are a perfect match to my view they should both be able to acknowledge that im sure there was tension while filming but you can feel the mutual respect out of this i believe comes only the best i think they are fantastic together i have seen everything from tom hardy so i was really exited about him being cast as rockatansky and he deliverscharlize theron is outstanding here this women doesnt need an oscar anymore i have the feeling she is above that nonsense and you can see that in her work of course no one is ever above approvalafter all thats the story here but oscars are just business the movie will be a classic and the actors immortal just because of this motion picture same goes for the team behind this masterpiece and last but not the least george millerchapeu 1010,reality
as big film lover this film had everything you wanted and expected from the franchise apocalyptic world big car chases with lots of destruction crazed lunatics creating and using some truly barbaric weapons the film shows the different types of people living in this savage world different tribes which makes you want to explore this world that lives in more good acting all round with no annoying characters like screaming helpless girls same same look as we left him although new actor and some great little nods to the original films i wish though tom hardy would of tried to put on more of an australian ascent rather than his usual bane voice,reality

george miller just threw down the gauntlet with authority the previous versions of are entertaining however this newest release is even more exceptional in every aspect genuine movie making at its finest to bring back keaysbyrne so creatively is genius and this movie is so intense i recommend you wear your dental night guard if youve got onebravo george and team you nailed it dare you to please do it againnow the question begs who else is willing to attempt to accomplish what george just did personally im hoping john mctiernan and walter hill are up for the challenge to name a few,reality
it was good and interesting but fights are too long and bore sometimes,reality
plot  normally id explain what i thought of the plot in my review but this movie doesnt really have much of a plot i mean there kind of is one but its not developed and it isnt very coherent action  the action is really good but it goes on for a bit too long if there were characters in this movie id probably care more about the actionvisuals  this movie looks kinda fake with all the bright colors doesnt stop it from being cinematic the fight scenes are really good and the overall look of this movie is great there is a lot of spedup footage though sounds  the soundtrack was good at first but then they keep reusing the same scores and it got boring overall this movie is way too long and not enough of that time is spent on the plot making it kinda dumb a movie needs more than good action and the appearance of being cinematic,reality
fury road is one of the vivid movies of 2015 the cinematography for this film is an absolute marvel showcasing the sprawling outback desert through hues of oranges and reds during the daytime contrasting it with beautiful midnight blues at night all this comes together to give the movie a very lively atmosphere the score alleviates the sense of rush and is smartly used diegetically as well as nondiegetically the action scenes are shot brilliantly with minimal special effect furthering its case as a masterpiece finally the acting especially that of charlize theron as imperator furiosa is topnotch and no character is left needing further characterisation tom hardys is a man of little words but the performances are so strong that the movie doesnt need dialogue in order to flourish this movie is definitely not hyped up go see it and then go see it again this sequel and reboot of the classic action franchise brings soaring vigorously back to life with a two hour action extravaganza that puts everything attempted in the original trilogy to shame the original trilogy was gritty and violent but compared to the colorful landscapes,reality
 fury road is the best action thriller i have seen in a very long time apart from its unique story plot the movie delivers to its audience something worth watching it can be gruesome for those who do prefer soft romance and chick flicks to actual horror and adventure movies but nevertheless it has created something exciting and what a cast the charlize theron and tom hardy combination is really spectacular to watch on screen i have not seen previous instalments so i am judging this movie purely on its own originality and performance my praises for this movie is not enough for those who love action and thriller movies this one should not be missed,reality
in a postapocalyptic world excop is captured by a group known as the war boys who work for the tyrant immortan joe taken to their citadel he finds himself used as a blood supply for nux a sick war boy when one of joes senior lieutenants imperator furiosa frees his wives and drives into the desert in her warrig the war boys give chase accompanied by who is chained to one of their vehicles after an initial confrontation frees himself and joins forces with furiosa together with joes wives they head east hoping to find the green place it wont be easy as joe and all of his war boys as well as their allies are in pursuit he is determined to get his wives back and punish furiosa for her treacheryif you are looking for something deep and meaningful this isnt the movie for you however if you want nonstop adrenalinpumping mindless action then prepare to have a great time little time is wasted on exposition before we are thrown into the action which barely lets up till the film is over the plot is fairly basic but that doesnt matter the film looks great i was immediately stunned by the burnt orange desert landscape in which the action takes place that action is thrilling as it constantly looks as though things go badly for our protagonists tom hardy does a fine job as but it is charlize theron who dominates the film as furiosa her character is more interesting than as it is her motivations that drive the narrative is a victim of circumstance who finds himself along for the ride as one might expect there is a good variety of strange vehicles and even stranger characters overall id definitely recommend this to anybody looking for insane nonstop action it is certainly a welcome addition to the series of films,reality
okay okay i understand how some people are immensely disappointed in this film it doesnt have much of a good story and the acting is dull at times so if thats what youre looking for move on however the entire movie is a spectacle an enormous av experience the cinematography is top notch with absolutely gorgeous scenery explosions etc the main reason i applaud this film is for its portrayal of a whole post apocalyptic gang ridden world there are leaders and armies and territories and whatnot there is a unique cast of characters in intriguing looking costumes riding in ridiculous cars with massive weapons in terms of the culture of the film and the whole underlying premise and cast of characters and the visuals it bleeds creativity its stunningly beautiful but are all the visuals and weaponcharactervehicle design worth a ten no which is where the final piece comes in the score junkie xl has crafted a deep moving epic score to accompany the action the pounding drums and searing guitars melded with the string section creates a wonderful atmosphere my favorite aspect of the movie is the giant truck with war drummers and the doof warrior who is a blind monstrous guitar player strapped to the truck with bungee cords world in a giant flame throwing guitar the whole movie is just creative genius all around,reality
youve got to admire director george millers imaginative costuming and overly and often grotesque display of post apocalyptic wheeled machinery and the endless road battlesbutand this is a big but after about 30 minutes it begins to make the minds eye glaze over and put the viewer in an uncomfortably numb state of nightmarish nothingness the film is scant on plot or motivation beyond the elementary good and evil are displayed in a way to displace philosophical musings with a comic book look and grunting testosterone telegraphingtom hardy could have been replaced with an unknown and nothing would be diminished he is literally dumb insane and without his wits and is reduced to groans and hyper spastic movementscharlize theron is equally replaceable with very little dialog and just glares most of the time overall action junkies and thinking deprived attention deficit types will most likely be enthralled and entertained it is one big eye candy of a movie that is at its best when it invites the viewer to scan the screen for all of that loving detail that miller put into the thing others with a hope for a modicum of storytelling and rumination about the worlds resources and lack thereof are most likely to be furiated,reality
was i the only person who didnt love or even really like this movie when i went to go watch this with my friend we would whisper michael bay to each other every time there was an explosion we said it a lot although i thought that charlize theron and her character furiosa were great the rest of the movie seemed only just above average with explosions left right and center and the overall story seeming to give up during one of the many many car chases only to pick up again later on overall this movie seems like a runofthemill action movie with a single good character and plenty of car chases and explosions that has been overhyped to oblivion,reality
the five out of ten rating for is based solely on the stunningly beautiful visuals of the desert sands which are featured almost continuously the story and script are rather silly with a wasted charlie theron and the equally talented tom hardysee bronson for a real taste of mr harrys acting ability the pair spend two hours being chased by numerous evil bald men with a variety of weapons and exotic vehicles with gigantic tires for easy navigation through the off road terrain i grew tired of the repetitive nature of the battle scenes even though they are spectacular at first a large screen is mandatory for this epic,reality
the first 30 minutes are a struggle sure a lot is happening but mostly i noticed that george miller action director extraordinaire was cheating almost every action beat fight or crash or whatever was speeding up the film which is the lazy way to make it look fast exciting whatever mostly it made it look like a cheap direct to dvd foreign action flicktom hardy for a lot of the film just grunted throw that in with the jerky and very obviously sped up film and it was painfulfinally about 45 minutes in the story became more interesting and compelling but the homages seemed to cry out creatively tired im referring of course to the jawas on motorbikes which seems like bad fan fiction rather than an original creation other images seemed lifted from the dark crystal and were strange retreads of millers own workthe few moments of real excitement and adrenaline only made the rest of the films flaws more pronounced and sad,reality
sometimes a movie comes around that thoroughly entertains you and youve forgotten most of it when you leave the cinema last year we had john wick in 2013 thor the dark world 2012 taken 2 the pattern goes on these films are endlessly entertaining and they make for positive experiences but they cant help but feel a bit empty a bit videogameyi do not mean to diminish off the bat  its wildly entertaining and well made but its no masterpiece and i will be firm with that from the start i made a video game comparison with john wick and i feel that the comparison is even more appropriate with fury road it would have worked a lot better as a video game than it did as a film the film is relentless with its action set pieces every single character is an interchangeable badass and the non action sequences play like cut scenes leading up to the third act the titular stops furiosa from fleeing across the desert and insists instead they should go back through all of joes forces at this point i thought to myself yep gotta go back towards the plot and the action or this would get boring quickly sure there was a couple of bits of justification for it but i couldnt help but feel that the action not the story dictated a lot of this films directionok onto positives this film excelled in every below the line category it could stunt action was epic production design was off the charts cinematography was unreal costumes and make up were world class and those visual effects  boy those were something special the explosions were unbelievable and the sandstorm was truly spectacular to behold tom hardy did a superb job in the lead  role of his back story is well handled and tom hardy brings a quiet ruthless crazy efficiency to the part i also really enjoyed nicholas hoult as nux probably his finest performance to date charlize therons furiosa was polarising for me  she displayed real grit and proved herself a capable action star but i didnt get any sense of her as a character she seeks redemption but doesnt tell us what that even means i choose to blame the writing over theron herself because she proves herself quite capable when the occasion calls for it the various collection of models and strongmen who make up the supporting cast do adequate jobs more than youd expect of them based on their resume but a lot of the time they dont do much more than look good one thing i did wish is that theyd all stuck to one accent or at least explained why some are americans and others are australianmuch like john wick before it fury road wasnt the most engaging of films but the action is really superb and even more importantly im very excited about the world it built this wasteland full of post apocalyptic tribes fanatical barbarians and crazed vigilantes is one id love to revisit a sequel more focused on story and less dictated by the most action may be a less visually sating but more satisfying overall,reality
well that was weirdraw brutal grotesque bizarre surreal savage pure adrenaline this is just nonstop car chases and action great visuals great score great production makeup scenery stunts and practical effects plot is thin as paper  and yet charlize theron manages to shine and do a great job while tom hardy is almost transparentmy main critique other than the thin plot has to do with the editing like in many action movies these days the editing just just ultrafast to the point you cant really understand whats going on and your eyes get really tired combined with the theaters air condition i can see why someone wrote that its better to watch it in 2d before watching it in 3dthe grotesque angle reminded me of jeanpierre jeunets style mixed with the name of the rose jeanjacques annaud judge dredd and 300all the audience had the same look on their face wtf did i just watchall in all this is a decent movie just put your brains in neutral no pun intended and enjoy the visuals and the rush,reality
george miller didnt invent the postapocalyptic subgenre he refurnished it with the 1979 a lowbudget piece of australian exploitation cinema two sequels followed the road warrior and beyond thunder dome given the success and popularity of these films in hollywood yet in cinema the apocalyptic genre predates miller tracing back as far the 1950s if not earlier one of the most famous examples of the postapocalyptic genre would be ingmar bergmans the seventh seal 1957 which is about a knight who returns from the crusades and faced a plague riddled medieval village similarly the japanese wastelands in akira kurosawas samurai epic throne of blood 1957 visualise a dust laden smoky aesthetic which is fitting for a film made after the nuclear warfare of the second world war these are apocalyptic movies biblical in scale and tone and along with the western genre they undoubtedly influenced the series the character of was originally played by mel gibson who himself has made numerous films about righteous vengeance set in a future australian wasteland of scarce oil resources and rickety land vehicles was a cop out for revenge against the men who murdered his family hes been compared to knights samurai cowboys and ronins as he travels the wasteland for work and defending villagesit has taken an age for a new film to be developed thirty years exactly in which time miller has delved with vastly different genres including childrens films like babe pig in the city and happy feet the delays for another are due to both politics and personnel miller envisioned making a new film back in 1998 and was set to shoot the film in 2001 but the september 11 terrorist attacks and the war in iraq canned the project a new would also have to be found once mel gibson was deemed untouchable by most studios health ledger was to replace him until he died tom hardy the dark knight rises and locke is the new a role which tests his physical abilities but not his acting range hardy is an extremely diverse actor shifting between action roles of raw physical power and independent character pieces last year he soared in locke utilising almost nothing but dialogue and proving the power of his voice against the physical limitations of a moving a car his version of is a troubled brawler who says little even once he doesnt have a mask on his face and is plagued by visions of his dead daughter who has a clear australian accent but hardy isnt served by interesting dialogue or personality which puts the breaks on how much character or depth this star can employin an unusual but welcome move for a blockbuster the female characters here both young and old are constantly active and more dominant than the male star role in this episode is helping the five wives escape from immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne an overlord who had imprisoned them for the sole purpose of breeding the five wives are hidden away in a war rig truck driven by the powerful and gritty imperator furiosa this onearmed warrior is played by charlize theron in an unapologetically gritty and resilient role fierce enough to lead the film on her own the group are pursued in the desert through a convoy and eventual collision of vehicles belonging to joe and his cult army one cultist is a young suicide soldier named nux nicholas hoult who later becomes an ally of pleasingly the film is free from verbal exposition particularly the opening scenes where the images and the camera alone dramatise the tyranny like the control of the water supply over the peasants but its far easier to tell a film through images when the entirety of the film is action and chase scenes which leads to george millers filmic style a clash of microscopic details and adolescence there are incredible visual effects using mostly practical stunts instead of cgi and millers eye for tiny details in the costumes vehicles and general feel of the world is admirable but its also visually and audibly an over pumped movie that blares continuously at you like an unstoppable fireball truthfully some set pieces are genuinely exciting like when the group must use a sniper rifle to fend off crazed bikers jumping high into the airsome have taken the time to state that the film is a masterpiece or meaningful at most we can suggest the film is trying to be biblical because it is about the raging fires of an apocalyptic nightmare it could also be interpreted as a metaphor for the end of tyranny as weve seen in the iraq war given the way a dictator is overthrown and the liberation of females the action is praiseworthy but this isnt a new benchmark for cinema miller is meticulously redecorating and redressing the already existing action and apocalyptic genre or formula with his own spin or vision a lot of imagination is on display but hes also confined by the limitations of the action genre the villains will get their comeuppance henchmen will die and the heroes will survive fury road is all technique but sometimes you want more or in this case maybe less,reality
one long battle of car chases and explosions set in a futuristic outback gasoline and water are apparently very valuable but we see no character treating them like scarce commodities theres not a whole lot of dialogue to establish whats going through the minds of these underdeveloped characters in a fictional world but here goes a shot at some point during a scuffle within a scuffle hardy and theron team up to help the five wives of cult leader keaysbyrne flee his wretched wasteland no they dont bother with trying to save any of the children or old people we saw for some reason just five beautiful women however it is commendable for using cgi sparingly director miller intended to make the film feel like one continuous chase and his accomplishment is at the price of establishing interesting characters not to mention that its impractical for the audience to be pumped the entire timea rollercoaster has to go up and down the flameshooting guitarist was undeniably savage though there ends up being too many unintentional callbacks to hardys performance in the dark knight rises a mask covering the nose and mouth blood transfusion tubing the weakness of hope use of a sawedoff shotgun etc ultimately a fun nightmarish ride worth time and money despite its obvious flaws out of four,reality
people are unfortunately trying to make too much out of this movie its has good graphics though not worth the extra money in my opinion and nice action for people that love action movies but nothing that really will blow your mind theres not much story to rave about either but im not sure anyone was really coming for that and despite what i have read and continuously keep seeing it is not a movie disguised as a feminist anthemwhat it is is an absurd movie that proudly revives the franchise when looking at other reboots of movie franchises this one stand far and away better than the rest,reality
its nice to see a george miller movie thats aimed at adults basically this is an updated version of his classic 2 as it was known in the parts of the world that doesnt call futbol soccerit is a bloody fine actioneer that isnt quite as relentless as the rave reviews would have you believe this not the bourne supremacy or the bourne ultimatummiller has more toys to work with here  boy does he use them to effect this movie is front loaded the first half is relentless before it takes time to breathe charlize theron is terrific as imperator furiosathe only thing i really missed from this was a mel gibson from 3 decades back hardy doesnt quite exude the haunting hallow shell of a man a much younger mel brought to the role it reminds of something i once read or came up with a vast emptiness fills methe younguns should be properly blown away by this movie it is far  away better than any fast  furious movie but for of us who were taken by surprise  storm by the road warrior miller doesnt quite reinvent his wheel here,reality
i liked it okay its visually stunning i would expect nothing less from george miller and has some powerful moments but it seems like the writers and director love their mechanical engineering and intricately choreographed mayhem more than any other parts of moviemaking or storytelling its mostly epic car chases and blowing stuff and extras up with occasional scraps of plot dialog and character development tossed in cause somebody told them they had tobut i like the idea of a character who starts out having given up on hope love kindness mercy altruism and justice but who nonetheless discovers that doing the right thing provides him with an opportunity to quiet his own inner demons and charlize therons character imperator furiosa is great though by now the trope of the antidamselindistress is becoming very familiar in our posthipster manylayersofiseewhatyoudidthere era i can see why this film has the mens rights groups panties all in a twist and i like it a lot better for that but of all the films i still like thunderdome for all its flaws the best and of course i identify with and i really like the idea that he also discovers that he can be a trustworthy reliable ally rather than just a partisan even in a fight that isnt really his and without being a white knight in the process  his equal partnership with furiosa is what i like best about the whole movie and the very last scene between and furiosa is truly great but seeing tom hardy as rather than mel gibson is a little like seeing chris pine rather than william shatner as captain kirk hardy and theron are very good but i spent the whole movie thinking things like daniel craig naw scarlett johansson naw chris pratt and zoe saldana hmmm maybe but seriously i think mmfr is entertainment for the damned  for an audience that knows that we are in real life complicit in torture murder war crimes and enjoying our wealth while others starve and we know perfectly well that the answer to the question then who killed the world is we did we have set the gears of climate change irrevocably in motion and now all that remains is the shouting and screaming the prospect of a nightmarish nearfuture economy of scarcity and dystopian society where desperation routinely brings out the very worst in human nature is no longer a stylishly cynical cautionary tale  it has become a sort of coping mechanism  the difference between knowing that you might get some terrible terminal illness and finding out that you actually have it,reality
i went to watch this film buzzing with expectation all the internet buzz all those great ratings and reviews had me expecting that im going to watch a modern day masterpiece although it was a visually astonishing film it falls short in many other aspects it will in all probability be considered a landmark work in terms of visual effects in future but it wasnt a masterpiecei know too much expectations always leaves you unsatisfied but even hours after watching it when i think about it with an open mind my opinion about the film doesnt change the movie is filled with amazing action setpieces brilliant locations cinematography but is that all you want from a movie no the biggest letdown is the story it is disappointingly dull absolutely nothing interesting happens in the story its a century old formula group a trying to go from point a to point b and group b is trying to stop them it is so awfully simple that it feels like a r rated movie with a pg story the actors didnt really have much to do they are all good actors and did what was asked of them but none of the performances from this film will ever be remembered for anything other than the cool actions they did if youre going to watch this film dont make the same mistake i did dont expect to see a masterpiece go to be entertained and you will be,reality
i have to say that fury road was not a film that excited me after a run of similar action adventure movies that failed to deliver wasnt really expecting to stand out but thankfully proved to be a thoroughly enjoyable movie experiencewhat really makes the film stand out is the fact that you have a connection with the characters this is sadly not the case with so many of todays action adventure movies in you obviously have who lost his family in the apocalypse and wanders the world alone it is also great that the film has a really strong lead female character furiosa who wants to leave the citadel and head east to where she was born to be honest furiosa is really the lead character and charlize theron is brilliant in the role the leader of the war boys is immortan joe who is suitably horrible there are a host of supporting characters who are also very well explored and the great thing is that you care about what is going on during the frequent heavy duty action sequences if you see one action blockbuster this year make it as youll have a blast,reality
its a dark and brutal world its the world of the film opens with the dialoguemy name is my world is fire and bloodthe film begins you are in for a ride as you enter this ugly yet visually breathtaking worldthe themes of slavery the objectification of human beings and post traumatic stress disorder are prominent throughout the medium of storytelling an action film this film is primarily one long epic car chase with maddening insane visuals and brilliant action sequencesit was a solid thrilling ride that moved at a very fast pace with twisted dark humour there is never a dull moment furosiacharlize theron is a brilliant character who caries the film nux nicholas hoult was a pretty awesome character as wellmy only complaint is that the lead character doesnt have much to work with he is reduced to a side character in his own film tom hardy was okay as although he was no mel gibson8510,reality
this is a mighty achievement in a time when film after film comes along with loads of hype and then fizzles out in the theatre this is a most welcome success clearly miller has a clear vision and goes to great lengths to create just what he wants for me the relentless opening escape sequence was too long and without proper introduction of characters i felt lost and alienated as if watching someone else play a computer game but then we meet the ladies suddenly all begins to make a kind of sense and a ferociously enjoyable movie unfolds i liked the action the costumes the pathos the humour the violence the whole unstoppable caravan of carnage girls and even old ladies in prominent roles was a nice touch and if this sidelined tom hardy so be it charlize theron was surprisingly good and the young ladies effective enough apart from my own problem with the opening this is very hard to fault and is a most spectacular and brash addition to the portfolio,reality
dont get me wrong i liked this movie as my score indicates but i dont think its the masterpiece that people are saying it is if you are looking for an engrossing story to go along with the action youve picked the wrong movie this movie is basically a 2 hour action scenethere is little to no character development at all i almost found it hard to care about the characters on screen because well the movie never really gave me a reason to care about them the main plot is driven by the villains five wives who are fleeing his captivity and abuse but we never see the villain actually abuse them perhaps if we saw something like that saw what the wives were really going through before trying to flee it would make everything more real and importantalso throughout the movie is haunted by the ghosts of people he couldnt save but we never find out who these people are or what happened to them why is he so haunted by their deaths who exactly is i think a flashback would have greatly benefited this moviethat being said the action was some of the best ive seen and most of the movie is action the incredible tanklike cars huge explosions amazing choreography for a carbased action movie it was all very well done and exciting the action definitely got me on the edge of my seati would give the story a 510 and the action a 1010 averaging the total score to an 810 imdb doesnt let you give a 75,reality
   as its events take place in an alternate reality located on an unnamed planet in an island of time unconnected to any we know this parallel universe seems to have a few things in common with life as we know it such as men women and gasolinepowered vehicles but the laws of physics discovered by people such as newton and einstein do not apply here nor do the economic principles of malthus or any precepts of the natural sciences as taught in americas public schools maybe they dovetail somewhat with creationism and global warming deniersi wouldnt know about that in children are only seen in nightmares but nonpregnant women are milked by machines for so many gallons that milk baths are the preferred way to clean up this planets gravity is such that 100ton trucks seem to get about 500 miles per gallon of gas though the landscape has less vegetation than any desert on earth the common folks appear to be wellfed but are told they do not need any water to survive for entertainment artificial waterfalls are allowed to soak into the parched landscape at the drop of a hat the original trilogy made some attempt to maintain an internal logic connected to our world this remake simply tries hard to be over the top all the time some people fancy themselves to be visually orientedthis film is for them fury road is beyond the thinkingdome for everyone else,reality
within the first 15 minutes i was hooked i mean what a rush the stunts the action sequences mostly all in camera undercranked framerates that made you feel insane just watching and then the momentum rarely let up its mostly one long action scene while the premise is simple the dialog minimal the acting was spot on and despite it being a film i think it was charlize theron that stole the show great work from the props department as those vehicles were just outrageous and wardrobe and makeup planted us firmly in george millers post apocalyptic world and this is where the cinematography came in some of those shot looked gorgeous steering away from the rule of thirds and planting the main actor or action center frame with a backdrop of beautiful locations biggest credit goes to george miller though he has made action films feel exciting again and that amid a slew of superheros fighting robots hobbits and their epic battles it really felt heartpoundingly refreshing,reality
what a ride what a lovely demented fullthrottled highoctane pure adrenaline ass kicking batshit crazy ride it has taken george miller 3 decades to come up with another chapter in the franchise that didnt just catapult him into the league of the finest action filmmakers alive today but also went on to change the entire landscape of all things post apocalypticand with fury road the fourth instalment  a possible reboot of the series miller has crafted something thats destined to go down as one of the most electrifying exhilarating  explosively entertaining action films of the past few decades for the frenzied madness that explodes from every single frame of this vehicular carnage effortlessly makes up for those 30 years of absenceset in the postapocalyptic wasteland where civilisation has broken down completely tells the story of a drifter in the desert landscape whos taken captive by the war boys army of the godlike tyrant immortan joe  is used as a blood bag his only chance of survival is joes imperator furiosa who has gone rogue with what joe considers his most prized assets and so begins the chase that only the craziest can survivecowritten  directed by george miller who returns to the genre he validated with trilogy fury road proves that despite after 30 years of gap miller remains the undisputed mastermind when it comes to vehicular mayhem and by upgrading the postapocalyptic elements for the new generation of filmgoers yet retaining the unprecedented charm of old school action millers kinetic direction succeeds in keeping the legacy of its franchise alivethe screenplay doesnt involve much of verbal exposition for its the nonstop action here that handles the storytelling part  defines the characters inhabiting this picture the visual narration is carried out so well that it doesnt even require its audience to be wellversed in english to understand whats happening in the film the story also has a surprising level of depth but it requires the viewers to do a bit of digging themselves if they want to find itthe themes of oppression  feminism is strongly highlighted human objectification attitude is heavily criticised plus women in this story are no damselsindistress and these elements are incredibly refreshing to see since theyre rarely found in action flicks the subversion to sexism in fury road does mark the beginning of something new in action cinema  its going to be really interesting to see where it journeys from this point onwardscoming to the technical aspects fury road is a marvel of action filmmaking art direction team wonderfully brings to life millers vision of the desolate future camerawork is absolutely breathtaking for the chosen angles movements  slowmo shots enhance its action use of vivid colours defies the usually desaturated look of postapocalyptic films every frame is captured in extensive detail  all of it is as its best during moments of actionediting also keeps the momentum going in its favour by fiercely pacing the picture  knows when to kill the switch to prevent it from exhaustion adding more refinement to its premise is its expertly conducted sound design that further enhances every explosion gunshot  crashes present in the film and finally we have junkie xl providing the background score that keeps the film on the verge of explosion at all times with its adrenalinerushing pulse pounding  dynamic tracksstill the best thing about fury road remains its groundbreaking action for the story puts on screen some of the most dangerous inventive  jawdropping stunts ever committed on film celluloid in a time when most blockbusters rely on excessive cgi which adds nothing to the emotional content this is one cinema that makes every bit of its 150 million budget count by embracing the oldschool practical effects over cgi  keeping the presence of the latter to its bare minimumas far as acting goes the cast is led by tom hardy  charlize theron and the contribution from the supporting actors is pretty solid stepping into the shoes of the iconic character that once belonged to mel gibson hardy exhibits a magnetic screen presence but as far as his work is concerned he either tries too hard or too little  whatever accent he was going for it never works out meanwhile charlize theron delivers a truly badass performance as furiosa  in most ways shes the real lead of this filmon an overall scale fury road is a deranged masterpiece that does total justice to both the as well as the part of its title and is the most complete fully realised  unadulterated action flick of the past few decades the insanity chaos  destruction it puts on the screen is in a league of its own for this picture is the most actionpacked viscerally thrilling  emotionally rewarding cinematic experience any action aficionado can ever hope for and if theres one thing fury road guarantees its that 2015 belongs to the mad,reality
first off i dont understand why people are rating this a 910 it is a descent movie but not great by any means the visual aspects and the special effects are out of this world however what reviewers seem to be forgetting is that visuals alone do not make a great movie the only thing we know about the two main characters is that they lived a bad life and were being used as slaves the movie follows these two characters which we know nothing about on a car chase for 2 hours thats it that being said the movie felt like a car ride to the beach with relatives little dialogue and not leaving the car for two hours i believe they may have left out a back story to the characters so that they have material for a prequel in coming years if you like a well developed story with characters that are developed this is not worth your money at the theater 7510,reality
fury road stars tom hardy as rockatansky alongside charlize theron as furiosa its the 4th installment of the series albeit 25 years after the 3rd film it takes place in a post apocalyptic world sometime after the last film beyond thunderdome it was pegged as a sequel with a loose connection to the first three and the first to star tom hardy playing rockatansky as opposed to mel gibsonin a stark desert landscape where humanity is broken two rebels just might be able to restore order a man of action and of few words and furiosa a woman of action who is looking to make it back to her childhood homelandgeorge miller when asked what first came to mind for him to explain the film said its a 2 hour chase scene he sure wasnt joking besides 1020 minutes the entire film is one giant chase scene its nonstop action with different beautiful real scenic shots of landscape and some death defying real stunts from an action standpoint its perfect even better when seen in 3d it feels like youre apart of the heart pounding actionwhen you dig a little deeper there are a few flaws the big one being a complete lack of any real character development if you saw the original three films there was a decent amount of character development along with a polarizing of rockatanskys actions going from kind and caring to downright cruel fury road lacked all of that the second big flaw is its r rating with minimal more cuts it could have easily dropped to a pg13 rating and it would have been fine and more widely vieweddont worry anyone whos timid its barely an r however since it was rated r already they certainly left some possible scenes that would have made the film seem more real off the tablewhat i can say for sure is the best way to go into fury road is with an open mind an expectation of great action great landscape shots and a disconnect from the original trilogy when viewed in that light the film becomes so much more enjoyable it almost made me wish its title and its main characters names were different so this film could stand on its own merit and not be compared or likened to the original trilogythat being said it was a solid 810 as a film but based purely against action movies as of late i would easily give it a 1010 its nonstop and its great its defiantly worth seeing in theaters as im sure its viewing power will decrease when not in 3d and certainly in home theaters happy viewing,reality
30 years after thunderdome director george miller returns to the franchise that made him famousfury road is about a wasteland warlord who controls the water supply and forces his people to do everything he desires including using a group of women as breeders but his time as ruler is challenged when and a fellow road warrior named furiosa charlize theron take him into battleif you enjoyed the other movies then youll enjoy this one too unlike george lucas miller remains loyal to his original vision and simply adds a new chapter instead of reinventing the wheel,reality
this is the same email i wrote to my brother in law a movie buff for blunt and honest commentary verbatimi saw fury road late thursday night the reaction varied with some mockery at a few weird scenesmy opinion is its a good movie for what it is a few scenes are out of place that make absolutely no sense theres a weird scene that should have been cut as it isnt relevant to the feel of the moviedirector george miller an old dude at 70 typifies with his style going for the weird and the grotesque it shows up again like in the latter two old moviesi almost hesitate to see the movie because of the reports and critic reviews that reported injection of feminism especially with the author of the vagina monologue a staple of college indoctrination tour my first sister was brainwashed with this grotesquemisandricempowerment feminist bullshit i express disappointment in george miller for the move not surprising as he pulled the similar bullshit espousing atheism in happy feet i saw the movie and felt that feminism is minimal so not to be detracting almost subtle the movie was fairly intense and riveting with constant action sometimes a little too much and over the top deserves an r rating for restrained gory violence and also the rarest r rated movie that does not utter any profanityi look forward to more sequels if it makes some money but i judged the audiences reaction with my astute observation and the reception is mixed almost muted because of how weird the movie is i noted the underage boys under 14 accompanied by their fathers upon exit after the movie if i were the father i will make exception provided the child is at least 11 and able to handle the violent content its a hard pg13 movie at best,reality
as of now i have never seen the mel gibsonfilm series i knew of them growing up but didnt know much beyond mel gibson the word thunderdome and tina turner having a role in one of the films which i have since learned was the aforementioned thunderdome i had zero interest in the news that there was a new film coming from george miller but the trailer and the onslaught of positive reviews got me curious enough that i found myself in the theater for fury road and wow it was as nuts as everyone said sadly i still havent gone back to check out the gibson series but now im anxious to do so still i went in to this movie blind knowing only the main characters name obviously and that he drives a sweet looking car through the desert fury road didnt care it gave me all the information a newbie like me needs to get caught up and enjoy the craziness rockatansky tom hardy is a loner drifting through the postapocalyptic wasteland apparently trying to avoid getting caught up in all the endoftheworld lunacy since hes had a few too many close acquaintances die on his watch its ruined within moments of the films opening when hes chased down and captured by a party of war boys from the nearby citadel a desert oasis set inside a massive rock formation thats ruled through cruelty by immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne when furiosa charlize theron one of joes prized imperators betrays him sees his opportunity to get outfury road is insane its nearly two hours of mindblowing action and car chases we spend the first half or so of the movie on a massive car chase into the desert and the second half on a massive car chase back with a few pauses at the very beginning and the middle for straight exposition with no context that sounds absolutely horrible just two straight hours of guns and explosions and cars flipping and revving engines on the contrary george miller and this is where i feel he got robbed on the best director loss at the academy awards tells a coherent engaging story in a world that while it is still earth is near unrecognizable to our own i dont know what immortan means or imperator but its not important because i learn enough from film that im not bogged down with questions immortan joe is the villain furiosa was some sort of lieutenant she hates his guts and formulates an escape plan where she can steal his five beloved wives and theyll all run away together to this mystical green place where they can live happily ever after fortunately becomes involved and uses his skills at murdering people awesomely to help them on their quest you would generally assume movies of nonstop action to be mindless spectacles cough michael bay cough but miller never forgets that an action movie is still a movie and movies tell stories that will draw audiences in in that sense this isnt really a moviefuriosa is to me the actual protagonist of fury road its her journey her mission we sympathize with her we cheer her on is just along for the ride but that isnt to cheapen tom hardys role in the movie hardy does a fantastic job with a character whos motivations are delivered through haunting flashes of memories and whos main form of communication is monosyllabic utterances he is a major supporting role in fury road but this is furiosas show 100 and charlize theron nails it really everyone does no one in this movie is giving less than 110 cast and crew alike even rosie huntingtonwhitely whom ive only ever seen flashing skin in the third transformers movie proves that she can do wonders with the right material she can act if only certain other directors utilized her as more than eye candy cough michael bay cough enough of the cast though seriously the action in this movie is bonkers and theres none of that shaky cam cant tell whats going on camera style here were talking wide shots full view of practical stunts with metal beasts theres a reason fury road won pretty much all of the production awards for which it was nominated this movie looks amazing the stunts are amazing the cast are amazing and its a total blast to watch if i would muster one complaint its that the movie pauses ohsobriefly in the middle to let us catch our breath fury road was the biggest surprise in 2015 and a mustwatch for all,reality
i was surprised to see that fury road was directed by george miller the director of the franchises previous movies i havent see but the first two movies whilst having long chases and action scenes have nothing in common with fury road this ones action is on totally different scale the film is basically one long crazy chase with a few moments of rest for the characters and for the spectator toomiller removed from his movie all the bullshit other action movies suffer from romantic subplots pointless dialogues or complicated origin stories this results in an insane pace where the 5 of nonaction is just what we have to catch our breath the action is heavy with explosions and destructions galore on the screen all of this is very wellcrafted and readableanother surprise was that isnt the main character in the movie furiosa very well played by charlize theron is shes a strong and quite attaching character who could have made for a successfully feminist movie if only all the other female characters werent halfnaked for the whole thingi also particularly liked the photography which i found offered stunning visuals there are different hues for different scenery and they really give a unique visual identity to the movie the only thing that bothered me was one scene at night which i suspect was shot during the day and then was filtered to look like night this scene is very bright for a night and characters in it are watching the stars which is contradictory because you really need darkness to be able to see the stars correctlyanyway this is clearly one the best heavy action movie of those last years,reality
fury road is one of the best most creative and epic films ive seen in a long time its easily the best action film in decades the directing acting cinematography music all work in a symphonic precision to deliver one of the most fun and enveloping cinematic rides ive ever experienced and i love movies if you couldnt tell yet and i love big movies but so many big movies are brainless and forgettable not this one george miller knows his format with an insight shared by few in his industry these days and this film is a brilliant showcase for a faceted career in storytelling on the big screen it literally is a moving picture show and i hope that this film serves to reinvigorate an interest in audiences to see practical special effects and real stuntwork in hollywood films you cant beat the real thing and this film is a real movie did i mention yet that george miller is a genius ,reality

it seems like of the saga the even numbered films are the best my all time favorite is the road warrior and this one is second to thatfury road once again captures that post apocalyptic grittiness that gave the road warrior that great miseenscne the notion of people flocking like sheep to be lorded over by the messianic tyrant immortan joe is a perfect statement of peoples willingness to be led even if the leader is a cruel maniac the human need to believe in some light at the end of the tunnel is exemplified in the war pups willingness to die for shiny glory in service to immortan joe even as they are riddled with sores and deteriorating from radiation sicknessthe action scenes are some of the best ive ever watched youve probably seen the previews of some of the bad guys up in the air on long poles attached to moving vehicles well you havent seen nothing yet as usual there are the odd and often unique cobbled together weaponry and the odd bits and pieces to justmakestuffwork in a world where there is no longer spare parts or manufacturing look for the gas pedal in the truck made from one of those foot measuring devices you see in a shoe storevery cool film go see it 910,reality

i need to make a complaint about fury road because i believe it should come with a government health warning this movie is highly addictive and will give you the ultimate head trip during and after you see it flashbacksthis from a certifiable art house cinema aficionado   like a lot of other people i went to see this new story in the series because i was intrigued by the trailer because charlize theron is up there with ms streep when it comes to acting ie monster and because anything with tom hardy is well worth going to seeafter viewing the film for the first time i came away thinking nice visuals two days later with the images from the flick still banging about in my head i was compelled to go again to catch up of the beautifully lit and composed imagery the multitude of detail in every shot and for the action i missed the first timeim going again today for the third time simply because i need a fix of this the first movie that i most likely will never tire of watching im 56 and have never watched a movie in the cinema more than twicethat i cant take my eyes off tom hardy or charlize theron there is so much drama constantly playing in their faces is another reason not to miss fury roadthe fact that the films director george miller is a genius goes without sayingpeace,reality
after seeing this it apparently doesnt seem as if much has changed in 30 years ok it obviously has a bigger budget than any of the last 3 movies combined and it looks visually stunning unfortunately this movie comes across as a standard adventure and really isnt much different from the road warrior 1982 or beyond thunderdome 1985 with thunderdome being the most ambitious one of them all the story to this one is very similar to the road warrior starting pretty much in the same way as the story went on with the movie essentially being just one big chase scene i found it rather boring and i saw myself dozing off since all the visuals ive seen done before much better in the road warrior 33 years ago with real practical effects and no green screen most of the movie to me was just a regurgitation of old visuals and ideas ive already seen i wouldve preferred to see mel gibson return and see the evolution of the character 30 years later so to me there was nothing new about this movie now even though people say this is a reboot there is obviously a sense of continuity from the last 3 films it just comes to figuring out where this fits in it definitely appears to be a direct sequel to the original 1979 since he still has a working interceptor the one sleeved leather jacket and the leg brace even at the end of the movie you can believe that he somehow recovers the interceptor and restores it before the events of the road warrior since the interceptor is totalled halfway through it anyways final word even though i was pretty psyched to see this movie my overall reaction is meh,reality
this has to be the most actionpacked movie i have seen in a long time regarding movies i have seen at the theater after watching the original three of the franchise i have to say this is my favorite to date with the 2nd one falling closely behind the 2nd one may overall a better movie in terms of its themes and the development of as a character but i definitely enjoy this 2015 release the mostfury road opens with mentioning he used to be a road warrior an allusion to the second film and we see jolting flashbacks to what seems to be his son dying in a road incident in this post apocalyptic world in this sense the film seems to combine a sequel with a reboot since lost his family in the first film yet the film does not reference specific moments from the earlier films other than this with the style more focused on the action a fast pace throughout and more modern cinematography i would classify this more as a rebootthis movie has received a lot of hype and while i enjoyed this movie very much i would not be so quick to judge it as one of the greatest action films of all time i may have to see fury road a few times because of this the plot is ridiculously simple at face value one side character even sums it up perfectly by asking all this over a family squabble is a loner captured by a community that resides at a place called the citadel and he is forced into the middle of a battle instigated by furiosa wanting to bring the leaders several wives to a land of safety when they realize this land doesnt exist anymore they decide to go back to the citadel fighting the warriors of the community who have been pursuing them the whole time thats itim not sure what to make of tom hardys performance as the opening voiceover sets the tone of the movie perfectly and the voice hardy uses even makes him sound like mel gibson from the original trilogy we dont get much dialogue from throughout the film  which is perfectly fine  but his body language seems to only say one thing for a long while mistrust is so paranoid of furiosa and the women she is protecting at first that he threatens them with an unloaded weapon watches them constantly and disarms them as soon as he gets the chance and actually fires warning shots that end up getting one of them injured his grief is represented by the jolting flashbacks to the death of his son which could have been handled with more subtlety as in the 2nd other than this what is there to say about the action in the film other than high praise i dont know how he did it but george miller was able to create many wellchoreographed and carefully thoughtout action sequences with little cgi and involving many various vehicles id have to say the best roadbased action ive ever seen takes place in this filmthis is one of the best films the first half of 2015 has to offer but it is not a perfect movie if you love action movies then it probably is the perfect movie for you go see this film if you want the experience of a roller coaster,reality
franky i did not enjoy the movie i did enjoy the old movies and they are much better than this basically there is no story presented just 3 words about main character and that its a post  nuke place overall we know nothing about any of the characters in the movie except few words here and there that basically do not tell anything the plot is rather boring they stole a war rig they drove to somewhere better went back while being chased by some party of raiders no interesting conversations no decent action no history no interesting storyline i did like the trucks though overall in my opinion a poor movie not worth watching,reality
this film was shown as a prescreening at the prince music theater in philadelphia on 51115 i was working frontofhouse for this event which was wellpromoted and highly anticipated a virtual sellout roughly 400 in the house but 13 of the tickets were film society waivers press passes and promotional giveawaysi saw only perhaps 20 minutes of this and it was what i expected a noisy frenetic cartoonish exercise in special effects gratuitous violence and shock value ridiculous lightweight premise and totally unbelievable characters visually compelling but that was about itin this the flick will make some good coin because such is what puts meat in the seats these days novelty explosions and comic book narrative are what appeals at present in our lowbrow mainstream popular culturewe had several walkouts in the first half hour of the film i asked these patrons what they didnt like about the film and the general response was a waste of production money and talent all right this isnt everyones cup of tea but most of these folks were film society people and as a rule they have higher standards and more informed taste than your average moviegoerat the end of the show some departing patrons were enthusiastic about the film but most who i spoke to indicated that they felt it was merely a somewhat betterthanaverage actioner nothing more caveat emptor when i finished my shift i felt i was leaving a wwf event rather than an effort at meaningful filmmakingas a postscript on august 8 2015 i predicted this would be a box office flop and i was on targetthrough today this piece of junk has done 368 million in business worldwide sounds great doesnt it however the studio gets 23 of the total drop which means the return was around 240 millionthe total cost of the film production advertisingpromotion and distribution was roughly 250 millionthis latest installment in a wornout franchise didnt even make back its investment during initial releaseof course it appealed to its low rent devotees but turned out financially speaking as dead ,reality
i might be seriously irritated about the destruction to a magnificent and delicate habitat that is the namibian dunes however this movie is awesome i saw it 4 times in the theater theron is amazing hardy captures perfectly and holt is just too pretty even when destroyed by radiation the camaraderie and assumed equality between furiosa and is a refreshing riveting and adds greatly to the believability of the narrative the visuals are a stunning operatic event the bad guys are just gross and the creep factor is naturally amped when they are juxtaposed with the diaphanous beauties or the innocent yet greatly misguided war boys its just crazy good,reality
okay no reason to mince words this is a riotous success in what it does and how it upholds the legacy how unexpected that the original filmmaker came from animated penguins and obscurity a few years back to barrel through superherodominated hollywood with all this verve where others see no story and just another action fest i see exhilarating freedom from the formulas of marvel and nolan how samey for example to have dragged our feet through another origin story setting down some convoluted saga how boring to have turned into another chosen one saving the world we get instead a man spat out by the dust a schmuck buffeted around a grunt along for the ride hardys reimagining of is great instead of the same dishwater look as any other apocalypse these days we get colorful swirl we do get a few plaintive looks and music but few the new terminator we got this year the latest stab at an alien with prometheus they miss the whole point thinking we wanted someone to smear some more with the mythology it was never the myth and explanations always the immersion in a world benefited from never having a sturdy mythos a skynet or weyland yutani we just roamed around the sands and came upon odd bits of world another enclave here a gas town somewhere things that just exist around for no deeper pointand the same sense of avoiding the trivial extends in another way the film is a long chase practically they could have just made a fast and furious rig crashing through desert instead the film is a pendulum that swings to the edge and back and in the movement we soak up different tribes worlds oddities of custom and ritual details that show someone lovingly tinkered with its world how great eg that we dont need to have sophomoric explanations about valhalla or the spray paint we see all that we need to know in actionsure its what gwar is to music provided you only look at it as a piece of gnarly show business for me it evokes a bit of pasolini exhilarating spiritedness as a way of moving beyond the familiar limits of vision toothless peasantry flocking to divine waterits important for me to see works that jolt from the routine of fictions enliven its why i seek herzog and pasolin and theres a whole flying circus around the chase this time chainsawwielding acrobats on poles et al its what verbinski tried for in lone ranger and those vehicles its all very wondrous to me even in this gnarly shape i can appreciate the work it took actual work you do with your hands and have to choreograph around bodies instead of a marvel team doodling away on computers to construct all these rigs and film in africahow do you go from this to staid tarantino in a few months only bringing him up as someone who likes to skirt the absurd i imagine him verbinski scott snyder the marvel makers paying their respects to this guy this is the most furious comeback of a franchise i have seen,reality
seeing the teaser of this film i rolled my eyes at the thought of another reboot offending cult classics and violating nostalgia with over the top cg and mundane acting charlize theron one of the best character actors of my generation brought me to give this film a chance ironically redemption being a driving force in fury road redeemed the negative stigma ive attached to reboots fury road seamlessly pays homage to all films while standing as a separate entity for those who arent familiar with the previous filmsfuriosa charlize theron and tom hardy are both trying to escape a tyrannical leader immortal joe is taken to be used as a bloodbag for war boys most likely unhealthy because of the toxicity left in the land furiosa is introduced as the leader of a war boys attack convoy and at the plot point shows shes smuggling away beautiful women used as sex slaves for immortal joe and his top men eventually commandeers her war vehicle and together they must escape the ridiculous amount of road warriors sent to retrieve immortal joes breedersfury road is nonstop action from start to finish the imagery is absolutely amazing the road warriorswar boys weapons vehicles and costume design mesh cult and industrial wonderfully there is very little dialogue between characters and somehow they still pull off a strong character arc and semblance of a deep back story the malefemale roles are blended well furiosa is androgynous with her war torn body and shaved head but didnt shove the feminism theme in our face survival overshadows those themes they help each other equally the war and action can be over the top and unrealistic but it is done so well it works i was very impressed by fury road it moves in a straight line but still manages to have some depth and for fans of the original films there are tons of subtle little easter eggs,reality

its been 30 years since george miller last showed us the insanity of his post apocalyptic australian wasteland with the long gap partly being due to the films production being almost as chaotic as the world the film is set in with the film is set it had many difficulties including being stuck in development hell for years filming being repeatedly delayed and difficulties in securing locations to shoot the film miller had plans to do the film as far back as 2003 with gibson intended to reprise his role but took a further 10 years before tuition but fortunately miller persevered through all this turmoil to once again to return to the drivers seat of the franchise and create this masterpiece that is his best film yetat the start of the film we watch as tom hardy is captured by an army known as the war boys ruled by a dictator known as immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne shortly after being captured one of joes soldiers called furiosa theron drives off in an armoured fuel truck with his wives so that they do not have to bare the children of a monstrous man and tries to drive to her childhood homeland because of this joe sets out with an army to chase her down and is used as a blood bank attached to one of the chasing cars eventually after freeing himself he joins furiosa and helps in fighting off the legions of war boys sent by joe in a non stop chase spanning the entirety of the film and when i say non stop chase i mean non stop chase from the very opening of the film to the end they dont go 5 minutes without some exciting action sequence with almost the entire scene being part of some chase or fight scene whilst under a lesser filmmakers control such action could be repetitive miller keeps it original by varying the action sequences and the beautiful scenery making it a masterpiece to watchalso the action is all so well made in contrast to a lot of recent blockbusters like fast and furious most of the film is done with practical effects and stunt work with cgi used very sparingly making for a much more high octane and realistic action sequences they pull off everything in this film flipping cars people dangling from or even jumping between speeding cars and even being engulfed flames its hard to tell whos more insane the people coming up with these incredible stunts or those who take part in them the scale of the stunts alone is impressive but the consistent creativity and range of the stunts within the chase should keep any fan of action gripped to the screen on top of the mayhem of the chase sequences the entire world is absolutely insane its strange to think that the same mind to create the likes of happy feet and babe pig in the city also creates a world like this with the likes of woman having their breasts milked as a resource a legion of pale thrash metal dressed soldiers and vehicles ranging from a tank plated gas truck to a barge led by a guitarist who shoots a flamethrower out of his guitar its a compliment to millers imaginative style that he can create such a bizarre whilst progressing the story and having constant action beyond carrying out incredible stunts the cast also give some impressive performances tom hardy does a great job filling in the dusty leather jacket as were quickly reintroduced to him at the beginning of the film so newcomers to the franchise are familiar with his backstory with explaining how he lost his family and blames himself with their loss leaving him with nothing but the instinct to survive oddly this short explanation of his character is the most that hardy speaks in the film instead of dialogue hardy conveys most of his character through his look of exhaustion as a man who has been through far too much then theres theron as the metal armed and strong furiosa who is amongst the likes of sigourney weaver in aliens and michelle yeoh in supercop as one of the best female action heroes she often steals the show in the film as a more human character than although just as dangerous as he is at one point even brawling him and showing herself to be just as deadly and resourceful as he is theres a great deal of mystery to her backstory with most of her history just being hinted upon also similarly to hardy theron communicates so much through her hardened look showing herself to be the product of the destroyed world in which they livei just love everything in this movie i love the detail in the way that all of the cars are adapted for the desert environment i love the beautiful bright cinematography i love that the chase lasting from start to end never for a second loses steam millers imagination mixed with an incredible crew has created a glorious symphony of madness and violence unlike any that had come before it apparently hardy has already signed on for three more films and with millers creative mind behind them theyll definitely be something to look forward to,reality
being a fan of the original movies i was very skeptical about this new version but i was very very pleasantly surprised tom hardy gave a convincing and fresh character development to and charlize theron was awesome as always you definitely felt george millers writingdirecting talent  familiarity in this new version it had the same rough gritty post apocalyptic feel as well as the storyline feeling like the older movies too overall id watch the movie over again  probably again if you are a fan of the old movies i dont think youll be disappointed good job guys looking forward to more movies,reality
a masterwork of visual storytelling fury road tells its exciting satisfying tale with intense emotional action very little dialogue and almost no exposition its been so many years since i saw the original trilogy that the only things i really remember are mel gibsons hair and sand because fury road was meant to stand alone theres no need for the audience to know all of the nuances of the mythology to appreciate or understand the story here this is a long chase movie but its also a legend about a man who has lost it all been driven and has to find his way back to himself see the movie for the story the characters and for the feeling of immersion into this wasteland of a world,reality
this movie was amazing great use of both cgi and practical effects you get to see toecutters eyes bulge in a flashback story is fairly simple but doesnt try to be more complex than it is lots of characterization through actions as opposed to endless amounts of dialogue looking at you avengers and nolan batman movies makes the over the top scenes seem fairly normal which is amazing considering some of the crap in there namely a freaking flamethrower guitar which is used not only in the scene shown in the trailer there are breaks in pace in the movie however they are welcomed as you sit through some very long action scenes that keep you on the edge of your seat throughout these scenes act as a breather and a chance to get to know more about the characters the action is well done and intentionally over the top it was a great experience and i would go see it again given the chance,reality
fury road is the fourth film of millers franchise and the first film of the franchise in 30 years fury road stars tom hardy as rockatansky replacing mel gibson in the title role charlize theron nicholas hoult and hugh keaysbyrne also star stunning explosive nonstop postapocalyptic action for 120 minutes is an accurate yet perhaps slightly misleading description of the film as with fury road writer  director  producer george miller has achieved far more than mere action proficiency so rare with contemporary action films the relationship between practical effects and cgi is balanced faultlessly the like of which i havent seen since peter jacksons the lord of the rings theres an equilibrium between the two and at times they both appear to blur the lines between one another  on multiple occasions i assumed that certain sequences simply had to be cgi yet i now learn many sequences were just incredible pieces of stunt work and loving production design the greatest testament to this balance is that all of the these conclusions have been drawn much later after watching the film as during my viewing of it my mind could function little except from being simply blown away by the incredible spectacle miller managed to createparaphrasing hitchcock in 2014 miller lightheartedly suggested that he wanted fury road to be understood in japan  without the use of subtitles now writing as a teenager in rainy northeast hampshire i can offer little to demonstrate if miller has been successful in his aims yet i find little to suggest he failed compelling performances are universal it doesnt matter if the language is spoken in english arabic cantonese or portuguese a good performance can transcend any language barrier and miller certainly has that in his ensemble cast it seems impossible for tom hardy give a disappointing performance recently but the true star of the film is charlize theron who gives a wonderful performance as the character imperator furiosa combining raw physical strength and brutality with a core of emotional sensitivitybeyond performances i feel like the film will be universally understandable simply because of the themes which are explored so delicately and overtly the themes of survival and family are universal and are the driving force beyond a narrative which doesnt stop for a seconds breath the film pays homage to some of the classic american westerns of the past yet the comparisons ive seen comparing it to road runner seem just as astute to me for me its somewhere inbetween,reality
having seen the trailers that described george miller as a mastermind he the same director as happy feet i was a little sceptical to say the least and this film had been so long in the making beset by so many production problems it made you wonder what on earth was going on worryingly endless reedits left fans thinking whether at best they could come up with something worthy of all the hype and anticipation or at worst if the whole project was to be doomed dont know and dont care because in the end fury road has turned out to be for me at least a big fan of the original and its first sequel not so much thunderdome one of the greatest action films i have seen in 10 years forget any unfair comparisons with michael bays formulaic churn and the like this mastermind has  and im not saying this lightly  completely and utterly rewritten the rule book on big screen action and sheer crazy spectacle i was aghast thrilled and ultimately exhausted by the end of this film some of the set pieces coming across like a strange mix of classic a french circus duel and the air cavalry attack from apocalypse now were astounding but knowing that all were crafted without the help of cgi something you can really feel across this raw untarnished vision  left me even more bewildered with delight true tom hardys isnt central to the piece in terms of dialogue and probably actual minutes on screen  i reckon miller has quite rightly let the world take centre stage theres so much to see new bizarrely wonderful things combined with clever evocative icons and nods to the past trilogy that to have thealwaysbloodybrillianthardy dominate might have overshadowed our reintroduction sequels yes please now to this miller universe in any case what does have to say or has to do is so flipping cool its all a case of very well written less is more ultimately this is a film that deserves to be watched again and again  big screen very loud theres only a small band of directors who make films that i can watch again again and again and yes i would call the likes of tarantino and scorcese masterminds i think george miller is one of them too now,reality
ah fury road this movie was received with a lot of acclaim from both the critics and the general public and was hailed as the best movie of the year and the thing this masterpiece does right is to drive across a desert and back using practical effects instead of cgi and have lots of explosions around apparently thats all it takes for a movie to be called great nowadays yeah just show a real piece of sht on the floor instead of having it be a computer graphic and voila its no longer sht anymore sorry but it takes a lot more than that to call a movie great or even good at least by my books when i sit down to watch a movie people call good the things i at least expect are a good story and characters thats my main requisite aside from that i expect to see some good acting some nice ideas variety in individual aspectssuch as actioncomedy etc or something different from the norm fury road has none of any of these thingsnow i am willing to buy the excuse that this was a pure action film and things such as good story were not that important and what was more important was the action the action was fine but there was nothing too amazing about it it mostly consisted of blowing sht up thereby causing some big explosion here and there a few guys come attack with some gunscrash vehicles into each other boom and repeat ill give the film credit for its use of practical effects and that definitely enhanced the experience but there was never much else for me to care about especially because the villains were mostly faceless mooks and the whole thing could have been over if they had just opened the oil tanker put a lit matchstick inside it and run awaynow i am normally okay with things such as plot conveniences as long as they are not overused and the characters reach some catharsis in the end or the story ends in a at least decent way but there was none of that in this entire movie in fact what threw me off was that they didnt even bother to introduce anything to us properly before rushing into the action we are told that there is this guy called who was taken and there is this joe guy who is a king of some sort and he mistreats his people and yet has some incredibly loyal servants never explained why and then one of his soldiers kidnaps hisdamsels in distress i guess and then they all give chase to him with a huge amount of cars all this happens in less than fifteen minutes and then they dive straight into the actioni seriously wish that they had spent at least some time in fleshing out the setting or helping us get to know the characters and give them some personality but all we know is that has a bad past the soldier is rescuing those women and the joe guy is evil just for the heck of it now i dont know about you but that is just not enough to get me to root for them even so when we know nothing about the damsels of distress i didnt even know any of their names another thing about them was that one could change their genders aside from the pregnant one and it wouldnt make a difference and im talking about all characters by the waywhich leads me to this great theme of feminism everyone was talking about because charlize therons character plays the soldier and she fights a lot and she is the actual main character instead of whos just kinda there i expected more from him given that the title contains the words shes the one who does most of the things and is like a leader figure and shes really praised for it the problem you cant think of her as a woman she is stripped of everything that makes her a woman i really dont see how any of that can be called feminism when you strip a woman of her femininity same goes for all women in the storyso if you dont dig the constant explosions that are happening every few minutes you wont enjoy this movie and youll probably be looking at the clock wondering when this whole ordeal will end the performances were alright although nothing too noteworthy the plot was basically a group of people being chased across a desertthat sums it up the characters were lifeless and forgettable the themes are either a mess or are unexplored there was very less effort placed into setting up the world or anything in it honestly the only credit i can give this movie is for its effectsfor all i care fury road is overrated garbage i could keep going on about its problems but ill stop right here i cant really say i hate it but there is no way i can recommend this movie to anyone who wants more from a movie than mindless action,reality
actually it is a great film i watched this film yesterday and it was beautifully shot film i havent seen any of george miller earlier works not even earlier filmsi watched the film nothing in my head i didnt knew any plot line of the film  so when the film started i started finding plot in film but the film is not just about plot and i figured it out very early so i experienced the thing and i swear it blew me away my heart started beating fast my lips went dry my ac was on but still i felt heat of dessertfor every one this is a must watch film but if you are a extra ordinary film enthusiast than this is the film which you were finding from long time this is not the regular action film this is something very rare it is a game changer i fell very bad for myself and the other people who havent watched the film on big screen but you can still enjoy the film just give it a one chance and the film will blow your mind,reality
fury road is 70yearold australian george millers magnum opus and the crowning achievement of his saga which previously comprised three earlier films made between 1979 and 1985 with mel gibson playing the lead the first two and 2 the road warrior were rather cheap independent films that built a cult the third one beyond thunderdome was a misguided expensive film that aimed but failed to do what fury road succeeds at this one is a totally adrenalinerush of an action film that will not only leave one breathless by its overthetop stuntfilled explosive sequences but whether a fan of the older films or not viewers should be blown right out of their seats in awe at the poeticallyperfect execution of its filmmaking brilliancebut what makes it even more special and what truly earns it the masterpiece epithet is the creation of the richest and most memorable female action character since sigourney weavers ripley in charlize therons imperator furiosa standing statuesque and sporting one metallic arm she is a macho mans wet dream of an amazon warrior but underneath her fierce exterior is a sensitive woman with a heart that beats with compassion whats more she is the films true protagonist and leaves the character of played this time by tom hardy as a second fiddle half way through the drama it should be apparent to most viewers that this movie purportedly a violent superaction testosteronic spectacle displaying more snarling bodypainted warriors and explosive pyrotechnics than a hells angels nightmare is actually a hyperbolized portrait of an independent womans rebellion from a maledominated world in that sense miller has created a trojan horse that puts down the very values it pretends to espouse and helping to confirm this is a littleknown fact that eve ensler writer of the vagina monologues was consulted in the films portrayal of its female characters whats more every aspect of this film from its film editing production design costumes sound editing  mixing is on a par with the greatest action films of all time but believe me this is not just for violent action fans  its for every one who loves great filmmaking,reality
a woman charlize theron rebels against a tyrannical ruler in post apocalyptic australia in search for her homeland with the help of a group of female prisoners a psychotic worshiper and a drifter named tom hardywithout a doubt is the surprise success of 2015 while it is not surprising that a big budget reboot of a popular science fiction series would be a commercial success how could anyone have predicted it would be a critical darling as well and yet it has found its way on to numerous top ten lists and picked by many as the movie of the year even has the second most nominations for the oscars which is unbelievablethe movie has its shortcomings the plot is well more or less nonexistent there is almost no character development and even if you know the mythology of it will be more than a little confusing for the first hour trying to figure out what war rigs are and why a bunch of pale guys have strapped to a car and why do we have a man with a flamespouting guitar what purpose does he serve so it is not a shock that of its impressive list of nominations none are for the writing or the acting how could they be while there is probably an art to scripting fights this is really fleshed out on set and the acting is well hard to say most of the good moments were probably handled by stunt peoplebut the categories of costume makeup production design effects and more are all clearly visible even the cinematography this is a dystopian future in a desert and yet australia looks more vibrant than ever before i would not expect the film to take home a cinematography award but it is obvious why it was nominated the best bet for a stature is in production design and maybe in visual effects but then they would have to fight off star warswhat will likely happen is ends up being the biggest loser of the oscar ceremony with ten nominations it has just about the most to lose it will be lucky to go home with one or two because frankly the best picture nomination is a fluke this is not the sort of film that typically gets the nomination and it is far less likely to win when it is supported by mostly technical achievements it simple does not have the dramatic weight of competitors revenant or the martianthe odds are better for a best director win while this is unlikely it is not impossible alejandro g irritu and tom mccarthy are the frontrunners but and director george miller can edge out room and big short right seeing a cult director from australia win would be incredible not likely but possible and certainly a nice change,reality
when it comes to george millers rip roaring pedal to the metal action powerhouse fury road the question truly is whether or not its the greatest single action film ever made miller who of course directed the original trilogy that helped launch mel gibsons career into orbit picks up right where he left off by creating a barren unforgiving desert wasteland inhabited by a variety of gangs and tribes in a dystopian postapocalyptic world the movie begins with our hero tom hardy in a brilliant likely careerchanging role looking out over the desert thinking about his former life as a cop and how hes haunted by the souls of those he wasnt able to save without warning jumps in his rig and speeds off into the sand only to be chased by a pack of shirtless skinheaded marauders or war boys is captured and brought to the citadel where the larger than life scary as hell immortan joe looms over his clifftop perch to deliver a booming message to thousands of peasants hes sending crews out for supplies bullets and so forth and he wants to see them off in style apparently this is where we meet imperator furiosa charlize theron who is leading one of the convoys in her imposing war rig but as the journey begins immortan joe discovers that furiosa has taken something from him that she does not plan to return and all hell breaks loose before long and furiosa become reluctant partners as they struggle to survive a full throttle fuelinjected game of cat and mouse to call fury road an action picture isnt even really doing it justice consider the most intense action film youve ever seen now multiply it times 10 im serious i love me a good action flick but ive never seen anything like this of course there are some effects that are undoubtedly cgi but from what ive read about the production of the film a surprising number of the unreal heartpounding action scenes were actually performed by actors and stuntmen take for example the scene in which immortan joes posse has just about caught up to furiosa leading the pack is a knucklehead war boy named nux who were led to believe is dying of a fairly common but deadly blood disease in order for nux to do this without getting sick he needs a blood bag or in this case chained to the front of nuxs rig with a blood line literally intertwined through the chain links furiosa sees a sandstorm up ahead and heads straight for it the buildup to this scene and the way the action unfolds on the screen as the chase rockets into the storm are film making at its finest action cinema does not get better than this now it would be one thing if we were simply lured in by groundbreaking action sets and scenes but where this film really delivers is the emotional connection it creates between the viewer and the protagonists there is a cautious but healthy respect between and furiosa especially as they each come through when the other needs them most by the end we believe in their bond and perhaps our throats even tighten up a little when our two heroes acknowledge each other with the simplest of gestures the cinematography is also of the highest order we get a real sense of place and scope of the environment the story takes place in ariel shots that gradually pan downward upon a frenetic chase scene are extremely effective especially aided by a thundering soundtrack that in some cases is literally part of the action make no mistake fury road is that rarest of rare treats a landmark film that will undoubtedly set the bar for the action genre for years to come to put it simply perfect in every way,reality
george millers trilogy has been a huge impact upon a lot of action movies and the 4th onefury road will and should inspire morefrom its very first scenes fury road vibrates with the energy of a veteran filmmaker working at the top of his game pushing us forward without the cheap special effects or paperthin characters that have so often defined the modern summer blockbuster george miller hasnt just returned with a 4th installment he just came back to show a generation of filmmakers how they have been stumbling upon his footstepswho was more crazy me or everyone else in fury road miller has pushed vision of a world gone to its logical extreme this is a violent movie but the violence acts as a need in a world this extremefury road would be remarkable enough as a pure technical accomplishmenta film that laughs in the face of blockbuster cgi orgies with some of the best editing and sound design the genre has ever seen and yet miller reaches for something greater than technical accomplishment he holds aloft the action template that he created with the road warrior and argues that hollywood shouldnt have been copying it for the past three decades they should have been building on it,reality
ok here we go again reviewing a movie to which i was a bit too closenever have i seen a movie that so polarizes the viewer you will either love or hate this flicklets set the scene this movie was largely dreamed up in the late 1990swhen george was producing the babe sequel in sydney working alongside him on the pleasant babe pig in the city were the other two notables that laid the foundation of fury road production designer colin gibson and while some may argue with me on this chief mechanic and partner in crime mark mc kinleyby the early 00s the location had changed to namibia which put it out of my reach and production had actually commenced over there then came 911the project was immediately mothballed it was felt that such a film would not be critically accepted so close to such a cataclysmic loss in the us it took another 10 years before fury road would finally rise to the top of the pond againas much as you read mmfr as georges film it was always gibsons baby colin had done so much for george in the past he stuck it out with miller when everyone else had long lost patience and left mmfr was georges way of finally letting his kids into the lolly shopmmfr has gibson and mckinley written all over it so much so that some times i wonder if george even had anything to do with the film at all that could be why the film polarizes viewers so easilymmfr is what happens when the crew get to make the film they want to make while the director sleeps it off somewhere and it stands as testimony to that and that alone from the earliest days of gibsons work on reckless kelly and priscilla queen of the desert mmfr is the culmination of all those pub discussions that have happened since the wouldnt it be cool if we could do this momentsand now they have in fury roadits perhaps no coincidence that the abbreviation mmfr is so similar to another one of gibsons early films mmpr mighty morphin power rangers viewers of one are likely to like the other they both represent what happens in film making when you pull out all the stops let things freewheel and just allow everyone to go madwhen it comes to fury road my advice is to go into the cinema with the same attitude that the film makers had when they made itgo hard or go home ps i met and first worked with colin gibson on the aforementioned 1995 vintage power rangers movie which at the time was the film that i wanted to make now colin you finally got to make the film that you wanted to makewell done matewe can all retire nowpaul m,reality
fury road is by far the best movie of the year and one of the best movies in history of cinemaan insane movie filled with amazing looking actiongreat acting and overall very intensethis movie has it all everything about the way that the action is directed is perfectall the time the main character is in danger and you never know how it will endtheres a guy playing the guitar during all the actionthats just freaking insane tom hardy does such an amazing job herehe fits on the movie perfectly and charlize theron is also very very good on the rolealso theres a certain amount of heart to the characters that makes you love them even moreits not just brainless actionit makes sense and its done beautifully george miller is back to show us how to do action in the best way possiblehe built this movie in practical effects and i appreciate that even morecars flipping and real explosion over the top makes the movie even more insane i really cant think of a negative about this movie so im definitely going to give it a perfect 1010 rating and deservedly so go see this movie if you still haventi personally cant wait to re watch it and experience this amazing craziness all over again,reality
first and foremost i assure you that this film definitely deserved the best of 2015 award not only because it was a special effects and action epic but also because of the story that it tellsfury road is the fourth installment in the infamous and criticallyacclaimed series at the time of this posting i havent been able to find justification for this assumption but i believe that the film takes place between 2 aka the road warrior and beyond thunderdome tom hardy bane from the dark knight rises stars as the title character rockatansky if theres anyone that i can imagine taking over for mel gibson for the film and character that made him famous it would honestly be hardythe film is an absolute epic of action film making with highspeed chases explosions gun fights and an apocalyptic electric dust storm despite some of the scenes being enhanced with cgi elements the making of featurettes of the film showed that there were not that many cgi sequences in comparison to actual oncamera stunts and effects that proves that the best films are honestly made not by computer generated effects but with real incamera effects it actually made the film seem more dangerous just to watch almost like youre participating in the chases and fightswhat was the best part of hardys acting performance is the fact that he did not have that many speaking parts he almost had no lines in the first 45 minutes of the film rather he was attempting to battle his internal madness no pun intended i think that this subtle portion of hardys performance is what ties it in with the first film when tells his main force patrol supervisor fifi that he feels like the only thing separating the bad guys from the good guys is the badge on his chest and that hes starting to be in tune with the madness on the streets this is a powerful nonverbal statement thats expertly portrayed by hardyhonestly though the piece of the film that was most surprising was the integration of a mainstreamed hollywood powerhouse actress like charlize theron even though she is no stranger to big budget independentstyle films ie monster aeon flux and prometheus to name a few her appearance shows that she still has what it takes to step outside of the hollywood mainstream and make a great film that not only marches to the beat of its own drum but doesnt need a mainstream storyline to be successful her character  the baldheaded imperator furiosa  had depth of her own right and was a great character for a great character actress like theronin all this film deserved all of the nominations and awards that it was presented the film is a standard example of incamera effects movie making and should be looked at as a great action film with a lot of depth in the characters if you are a fan of the films please go see this film if youve never heard of my strongest suggestion is to get acquainted with at least 1 and 2 before seeing it so you know whats going on but nonetheless this film needs to be viewed by anyone who has a love with good ole unadulterated action,reality

fury road is a film like no other from the insane stunts the manic pace and the heavy metal backdrop makes for one hell of a ride it jumps out to an insanely fast start and doesnt stop ive never seen another movie filmed like this one the camera work did an awesome job of showing how out of control the people were everything was desperate fast and desolate there is little pre story and character development but who cares thats not what this movie is about this is fury road it says it in the title and its one hell of a ride i love postapocalyptic movies and this one doesnt disappoint this movie does a great job portraying how insane the people are and how dangerous blind faithfollowing is the music is manic the pace is manic the speed is manic this movie really made my heart beat fast its a thrill ride action movie it knows what it is and it sticks to it i was really impressed when i found out most of it was actual stunts and not cgi although what is cgi is really good the fighting choreography and chase scenes are awesome this movie is junk food for the brain thanks rd jr natural born killers it was intense and didnt slow down for a second it is action packed from start to finish constant battles and chase scenes for 2 hours it has an identity and it stuck to it this movie is obviously not one of the best movies ever but it is in a class of its own because ive never seen anything like it i had a blast watching this movie and i bet you will too i was really surprised to see so many negative reviews on here id give it a 9 overall but a solid 10 in the action genre,reality
it deserves its hype what the movie is getting unic style and its storyline is basically so awesome that you cant say that some parts are copies from other movies cause they arent series has now also changes to get more sequels in the future and i hope there will be more of these best action movie this year so far every movie has problems in something and i have to say that this movies ending was kind of average and i was disappointed for the final results at the end more thought could been placed there thats why its not then 10 but solid and excellent 9 with a creative style and gorgeous remake stunts to interesting characters makes this movie already a living classic,reality
im going to start by saying that if youve read one fury road review then youve read them all so feel free to skip this but i will do my best to prevent the words adrenaline rush and actionpacked from appearing oftenthat being said what can you really say about fury road the story and characters are so simple and immediately understandable that theres nothing to say other than it was amazing the action sequences were beyond incredible especially considering the lack of cgi used the atmosphere is beyond indescribable invoking emotions without even needing to say anything the film can simply show you an image and youll have an emotional reactionactors tom hardy does a masterful job as with charlize theron being equally masterful as furiousa the other actors do their jobs fine with nicholas hoult being a surprisingly tragic character and hugh keaysbyrne being a perfectly grotesque villain story as said simple and understandable a desertwide chase of epic proportions visuals visually i cant think of another film that looks quite like fury road its a postapoc world sure but its so colourful and so bright it almost looks happy the sand is yellow the sky is blue the blood is red it all stands out so perfectly from everything else sound cleverly mixing an actual soundtrack with the inworld music of drums and electric guitars being played upon entering battle fury roads soundtrack genre as said the action in this film is incredible the majority of the stunts were practical which makes certain scenes even more entertaining,reality
seriously every reveiwer on this website hates this movie hi welcome to imdb were we hate everything any this movie is incredible this movie has fantastic performances from tom hardy and charlize theron who were able to act with minimal to no dialogue not just them but the rest of the cast did a fantastic job the film looks wonderful almost like a beautiful painting which moves the cinematography and the use of colour is wonderfully excited and made me feel like i was in the world this movie created the story is to the point and straight forward with no added subplots distracting us from the main story much like many major pictures out there the action in this movie is intense and adrenaline field with fantastic stunt work that keeps your eyes fixed on that screen this movie is fantastic and i would recommend to everybody if you hate this movie shame on youthe reasons people seem to hate this movie are as follows the acting is bad they say just because the actors use their body movement to express emotion in this film requires tons of skill from talented actors you cant just a character say im sad to show that they are sad it is shown with their body movement and their facial expressions i retaliate with there is no story they say there is a story it doesnt have the a million subplots like every hollywood feature ever also it is told in movie language which involves using images to tell a story the only people who dont understand this are either really stupid or are blind i retaliate with its just a bunch of explosions they say dont all action movies with guns and cars have explosions in them i retaliate with there is no character development they say what are you blind their is plenty of character development its just not done with a 30 minute monologue like in every movie ever cough avengers cough i retaliate withthis movie overall is a fantastic action movie and the only reason people hate this movie is because the want to be cool and they want attention how do i know this because i did the same thing with star warsso this movie is movie is for the people who love to use their eyes and their brain when watching movies but if you dont like using either of those two magical things youll be like all the other people on this website,reality
super film ever they exactly show us the what will the world be in future but the stunts are really where the film shines its hard to think of a better action road movie it has all the intensity and perversity of the and the road warrior but amped up to new heights of craziness miller is the real star of the film  in some ways technology seems to have finally caught up with his early hyperactive camera style and he takes full advantage of the ability to move wherever he wants however he wantsgreat film so fastpaced it makes every other film out there look slow and oldfashioned wonderful to see george miller back on the australian road where he belongs charlize theron is great tom hardy is not bad,reality
background of all the movies that showed the future i would say this is among the bestcertain concepts are given in this movie such as the ones who take control of the water can rule peoplea post nuclear war approachhalf livesoil warswater wars etc story line  fury road story line lacks depth of coursebut that doesnt mean the movie is badactually there is more importance to furiosa than actors tom hardy is the best man to depict he has been exceptional in every way charlize therons depiction of furiosa has been outstanding all others are okay direction george millers direction has been very good in this filmnot many flawsand excellent portrayal of the desert watchability the movie is colorfulthrilling and of course not boringno lags no unwanted shotsdialoguetalks littlethe background score is very good fury road is an excellent movie to watchdont miss it,reality
fury road is the forth installment in the franchise and is directed by george miller who directed all of the previous movies this movie stars tom hardy charlize theron and nicholas houltin a post apocalyptic world where water and gasoline are scarce furiosa theron kidnaps a crazy warlords wives to set them free she is pursued by hordes of the warlords followers called war boys along the way she encounters rockatansky hardy and together they struggle to escape with the newly freed wivesfull of nonstop action and mindblowing practical effects fury road was an incredible film george miller returns to continue the franchise at age 70 and still creates a thrill ride of a movie the directors use of practical effects caused the movie as a whole to be elevated visually this movie was perfect there wasnt one flaw audiences were pulled into the world of and didnt relax until credits rolledthis movie should have been titled furiosa fury road and is there too but audiences got fury road charlize theron as furiosa was the backbone of the of this film she the most interesting and driven character in the film even more so then the title character charlize theron perfectly displays the furiosas desperate drive for freedom female audiences finally have a strong female badass character that doesnt take crap from anyone but the writing for this character doesnt form her as a stone cold killer there is a scene where furiosa breaks down and charlize theron is given a chance to express all the rage depression and conflict that has built up inside her character furiosa is a breath of fresh air in the action genretom hardy takes over the role of rockatansky from oscar winner mel gibson there was a lot of anticipation to see if hardy could live up to the shadow cast by gibson although wasnt the main focus of this addition to the franchise hardy delivers a convincing performance that stays true to the character created by his processor character in the movie acts as great support for furiosa and deepens her for the audience the main attraction for in this movie is that he is a familiar character that fans of the previous films can recognize and root fornicholas hoult plays the war boy nux in this film hoults character is a new and innovative idea the audience gets a clear view of the enemies has been fighting for all these movies nux hoult had a great development as a character and we could see him change throughout the film hoult managed to display conflict inside his character with very limited dialogue he created a whole new side of the villains that the previous films couldnt fury road is a masterpiece of practical effects and amazing stunts the action in the movie is unparalleled george miller created the most intense and reckless action packed film of 2015 so far where most movies settle using cgi and greenscreen to create their action fury road uses amazing stunt work and actual explosions the movie is essentially one giant chase sequence but a chase has never been filmed so well all the driving is shot from beautiful wide shots including all the important elements to the scene even during the brawls the movie hardly had any quick cut sequences that change the shot better yet shaky camera was avoided entirely in this film the audience is sucked into this brutal world of chases gun fights and brawls because the entire film is enhanced by the high quality action although the action was perfect this movie as a whole isnt faultless when you break down the story there is no real plot granted the action of this movie manages to overshadow the lack of story in this film but under it all the plot is still missing the entire plot is based on furiosa theron taking a wrong turn that is it this movie was insane there were war boys jumping onto cars while swinging chainsaws and blind people shooting twin machine guns the craziness of this movie can be a negative thing for some audience members the audience that disliked the previous films wont find much if any joy from fury road it stays true to the roots of its franchise as well as tops it off with more insanityfury road is an amazing film whether you are a returning fan of the franchise or a newcomer and gets a 9010 stars,reality
id like to preface this review with a statement to those who found this movie to be overrated underwhelming tripe what exactly was it that you were expecting did you want a film that flowed along the same lines as the very dated original film did you expect a wry sophisticated thriller that generated line after line of unforgettable genius honestly im unsure of what a wellversed moviegoer would have wanted and expected from this film upon admission to their local theaterthose of you who live in the present will understand that this is a high mark for this generation in action and stunning visual creation that need not be taken for granted the acting was not at all legendary and it didnt need to be the story was not at all realistic and it wasnt supposed to be the film as a whole was pretty much void of deep character progression and it had to be this is one of those films that you watch and as it all unfolds and comes to a close you sit there in your seat and think to yourself i hope to god they make a sequel so that i can further explore this vivid raw and highly imaginative world that is in my opinion an obvious mark of fantastic storytelling everything about this film demanded descriptions like highoctane and thrillride like no movie before it its entirely unique yet somehow comfortable enough to the common moviegoer rather quickly and connections are made without the need for forced complexity or cadence this film is bold and assertive and unapologetic a landmark an absolute masterpiece,reality
furiosas charlize theron job is to drive the war rig and siphon off gas from outlaying towns but she rebels and tries to save 5women from the dictator immortal joe hugh keaysbyrne who has convinced his minions that he can guarantee them a place in valhalla when they die on his behalf of course immortal joe gives chase he wants his property back as he considers them more valuable than oil or even gas mostly because they can have babies tom hardy is strapped to the front of a vehicle during this chase and somehow gets free and joins up with furiosa who doesnt trust him at first basically this is a 2hour cartruck chase in the desert the stunts and cgi are the real winners in here and are so good there are no words to give them their due they are spectacular you will come to believe this is all very real and you will cringe or avert your eyes often as i did kudos since is not really but angry that he got caught the title should have been furiosa and mostly because furiosa is the real hero in here and was along for the ride there are some good moments when we get to relax somewhat and learn about the characters and believe me we needed those breaks furiosa has a prosthetic left arm and we keep looking to see how that was done movie magic in time the looks and furiosa gave each other were pure gold and we had hoped this pairing would go somewhere good chemistry all in all the stunts and cgi are ones for the ages and it will be difficult for anyone else to top them but they will try this was filmed in australia 910violence yes sex no nudity yes briefly language no,reality
i enjoyed this movie it was nonstop action but the action was really well done they kept outdoing themselves with how many ways they could bring down or blow up the opposing vehicle and for some reason i cared about charlizes character as well as the bad guys costumes were so bazaar they added to the fun the bad guy leader     didnt he ever get too hot for that getup but while watching i did have a problem with how their situation could exist 1 there were two scenes where they gave the thirsty crowd water they used the most inefficient method they dumped it onto the folks nearest the cliff and wasted about 98 of it why i know for show 2 did they ever eat i never saw food or anyone eating except for one guy eating a bug 3 how did they manage to keep all those vehicles running gas where did the gasoline come from you need a refinery for that and auto parts who made those those monster truck tires cost about 2000 a piece where did the money come from where did the tires come from i know its just entertainment it doesnt matter it was hollywood true but i enjoyed noticing all the inconsistencies,reality
watched keep in mind the sequel to the original was a movie called the road warrior released in the early 80s which single handedly defined and ushered in the genre of post apocalyptic survival in worlds gone there was always however clearly defined lines of who is good and who is bad that the audience can cheer for sympathize with and as well hold contempt for despite the good guys often having to do things just as bad as the bad guys the new throws no pretensions of righteousness on the audience this movie its director and its screenwriter understand that in such a world everyone is bad this is not a fun movie this is not a feel good summer flick  its a two hour journey into hell with a devil on both shoulders and its brilliant i wont give spoilers but had the movie been called the road warrior then beyond any doubt that warrior would be charlize theron rather than the actor who does play for which other than being who is in the first scenes of the movie is no more fit for survival than any of the other characters he is the one whose perspective is often used to relay events that theron invokes but no one is the actual center of instead an array of characters collide again and again as the three primary roles fight their way across the wasteland this eclectic mix of personalities and bizarre personas are played out relatively small amounts of screen time but by actors and a screenplay so perfectly on target it only takes those few minutes to attach ourselves to them and realize the madness they call normal lifethe score transcends the movie there are times when the most intense moments of wanton death are accompanied by passages of orchestra matched with cinematography that shows a requiem to insanity which laments those dying rather than making them prop pieces blown up for us to be thrilled by we the audience witnesses the only reactions characters in such a world can have when hope is not the reason one lives but the glee of dying gloriously for a cult of personality one believes will carry them after death this readiness to die its the reason we sympathize with them the wasted loyalty is sad their joy at death the ultimate symptom of how truly the world is our sympathy for the devil as it rears it head over and over makes us come face to face with the fact that the devil has no where else to go either when the whole world is hell,reality
from the first minute to the last minute of the film youre strapped to your chair and being thrown around a pestilent desert wasteland full of insanely modified vehicles and classically apocalyptic characters there is never a dull or forgettable moment a chase with benefits of water fuel and beautiful women is the theme of the movie deadly from the startgreat acting stunning cinematography and a unique apocalypse style them and plot come together for one of the best action films of 2015the only cons for myself personally the length of the film could have been shaved by a few minutes as at one point an event occurs that makes you groan a tad internally aside from this the film was tops,reality
if it werent for tom hardy and charlize theron i would never have watched this movie both the lead actors were as usual great there isnt much of a story but you get to see great stunts with men swaying on moving vehicles lively visual effects most stupid cars abuse of guns and fuel in the world where there is no water cultivable land and worst of all pregnant women and very old women fighting on top of moving cars and even riding bikes and cars there arent many dialogues and some the main characters dont even speak nicolas hoult was an addition with no real need or character even the antagonist immortal joe owns everyone and everything as he owns a huge lame mountain of water with no visible sourcethat is what is actually shown and has the only lame green piece in the middle of a desert when charlize therons characterfuriosa secretly helps his wives escape then the furious joe pursues her and the rest of the story is very much obvious overall this movie is just for you to buy your own time to kill and be a little happy about it,reality
fast paced and gritty continuously tries to engage the viewer visually the movie succeeds in doing just that but lacks emotional depth and and almost any semblance of nuanced characters the movies strong point is its feminist tilt and the overpowering performance of charlize theron also you cannot help but be mesmerized but the dystopian universe that the director has created flame spouting guitars and all purpose war cars are just a few of its charming features the movie feels almost half an hour too long and the viewer will most definitely guess what the ending will bring tom hardy grunts and succeeds in looking pretty but mostly takes a backseat to furiosa therons character cgi use is limited which is a rarity for such movies overall visually entertaining and violent with a dash of supermodel just be careful to not get dust in your eyes,reality
ive seen fury road twice and tried to see it a third time tonight they were only showing 3d screenings after 830 pm so i had to pass whos with me on this 3d is for kidssince i very rarely watch movies twice in a theater this is an odd impulse which i dont entirely understand made more odd by the fact that i didnt like the movie too much the first time i saw it i didnt like it but i also felt i was in the absolute wrong frame of mind to digest what was being thrown at me on the screen so i went backwhat i found on second viewing is that fury road is the filmic equivalent of an unbelievably great if slightly challenging hard rock record the pleasure in watching it isnt really story and suspense theres little of either but just soaking in the craziness the out of this world textures cars costumes weapons the awesome soundtrack music and effects during the second screening it seemed for most of the show i had a huge smile plastered across my face because i felt so in tune and aware of all of these elements intertwining when i wanted to go back a third time tonight it was with the same impulse that i might want to listen to a great record again to take that journey once again and to capture even more nuance and subtlety in the compelling vision being played out on the screenin the end i feel like this movie captures something lost about my teenage moviegoing in the 80s when we used to go see stuff like a clockwork orange pink floyd live at pompeii or texas chainsaw massacre pt 2 and not always of sober mind have really extreme audiovisual experiences in a movie theatre that kind of filmmaking to my mind has largely been lost in an era of on the one hand incredibly dumb hollywood movies and on the other extremely selfconsciously arty films made to impress critics for me its great to see george miller for at least one shining moment explore other possibilities with the medium,reality
i have only seen bits and pieces of the original films so i wont be making any comparisons between the two without a doubt this was one of the most unique movies ive seen i have never been able to say about a movie that it was the weirdest and darkest but very wellmade films i have ever seen until i sat down to watch fury road still i felt very mislead because it didnt advertise the fact that there would be less than 150 lines of dialogue in the whole that definitely resulted in the lack of character depth and acting in the film despite some of its shortcomings fury road delivers in its promise of a movie that is ninetynine percent action with some of the most realistic effects ever seen on the big screen i am a huge fan of tom hardy i think he is a great actor whose best films still lie in front of him but if you are going to hire a great actor in a big budget action film give him something to work with it is pretty hard to act in an action movie when you get virtually one line of dialogue ever five minutes i would not be surprised to learn that charlie theronwho has the most screen time and nicolas hoult had more lines that tom hardy i understand i understand this is an action film but that is not an excuse for lack of character depth and development in the movie yes is just a road warrior whose mind will always be the same but that does not mean he has to be a static character throughout the whole movie the only person whose character changed during the movie was nicolas hoult a supporting actor i feel that any good movie needs a good amount of character development to make the story interesting and exciting especially for an action film enough about the bad aspects of the movie now we are going to talk about the without a doubt best part of the movie the action so basically the whole movie is one giant car chase with minimal breaks in between naturally this calls for some great action sequences from what i read on the movie george millerthe director wanted to use cgi very sparingly and use as much onset action as possible to give the movie a very realistic style he achieved action filmmaker hall of fame by using so never have i quite seen explosions and action sequences in a film quite like the ones in fury road so many times during the movie i kept asking myself how the hell did they film that the answer even if told to me i probably still wouldnt be able to comprehend the screenplay as i said before is mainly just one incredibly wellfilmed car chase and since it is based in an apocalyptic desert wasteland where a warlord is hunting the main protagonist down there cant be much clearly outlined direction says the plot is as said in the first few seconds of the movie survivalkeep in mind that this movie is very dark in its action with incredibly intense action sequences not for the faint of heart if you can handle that though and like to see good action movies i recommend you see fury road while it is still in theatersfor more of my reviews go to my website at reviewsbywestcom,reality
the movie was inanity madness and chaos but the directing and premise did not need to be having not watched or heard about like many of us there was no basic sense of what was going on other then the sense that people were blowing each other up only did a few subtle frames or one line sentences hint at a possible premise but it was so subtle that i was left confused throughout the action scenes intro did not reveal who he was or how he got there as it was only about 5 sentences revealing that the world was chaotic sure i get itbut why was it chaotic the post apocalyptic civilization and culture was little appreciated because the director failed to establish the premise of their existence hence i could not appreciate the deeper philosophical introspection of the authors depictions of the end of the world only until after doing research did i get to understand the deep characters but without the research i was left to wonder what exactly what i was watching the rest was just madnessand madness was the obvious motif of the movie the world ends and this post apoc culture is unstable insane but for the most part fun to watch action sequence of trucks driving up rocks getting stuck in mud while a death metal guitar strapped to a flame thrower is blasting music through all the fight scenes i just wish i was given more information about and the end of the world culture that developed the movie could have used a 20 minute synopsis of the past 3 movies like in superman,reality
my summary says it all i dont usually rewatch movies unless i lost the plot or missed something important i only rewatch movies that i really like when enough time has passed for me to start forgetting parts of it however with this movie im simply dragged to watch it again and againit totally took me by surprise i was rather expecting another awful reboot with the sole purpose of cashing in the name so i began to watch it without much interest all that change two hours later when i returned to reality at the end of the movie and found myself completely flabbergasti think that more than the action scenes which are so good and so often that keeps you immerse in the movie for its full length what i most liked and what really hooked me was the world that miller created the society surrounding immortan joe and how miller masterfully reveals it all visually without using the typical exposition scenes i found that aspect of the movie so interesting that i simply wanted to know everything about it and that without even taking into account how cool everything looks from the landscape and the citadel to the vehicles and the characters you can clearly see that a lot for effort and thought has been put into this movieanother thing that surprised me was charlize therons characterization of imperator furiosa i didnt look at the credits before watching it just knew that tom hardy was substituting mel gibson so i didnt know that she was in it until well into the movie my image of charlize theron is the perfect miss vickers from prometheus in which it even makes you doubt whether she is human or an android so to find her as someone as imperator furiosa the complete opposite of vickers was something quite difficult to believe it kind of seemed impossible to reconcile the fact that furiosa and vickers are played by the same actress i dont think many actresses as good looking as her could have achieved such a convincing transformation tom hardy was also quite good as i didnt miss mel gibson at all which is something that rarely happens with this type of franchisesthe only reason why i didnt give this movie a 10 is the plot and the end the plot was rather simple which seems to have been done in purpose as miller was after the road chase from 2 but as long as a full movie given that premise i think it couldnt have been done any better so its difficult to predict how it would have turned out if the plot was more complex and regarding the end which im not going to explain well it simply didnt convince meresuming it is possible that if you dont like good action movies then you wont like this one but if you do this one is definitely for you i would go as far as saying that in my opinion it is one of the best action movies of all times,reality
an accurate and funny description i heard of this movie if war broke out during burning man  this would probably be what it looked like superelaborate costuming  including for the vehicles which i heard were all carefully crafted and engineered much more effort than i would have expected  but great that it wasnt all cgi i heard innovative stuff was done with the cars in order to fuse vehicles together  but still making them roadworthy and safe i suddenly want to know more about the making of for the cars for and thats where it is trademark  with a hero who obviously doesnt want to be a hero who is really good at getting out of almostimpossible situations and really weird cars that have been bolted together from the remainders of other cars  with lots of extra armor and spikesit was a 2 hour chase scene  and unapologetically so it was a bit contrived when was insisting that they had to go back from where they started  so the entire movie is spent driving pointlessly in one direction and then after picking up a few more people driving pointlessly and needless to say  recklessly and homicidally back in the other directionand while they definitely delivered on spiky cars driving back and forth in a brutal death match  fighting over very limited resources in a postapocalyptic world  i have to admit that it would have been nice if it made any bloody sense at all  just as an extra i know thats not what this movie was for  but it would have made it so much more better if we had any clue what some of this was all about why were those guys painted white with black eyes and a sort of skeleton zombie appearance and what was the deal with the suicide fighters spraypainting their teeth silver theres obviously some kind of cultreligion going on here with the leadbaddie being the icon of this strange pseudoreligion  but not much is explained except in bits and pieces that never quite come togetherthe tanker full of breast milk makes no sense at all i guess it could be a source of protein  but far more protein could have been cultivated in growing beans or keeping domesticated animals than in taking the time to pump all that breast milkand that guitar dude  seriously i know its just showing off and is kitschy as all getout  and it was almost laughoutloud funny but what is this guy supposed to be the main baddies minstrel and why waste fuel or flammable substances on making a guitar into a flamethrower just to look cool and thats not even mentioning the whole ark of drumbeaters that were following the entourage when going to battle  i guess youd want scarysounding drums  but i would have thought all the flamethrowers exploding bombs hand grenades bullets grinding engines and exploding cars would have drowned the drums out really or were they just trying to explain the soundtrack i heard a rumor about complaints over a feminist agenda in fury road that being said  the seemingly allwomens tribe on motorcycles in the middle of the desert but previously in some special green place was about as unlikely as the rest of the movie it was nice to see a female heroine who wasnt weak  and a badass amputee at that and it was also nice to see older women talking allwhite hair wouldbe granny types all suited up in leather and kicking ass it was a refreshing change  but i didnt feel it was antimensome complained about not having many lines when has he ever he was never known to be a talker i actually thought that the actor playing this version of did a good job of seeming almosttootraumatized to really do much talking  as if talking was too troublesome he had a jerky hesitant way of talking that sort of fit with someone who probably never gets much of an opportunity for civilized conversationin a gameofthrones crazy world  where every other show seems to be copying them  it was nice not to have some exploitative and disturbing sex scene in this version of  which was almost surprising they show an awful lot of violence  but not much nudity and zero sex everyone is too busy driving for that i guess were it not for the all the gun play and people being run over in cars  it could have been rated as pg13for a good portion of it  i felt like i was sitting through a rather long music video  especially with the white makeup of the main baddie resembling the 80s rock band kiss and he had this strange breathing apparatus that reminded me of darth vader  except with big teeth on the breathing mask part i guess thats one way of making it look cool to be on oxygen but why is this guy like this why did that one guy need to be hooked up to for a blood transfusion in the first place not explained i suppose we have to wait for the next movie to explain all the white make up and skull cultreligion maybe  if they remember what with having to put all those spikes on the vw microbusi just heard theres a comic book series that this movie was based on  and now all the gaps in the story makes a weird sort of sense  maybe its possible this made so much more sense for those who read the comic books  or maybe not it was fun anyway though  as long as your expectations are not terribly high,reality
a long forgotten genre driverexploitation bikerexplotation etc etc is reborn first robert rodriguez did it when he brought frank millers film noir world to life and now george miller did it with fury roadi would never say that mr miller did it again because this is nothing like anything weve seen before miller manages to pull a completely new angle to driverexploitation with tougher action where you can actually see whats going on im looking at you modern hollywood action flicks with shakycam and bad choreography i was very surprised that i wasnt bored through this film a 2 hour chase scenes sound long a drag but fury road was anything butdefinitely my favorite pure action flick of the decade mr miller has all of my respect,reality
returns and the original main villain from the first 1979 movie immortan joe also returns played by hugh keaysbyrne i thought this was a good movie even though the plot seemed like a jumbled mess with no real character development from some of the people the stranger meets some of the characters such as the vestal virgins and the ginger vestal virgins skinhead boyfriend nux played by nicholas hoult were kind of annoying at firstbut the intense action scenes of cars and trucks racing against each other and the breathtaking exotic landscape made up for the lack of a real plot tom hardy and charlize theron put a pretty good effort as and furiosa the costumes the weird make of the cars and trucks and the exotic desert landscape made the movie look like it took place in another planet rather than a postapocalyptic australian outbackoverall this is a good movie to take your children and wife or girlfriend to even though theres a lot of combat violence we actually dont see a real bloody mess such as limbs and heads flying out of car crash collisions i didnt hear any profanity like in military combat movies and horror movies theres no gratuitous sex scenes and make out scenes the two main characters and furiosa are allies only in their predicament nothing more hopefully there will be more sequels to come,reality
for start to say that i watched all movies in past right as they started to show in cinemas most memorable was part 2  theater was full with people standing at sides so i watched fury road 2 days ago and wrote review here but now i feel need to edit it add some thoughts because some things are more clear now after some digesting and rewatching of 2 i was surprised about that final tanker chase took only some 1112 minutes funny is how human memory distorting things  as that chase was most impressive part i thought that it was some half of movie time fury road involves tanker almost at very beginning and it is present during whole moviejourney so my theory is that miller wanted to develop to say so that part to the  with help of modern cgi and of course much higher budgeteven title is confirming it  fury road suits perfectlyso focus is on road action scenes which make about 70 of running time at begin is some carless action too and we have some slower and shower parts too for allowing audience to take breath and see something lovely among all that destruction the plot is nothing deep but that was not to expect basically all happens around huge tanker vehicle  as it was in 2 finish actually all before it was just some shallow story all in purpose to lead to road action did not like that wearing that ridiculous tdkr mask too long time dont know was it just millers weird humor now about what happens most time action on road absolutely spectacular and lot of kamikaze moves over top huge vehicles and inventive spectacular stunts surely there is lot of cgi and thats good because no other way to achieve such level of destruction on screen although almost everything is over top i never had feeling that some scene is unrealistic as it was in many die hard fast and f movies furious is maybe word what describes it best speed is not of essence but matters a bit this movie just made what most of action movies failed managed to make some really original action scenes what some  a lot of them  more than in 10 other action moviesi think that it is result of smart approach instead going by scenario they gone on thinkering out scenes on location self according to main actress shooting in namibia took months and they were instructed to be on shooting all time even if scene with them was not planned maybe there will be interesting to see dropped scenes on blue ray  if it can fit on single disk  for action blockbuster this is pure 10 but there are some weaker parts like plot some ridiculous things fluids would say that this was first road movie in this road action franshize  they were basically on journey all timesequel is inevitable i hope that money hunger will not prevail and that will not rush with it even if director is in dino age good ideas need time,reality
the good very well made similar feel to the original films i very much liked the subtle environmental message and plethora of powerful female characters without being preachy and found that truly original all but a few sideshow characters have visible vulnerability which was again refreshing charlize theron was very good and i can understand why her character will be expanded upon in the following film the action and machinery is of course epic and reaches the level of art in of itselfthe not so good this is the worst performance ive seen from tom hardy his accent is weird which i suppose works from the point of view of audience ambiguity which means more people will potentially identify with the film however he is too laconictaciturn and needed more dialogue cant help feeling character is a dinosaur which possibly explains why he wont feature so much in the next films at no point in the entire film did any of the tyres on the rig get blown out in ii that was one of the first things the baddies went for for obvious reasons consequently the entire film doesnt hold up well in the believability stakes the plot is thin and theres even less dialogue than the aforementioned ii perhaps im becoming a fuddy duddy but i feel ii is still a better film overallthe irish film classification office gave this film a 15a rating i feel a 12a wouldve been more appropriate  there is no swearing full frontal nudity graphic violence ie people losing limbs not sure what other territories classify it as but it should be something that fathers and tweenies or above can reasonably happily go and see together alex liked it,reality
i couldnt resist myself after reading some of the lower scores for this film some of these people are nuttier than there is a plot several if you want to be specific about it people just choose to ignore it or rather they dont care for it the main plot is furiousa taking the wives to a better place a place that is suppose to be alive and vibrant the side plots are furiousa trying to find redemption finding sanity and hope along the way which he does at the end and the least missed of it all  the disruption in power due to the deaths of at least 4 group leaders no plot they say lmaothen i read people complaining about everything being available no the movie makes it clear that they either go to war with other groups to obtain the needed resources or trade them as with the 3 groups this is why furiousa drives a war rig  the movie even has a scene where they were suppose to trade oil for passage through the mountains immortal joe has water oil and green the oil is most likely traded from the friendly groups seriously you have to pay attention to the movie peoplethere were several remarking that the world was lively and not post apocalyptic enough with people working and i guess having fun immortal joe has them as slaves under drugs the movie makes this extremely clear throughout and especially at the beginning those that are brought up serve several purposes1 provide milk 2 sex slaves 3 machinist slaves 4 drugged up war boys to die willingly for joethose that are not brought up live a horrible horrible life as seen in the movie so again why is it that some of you think its all so pretty do you want like 10 people being around only loli cant stop laughing reading these ignorant comments if you dont even pay attention to the movie you wont know whats going on might as well throw you money away or give it to charity youll be doing everyone a much better service rather than your shortsighted clueless review,reality
what is there to say about that has not already been said not much by now a few weeks after the films initial release you will have seen that there has been high critical praise for this movie among fans and critics alike to dislike this film which is subjective at the end of the day would make you part of a small majority to say the least i went to see fury road with little to no hype for it its true i have seen the trailers and while i was enjoying each new piece of marketing material that i saw i was never truly excited when i heard the reviews however i made sure to see the movie critics were raving about it was something completely unique and awesome to behold not only did the director of the original return at the old age of 75 but it was a revival of a long dead franchise with a substantially high and risky budget that was pretty risky considering how dead the franchise is everything about this movie is amazing i wont ramble on too much longer but the action acting especially charlize theron who was the best performer in my eyes practical effects and the world created in this movie were all amazing if you havent seen fury road watch it now,reality
is back of that there is no doubti went into this film as a fan of the originals but also fully aware that this wasnt going to be a direct sequel of any kind its 30 years since last took to the big screen time technology and even actors have moved on now the film would be different of that i was surethey got rid of any concerns about continuity pretty much right away by declaring with the appearance of the interceptor which the last time we saw it was at the bottom of a gully in lots of pieces and very on fire that there wasnt any continuity right from the outset too they made it clear that this was a film that was telling you not to get bogged down with the details just take it as a story from one of encounters out in the wastelands and enjoy the action then there is a new actor in the roll that gibson made his own hardy is a physically expressive actor who uses his body to bring presence to his characters and i would think that with being a man of few words this was a part of the reason he was cast this is a more brutal world than the one we saw in road warrior and thunderdome though so what we get is a more brutal where as gibsons lived on his speed and ingenuity hardys seems more driven by brutality and instinct its still the we know the noof questionable morals and of few chosen words whos given over living for just surviving but this seems to be a whos been out there in the wastelands much longer than he had been the last time we saw him and is a few steps closer to complete insanity its a much lonelier mistrusting and feral version of the character than the one gibson left us with some 3 decades ago but its a version that works exceptionally well few actors do boarder line insane and have physical presence at the moment as well as hardy doesthe big question for me as it has been for many others was how would it hold up against what many consider to be the best of the originals road warriorwell consider this road warrior was ground breaking for its time and the real stand out scene was without doubt the final chase with the tanker for the budget they had and with what had come before it was astonishing now take that admittedly quite long in itself scene and turn it into an entire 2 hour extravaganza thats braveif youre going to do that youve got to make sure that it is a new encounter for the new character and not just a remake of one of the most iconic action scenes ever filmed then if youre going to do that youve then got to make sure that the quality of the action at least meets that of road warriors if not excels above it with a film thats and im not joking here at least 80 action thats a tall orderso did they do it a resounding yes this is an action film and makes no excuses for it there is no clever twist no love interest not much dialogue and not much that on paper makes it much to shout about as a great film but purely as an action film its an absolute masterpiecethe action is plentiful beautifully shot brutal chaotic relentless and merciless but interestingly its as much of a plot point as anything else in the film is a particularly nice touch were the aerial long shots showing where everyone was in relation to each other as they converged across this vast barren post apocalyptic landscape it truly takes center stage above all else and much like road warrior did almost 35 years ago sets new benchmarks in what an action film can dothe thing is when you consider that most astonishingly of all is that the vast majority of stunt work was done using practical physical effects in this digital age every action film that is released from now on cgi or not will be compared to fury roads many many excellent scenes it is simply that much of a game changer with action film standards youve got to take this film for what it is a no holds barred old school action film of the very finest level of those it really is one of the very best examples of on screen action ever put to film,reality
wow george millerthis movie that you made has left me breathless still 2 days after watching it this movie has no comparison to the original installmentthe visual and stylistics in the movie leaves you gasping for air be warned once this movie starts rolling which is very early in the movie their is no stopping the momentum this movies keeps building the pressure in your mind in your head in your whole being oh my god my review is very simple when their are 3 moments in the movie where the action stops and all you can hear is an entire cinema catching their breath that gives you the answer you needtheir is simply nothing that even comes close on how great this is can not wait for the 3 sequels,reality
what i really enjoyed about this movie was that for the first half i was pretty sure it was just going to be a completely prurient vacuous action movie filled with special effects violence for special effects violences sake then it completely changed up in to a meaningful dramatic exposition of powerful themes and important allegorical advocacy of respect for human diversity condemnation of unchecked abuse of power by authority and the effects of nuclear power and global climate change i thought the film was powerful and entertaining at the same time charlize theron working with tom hardy created a powerful chemistry on screen that only results from bringing two major talents like these together in the same dramatic exposition which was indeed a treat and i was equally surprised and pleased to see many new faces as well which is a trend i hope continues casting hollywood blockbusters finally i have to admit the film left me wondering whether or not emu oil is an effective remedy for postapocalyptic road rash until next timepeace,reality
i waited thirtyfour years for another real flick that 1985 monstrosity with tina turner does not exist to me and i never thought id see the day well my pain and patience was worth it in the end ive been rewarded with a mindexplodinglygood eyeorgasm of ecstatic delightthis is seriously the most badass action flick i have seen in years the word ever briefly flits through my brain it is classic overthetop crazyweirdness done better and badderand even beautiful in some of the few spots it slows down enough to focus on something still it is dark ruthless and brutal yet at the same time hopeful with a powerful message of warning greed killseverythingto say that tom hardy and charlize theron are both brilliant in bringing their roles of and furiosa to life is a given the complexity of each of their painful pasts along with their respective hopes for redemption or resignation to penance weaves gracefully through the fabric of their personas and within the fiery desperate gleam in their painfully dusty eyes however it is the unexpectedly shiny performance of josh helman slit that held me fixated throughout his screen time his is like the bubbles in a cold glass of sparkling water the extra tickling enjoyment that thoroughly quenches ones thirst slit has such blossoming full character arc for a supporting rolesingleminded loyalty anger goodness surprise delight and yet poignancyand he delivers each facet so perfectly and seamlessly one isnt sure whats coming from him next he is that shiny bubble floating speedily through that glass of water to its inevitable destination but the path that bubble takes around the ice cubes is unpredictable and you cant take your eyes off of itdid i say it was good did i mention i want to do it againlike right now thank you so much george miller and please sirmay we soon have another drink of your glorious sparkling water,reality
what can i say im hardly the type to sit through a movie especially a 2 hour plus but this you cannot take your eyes off the screen all the characters are eccentric all the costumes are magnificent the guns and war vehicles are completely out of this world the ideas are flowing like the filming location is so beautiful and seeing it on the big screen is incredible charlize does not say much but with her finesse she doesnt have to hardy is brill all of them play their parts excellent the harsh desert sweating and getting downright dirty it is just so freakin good i love this movie all i can think of right now is when is the next one,reality
well that was exhilaratinghonestly fury road might be the most fun ive had at the movies in quite some time i spent the last couple weeks catching myself up on george millers action franchise after seeing how well fury road was doing critically long story short the original films are now some of my favorite action moviesflash forward thirty years and miller is back at it again making the fourth film without mel gibson skepticaldont be if theres one thing george miller knows how to do its direct an action film save for ten minutes in beyond thunderdome he made three action films that centered around the action in todays world most action films try to go for emotional depth and complex scenarios only to drag themselves down with unnecessary clutter while fury road does add narrative heft and some emotional backstory it augments the action and doesnt distract from itthe one complaint i have with millers approach in doing this is that it can leave the viewer somewhat confused about who people are what they are doing and why they are doing it this is a hallmark of the franchise for better or for worse the most prominent example i can think of in fury road is the main villain i loved his look i loved his voice and i loved the character all around but i cant for the life of me remember the guys namespeaking of the villain lets talk about the look of this film millers franchise has gone from understated and simple with the first film to progressively more grotesque and strange as the budgets have increased the third of the original films beyond thunderdome had a budget of approximately 20 million with todays us dollar value fury road has a budget over nine times that needless to say it is by far the most glamorous of the franchise it largely retains the aesthetic present in the first three films while adding a lot of new cool stuff possible with modern technology the cg present is really well done however the practical stunt effects are what steal the show miller himself said that 90 of the effects were practical this adds a realism and heightens the suspense during the absolutely jawdropping stunt sequences my favorite part of millers direction is how he manipulates the frame rates to make the action remain coherent or seem slightly less so that single thing made the film incredibly unique and quite fun to watchmoving to the acting tom hardy is an excellent replacement for mel gibson most people say that acting doesnt really matter in action films thats garbage when someone as talented as tom hardy does any role its noticed he really embodies the chaos going on inside head and also that stark coldness that gibson brought to the character charlize theron is also a good choice for furiosa as she shows the more caring nature that her character brought to the filmoverall fury road is the breath of fresh air that action films need in 2015 most in the genre are either old worn out franchises live free or die hard terminator genisys etc or featuring old worn out actors the expendables george miller expertly crafts a film that looks both back and forward at the same time retaining the unique aesthetic of the original films while also integrating new technology that makes the stunts that much more exciting fury road is a nonstop thrill ride that will entertain almost any moviegoer with its intensity and technicality,reality
going in to this movie viewers have to be on board with the ridiculous amount of action and some over the top moments this movie simply put is for an action lover this film has done the things other modern day action films have failed to do the hero is not an invincible super soldier which they well establish at the beginning our protagonist are rarely not in danger sucking the audience in making is scared for them great enemies who dont feel like balloons being swatted away but rather people who pose serious danger all this creates a tense adrenaline filled fun time at the theatrethis being said i dont agree with some other reviews on the character development or plot etc the world building was great as soon as the film began showing us the struggles of the common and the actual weakness of a self proclaimed god who rules them the character development on and furiosa was small and clich but they did it well the character nux was developed extremely well showing us the the human side of these faceless troops finally the plot was simple but perfect for action our heroes steal a much wanted resource and try to escapesimple yet a perfect plot for an action packed thrill ride as it puts the characters in situation of constant peril,reality
fury road is the fourth movie directed by george miller different from the other movies this one follows its own storyline and does not have any associations with the previous movies in the franchise i will be honest when i chose to watch this movie i had no idea it would be so damn insane i mean i had watched the trailers and seen what i was about an apocalyptic wasteland where law and order no longer existed and the only thing left to do is to fight for your own survival i was just not prepared for the insanity almost every character seemed to show i mean even our own protagonist does not think clear which just comes to show the world really had gone if you have seen any clips on youtube from behind the scenes of the movie you will know how little cgi that were used to film the crazy carchase scenes to see how much effort george miller went through to make each scene look almost exactly like the ones shown in the movie is a big plus in my book for the characters tom hardy did a solid job as but he could not have done it without the assistance of charlize theron as furiosa who did a fantastic job in portraying a strong female character the movie could have been called furiosa and i would have been fine with it in addition nicholas hoults character also did a great job and the same can be said for the movies main antagonist immortan joe even though he had a mask on that would hide his facial expressions it was easy to see in his eyes that he wasnt playing around it was like watching tom hardy as bane from the dark knight rises  you could feel the horror from the look in his eyes the movie is not filled with much dialogue but the scenes in the movie that involves the most dialogue is great to watch and shows good character development but the movie shines the most is at its crazy overthetop action scenes that are gold to watch i just wish i had seen the movie in cinema because this really is a movie that deserves to be enjoyed on the big screen,reality
this film is the most beautiful thing you will witness ever flawless editing and an incredible soundtrack george miller gives us another dose of wasteland in amazing style the stunts are unbelievable especially in an age when cgi is used far too much and the film is basically one long car chase there are plenty of awesome stunts and explosions to enjoy and the story can be enjoyed in a simple there and back again way or on a much deeper level thanks to millers character development excellent casting and awesome world building this film really plays with the visual side of story telling as very little speech is used characters often using facial expressions and gestures to express their feelings and desires there is so much foreshadowing and mirroring and intricate details visual and auditory that youll only catch after watching it a few times over and the many levels make it perfect for textual analysis 1010 would watch 100x,reality
fury road directed by george miller who also directed the previous instalments is back this time played by tom hardy is captured by a warlord immortan joe and his subjects lucks out however as he inadvertently takes part in a kidnapping and rescue mission by joe and his war parties helps the kidnapper a rogue war party member furiosa and her victims sex slaves that joe keeps together this crew races through the desert of postapocalyptic australia as they try and escape immortan joethis is a simple movie in a lot of ways there is very little dialogue and much of the story takes place through action scenes or set pieces i love that these scenes can often describe the world miller imagines without any tedious narration or worthless back story hardy does a great job as opting for silent brooding and grunting dialogue to portray as was mentioned this movie is 90 action think the tanker chase scene from the road warrior and multiply that by about 4 its nonstop action and its gorgeous to look ati have seen a few pieces of criticism for this film that describe it as childish or mindless action to improperly quote a few i would address this by pointing out that miller does not insult the audience with dialogue to explain the world or back story of universe he leaves the scenes to themselves and allows the viewer to see the minutia of his world or not depending on how close they are paying attention this movie has flipped the hollywoodized action flick around there are no clichd moments of candid action with jokes and laughs shared by invincible heroes the action scenes are intense and our heroes are vulnerable the thrill and suspense throughout the film keeps the viewer attentive and engaged the world develops around these scenes and often leaves the viewer to marvel much as and crew do themselvesi really enjoy this movie and on my fifth watch have decided to write this review a movie is excellent when it improves on subsequent watches and in my opinion fury road does just that it is eye candy action to be sure evens so there is nothing wrong with a great action movie and this one fits the bill perfectly fury road is highly engaging thrilling action packed well shot and directed and a total blast to watch each time,reality
for two hours i watched this film with awe and admirationcomplaints1 as i watch this film i feel like im playing the rpg dungeon quest the story is on a rail to accomplish an uncompleted quest we must go back the exact same way that we came not much thought involved not much freedom to explore the map just action on a rail2 i could never get the colors right reds are excessively red yeah its intentional however if my color settings work for every other video why should i need to make major adjustments without ultimate satisfaction for this film,reality
fury road 2015  out of 4 in a futuristic postapocalyptic world female rebel furiosa charlize theron goes against her tyrant leader by trying to get his female brides to a safe land far away with the brides stolen the tyrant sends all of his force after them but with the help of the loner tom hardy they try to reach some place they can live with peacethis is technically the fourth film in george millers franchise but i think its safe to say that this here is the best of the bunch considering how good the original series was its rather amazing to see how amazing this one here turned out i usually dont try to speak too highly of a new movie because i think the true test for any great movie is time i mean how does a film work fifteen twenty or thirty years after it was made does it stand the test of time while watching fury road i couldnt help but feel as if i was watching something that would easily stand the test of timestorywise this is pretty much a simple story but its millers wonderful eye that makes this truly one of the most remarkable action pictures in recent history i really dont want to underpraise this movie because it is so wild so crazy and so overthetop and suspenseful that you really cant help but feel that youre watching something unlike anything before the special effects here and stunt work are among some of the greatest that youre ever going to see so many action films are overloaded with mediocre cgi that you cant help but feel as if youre watching an unrealistic world thats not the case here because everything looks so real that you get caught up in whats going on because you feel as if its a real world with a real battle going onthere are some intense heartpounding battle sequences that really make your jaw hit the floor in regards to the action the explosions are loud and violent and there are a number of bodies being thrown around in every way imagination the builtup cars and monster rigs are something unlike youve ever seen before the the pure wild imagination in the action scenes is just rather remarkable theres no doubt that what youre seeing here is among some of the greatest things ever captured on film the masterful editing sound effects and cinematography just pull everything togetherthe performances are another major plus with theron being perfectly believable as this tough warriors hardy is also extremely great as the loner who doesnt speak too many words nicholas hoult josh helman zoe kravitz and hugh keaysbyrne are all impressive too fury road is pumped full of wonderful action and suspense and its certainly one of the best of its type,reality
i finally got around to watching fury road and am pleased to say i got exactly what i was looking for a nonstop joy ride full of amazing chase scenes and postapocalyptic imagery i will first say that this movie is not for those looking for strong character development a lot of the characters develop in a showandtell manner and not with deep evolving stories on to the characters charlize theron is amazingly bad ass as furiosa shes a great female protagonist who is not about the male fan service in fact this movie is full of strong female characters serves as more of a side character in comparison tom hardys portrayal of was as close as the original as i could have hoped for but i still believe mel gibson captured the cynical selfserving nature of character better than hardy overall the most impressive male character was nicolas hoult as nux the war boy who was raised for one purpose to fight and die for immortal joe the main antagonist and warlord of the citadel who goes on to betray joe and help furiosa and joe interestingly enough is portrayed by the same actor who played toecutter the main antagonist from the first filmfun characters great chase scenes and nonstop action make fury road a mustsee for anyone looking for a great action flick,reality
i saw this movie when it first came out without any expectations i had not even watched the trailer before i walked into the theater so i had no real idea of what i was about to see the movie blew me away the acting the visuals the soundtrack and the action were all stunning my predominant reaction however was to the character of imperator furiosa and everything she stood for many people are calling this movie a feminist movie but george miller the director once said that it was not his intention to make a female empowering film he was not upset that it had feminist themes however that impressed me the most he had unintentionally made a movie that had a strong female character which is how movies should be the film industry should not be shocked when there is a movie with an action hero that is female and that is the effect of fury road did not make it a huge deal that it had a woman like furiosa in the lead it just did it did not sexualize her or put her in a love triangle she was just another heroi cannot conclude my review without mentioning the idea of visual music george miller said that it was his intention to create a movie that could be watched in a language that you do not speak but you would still understand it the lack of meaningful dialogue from was taken by many as poor acting on tom hardys part but i think it all had to do with millers visual music technique the product was beautiful and i could watch over and over again and still find new ways to love it,reality
george miller really is a mastermind this was essentially 90 minutes of pure adrenaline rush tom hardy hardly had to talk and he still gave a thrilling performance as the new he is a certified action star now is taken on an adventure when he is used as a blood bank for nicholas hoults character he ends up escaping his role and meets up with charlize theron as she helps out the villains many child baring wives george miller and hugh keaysbyrne did an absolutely fantastic job developing the villain immortan joe he is this years best villain and it wont be close at all he is an absolute terror that is relentless in pursuit of his wives the chase scene as joe chases his wives is about 90 of the movie with absolutely crazy stunts and events occurring in this chase george miller showed everyone what a chase scene should be take note fast and furious franchise there are some twists and heartbreaks along the way which really adds to the main storyline as well just proving that miller knows exactly what he is doing with the franchise just sit back and enjoy the ride,reality
fury road was an outstanding visual experience with relatable characters and a world that is so insane you wish it was real rockatansky was perfectly portrayed by tom hardy who had big shoes to fill after mel gibson did not feel invincible like many of the other characters in this movie this made everything just more realistic i enjoyed the fact that was again portrayed as a man who is trying to survive in the brutal wasteland created by director george miller really does look in this movie with the images from his past haunting him throughout the movie imperator furiosa was another bad ass that really focused on trying to save the human cargo the immortan joe was gross and terrifying and i couldnt love this character even more the way he portrays himself as a god was a big part of the story and character development the action was amazing and in my mind this is the best action movie of all time if not that then at least the best action movie of the last fifteen years this film definitely surpassed the previous best movie of the series the road warrior the reality of this world was frightening but was so awesome that i felt i wanted to be apart of it the cars alone was something that drew me into the wasteland the fact that so little is left but they can make so much of it is an important part of the world the madness of the war boys was completely insane and crazy and that is what a film is all about overall this film is a great action movie that should be watched on the big screen i had a great time watching this movie and cant wait to return to the wasteland and for tom hardy to come back as the words greatest survivor,reality
the only exposure to the franchise i had before this one was thunderdome that piece of 80s hoohah that was all big hair and snarly performances so i came into fury road fresh with no expectations and no comparisons to makefury road is one of the most beautiful films ive seen in a long time a strange claim to make about a film with such a dirty grungy setting peopled with characters out of a postapocalyptic nightmare but it is absolutely visually stunning and a reminder that beauty in film is about much more than pretty scenery and cinematography george miller and company turn this action film into a ballet that left me almost ecstatic with excitement and reminded me how infrequently i see a film thats truly cinematic and how much i love it when i do the film is mostly one long sustained set piece that in the hands of a different director would become monotonous and boring but not here stunt actors tumble fly crash and swoop in and out of the frame while vehicular carnage is filmed with all the love of a romantic dance there are narrative themes that tempt one to take the film more seriously than is probably wise  beyond the obvious one of environmental crisis the film evokes thoughts of the religious fundamentalism and tribal warfare plaguing the middle east but this movie is more about movement than anything else and i was happy to sit back and enjoy the ridetom hardy and charlize theron are great at what theyre asked to do which is mostly grunt and kick butt and if the makeup artists do not at least get nominated for an academy award for their work there is no justice in hollywoodgrade a,reality
this film is no memento when it comes to plot and only makes a few appearances but i am not complaining as a fan of the original trilogy i honestly did not have high expectations when sitting down to watch this film considering that very few new continuations of franchises are good howevergeorge miller has outdone himself and i applaud him the editing and pacing flows and the action scenes are so spectacular that they would make any director jealous this movie is a simple film with an idea that everyone working on fury road has stuck to and improved upon vastly this film is definitely a worthy addition to the franchise and i look forward to future installments,reality
review what an epic ride im not one for remakes but this was a great movie its full of action right from the beginning to the end and the stunts were amazing personally i think the movie should have been called furiosa because hardly said a word through the whole film anyway in this movie you see rockatansky tom hardy being captured by a group of rebels who keep him in a dungeon as there prisoner when furiosa charlize theron is told to pick up some gasoline for the rebels she takes his five pregnant wives with her because they want to escape from the ruthless warlord immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne whilst travelling across the dangerous wasteland joe soon realises that his wives have escaped so he gathers his various gangs together so he can get them back also travels with the rebels and he manages to escape from them and ends up helping furiosa on her impossible mission the storyline was great and the intensity throughout the movie kept me on the edge of my seat charlize therons performance was outstanding and the whole look of the movie was brilliant it does end quite abruptly so i hope they come out with a sequel soon im waiting to see kick butt because there wasnt that much depth to his character thats not to say that tom hardy didnt play his part well but there was just way to much going on for the director to go into his story hopefully he will do in the sequel anyway its definitely one of the best films that i have watched this year and for a remake it makes the original look mediocre brilliantroundup charlize theron 40 first came on the scene in the children of the corn iii if anyone actually saw it but most people remember her in two days in the valley in 1996 after starring alongside tom hanks in that thing you do she played a major role as keanu reeves wife in the devils advocate in 1997 which pushed her to the big league her next major role was alongside johnny depp in the astronauts wife in 1999 and after the successful legend of bagger vance she starred with keanu reeves again in sweet november after that she had a string of average movies like 15 minutes trapped and waking up in reno and then she starred in a leading role in the italian job remake in 2004 she won an oscar  golden globe award for the best leading role in monster and she was nominated for the same award for north country in 2005 after the disappointing aeon flux movie in 2005 she didnt really come back into the limelight until she starred alongside will smith in hancock which i quite enjoyed she then got high praise for her role in young adult in 2011 and she also starred in the long awaited prometheus after that she proved that she can tackle most genres by starring in snow white and the huntsman and a million ways to die in the west and then she comes out with this movie were she put in a terrific performance i just hope she returns for the sequel this movie was directed my george miller who also made the original movies he also directed the twilight movie the witches of eastwick lorenzos oil babe and happy feet 1  2 so he definitely has experience in different genres its planned that he will be directing the sequel wasteland so i hope that he doesnt spoil the franchise now that this movie made such a healthy profit anyway the cast was perfect and the concept was fresh and definitely worth a watchbudget 150million worldwide gross 375millioni recommend this movie to people who are into their actionadventurescifi movies about a man who helps a radical woman to bring 5 pregnant women to safety 810,reality
i was reluctant to see this film because i really liked the original road warrior and from the trailers it appeared to be nothing more than a good remake and i rarely like remakes this movie has more action and stunts in any movie i have ever seen sure looked like a large majority of those stunt were physically done without cgi  and for me made it much more enjoyable if you want a film that throws everything at you for a solid 2 hours then this film is for you dont think about whether any of it makes any sense i stopped once and thought how far can all of these souped up vehicles go on a tank of gas aw forget it and just enjoy the carnage,reality
in a world where civilization has collapsed water is scarce and humanity is broken immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne is the leader of a large group of survivors in a town called citadel imperator furiosa charlize theron escapes the town with immortans five wives in search for a better future and war boys were sent in search for them while escaping furiosa meets rockatansky tom hardy who was being held captive by the war boys who went in search for the wives once free and furiosa help each other and were on a path of survival they headed east where furiosas childhood homeland once was but after realizing the home where furiosa once lived was no longer there they decided to go back to citadel and confront immortal joe on the way back to town immortan joe gets killed by furiosa giving the town of citadel a sign of hope opening the water supply to the town fury road is a ruthless high octane movie from its very first scenes you can feel the energy that the director george miller is trying to project to its audience rockatansky tom hardy speaks about how he used to be a cop and now he prefers to stay away from those who are alive than dead getting in his car and driving off he quickly realizes that he is being chased by war boys who are pale warriors with blisters all over their face due to the radiation ends up being capture by the war boys after his car gets pushed sideways making him flip the car the introduction of the new rockatansky as tom hardy was great in my opinion a man of a few words a lonely wolf a crazy hard core that is what i seem to remember from the previous movies the two hour long movie is full of stunts explosions and car chases the computer generated imagery also known as cgi was slightly low as some of the explosions and actions sequences looked more like computer games than a movie but you can easily forget about those details as soon as you see the types of vehicles they have with customized enormous engines and tires that not only use gasoline but also nitrous oxide to increase speed during those car chases the directors idea of having a massive stereo on top of a truck with a guitar player who uses the guitar also as a flame thrower was mind blowing you tend to have different perspective of where the music is coming when the action begins this part will make you want to get in your car and drive fast while listening to a metallica song at least thats how i felt the characters were great including the beautiful charlize theron but it was hard to see tom hardy as from the very few times that was speaking i couldnt seem to stop thinking of hardys english accent also hardy is so darn good looking i felt like needed to be an uglier raggedy actor like the old overall this is a thumbs up movie the movie kept me fired up to the end although the ending was clichd a happily ending story without a plot twist i would still watch it again without a doubt,reality
when was ever about the story line when was ever about deep character development the answer is never to all the whiners and softbodied movie critics out there know this has always been about action fuel chrome punks fast cars spikes supercharged engines and badass guns its as simple as that if you want anything else go hire the notebook i remember watching 2 as a kid and walking out totally shell shocked at the roller coaster ride i had just been through only star wars came close to embedding itself into my subconscious in such a way back in the late 70s and 80s post apocalyptic movies and shows were common it was a cheap and easy setting for directors to create all you needed were old factories dry landscapes a few rusty barrels and barbed wire thats pretty much what is but in fury road you can add a dash of nitro is the king of postapocalyptic adventurefor those who havent grown up on you really need to accept that this movie is all about nonstop turbocharged overthetop action once you understand what is all about you can sit back and just enjoy the spectacle you wont see action this good in any movie just think of it as a roller coaster ride for your brainis set in australia years after a nuclear war has desolated the planet theres little hope for the human race and man has fallen back into the age of barbarians as explains i exist in this wasteland reduced to one instinct survive thats pretty much all you need to know the almost nonexistent plot fills in small gaps between raging high octane induced action the stunts are fast and awe inspiring the only gripe i have with fury road is that like most movies these days the dogooder leftwing progressive dribble has seeped into this production here we see the need to show the world that women are strong willed powerf zzzzz oh yeah youll see 80year old women jumping on the tops of racing trucks and theron personally taking down an army of lean barbarians it doesnt work no matter how hard you try and force feed us this prefabricated notion that everyone is physically equal well never fall for itthat said i recommend this movie if you are in the mood for action and dont really care for a deep story,reality
the propagandist cabal which also runs hollywood becomes increasingly antiwhite racist this is heavily antiwhite and anti european racist indeed whites are pictured as fagots insult valhalla i even spotted that the degenerates have a black and red banner which may refer to the flag of ukrainian volunteer battalions who at this moment fight kremlins invasion in ukraine the degenerates in the movie call their paradise valhalla i suggest the word valhalla to be removed because it is used uniquely in brainwashing purposes to engrave negative associations with european culture in the brains of the cattlecitizen there are also other propaganda messages otherwise the movie is entertaining there is a lot of creativity in the design of vehicle and action scenes the verdict 1 worth watching 2 worth protesting against the anti white and antieuropean racism,reality
at the start of the film i was very confused having never seen before and the settings and scenes not to mention characters freaked me out a bit and left me thinking what have i came to see i couldnt understand the concept but as the film went on and i started to understand the plot more and more it became a very top quality film which i would definitely watch again the film definitely got more intriguing as time went on and after nearly walking out i am so glad i didnt because id of missed a great piece of film tom hardy is a brilliant actor and was at his finest in this also nicholas hoult was fantastic in this he nailed the role of a half life and played it exceptionally well overall if you havent seen any other film it will take you by surprise at first but trust me the more you watch the more attached and intrigued you become and you come away thinking wow that was a really good ever lasting plot excellent film,reality
the fact that so many people hated the movie and still we know deep inside that its insanely good tell me that sooner or later this movie will be considered a cult classic think about the review when blade runner came out this movie is beautiful a ballet of total mayhem a twisted metal hybrid fury roadwhat kind of plot where you expecting hereseriously clearly this movie is not for everyone specially if you are into almodovar style this is a romero night of the living dead its a hidden gem of dirt fire and blood im ok with all the negative reviews in a few years this movie will be a reference for any post apocalyptic adrenaline driven movie title for those who love chaos mayhem explosion and decadence do yourself a favor and just watch this movie have a lovely day ,reality
fury road is without a doubt one of the greatest achievements of cinema captured on film in recent years the explosive exhilarating action sequences were masterfully directed by yes a true mastermind and genius george miller george miller creator of the trilogy with mel gibson brings his franchise back from the dead with this monster of a movie the film takes place in a post apocalyptic wasteland filled with crazy people in the very beginning of the film we are introduced to a tortured and damaged man named rockatansky is our protagonist and hero of the story he is haunted by his past and his failure to save the ones he loved he is the definition of a loner until he is captured and taken back to the citadel he then gets involved with the chaos when he meets charlize therons character imperator furiosa a one armed woman looking for redemption together they team up to take the abused wives of the main villain immortan joe to find asylum out in the desert tom hardy and charlize theron are perfect fits for the lead roles due to their wide ranged acting skills particularly those of charlize theronas every moviegoer should know a movie villain is very important to the film because not only does he or she help drive the plot but can also be responsible for the movies awesomeness we are in for a treat with immortan joe who you can tell by just looking at him that he is one evil and sinister dude immortan joe presents himself as a god living amongst his people he hogs all of the valuable resources in the wasteland and this gives him his power his war boys are so loyal to him that they will do anything for him like the league of shadows guys from the dark knight rises the practical effects of the movie create an old school kindofvibe throughout the movie but it pays off well because it is so realistic and looks way better than computer animated special effects the practical effects look fantastic in this film and hopefully it inspires future filmmakers to use this technique rather than cgi dont get me wrong cgi can be a valuable tool but it is overused in film today the stunts were also spectacular to look at and honestly some of the best i have ever seen overall the action of the movie in one word amazing this movie will surely bring in oscar nominations so aside from the cool characters special effects directing technique and action what a movie really needs to be a masterpiece is a great story though fury road did not slack in this category it was just to a minimum the story was basic and presented in a rare way without any real exposition making it a little difficult to get a good grasp on the story though this is not necessarily a bad thing it was just different millers clever approach to this made the beginning to be somewhat complex as it forced the audience to figure out this world without any real introductionalso miller wanted to tell the story with the visuals so there is not much dialogue throughout the film so pretty much the opposite of a quentin tarantino movie again not necessarily a bad thing because the plot still flows well although it does not allow for a lot of development of many cool characters miller once said in an interview they wont have to read the subtitles in japan this will surely make it easier on foreigners but has no factor in making the movie better also the movie did not have the most memorable dialogue but was more memorable than the old films some lines tried too hard to be movie catchphrases while others worked perfectly for the scenethough as awesome as fury road was i cannot give it a 10 because of its basic story i wish the movie was a little longer with more development dialogue and focus on the story so it would make the movie even more epic with higher stakes purpose and emotional appeal compared to other action classics like the matrix and the dark knight which had great stories along with groundbreaking action fury road did not quite reach those heights but reached farther heights than most action movies of recent yearsfury road had potential to be one of the greatest action movies of all time but just barely missed at the end i found myself saying really that was it and i wanted more still fury road is an awesome movie that most will enjoy and appreciate cant wait for the sequels 910,reality
first off ill start by saying i was not impressed by the trailers and immediately thought this movie wasnt going to be great i played borderlands so i do like this kind of setting as well and they are almost identical yes i know came firstas an action film that is already a sequel this film is absolutely amazing once i realized it was like 98 action and 2 of the film talking i was still impressed by the cinematography as well as the well directed scenes this film has amazing acting on almost all parts while the mannerisms and behaviors of the war boys in the citadel made me lose brain cells i think the acting by everyone was amazing especially love how the movie starts off as well as the scene where they show the guitarists strapped to a giant amp,reality
one of the best movies i have ever witnessedthis is one of the most cinematic movies i have ever watched the directing is absolutely stunning there is no shaky cam here there is no over the top cgi gap filler it is pure camera shot bliss with top notch directingthe wide shots and camera angles are absolutely mind blowing and beautiful in every waythe story is typical and similar to the originals as you would hopeexpect and i just cant say anything bad about this movie if i had to complain it might be that himself is less featured than the cast as a wholebut i feel that is more an intro to him to prepare us for the next movietake note other film makers this is how you make a movie,reality
superb action sequences which apart from a few brief moments last the entire length of the movie the colors are beautiful and the sound is furiousyou can almost smell the gasoline hardy could have done with a bit more dialogue though but still does a great job along with theron who really is the main focus of this film i think a film like gladiator had the right balance between a good story and some great action scenes but for me personally fury road misses being a classic because the plot is too simple on the plus side miller steps on the throttle like an f1 driver who has nothing to lose and gives the viewer a ride into the chaotic,reality
there was a lot of hype about this movie and in all honesty it more or less lived up to it it could just be me but i found the whole thing to be slightly overrated do not get me wrong i enjoyed it i mean its the closest thing to a proper borderlands movie ill ever get and charlize was a goddess as usual but did it deserve all this probably not i lost interest around halfway through the ridiculously long chase around the wastelands but i decided to stay longer and watch more in case of a major plottwist but no instead you get what im assuming to be failed clones of daenerys targaryen and really how convenient was it that she had a contraction right when it was critical to remain silent i will admit that the overall execution was impeccable but the whole thing revolved around escaping from the oppression only to decide to go back it really felt like a storyless movie adaptation of borderlands as i said it could be just me as this is the first movie ive watched in short the overall battle scenes and the environment were absolutely stunning and the acting was on point but i felt the story was a bit lacking,reality
lots of trucks lots of fight scenes lots of characters this post apocalyptic action film can be entertainingthere is a story yet it seems that the story could have been better developed the story the characters and the world they live in could have been better explainedthere is very little racial diversity in the castingi liked the character played by nicholas hoult in this movie tom hardy uses the same voice that he used while playing the bane character in the batman movie i have no idea why they would have told him to use his bane voice in this movie it seems very much out of placeoverall the movie can be entertaining but the story could have been better or it could have been better explained and tom hardys bane voice was a distraction,reality
fury roadto quote joe bob briggs the worlds most famous drivein movie critic theres no plot to get in the way of the storyfury road mmfr is set in a dystopian future where warlords rule and fight over oil and water in a desolate desert land outside any rule of law that would never happen its the stupidest movie i have enjoyed in a long time the sets arent wonderful and the acting what acting the editing meh the cinematography is okay not spectacular for a dystopian road movie the make up nope not great what works in the film is the action and morality tale and the vehicles the vehicles are cool ie fascinating im not a gearhead by any stretch but what they did to mix different vehicles together to make scary road war machines was very successful like the horrendous there are no words to describe how bad beyond thunder dome 1985 mmfr is a morality tale not about saving but about saving the innocent however the writers were smart this time giving few lines and making the female protagonist imperator furiosa the star if there was an oscar category for best stunt work mmfr would win hands down its fun to watch while incredibly improbable however because it is set in its own world we accept that furthermore there are no posturing heroes spouting diatribes from patriotic speeches avengers or camp and cute but deadly sorts of heroes guardians of the galaxy or a vomit inducing good versus evil dualism that pervade so many super hero and other action films while violent and full of explosions it doesnt insult us with such morality play nonsense mmfr is pure action take it for leave it rating matinefull priceif action without pretense is your cup of tea if you are sick of the simplistic good versus evil plots if you like characters that dont easily fit into a box called villain or hero than you will enjoy mmfr if you need those things or you want more plot or thought i understand i would recommend you stay home and watch the also entertaining theory of everything but youll miss some bad ass vehicles peace tex shelters,reality

one of the best movies i have ever seen i found it amazing that they could make an entire movie about a car chase and make it so interesting it was well filmed and i liked the style as well as the great plot tom hardy did the role really well and i thought it was cool that a main character could have such little line in the movie and yet still give such a character the craziness and weirdness of this movie makes it even better i think that nicholas hoult did well in playing that out favorite line what a wonderful dayas someone who is a big fan of the old series i was a little worried that this would not be up to standard but this movie definitely destroy the old onesi would recommend this movie to anyone who likes action packed adventure overall a fantastic movie good job george miller,reality
i did not know what to expect when i went to watch this movie in theaters i had never seen the original movies so i was not sure what it was going to be about i was blown awaythis movie is a thrill ride from beginning to end its goes 0 to a 100 real quick and stays therei also have to say that it has some of the best visuals i have ever seen in a movie most of which are not cgi as opposed to what people may thinkall in all i would have to give this movie a 10 rating i would recommend this movie for everyone to watch hold on to your seats,reality
is great 80s action movie of 2015 this movie is great for the wide screenthe action is not cgi all real the hero furiosa not the villain immortan joe awesome and the grand scope mix it with the amazing soundtrack with the guy shooting fire out of his guitar this movie is nuts and thats what makes it great its different then your normal action movie tom hardy is good as the character charlie theron as furiosa was amazing nicholas hold as nux was pretty good and the direction of george miller is at its best he made a modern touch to this world but i must talk about the action so great wide shots no shaky cam oh my god this is one of the best movies of the year and were not even done with it yet,reality
on the front end of this review let me say that i watched the mel gibson trilogy in preparation for seeing this movie i was brand new to the franchise having only seen bits and pieces of the original films as a kid having watched those movies recently im now judging fury road based on both its strengths as a film in general but also as it compares to the other films in the franchisethat said ive rated fury road at 8 stars giving it a one star advantage over the gibson trilogy which i rated at seven stars each i suppose that means that i found fury road to be the best in the franchise overall im still partial to the original in terms of storyline and the character development behind himself and my reviews of road warrior and beyond thunderdome both mentioned that my biggest gripe with those films is that origin story from the original movie is completely cut off from the later filmsthat trend continues in fury road if you watch the first movie in the series and enjoy it at all you may be frustrated that the next three movies fury road included have little to do with the original film that said ive come to peace with the fact that the franchise from here on out is going to follow the nowestablished formula of making a nomadic adventurer who happens to get into lots of quandaries in the postapocalyptic australian outback if you come into fury road expecting that and nothing more then you wont be disappointed with this film at allthe films individual merits are noteworthy the movie starts off a bit awkward with a capture scene that gives no background and provides very little in the way of plot development that awkwardness on the front end of the film is the main reason that ive rated this film at eight stars and not higher however i must say that fury road does do something that i feel is rare in filmmaking today it tells its story in a way that doesnt go into great detail about either the basic gist of the plot itself or any of the main characters and yet along the way it tells you all you need to know about the story for it to be fun and well done i found this style of movie making to be a throwback to 80s films that somehow seemed to be able to utilize this method in a better way than the industry has done since its the same formula that was used in both road warrior and beyond thunderdome but fury road arguably accomplishes its task better than either of those two predecessorscertainly better than thunderdomeits also true that the film is well made in terms of both acting and visual effects the visual style heavily emulates road warrior which i personally find to be a bit out there and abrasive but despite my personal distaste for the dessert scene mixed with beater cars and leather clad minions i nevertheless can admit that the film is well done visually as for the acting tom hardy plays his role well albeit its somewhat hard not to play a severely underdeveloped leading role that could have just as easily been mike or mitch since theres so very little about character that comes through in the filmbut thats a script problem not an acting problem charlize theron however is the films real star its uncommon for summer blockbusters such as fury road to feature acting quite as strong as therons it may be inane to suggest that she might deserve a best supporting actress oscar nomination for this role but i wouldnt be terribly surprised if it happenedall in all this movie like road warrior and beyond thunderdome is not a film that it takes a great amount of intellectual acuity to appreciate but in spite of its lack of depth its nevertheless a fun high paced movie that is a great two hour distraction its doubtful that youll want your money back even if its not your favorite film of the year,reality
ive grown up with the first came out when i was 16 i have seen all the movies numerous times ive even been to a marathon to see mm i to iii so without being a hardcore fan i like a lot but after iii i decided and a lot of fans with me im sure that it was probably better to leave it therei went to the cinema expecting a rehash of the old but boy was i in for a surprise george miller has outdone himself and created a worthy successor that may even be better than parts ii and certainly iiithe makers have squeezed every little bit of extra fun there was in the story and managed to put all this fun into a wellbalanced movie that never stops even though it manages to have a few quiet moments i liked the humor and the timing especially it is the best action movie i have seen for a long long time for exactly that reasonthe only bit of criticism i have is tom hardy or maybe his presence in the movie did he have a fight with the director all i know is for a main character he doesnt have anywhere near the screen time he should get nicholas hoult compliments to him stole a lot of it looks suspicious now i dont know tom hardy all that well but i think hes capable of a lot more than what we get to see here which is basically a lot of muscle and very little facial expression or dialogall in all though this has to be one of the best postapocalyptic movies of all time and an example of how to make action fun it makes death proof look old very very old,reality
in my view writing comments on current releases is fairly pointless as theyll disappear into all the noise but the franchise is one im particularly passionate about so allow me to attempt at some degree of objectivity while writing this glowing review im a curmudgeon when it comes to action and sci fi movies in my view stunt work is much less impressive when half or more of it is accomplished via greenscreen and rendered human beings science fiction relies on visual stimulus and often massive destruction effects miniatures matte painting and stop motion to add to the constructed universe and entertainment factor now diluted so much by the knowledge that rooms full of outsourced nerds in canada india new zealand and china are clicking pixels around until everything is absolutely perfect so in my view making an action and stuntheavy science fiction film in this day and age is an uphill battle to impress a weary action fan such as this but this film did the best job it couldwas it perfect no there were issues with pacing inconsistent character development some awkward cgi yes especially in terms of cgi humans for stunt work and hardys performance and characterization not quite up to snuff i was also put off by some distractingly gimmicky 3d shots like a steering wheel floating in the screen after an explosionperfectly imperfect almost if this film had brought back a haggard 60 mel gibson finding his redemption and otherwise been the same i would have given it a 9 i absolutely love how the toecutter from the original returns here as immortem joe showing that geriatric villains can be just as threatening as any other with each successive film there has been more and more of a feminist approach to the presentation of tough women dominating men in this film they go a bit over the top with it but not to the point where its utterly unbelievable a la hunger games where a scrawny woman has no problem defeating a musclebound man in a fistfight without even taking breaking a sweat refreshingly a lot of the female characters are put in just as much peril and take just as much unceremonious damage and fatalities as their male counterparts all things being equal its great fun and something new though at the end of the day i cant see a lot here in this blighted dystopian landscape that would attract a lot of female viewersreasonably entertaining of course this film is loaded with a lot of carnage stunt work and visual stimulus including some delicious really wasteful and globalwarmingcontributing gasoline explosions of a like not seen since the 90s the color palette is beautiful the women gorgeous to look at and some of the production design for the vehicles and sets some of the most creative of the steampunk genre seen since blade runner a few moments really had me at the edge of my seat such as the overlapping battling across multiple vehicles near the end i only wish there was more of thiswhat would i have changed didnt need all those ghost voices following him around through the film and could have used some character development outside of that he could have played a more central role in driving the plot forward the ending needed more of an impact or crazy crescendo to build up to id have added another element such as a time factor on closing the pass another tribe emerging or a bigger explosion or megacarpileup to close things with its difficult not to feel a bit disappointed that things end on a whimper movies dont know how to end these days also much like gravity this film suffers from protagonists living through things that would have killed anyone in real life theres no way any human being would have lived through a couple of these high speed crashes especially with ones neck chained to one of such vehicles so id have ironically toned some of the danger down a tad to increase this universes realismtension leveli get the feeling that an unrated release will be on its way im picking this movie apart but aside from what i mentioned it gets so much right its got a crazy bald guy playing a flamethrowing guitar while wearing bright red 1800s pajamas for gods sake its one for the boys but also one for anyone needing a modern big screen action fix,reality
note i have not seen any other films but i intend tofury road is without a doubt one of the most hyped blockbusters of the year featuring tom hardy and charlize theron in the leading roles of george millers famous franchise the movie generated a lot of buzz and the trailer promised the uncompromising vision of george miller which is exactly what we getfury road opens with a short montage explaining the events that create the wasteland that the films ensemble will traverse its a bit choppy and generic but it gets the point across it then cuts to overlooking the quiet desert landscape twitching at any sound before he hops into his car the quiet is disturbed when a caravan of land vehicles come following after from here on the action is almost nonstopisnt much in the way of character development it isnt concerned with backstory or relationships very much it simply places our main characters in a setting and lets them play around in it for two hours while this may sound unorthodox george miller pulls it off with masterful ease using visuals he establishes the rules of the citadel and the dystopian civilization they are living in a scene where immortan joe gives water to the people we understand what is happening and who is importantthe movie soon takes us off course as furiosa played by charlize theron takes a detour from the supply run and immortan joes warboys including overly enthusiastic warboy nicholas hoult in a role that is surprisingly wellsuited for him take off after her thus begins the epic chase the movie is almost unrelenting in the amount of action going on at once it is amazing to look at there hasnt been more thrilling chase scenes in any film in yearsunfortunately the movies greatest strength is also its greatest weakness with about half an hour left to go the movie starts to feel rather monotonous there is very little story to work with which works great at first but by the movies end it felt like my eyes took a ride but not the rest of me i left the theater feeling nothing for the characters nothing to think about in regards to dystopia and realize that what little story was there could have been told in five minutes the movie does itself an injustice by only showcasing breathtaking action sequences and failing to dig just a little deeper the actioner also suffers from the trope of the good guys being great shots while the goons are insufferably disposable and terrible shotsstill pretty much everything else works in fury road the cinematography is gorgeous the colors are saturated rather than desaturated like most postapocalyptic films and the use of sweeping shots and wides give the audience a great view of the action the editing is frenetic but not in such a way that dizzies the audience jump cuts keep the tension high and there are several disturbing inserts that represent the mental torment is really in the soundtrack is thunderous and bombastic the production design is outrageous and unique and the actors though they arent given a whole lot to work with are all believable in their roles the one who really gets to shine here is nicholas hoult a warboy on the trail of and furiosa in the hopes of impressing immortan joeanother point that should be applauded is the movies portrayal of females while most blockbusters are very maledominated and often stereotype women as damsels in distress the strongest characters in are the women charlize theron is scarred and has a prosthetic arm but it doesnt stop her from continuously kicking ass throughout the movies 2hour duration as badass as he is isnt the best shot with a sniper rifle and isnt so proud as to risk wasting ammo and turns the rifle over to furiosa in a very symbolic image one of immortan joes wives removes the shackles around her crotch and kicks it away is liberating towards its females and drops hints at the savage nature of men throughout the film with writing on the walls of the citadel reading who killed the world and we are not things its refreshing to see such balance in such a filmfury road is a masterpiece of action an uncompromising blockbuster with a unique and original vision all the visual elements are in place but by an hour and a half the spectacle wears off it may not leave you with much to think about or feel after but its a great time at the movies and it plays to a different tune than most summer blockbusters i know ill be present at any future installments,reality

mild spoilersfury road is an amazing action movie filled with practical stunts and a compelling story for those who say it doesnt have one werent paying attention to the movie first point except for the first the character has been a side character he is not the main point of the plot he is the vessel in which we get to experience this world which is why except for the first film the last three arent in any chronological ordersecond point for those screaming feminist this and that the reason the women were so important in this movie is because the main villain was out to have a perfect child instead of warboys and damaged men and women he fought hard to achieve his goal in this world where they have water and gas and food and bullets they focused on achieving new and healthy lifethird point was just how he was supposed to be for those saying there was no character development need to look at the eyes and pay attention i for one am tired of movies constantly taking half of the movie explaining through long periods wtf is going on it is annoying this had many visual and vocal cues of character growth and development you just needed to pay attentionfury road had a very deep and engaging story for those with more than one brain cell who had the ability to put together a simple crossword puzzle this movie doesnt have quips and jokes it was mayhem and darkness which is what it is supposed to be it is isnt feminist it revolved around the women because that was important at the that time in the universe bottom line grow up and pay attention the details of the movie we are adults you should be able to pay attention to small cues and story development,reality
flesh and metal collide in the part sequel part reboot post apocalyptic no holds barred fury road 70 year old director george miller returns to the franchise he created 30 years after the last outing this time with tom hardy as rockatansky and charlize theron as imperator furiosa two rebels trying to survive in a desert landscape of lost humanitythe plot is fairly simple furiosa abandons her duties and sets out to find her homeland and take immortal joes young brides with her joe of course sets out to stop her and is caught up in this battle charlize theron is fantastic as furiosa with her artificial limb and war paint determined to find her home and reunite with whats left of her family tom hardy as is a man of few words troubled by visions of past horrors both need to work together as they guide the fragile and beautiful brides of joe to safety the film has a core theme of feminist solidarity that balances well against the testosterone of immortal joe and his war boys the performances from the two leads and their mutual respect is told mainly through actions rather than dialogue exposition takes a back seat hereunlike previous films in the series the budget this time around of 150 million finally matches the ambitions and imagination of the director the sheer originality on display is impressive stunning photography high contrast warm colour palette and smooth camera work draw you into the wild west wasteland the jaw dropping carnage of the action scenes are indescribable fast  furious is a walk in the park compared to this you must see it to believe it but even then you still ask yourself is this actually happening it has the right mix of cgi and real stunts that will make you think back to classics like james camerons terminator 2 and it all looks awesome in 3d ithe score by tom holkenborg aka junkie xl is loud heart pounding epic and in sync with the bizarre but soon to be iconic flamethrower guitarist and tribal drummers who get their fair share of screen timei highly recommend this film if for some strange reason youve been sitting on the fence its feral dark gritty anarchic surreal just pure mayhem fury road isnt just any action film its one that sits side by side with your favourite hollywood blockbusters a new classic that demands repeat viewings for its visual triumphs and sonic assaults now if you excuse me im off to watch it again,reality
the characters first of all you should know that this movie is character driven as opposed to story driven the characters individual journeys how they are developed over the course of the story are very thought through and although some of them will seem flat at first they soon start to grow and change into individual personalitiesthe setting it explores the base human instincts in an unforgiving world with little comfort where survival is the everyday struggle it brilliantly portrays through acting and directing the insanity that affects this worlds inhabitants and how their desperation to survive drives them to believe in anything that theyre told that gives them hopethe art direction the visuals are stunning miller allegedly wanted the movie to be colourful because he thought that in a world such as this humans will try to gather every scrap of beauty they can find to try and make their hard lives a little more bearable this coupled with the amazing namibian desert makes for an impactful picturethe acting the portrayal of the different characters in the movie is fantastic even the supporting cast has memorable personalities that are conveyed through a few simple actions  the adaptable survivor the long term thinking life lover the weak one searching for security the brave protector and these are just supporting characters the main characters are equally brilliant and thanks to actors with a proved track record these are brought to life in a great way that makes their emotions your own  hopelessness desperation anguishthe action heres one important aspect the action will drive your pulse through the roof from almost the very start the high pace will have you gripping your seat an acquaintance of mine measured their pulse while watching the movie and was apparently doing heavy cardio excercise while sitting down if you watch this in a movie theater youll hear the audience gasp for air between the action sequences its like a roller coaster ride and im not exaggeratinglastly i want to explain how i rate movies i give them a number from 1 to 10 based on my initial feeling and then i go over the movie and try to find things worth retracting points for in this case the initial impression was so good and after analysing it i decided that neither of the two things that made me go huh while watching the movie was worth retracting points fori will definitely watch this movie again and this is one of those few instances where ill be getting a copy to put on my shelf as well,reality
fury road is a movie that forces you to use your eyes and your head instead of forcefeeding you exposition via pointless and unrealistic dialogue this movie is the embodiment of show dont tellthat is why some people hate this movie and why i was somewhat confused as well at first i was only doing what id got so used to doing in action films listening for the story and looking for the eyecandybut this film puts everything from the smallbutsavesacharacterslife details to the overarching background story into the shots instead of the audio the characters clothing equipment vehicles background and mannerisms tell as much as any dialogue could look for the story and youll find this piece is an exercise in worldbuilding like no othercombine that with incredibly creative and unendingly intense action and you have yourself one hell of a movieand to those saying hardys acting is poor again look at his face clues in the name is insane his face does the telling his words are but the pressured utterings of a man driven far beyond the edge,reality
everything about fury road makes it one of the best actionpacked movies the cast the insane cinematography and how the movie was edited and the sheer madness of it all tom hardy and charlize theron are insanely good in this movie and they managed to even make me cry this movie is a mustwatch,reality
this is the best action film that ive ever seen i love everything about it the visuals are absolutely stunning and the special effects are up there with the best of the best but what really takes to the next level is its subtlety it uses subtlety in a way that not too many other films can let alone action films sure there is some dialogue that is too blatant in its goal to move the story forward but most of the worldbuilding and plot movement comes not from dialogue but from everything else the allout action the changes in scenery and the characters general demeanor all help shape the world that the movie takes place in and tell the story this is a credit to everyone involved in the film everything is done so well the visuals sound acting directing everything this not just a ridiculous two hour long car chase this is a masterpiece,reality
too much money and overproduction the road warrior was lean mean and tight action classic this is a disney version of it a kiddie movie hope if miller still makes another sequel it will be back to the roots i dont believe that will happen george miller grew up and started avoiding hard violence he should stick to family movies if anything this franchise is dead,reality
when this first came out i had no interest in seeing it because it looked so stupid four years later it is free on hulu and based on high reviews also that i found out it is the original director i thought id give it a shotas others with real reviews have stated it is one long car chase with constant explosions and extreme redickulousness alternatively lot of people seem to love this movie for action and cinematography however the same type of bizarre car getting blown up over and over again is boring also the cinematography is not great it is filmed with ultra dynamic range and there is little contrast most certainly not shot with reds i dont call that good cinematography just a stylized quality that makes it look like a real time rendered video game in fact i would say that the action and camera work is atrocious because they need to rely on many fast cuts to hide none existent practical effectsalso i dont get the premise because it doesnt seem to have anything to do with the from the previous movies this is more like an alternate universe where despite limited resources in a post apocalyptic world there are unlimited resources and has zero resemblance to the original also somebody should have told hardy that he is not playing batman he can speak in a normal voice and not grunt out overly raspy lines they took about 66 of the way through the film to even start with any resemblance of character development and even then there really isnt anyso basically the action is dumb and very very repetitive there is nothing interesting about the characters or dialog and there is no plot at all i mean none at all start driving down the road with a big chase chat a little then turn around with a big chase that is itnow if you think that the avengers is the greatest movie ever made theeeeennn this is right up your alley if you are moderately intelligent then dont do what i did skip this movie for the rest of your life it is not worth watching even once,reality

just go watch the original this movie has absolutely nothing to do with whatsoever if you watched it name one thing you learned about during this entire film that you didnt learn in or the road warrior cant do it thats because the movie mainly focuses on furiosa great cause thats why i go to see a film theres a seen in the movie where says hes gonna go get some supplies and will probably not come back you then see a explosion and coming back with a bunch of ammo wow the one thing i came to see in this movie and it wont even show it to me for people who havent seen it dont you can watch this movie but go watch the original two movies first then watch this you might understand why people are giving this bad reviews some ideas are cool but the movie just loves to spit all over the original fans by constantly destroying the v8 interceptor and give him a double barrel shotgun that doesnt even work great idea insult the fans who came from a good movie fantastic,reality
this movie was one long car chase with a few very few intermittent scenes that i guess were supposed to develop the plot they didnt work well character development was nonexistent the very long list of goofs continuity errors is not surprising it wasnt even generic macaroni and cheese just annoyingly awful,reality
fairly good movie visually and when it comes to stunts the story and a few others flee from a place the villain controls 80 min car chase then they turn around immidiately and kill the villain on the way back 40 min car chase braindead action is a common movie genre not necessarily bad and always with some kind of plot or interesting characters this movie is literally just braindead action  literally imagine watching the grand finale of any action but not the rest of the movie so you got no idea about why things happen or care enough to root for any side this is that for almost two hours,reality
whos he cry the younger generation well i guess hes tom hardy these days however to anyone born back in the seventies and eighties he the titular character was synonymous with a different actor who has since majorly fallen from grace so in short  its a remake but in that most rarest of remake traditions it seems that the general consensus is that its actually pretty good now i was never that into the original films i cant even remember whether theres two or three of them so perhaps im more forgiving and not exactly a purist however perhaps one of the reasons this new version is so well received is that its written and directed by the originals director george millerit follows the same premise ie in a post apocalyptic world or australia as its also known  boom boom gangs rule the deserts and fuel and water are the most rare  and therefore valuable  commodities that people will literally kill for enter one gruff loner or as we later find out whos been surviving on the road all this time on his lonesome however his sort of carefree days of eating lizards and driving a cool car quickly come to an end when hes captured by a gang of those nasties who seem to come to be in every post apocalyptic world weve ever seen on screen so hes tortured and killed and no one lives happily ever after just kidding with the help of a load of other prisoners he escapes and they all go on the run hotly pursued by their psychotic former captors however just because youre on the run from people who want to strap you to the front of a highpowered vehicle and wear your skins for sun block doesnt mean its all bad there are worse people to be on the lamb with than charlize theron unless shes playing aileen phillips from monster i suppose so the pair of them do their best to fend off the constant attacks from the gangs while protecting those who are escaping alongside themi guess if you were to sum up the film and try to pigeonhole it into a genre you could say its an action movie but i think the subgenre of a chase movie is more in order it never really stands still for long and the film is ultimately one long chase across a desert only stopping occasionally to gather a breath or two before everyones off blowing moving vehicles up again and if thats your thing then youre in for a real treat part of the enjoyment of this very simple film is that many of the special effects are real life stunts as opposed to cgi or bluescreen work yes i think there may have been a little bit of the aforementioned effects but its pretty minimal so you really get a feel of the danger the actors or probably stunt people are going throughnot only are the explosions all convincing but the makeup is also really cool and by cool i mean absolutely revolting although it seems that in this dystopian future only bad people are hideously mutated individuals and anyone who needs saving looks like a supermodel from a victorias secret catalogue although to be fair it seems that once a woman stops looking like cindy crawford with slightly less makeup if they still wish to stay on the good guys side they automatically become a hardasnails old crone whos got a heart of gold and a forehead that time forgot anyway thats just me being picky this film is fastpaced fun if you like numerous explosions car chases and general mayhem then go on a road trip with these people and youll see how bad car travel can be  i promise you after seeing what these people have to endure youll never moan again when all you have to do is drive a car with your kids in the back while they constantly ask are we there yet,reality
despite having not seen the old films i was looking forward to this given its 8 rating on imdbafter 20 mins i had suspicions it wasnt quite going to be what i was hoping for however given the reviews i perseveredafter 40 mins i wondered would the film ever calm down a bit and just relaxafter an hour i realised it wouldnt but i hung in their waiting for a great endingit never materialisedthe film is just bonkers it lacks any meaningful story line the beginning of the film barely sets up any kind of plot nor does it properly introduce the characters involved for the first 20 mins i wondered what the hell was going onyou get the gist shortly afterwards however all you get is more of the same and the same and the same for the whole filmi really like the post apocalyptic genre as the directors have so much scope to be creative with back stories however this film has next to no back story at all there are a few cool details to the post apocalyptic world that have been thought up and are to be admired however it doesnt make up for the total lack of a meaningful plotinstead you are treated to an hour and a half of special effects stunts and craziness which all gets very repetitivepersonally i sat through all of it waiting for the film to show me more than just action scene after action scene something a bit more meaningful and interesting it never comesyoull know if you are going to like this film after 20 minutes if you do then great keep watching if not dont stick around expecting anything else youll be bitterly disappointed,reality
watching this film is like stepping into a lurid dime store novel the setting is mostly desert and open road the backdrop changes colors with the mood the action feels spontaneous and inventive as vehicles explode and skinheads fly through the air like acrobats the primary antagonist is a decrepit megalomaniac who monopolizes the water supply and literally milks and breeds women while driving his fanatical minions to selfdestruct to make this all less tawdry his captive wives discover feminism and escape with a butch heroine her posse of old biker chicks and a romantic sap named nux helps guide the lost ladies to their true utopia that in a nutshell is fury road sure theres morecretins with distracting deformities a midget a pregnant woman with an exposed belly etcbut none of it really matters the world and its characters have a pulpy comic book shallowness either you like them or you dont if youre not a fan the fantastic visuals may not be enough to sustain you for two hoursrating based on five factors each worth up to 2 points sound 2 actingcharacterization 05 script 05 visuals 2 concept plottheme 05 total accumulated score 55 rating based on gut feeling 5 average final rating 525,reality

this is not a bad movie in fact it is better than what it could be based on that theme the problem is that the scenario is simply put naive and superficial post apocalyptic mayhem  ok original did it in the first place and it was great for its time acting is not bad and photography is good also still on general terms this movie is two hours long chase with great fx and not much more to it i got really bored watching it after the first halfit really makes me wonder about the 82 rating on imdbif you prefer something with more depth search elsewhere,reality
the first 30 minutes of this film i wondered why so many men would be willing to die chasing this big vehicle i gave up after an hour and just enjoyed the rest of it a fast paced action movie with incredible stunts thats basically what it is entertainment wise if you like lots of action its delivered here a lot if you want character development forget it lots of people trying to compare this with the original and road warrior movies i can see why its a bit like those movies x10 the action and a ton less of dialoguegot 2 hours to kill no pun intended worth a rental but thats about it,reality
dont get with me to the but i was not enthralled at all with fury road george millers redux of his classic 80s franchise was mostly about visual storytelling but there was no true connection with any of the characters mostly the madman himself if you are not familiar with this franchise the film takes place in a dystopian future where eccentric characters set the pave to a divided society tom hardy stars as who is about to be killed in some type of mundane chain to a speeding truck kind of deal when circumstances change he now joins a group of female rebels led by imperator furiosa profoundly played by charlize theron but not to the caliber of oscar nominated dont get furioso with me just my take tom hardy who is one of my favorite actors turns out his worst performance of his career he looked lost and stale throughout the picture however i am still in the tom tom club as a hardy fan hardy har har nicholas hoult was sound as the desperate nux director george millers direction was way over the top and not much could be said of his limited screenplay hey but i did not hate it all together john seales brilliant cinematography got my seal of approval fury road was a road for me that will be less traveled  average,reality
i had very high hopes for especially because of tom hardy playing the lead role but felt greatly disappointed when walking out of the cinema this movie was supposed to be something new and fresh and i thought it would be movie of the year but boy was i wrongi still dont know what the point of the movie was it felt like the writer had a great idea started writing and just went with it wherever it took him there was no real vision and because of that the plot seemed lostusually when a movie is as dark and revolting as the director tries to pull the viewers in by aestheticizing some part of it be it a place or a character nothing about this movie drew me in and i felt disgusted and uncomfortable throughout the whole filmthe reason this movie gets a 7 from me is the decent acting and amazing stuntsfilming it compensates what it doesnt have in quality and depth with intense car chases and fighting scenes that keep the viewer excitedacting 7 plot 6 dialog 5 filming 9 overall feel 6,reality
if youre going to make another film modeling it after road warrior the best of the original three is not a bad movethis film hearkens back to road warrior in that the whole movie is structured around the chase scenes and if you arent into chase scenes youre watching the wrong movie the soupedup vehicles are fabulous mechanisms a hodgepodge of hightech hot rods and neanderthalic sensitivityeven the movies villain immortan joe is reminiscent of road warriors humungousthe problem is tom hardy is not mel gibson pretty much defined the character selfcentered a survivor who approaches life as if he had nothing to lose at the same time a person who is willing to lay down his own life in the pursuit of someones hope for a better lifehardys character utters lines that convey similar meaning but they dont seem to ring true gibson never had to say who he was  it was clear from the getgo hardy comes off as unmotivated almost as if hes reading his lines even though he says his name several times i never believed it hey if he has to tell you hes it means he hasnt been able to convince you of that fact by his actingand where did the bane voice go gibsons was soft spoken a deep rough voice uttering as little as possible hardys whispers with a voice just an octave or two below falsettodont get me wrong i like tom hardy he is certainly one of the upandcoming actors of today but if hardy is in fact signed up for three more films those will likely be three movies i wont be seeing,reality
lets back off a little and look at who did this movie the original director the guy who made all 3 previous movies then he didnt really have much money when he made the first one which is considered a classic and has some nice stunts but has aged badly feeling blown up at times filling time to get to the 90 minutes mark but it was successful enough to make more the second movie was considered to be the best up to this point that is  we have a new king with a queen by his sideso a 70year old man brings you this movie that could and should be played in film schools but dont get it twisted this is entertainment as it should be unless you have a case of macho gone wrong there is nothing you can fault in this the beginning alone almost had me jump up and down with excitement thats 5 minutes into the movie  and more insanity was still to comeif you can fault the movie for one thing its that you dont get as much the character as you got before but it actually makes tom hardys character even more mysterious we dont really know what hes about it does seem to lean a bit on the previous installments character developmentwise if you want it to be  but thats up to the viewer to decide you dont have to have seen the previous movies to get this and even if some things seem inevitable and some might say clich the movie itself is just superb and pure entertainment stunts ideas editing score and more all blend into a very fine movie indeed,reality
in 1979 a bleak and violent film set in a dystopian future was released in australia with a then 23yearold actor named mel columcille gerard gibson as its star we hear that that mel gibson guy did pretty well for himself and his first major film made quite a splash too held the record as the most profitable film in history comparing budget to box office for two decades and spawned sequels in 1982 2 the road warrior and 1985 beyond thunderdome and 30 years later with fury road r 200  and more are planned the franchise has influenced countless dystopian films inspired directors and musicians and become the basis for video games and entertainment properties as diverse as a wcw ppv event and an episode of rugratsmeanwhile the films themselves have gotten bigger bloodier and bleaker the budget for the second film was ten times that of the first and the budget for the 2015 version was fifteen times that of the 1985 version as the series has progressed the bigger budgets have allowed for more spectacular visual effects more elaborate props and more impressive set pieces as well as more violence and the depiction of a steady decline of the human condition in the postapocalyptic world of but after all is said and done the only question that matters is whether the time and money that has gone into fury road was wellspent  and whether we should be looking forward to the sequelsat the beginning of the fourth entry into the franchise tom hardy is still trying to survive alone in a world where civilized society has now completely disappeared hes captured by the war boys an army of young men with painted white skin who believe that their power to fight is enhanced by the blood of other strong men the war boys fight for king immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne who rules his corner of the globe by rationing the only water in the region and he preserves his power through complete control of all available vehicles and the gas needed to run them immortan joe keeps everyone in his realm dependent on him for their very survival and he treats the war boys as his own private army whose loyalty he preserves by promising them an afterlife in valhalla if they die fighting for him besides all that selected men are used as blood banks for his warriors and women are used as breeders and sources of milkin a setting like this it should come as no surprise that a very strong female character is as important to the plot as the title character imperator furiosa charlize theron has escaped the fate of every other female in immortan joes realm by being a tough and smart servant of the king she drives his heavily armored war wagon a vehicle which is designed to carry and protect the gasoline that the war boys help procure from nearby communities furiosa may be considered privileged but she is not happy about her lot in life and she develops a plan to break free from the pack and do some good she turns one of her gas runs into a run for the border if you will furiosa drives her war wagon west toward the place where she was born and stolen away from many years before shes heading to the green place as she calls it but shes also smuggling some of immortan joes most prized possessions in that war wagon when he catches on he pursues her with the help of his regional allies and his own army of war boys one of which is the especially devoted nux nicholas hoult who has chained to the front of his vehicle and connected to him by a rubber tube making into a personal portable blood bank things dont go according to plan for anyone involved and there are multiple violent confrontations among the main characters as they crisscross this vast wasteland in a deadly game of cat and mousefury road creates a world that can be as upsetting as it is fascinating this film is something of an assault on the senses but is a truly engaging experience the action is virtually nonstop while the various design elements and the cinematography are truly remarkable frenetic action and explosions of color are occasionally punctuated with an eerie quiet and practically monochromatic scenes which are beautiful in their simplicity the vehicles weapons and clothing that these futuristic communities have cobbled together from the remains of civilized societys industrial production are both frightening and fascinating to behold and the characters personalities are just as colorful its very clear that has his issues but almost everyone he encounters is madder than he is at times this film is almost too much to take in as it goes somewhat over the top with its action sequences and for lack of a better word with its freakiness but there is no denying that director and cowriter george miller the man who cowrote and directed or codirected all three previous films has brought to the modern screen a unique coherent and engaging postapocalyptic vision which will remain in your head long after you leave the movie theater b,reality
fury road oh fury road eyepopping adrenaline pumping best action movie ive ever seen i thinki wasnt expecting much of it as im not fond of remakes and really love the old trilogy i wasnt aware it was the same director im not fond of brainless blockbusters either and already the trailer told this wasnt gonna be a brainy or profound story i went to the cinema more out of curiosity and boy that was one god decision that is a movie that only works on a giant screen with a blaster sound system and the thing is  this movie doesnt need a scenario it is beyond scenarios and its amazing how you stop looking for things to make sense after two minutes of moviethe aesthetics are gorgeous the characters have style the music is beyond the mind this movie starts extremely fast and then it just goes faster and faster and faster and if you let it reach you you just tag along and it works and you just get dragged through the heated desert the film is one huge action scene everything goes in one fastforwarding flow probably thanks to millers wife margaret sixel doing an awesome job at editing it i would just stare at the screen with wide opened eyes gaping to not miss a thing almost falling from my seat mouth opened in a crooked smile that stammered   whatthef there are a lot of thing that are weird feel weird possibly ridiculous in this movie that literally scream lets do this i want to well just do this because i can its so overthetop that i burst out in laughter a few times but the rhythm is so intense the car chase so fast and everything so bizarre and absurd that you just shake your head laughing incredulously in admiration at such spunk its bad ass its rocknroll its exhilarating and galvanizing its nonsensical and furious and extreme this movie is like playing need for speed on ecstasy its like surfing on a raving wave of fire while blasting a fully loaded kalaschnikov its awesome i absolutely loved it,reality
occasionally films will be criticized for having style over substance with fury road the style is the substance every frame of george millers postapocalyptic epic is rich with detail and a near obsessive level of perfection at first glance the story is minimal although with repeated viewing the many layers to the film become more obviousthe amount of the story you recognize is irrelevant however because this is a spectacle film in its truest form dialogue is minimal yet every action sequence is its own coherent story playing into a larger whole no punch turn or grunt is without consequence or meaning this lends itself to multiple viewings each one revealing more than the lastvisually stunning deceivingly shallow ultimately deep and captivatingfind the biggest tv you can and watch fury road you need to experience it now,reality
my original review for this was written may 31st 2015this movie was incredible and the best that i have seen in my life the visuals were breathtaking as the entire movie acts as a giant action sequence the characters and story were very interesting and i was greatly invested the unique landscapes vehicles costumes and characters add to the sheer greatness that this film has achieved with the lack of both dialogue and slow paced moments this movie gives you little time to breathe as every scene is action packed and intense the acting was tremendous as well as tom hardy and charlize theron shine in their roles as and furiosa the practical effects were combined with digital effects to perfection as miller balances the two to a high degree of effectiveness many films today cannot compare to the critical masterpiece that is this movie but can be inspired to make them surely better and improve i can not praise this movie enough but i will conclude by saying that george miller has proved himself as a cinematic genius with fury road,reality
while some movies tend to put the story over the film making itself graciously offers some of the best filming in the history of action cinema charlize theron completely steals the show becoming the real hero in a movie with a clear feminist message however fury road is first and foremost an action movie that delivers insanely intricate sequences that will totally mesmerize the viewer after so many years it is really praiseworthy that director george miller managed to pull off such a wellrounded sequel to the original trilogy even more considering that fury road doesnt have anything in common with the original three movie other than the theme and even that can be discussed hardys doesnt talk that much and the budget for fury road was way higher than that of any of its prequels oh what a day what a lovely day,reality
fury road has reinvented the modern action genre in ways nobody truly saw coming its wonderful how refreshing the practical stunts character development amidst the action sequences and feminist overtones the film has to offer its what ive been waiting for from the action genre an open minded film that pulls all the stops isnt misogynistic where the danger feels real and an unsurpassed amount of visual kinetic energy on the screengeorge miller has given us the finest blockbuster of 2015 thus far fair and square no superficial cgi robots no cgied explosions no halfhearted performances just fully realized relentless excitement that has been long overdue this year the cars are all really on screen the motorcycles are properly on the screen the stunts are actually happening and the beautifully desolate landscape in the film is real i cant think of a more honestly practical blockbuster than fury road from this year its just so well done and gorgeousa modern classic sure to be remembered for many years to come,reality
fury road 90this film is totally epic awesome actionfilled spectacular funfilled adventure ride of the summer right now this is the best film ive seen in 2015 director george miller just proved the practical effects can be very much better than cgi you werent distracted at all from explosions or vehicles that looked like they were pulled from a video game cgi works in some cases and can be just as artful but when stunts are done for real it is a much better experience except the few cgi things that stuck out terribly miller also kept all the movements and the actors actions all very easy to follow so it wasnt such a mess all the actors were great in this like many have said before played by tom hardy is barely the main character as his costar charlize therons furiousa is the most badass person in the film everything that was put into the action sequences the stunts the practical effects the great editing the directors direction the actors and sheer epicness make this such an intense film this film had such an awesome gorgeous look to it like the scenery color and overall cinematography overall great awesome film intense new and not sloppy fury road is the best action film of the year,reality
what a damn good movie this was one of the best action movies in the last few years this movie was a crazy fun wild ride all the way few these types of movies dont come often so seeing this was just god my lord it was good the movie had some very strong themes of women which is awesome to see in movies like this were women are only seen as objects mostly this movie should and better win a oscar for something special effects costume hell even for best movie of the year if i had a say in the oscars this movie i thought was going to be a disaster but the way the action scenes were directed was great most of all the was little to no shaky cam which was great woo this move gets 9 out of 10 since still not movie is perfect and there always room for improvement,reality
i realize im writing this movie multiple months after its release however for those still on the fence about purchasing this via dvd on the first of september im here to help this movie was one of the most incredible films ive seen this year aside from the man from uncle this movie ranked highly on my personal favorites list tom hardy is one of my personal favorite actors and like the majority of his films this one was extraordinary the old lacked something this one put together with multiple action scenes a thoughtful plot and a superb cast this film notched all the checks for me to me tom hardy charlize theron and nicholas hoult played their roles to perfection if you want to purchase a movie well worth your time and the likely 2030 price range this is it i highly recommend this movie rating i give this movie an 8510 and i was constantly entertained when watching it age even though this movie is rated r i would say 15 for this film purely because of intense violent scenes verdict this movie was an adventure from start to finish and i would definitely recommend this film,reality
my name is trembles the opening scene of fury road and that is about as much exposition as you will get a few sound bites hinting at a nuclear wasteland and a harsh voiceover establishing the persona of the title character tell us plenty yet the film could even do without those the two headed lizard that chews hints at both these without being too overt and there is subtext without need for a immediate answer in the ghostly whispers of deceased daughter and wife george millers post apocalyptic world is immediately engaging with barely any expository dialogue or explanation its a film buzzing with strong imagery mythology and mood that elevates it beyond pure action the production design is spectacular in particular the art design of the various vehicles of the barren wasteland that run on the precious guzzoline theres battered falcon coupes a huge double reared gigahorse a merlin v8 adorned with caterpillar tank tracks buzzards covered in spikes a doofwagon entirely for serenading the warriors on the brink of eternity in valhalla and the centrepiece furiosas immense war rig which hums with as much rhythm and intensity as the many action spectacles of the film its reminiscent of the equally menacing vehicles in 2008s death race but whereas those racecars embellished with machine guns and missiles feel like a juvenile fantasy within a futuristic dystopia feel more like an organic result of a desperate society and a crazed leader death race like most post apocalyptic films is awash in muted and gritty grays and provides an excess of eye candy in female assistants for the racers is visually vibrant in a genre where this is out of place as designated by miller and cinematographer john seale overseeing a post production process to digitally ramp up the highly saturated landscape of reds oranges and ochres the night scenes were actually shot during the day then washed in murky and atmospheric blues theres no gender imbalance even though a post apocalyptic setting might suggest one and even though 2 of the wives are portrayed by supermodels  the wives and furiosa are given as much weight and agency as any of the characters as are the females of the vuvalini clan again the valkyrie portrayed by a supermodel but the point is never objectives them thats half of what draws you into the world of  the other is the mixture of norse and mechanically derived religion which brainwashes the horde of war boys and pups at immortan joes command kamikazelike attacks promise an eternity of feasting with heroes in valhalla referred to as a second life i live i die i live again joe sprays a shiny mouthful of chrome paint and inexplicably nux rushes off with anticipation of the other life imploring others to witness his sacrifice its all absolutely absurd but it works because in addition to all the other fantastical elements of the aged future doesnt overreach in setting premise or stakes its a tightly confined narrative which rides on its action sequences instead of trying to overpower them with tangents of emotional catharsis one glaring exemption is the slightly ridiculous scene where furiosa collapses silently on her knees when hearing of the greenlands demise simply is one long car chase that reaches a wide expanse of salt flats formerly the ocean and turns around for the same thing the sequences of carcombat and sabotage are tightly edited and shot frenetic without allowing for excessive shakycam or jarring rapid cuts seale centres the action squarely within the middle of the frame which makes the spectacular choreography all the more thrilling and easy to eye trace they are brimming with rhythm and character interest as the vuvalini clan fit seamlessly into the scene with an air of competency yet desperation as the setting decides one man one bullet they are accompanied by the doof warrior guitarist and several drummers which make up key areas of the soundtrack the percussions builds in intensity with each beat with a gritty distorted electronic twistmiller touches the grotesque and absurd without ever having to expand or explain theres the complicated breathing apparatus and armour pieces immortan joe dons as he addresses the people of the citadel as their saviour theres his stunted disabled son wheeled around in a chair and his equally imperfect brother rictus the paragon of imposing strength and brutality there are curiously malformed creatures upon stilts in the wet marshland formerly the green pastures of life and freedom for furiosa doesnt just suspend your disbelief it actively seizes your gaze,reality
the people who vote this best action movie of the decade poorly dont understand the art of cinematography and the concept of the film first this is an action movie and not a drama with focus on relationship and character development netherless the playacts of charlize theron nicholas hout and tom hardy are really good second this film is in many aspects masterclass and you can see the ingenuity in cut camera props scene selection appropriate musicchoice i daresay this as a semiprofessional cutter third the actionstunts show sense for humour and are creative i cant remember another film in short time except gravity where i forget to breathei suppose some of the haters are aranged from the envious filmbusiness competition some of them hate films with strong women some opinions seem plain and conservative some hate action movies and some of them want attract attention for a negative rating this is truly not fair the first and presumably one and only film 2015 which will stay in mind 1010,reality
many modern action films suffer from the same boring dull monotone action scenes that only succeed in cluttering the screen with obvious stunt doubles blinding lens flare and excessive explosions classic action films are often just that classic they may be fondly remembered for their originality but they may be quite clichd and fail to be as exciting as they intend the trilogy may fall into the latter with some debate fury road however will always be remembered as one of the greatest action movies of all timei was relatively fond of 1979 and greatly enjoyed 2 the road warrior 1981 due to its crude humor dynamic characters and action packed car chases beyond thunderdome 1985 was not great but not terrible either now for the reboot i am generally skeptical of rebooting a series so i entered the cinema with caution fury road 2015 presented a dedicated director george miller who fronted all of the original films two outstanding lead actors in tom hardy and charlize theron and thirty years between its release and that of its predecessors so this movie had everything going for itthe beauty of the this film is all over from the fantastic camera angles the gorgeous landscapes that while desolate manage to create an incredible image throughout the film the gradea performances by the cast specifically the two leads and the nonstop action perhaps the greatest part of this film is its simplicity the entirety of the movie is a chase from point a to point b then back to a againperhaps the two aspects of the films that will deservingly receive the highest amounts of praise are the acting and the action tom hardy performs perfectly as a mostly silent somewhat antihero charlize theron delivers one of the best performances of her fantastic career and steals the show from the main character the entire films deals with jaw dropping car chases and action sequences which only pause for brief moments as the characters and the audience recoverthis film shows the public what action movies are supposed to be and no one should deprive themselves of seeing this masterpiece i cannot stress enough that if you have a chance to see this film take it in eightyfive years when humanity looks back on the great films of the last century and they stumble to action a noble few will come from the first fifteen years they will include fury road,reality
i am utterly amazed at those that claim to hate the movie i guess i should say people just walk around nowadays to hate stuff because i honestly wasnt expecting the kind of thrill i got it is an action packed blockbuster movie not drama scifi or thriller simply action packed if you got bored your life probably be in a night club or war torn region for start to finish my love grew the problem with other action movies of these type is too much dialogue unnecessary clichs and horrible progression you cant fault this movie for any of the three what amazes me is i couldnt pick my favorite actor or actress as tom charlize and nicolas brought their a games to this while this isnt toms best ever movie he retains his ever high standard of intriguing acting that just has me wish to meet him personally for refreshing the action movie genre you want to diss a movie dis transformers or something this right here is the only i want to remember in 3d awesome,reality
original reviewits got the feel of the original series with a renewed energy the world has changed but the overriding theme remains survivein this reboot we follow the story of a drifter with nothing to lose and a woman looking for a way out both main characters are quite relatable and stand out in a fictional world much different and offputting than any other the disturbing imagery takes away your comfort and the action sequences drag on as the film wanes but the beautiful desert landscapes and score by junkie xl help glide the movie the story was surprisingly heartfelt with a great performance from nicholas hoult and a surprising one from rosie huntingtonwhiteleyas a newfound fan of the road warrior this was disappointing it is a decent road trip film but i expect it to improve upon a mandatory rewatchupon rewatchtom hardy may have ruined the film his occasional low growls and general lack of emotion certainly do not make him likable nor do they make him an interesting supporting character the way was written for this movie makes me question whether this can even be considered a film that flashbacks that should add depth to his character do nothing but confuse,reality
a lot of advertisement bunch of trailers and for sure not least famous title i would not say that i expected something with a deep meaning or thoughts but for sure not 3040 minutes of racing on cars in a desert with screams and shootings from the beginning enormous explosions and looking of last heaven place on a planet for sure there are must be all of this but not so much nevertheless sorry but i am already grown up and i do not want to see what i watched when i was a teenager i mean i liked 19791985 the book of eli 2010 waterworld 1995 doomsday 2008 etc  but it was long time ago and i am not brennan or dale from the movie step brothers 2008,reality
all core elements of modern day filmmaking and oldschool techniques can be summed up in fury roada movie with sans exposition dialogue is a rarity and the proof is in the pudding with multiple award nominations and finally a victory with six technical oscarsthe much criticized lack of storytelling is covered in the visuals and one must realize it may take a couple of viewings to truly grasp a modern masterpiecegeorge millers stroke of genius is sincerely adulated by manythank you george for a great cinematic experience,reality
fury road is apocalypse wow the fact that its a fuelinjected adrenaline rush as well as a thoughtful surprisingly moving film is a combination that makes this fiery blockbuster one of the very best of the genrethe film starts off with a shot reminiscent of the road warrior with our eponymous hero rockatansky tom hardy looking away at the desolate wasteland of his shattered world and then it just goes berserk gets himself captured by the underlings of the citadel a kingdom high inside a lone tower of rock at the citadel chaos reigns among a starving citizenry at the mercy of a mutated leader known as immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne a halloween horror of a man outfitted with protective gear and a gruesome breathing apparatus we meet his musclebound security team and his war boys  a group of tumorladen dying soldiers who fight for him in belief that afterlife glories await from their sacrifices their present task is sending a big rig to a place called gastown to fill up with 3000 gallons of that most precious commodity outside of water but when one of joes lieutenants imperator furiosa a shavenheaded charlize theron takes the truck on a detour with precious cargo  the leaders five wives one of whom is pregnant with a view to break them free of joes despotic shackles  the chase is on with warparty vehicles in pursuit and our titular hero as a captive on one of these vehicles bests his captors and reluctantly unites with furiosa and her company of oppressed females as far as plot goes thats about it fury road moves at a frenetic pace from beginning to end offering brief respites where the viewers can catch their breath to prepare for the next jawdropping sequence now visualize this image a pair of 1959 cadillacs welded together or a vintage plymouth valiant accessorized with tank treads and all of them are militarized men and women vaulting from one vehicle to another climbing giant flexible poles planted in the rear in a frantic orgy of speed and skillthe key to making this all work is in having original director george miller back for another ride he returns to the postapocalyptic wasteland almost three decades later and its like hes never been away bringing a spry outlook to his burgeoning vision on paper the movie is one extended chase a highoctane race through desolate desert and narrow canyons raging to the tune of composer junkie xls pounding soundtrack but miller frames the trek with impeccable attention to detail the editing is never hasty or disorienting even at top speeds the movie brings riveting clarity to each ambush and narrow escape going against the grain of digitized sensation much of what we view is actually happening staged for the camera with incredible choreographic energy and the cinematography does the unfathomable it gives pulsating life to a barren desert the most unattractive of movie settings of the cast tom hardys note perfect as giving a nononsense performance eloquent in its silences but the films real emotional core is charlize therons gimleteyed furiosa scarred by her warriors life and bent on redemption sporting a cgi mechanical arm face paint and a permastern expression theron makes for one badass rebelfury road is an act of defiance  a rage against the mindless blockbuster made today it is visceral taut insightful engrossing intricate meticulous and above all else driven by a creative spirit that sees the material from a space of undaunted enthusiasm,reality
without any doubt visually this movie is one of the best productions in this 2015 intense and colorful action scenes with excellent effects and a very interesting storyline far beyond an simple dystopia like conceptual framework tom hardy plays a perfect with a profound feeling for his lost family and charlize theron simply is a excellent and emotionally perfect furiosa is an ex highway patrolman maybe its necessary to say here that the correspondent audience should know this due to its the substance of the movie no drama scenes were required all sensations and emotions were gave in a perfect measure in a futuristic world where there is no place for crying and laments,reality
this movie isnt canonically a movie and thats not bad it is magnificent it has a good premise great acting and a lot of topics to tackle post apocalyptic world cult dynamics gender issues personal redemption and it tackles them all quite well at a lot of times i forgot that i was watching a movie or even an action movie till the well crafted explosions reminded me the story isnt quite new but well made and serves the events right the issues presented at the movie are quite great and it made me ponder a lot into a lot of issues deep and profound ones the stunts and visual effects are great it could have used some more mundane tasks drama eg resource managementetc but that never seemed to be quite a hindering point to the movie,reality

fury road 2015 is probably one of the best remakes that has come out in the last year ive always been a fan of the original movies and of course i was very skeptical of seeing this the only thing that made me consider watching the movie and give it the chance was that charlize theron was in it she is an excellent actress from the minute this movie starts it is none stop action through more than half of the movie where it then begins to go over more of the story after a few minutes of going over some more of the story it is balls to the wall action all the way to the end amazing remakethe graphics and acting were extremely well done,reality
this movie is awesome i bet youre gonna enjoy it from the beginning till the end hardy is perfect as others did well too its a must watch for everyone the plot is great  i hope they continue this franchise i dont know why people are complaining come on what else do you expect its almost perfect movie i just loved this movie intense action from start to finish and didnt slow down at all that made it ridiculously fun to watch the great characters and the performances are awesome on screen and were always interesting to watch if there was ever a twisted metal movie this is what it would be nothing really let the film down and everything really worked such a great time and the best cinema experience this year so far,reality
george millers return to is  who would have expected  a great feminist filmthe landscape is unrelieved aridity and machinery the dryness of the sterile male the monster machines are technology without humanity so they represent male power at its worst the horde of pale bald humans connote another kind of sterility the mens only skin growth are boils and tattoos hence the evil kingpins obsessive pride in having impregnated one of his breeders and his determination to recover the harem when they are swept off by imperator furiosa charlize theron the ruler is a pustular ruin whos encased in a shell of medals and plastic armour to conceal his venereal decay he survives on a breathing machine he monopolizes the water and doles out occasional spates to keep his subjects dry enslaved and grateful awed by his pretence to immortality that imperator will disprovethe tyrants son ritcus erectus bears another name redolent of futile macho power as he celebrates his stillborn baby brother perfect in every way  but dead the societys emblem is a stark grinning skulltheron plays the heroine bald and flatchested eschewing the conventional heroines beauties the women she saves are young insecure their nipples outlined flat behind the white wisps they wear in contrast the tyrants production line of milking mothers are swollen grotesques in a world sans water the characters live on mothers milk a reminder of the  but here abused  natural primacy of the feminine as the heroines name suggests she is both angry and driven  an imperative fury her characters name provides the films subtitle the narrative road is the womans fury she is enraged at the male power that reduces woman to milking machine and breeder there is no indication of sexual pleasure except for the one girls loving caress of the reformed thug imperator resolves to save what girls she can from their strictly reproductive servicehero rockatansky tom hardy is imum hardrock but he starts imprisoned both caged by the villains and boxed in by the trauma of having failed to save his wife and child a few films ago his fights with imperator are even as their relationship grows away from their initial distrust and violence there is not a single word of sentiment or romance necessity breeds a tentative trust which eventually grows to include his initial enemy nux the film ends with the hero and heroine exchanging a wordless nod across the distance between her settling in as new ruler of the citadel a reference to the brutish male military academy and his disappearance in the crowd off to seek his own solitary redemption miller eschews their romantic coupling because these women dont need to depend on men imperators home community may have lost the green and richness she remembers from childhood but its women are tough competent survivors the oldest carries a satchel of seeds that will bring a new fertility to the blowing sands once imperator frees the water the first ruler hoarded of course this is a very violent loud sensational film but at its heart is the reminder of the feminine upon which our species survival is far more dependent than upon male power that lesson justifies this sensational fable  and compels us to overlook its pervasive improbabilities the characters survival without food and water the monster technology they have somehow managed to construct postapocalypse and the characters rebounding from such violent assaults its a fable a feminist fable nestled within the strut of macho blockbuster so washes a killed foes blood off his face with mothers milk our feminine is the great cleanser,reality
its a pure cinemastory and emotions are carried by pictures and sounds not just another chatter box movie the other awesome aspect of movie is the very proper using of 3dit really helped and improved the movie and the director used it very smart to increase the tension of sequences by making it bold step by step characters were great specially female characters not a beautiful sexy trophy for the male hero but an independent smart focused and hardworking humans very rare these days in movies the custom and set were designed so good and believable the cg scenes were well crafted as well and they hesitate to use it in every shot most of scenes were based on stunt master workstotally recommend to watch this movie and watch it 3d,reality
i had heard a lot of good things about fury road prior to going to the theater still i only had rather modest expectations after walking out of the theater i could not immediately understand what kind of epic i had just watched fury road was simply put a masterpiece on so many levels that it singlehandedly reignited my hope in the moviemaking skills of hollywood directorswhere do i even start the first 30 minutes were perhaps a bit boring for me but after that i was completely glued to the seat for the rest of the movie and wow was the most common thought in my head perhaps it would make sense to start with charlize therons performance she was simply fantastic and captured the badass attitude of the character as well as her deep pain and longing for freedom perfectly even though its in principle an action movie she deserves an oscar nominationthe plot wasnt really that relevant in this movie i felt that george miller finally had the tools to create the kind of postapocalyptic world he had always envisioned and what a beautiful world it was on top of that the music score was awesome as well when i got home i immediately started listening to the fury road soundtrack i could go on and on but ill just end this review by saying if you have not seen fury road you absolutely must see it i have watched a lot of movies from all genres and on my list fury road belongs to the the top 10 it is such an exhilarating masterpiece that i might not bother to see any other movies this year  which movie could possibly surpass it,reality
i was having an absolutely horrible day when my friends asked me to go see this movie i wont go into details but it was badthe acting and explosions and everything else was so good that i almost forgot about my problems this movie is the essence of what good movies should be fun and unpredictable very loud very exciting and very fresh right when you think you have it figured out something unexpected happens and leaves you wanting more i had never seen an movie before this one yet i enjoyed it completely and was able to follow alonghighly recommend this to anyone and even more so if you like action as this movie has nonstop action,reality
truly incredible  that sums it up rather well if you are looking for a film about 90 action and 10 other stuff  this is the film for you it was truly action packed  from start to finish i couldnt take my eyes off of the screen and the story is so simple yet so effective being i imagine one of the younger viewers it didnt matter that i couldnt really remember seeing the first few films this brought them to a whole new level anyway i didnt view this film in 3d but am so keen to go back and see it again and not make the mistake of 2d next time  dont get me wrong the 2d was brilliant but there was obvious moments made for the 3d and with all the explosions and madness in the film i think it would work extremely well unless it motion blurs then youre screwed to see anything ,reality
i watched fury road and avengers 2 within a week of each other and the difference was like night and day fury road is an exemplar of what action movies ought to be like and avengers 2 is an exemplar of what theyre like instead id written off action movies completely because of the trend toward rollercoasterride visual spectacles with huge displays of senseless violence and asinine plots im glad i took a chance on fury road because i got the exact oppositethe balance of show and tell in fury road is just about perfect miller does a fantastic job as always portraying a livedin world where we dont need to have the intricacies explained to us in order to make sense of them the plot is a bit thin but its also straightforward and makes sense the titular wanderer blows into town just as he did in 2 and 3 bringing just enough motivation to get him embroiled in the sympatheticgroupoftheweeks struggles with the villainoftheweek anyone who thinks role in this was too small ought to consider it in the context of the formula established by the earlier movieswhere most contemporary action movies rest on spectacle however fury road takes its cue from the better action movies of the seventies and eighties spectacle is certainly an important element of the movie but every blow matters every fight carries a serious risk of wounding or killing a character or causing permanent damage to the escaping war rig the action centers on the villains forces are visibly depleted over the course of the movie in stark contrast to the endless waves of throwaway henchmen in movies such as avengers 2 where weve been trained to accept throwntogether plots that simply give a context to action scenes fury road gives us a plot completely interwoven with the action scenes that drive itthe practical effects were a breath of fresh air from an industry infatuated with cgi the visual design was imaginative and entertaining and the actors fit their roles wonderfully but all of those factors are simply bonuses the real strength of fury road is that it shows that action movies do not have to be monotonous you do not have to turn your brain off to enjoy a good action movie and it is not nitpicking to criticize the plot of a summer blockbuster fury road is what action movies ought to be like and we do not have to accept what weve been shoveled instead for the past two decadesas an aside apparently some people didnt like the movie because they perceived the message as feminist some other people say youre wrong its not feminist at all and therefore its acceptable im not going to bother addressing that point because if you avoid watching movies because they might promote equality between the sexes then you and i have no common ground,reality
i guess you could say my interest in movies is nonexistent at 55 ive never seen any of the previous ones even though i watched my share of movies during the vhs years of which the original was a breakout hit so why now am i not only watching a madmovie but reviewing it simply because im guessing there are others not unlike mei like a good action movie or scifi flick and often watch ones i feel are overambitious ending up flat especially some that require total belief suspension which are in my opinion harder to pull off with that in mind i wouldnt have desired to see the latest movie as i had nothing invested in the franchise previously what changed my mind is i kept hearing on multiple tv shows positive diatribes on the movie after decades of being immune i broke you know what i really enjoyed itthis is pure movie making because the story isnt at all creative or really even compelling the acting isnt anything special either though i realize some probably differ in my opinion what is special is the sum of dramatic local vistas unique characters brought to life and a constant pummeling action that hardly lets up this is what makes the movie so edgy and fun to watch heres some writers who found the right director and cinematographer to make a completely unbelievable storyline work due to handin glove synergism the props are offthehook as if someones drugaddled imagination came to life on the screen i didnt feel i was dumbeddown either as i watched this its a kind of grand steampunk industrial art movie discussed as a an action movie so here i am telling you other resisters to break down and go see a movie id never thought id even want to see thats excellent movie making,reality
fury road is really entertaining intense and mindblowing film that youll surely gonna like it i watched this film with my sister and we really did enjoyed this movie it has an amazing acting of the actors with great effects of the scenes in the movie that are truly fascinating definitely madness all over the film this is one of those action packed films that ill surely remember because of the amazing cast that deliver great performances with their role on the movie esp charlize theron and nicholas hoults character which i enjoyed watching in this film when this movie has its dvd release ill also going to watch it because this is really one of those great action packed films that i also recommend for you to see,reality
1010 should speak for itself brilliant raw beautiful brutal movie from beginning to end and a breath of fresh air from marvel action fury road is a testament to every classic film that came before making you want to watch them again  this gem even more a classic this will become in itself i look forward to more of our new journey but will be happy having been able to experience at least this journey if it is to be the last beyond thunderdome left fans wanting more i never felt like it had left as satisfying an ending as it could have had such as our recent batman deserved this renewal or even this ending tom hardy is just as mel gibson had been and would have continued had so much time not passed this feels like a continuation of excellence everyone else was perfectly placed and george miller did it again maybe even better thank you,reality
i love how furiosa charlize theron has turned a crappy sks into sniping rifle the sks doesnt have a method for attaching a scope naturally so youd need to find a mod that replaces some of the parts all mods out there today are fairly unstable and typically garbage in other words i wouldnt recommend trying to scope an sks this simple touch gives the movie a more realistic feel in that they need to take whatever they can find and make it work bravootherwise this movie is already a classic for me its right up there with blade runner theres far too much depth detail and room to let your imagination fill in the blanks to think otherwisei hope they continue to film these in africa the environments seemed much more functional to the story,reality
as i have said in the summary it is a really good movie specifically a really good action movie everybody enjoys an action movie every now and then but you could watch with practically any humor even if the plot is almost nonexistent it has enough elements to make a consistent and amusing movie the direction is magnificent and the camera games perfect despite being a very moving film it never gets you dizzy and always maintains your attention you could describe the film as a postapocalyptic dieselpunk road duh movie or just as an amazing and big persecution with an odd atmosphere but the interesting thing is that with that kind of atmosphere most of the movies would look ridiculous but not this one and that is thanks to george millers excellent labor and to an appropriate use of fx technologies im really not a fan of the original movies or remakes but this film has showed me not to prejudge tom hardy has been an excellent choice to the leading role and it has been a really nice touch to have hugh keaysbyrne again as the bad guy i recommend to watch it in the biggest loudest greatest cinema you could afford,reality
fury road brings jawdropping dystopian landscapes and you gotta hand it to the people who dreamed them up the first storm sequence of the movie which furiosa enters on the large gasoline truck is just wow this movie is about a very grim future but boy does it look great hope hasnt looked so good and despair so sickening therons furiosa is a driven individual with hope hope for a home where she was born the land of the mothers she is one of the prize breeders of immortan joe in fact all women have been reduced to just that in this world furiosa escapes with the rest of joes prize breeders and we get this chase of a movie i personally favor movies with cgi that blends with the environment so much so that it doesnt look like cgi anymore and fury road achieves that and i love it good performances all around also help hugh keaysbyrnes immortan joe is adequate and played with appropriate fury therons furiosa drives the movie and the parts that she doesnt tom hardys and nicholas hoults nux take up the job overall a great movie definitely worth a watch,reality
while not reaching the dizzy dystopian heights of the road warrior this film at least does not have the uneven quality or the naked sentiment of beyond thunderdome so in a sense this new film from george miller has saved the series  it wasnt right for to end on a bad note ive heard one person say its too bad mel gibson couldnt be in it but only one person most people i think recognize that his presence would only have complicated things besides which tom hardy is arguably better in the role than gibson ever was hes much more adept at disappearing into the role and portraying as somebody who rather than imposing his will on his environment rolls with whatever is happening to him and tries to adapt and survive i halfway think that the reason george miller waited so long to make this film is that he wanted gibson to be too old so that he wouldnt be criticized for replacing him i know that i wasnt supposed to take the film totally seriously but the whole carnivalheavy metal aspect of the villains was just too much for me to take apparently when the apocalypse happened a bunch of head bangers as we used to call them got together and decided to create a new society based on the lyrics to slayer and metallica songs everybody knows that its absolutely essential in the post apocalyptic environment to have your flaming guitar player with you when you set out on a desperate mission cant leave him at home to me the presence of these silly elements does detract somewhat from the films themes of survival and dignity in the midst of social disintegration my other problem with the movie is the aggressive way that miller used the flashbacks to the deadendangered child the road warrior stands alone without much reference to his family or to anything that happened in the first film  so why did miller andor his writers think it was so important for this film to constantly refer back to the dead family the dialogue about redemption was heavy handed and literal for every problem there are a half dozen excellent and fun things about the movie so i am recommending it to people but i would say its not as good as the first two films i loved the earth mamas on their bikes one bullet one man  oddly enough they reminded me of esme cordelia hoggett in babe pig in the city kicking ass and rescuing the farm a lot of people criticized miller actually for leaving father hoggett on the farm to be rescued by his wife  i think it showed the feminist streak that manifested in this movie and lead to even wider criticism of miller im pretty sure from where hes sitting with this film raking in dough around the world hes not too concerned with what a bunch of socalled mens rights activists think about the film hes a subversive guy and for the most part he knows how to challenge our preconceptions and our expectations just enough to leave everybody happy the mixture of craziness sentiment and thematic force are just about right here,reality
only for the guilty pleasure to watch charlize theron in her own juices this movie is worth its heavy amount of  of course the new is a little short of the real watermarked madness of his former actor mel gibson for the total greenhorns and the orange touch of a film undoubtedly touched again by the digital graphic pallet hurts sometimes its vision and also let us say the quite clear for the continuity of a story somehow complexdevotee of the very first for a very long time i have to admit all the same that i was amazed rather by a narrative which stand up straight most of the time cart about somehow or other towards the number third of the franchise otherwise by being completely for its height i named beyond thunderdome obviously the end which is tinged with a mormon and puritanism spirit will not please to everybody but this aftereffect fights well as a new one ben hur seen again and corrected and his savages have at least the advantage to be truer than truedo not miss the bad appearance of the dictatorial head immortan joe a very successful miserable just like his harem and also this decerebrate guitarist beating time measure during the gimmick of this nth epic of rockatanskythus let us wish that george miller soon frees his hero  from a pure entertainment in the shape of blockbuster a little too much bounded to the commercial imperatives  towards a number 5 in which we shall find maybe inside the insane ultraviolence of a very inflexible censorship had condemned formerly for a long time,reality
wow man this movie was excellent this movie was so good it felt so different from all of the other movies because of how better this was compared to those other crappy ones i mean 2 is second place then 1 then thunderdome the script was amazing and the cast was amazing just everything was amazing and sooo superb this felt like a proper solid movie the soundtrack is incredible and so is the story now it dosent really feel like the title should have been named after as i felt like he wasnt the main character rather i feel like all pf the characters were the main characters as they all played their part in the story and also didnt really say much so that was kind of weird it should have just been called fury road but i mean hey the movies good so thats all that counts i also felt like some parts of the story was wacky like the whole baby milk thing but its so there has to be some weird villain with weird things that he runs i cant wait for wasteland p,reality
has a gripping atmosphere a break neck speed pace astounding visuals is exciting from start to finish and has stylistic directing what more could you want,reality
this is my first experience of the franchise and had much to learn about its story this movie taught me all i needed to know and its a bizarre world full of character and stunning imagery its a strange movie but one that keeps up an impeccable pace and is full of brutal action really the whole movie feels like one massive racing scene and on reflection not much happens but the full 2 hours is a fully entertaining adrenaline rush im positive this is a movie which can be enjoyed by all due to its unique style and extensive entertainment value,reality
i watched this for the second time yesterday and it was as satisfying as the first time fury road is a little masterpiece for those asking why my rate is just 8 i think that higher ratings should be reserved to eradefining movies and suchim not a fan of action flicks nor i am of the series but this is a jewel in film making here are some notes1 action action action fury road is an adrenaline bomb from start to finish while as i stated im not fond of action itself when a movie keeps you on the edge for two hours i like it the problem with most action movies is that you have seen it all before more or less in fury road 90 of the action is something new funny over the top superfast acrobatic and surprising its obvious that the sequences are written with sincere passion rather than with that lets stun the audience with special effects and milk their money mood thats ever increasing nowadays2 while the photography deserves a mention itself for the oversaturated colors and the beautiful landscapes the most important aspect about it is the action again photography is in service of action and it does a wonderful job lots of scenes have a weird fast framerate that gives the movie a distinctive funny and obviously speedy look dozen of takes filming the explosions are made through oldfashioned fixed cameras mounted on the vehicles so that youre thrown into the action for real  not like in todays movies where odd and complicated digital camera movements take away all the emotions3 the story its original and surprising something of a move on from the same old tropes it starts and ends in an oldfashioned way because it has to stay in its roots but all whats in between is absolutely fresh characters are funny deep and all enjoy their personal arc4 himself tom hardy is a great replacement and ill say hes even better than mel gibson or something more on pace with the times his grunts short lines and facial expressions often subtly ironic are just perfect ill also add that the rough sharp way he moves and walk is a subtle and perfect rendering of that character a man whose only goal is to survive5 the design of sets costumes and cars beautiful6 the oldfashioned way practical effects little cgi and the old way of shooting as i mentioned its definitely better7 the last and most compelling aspect of this movie in my opinion is that its totally over the top exaggerated characters sequences and language blood bag witness me shiny and chrome the guitar player the models the fight with the car door the gun wielding blind man everything in this movie is just i like this a lot its some kind of postmodern pulpish cinemaedit i watched it for the third time and id like to add8 its built like a comic book really and i like this very much the three villains are straight from a comic book in their characterization lots of sequences are edited like comics with interconnected shots and wide angles opening and closing them some obscure details like the missing shoe the jacket the bulletteeth and so on get their brief screen time and help build the sequences thats another thing you find in comics,reality
there is no way to make this film better one of the best from 2015 and one of the greatest action movies of all time on top of that hardy and theron are absolutely badass and their chase through the desert wasteland created some of the best action ever on film amazing stunt work and actors do great with relatively little dialogue this movie will never get old,reality
one of a kind action film i dont see any filmmaker beating this returns in a film that ramps up the action to unprecedented levels and resurrects a dormant franchise miller has grown as a filmmaker and another visit to is overdue yet again great film and a worthy addition to the franchise,reality
easily one of the greatest films of all time fury road is a joy ride from start to finish despite the minimal dialogue in the film the glorious cinematography and score will keep you entertained throughout like every film minor gaffes appear but that does not take away from the solid plot and action packed sequences that occur the best part about this film is that it only gets better just when you think the best has already happened,reality
now this is what entertainment let alone films is supposed to be this film was everything i hoped snorting a few rails and driving over a 1km long lineup of movie extras with a large meatgrinder strapped to the front of my truck would be the audiences in both the theatres i saw this in were literally on their feet cheering in parts there simply are not enough films of this caliber and i would love to see a great plenty more from these geniuses,reality
my dick can only get so hard it just grabs you by the balls and makes you grow a mustache by the end of it,reality
absolutely speechless about this movieaction masterpiecego and watch it now,reality
first of all i must say that i am a fan of both the decline of its social ecosystem and the artistic aesthetics of each of the films fury road clearly try to be part of that postapocalyptic ecosystem but the great disappointment is in the poor development of the characters if not because everyone knows that tom hardy is could perfectly be a character surviving a poor script  a full of visions but without personality or history or humor two hours of chase with stuntmen jumping from one truck to another and many faces painted white are not enough to convince us that we are watching 4 or are simply selling us a trailer for the next 5 alredy announcedit is not a bad action film just look at the nominations and awards but it is not it has no history or the little history that surrounds imperator furiosa charlize theron does not catch it is surprising that having miller as director the focus has been lost so widely,reality
a real pity that such a huge and epic saga with so amazing resources came out that empty the film is soulless the argument is pretty bold my sensation was that they invested and bet in the visual aspect which is great by the way and in the constant action scenes which ive found too long leaving the story completely aside another issue that not many people realize is the music score which for me is very important in this film just didnt glue with the dynamic of the gesture the lack of development of the bad guy character who had a lot of potentials was also not exploited as it couldi did love the production design the costumes and makeup are amazing the photo is very good indeed the cars rocked and the cast is to dream of i am very fond of the saga and this film was much expected that is why is so disappointing that this ends up being just another good action movie when it was bound to be a major classic,reality
is a fresh take on action movies 2015 was a year full of blockbusters and even so this one managed to stand out it captures the essence of the previous movies while giving viewers a fresh take on and the newly introduced characters the story while not rich in dialogue or character introductions provides all of their motivations by minimum dialogue and gives us a glimpse of backstories the brides know nothing more of the life theyve lived as prisoners or breeding stock and are chasing a better life although they have no idea what awaits out there furiosa looking for redemption and an old home hasnt lost hope and is looking out for the rest of the girls a hardened survivor is looking only for that to survive not get involved in anything and staying out of the way becoming unlikely allies for plot reasons doesnt feel forced but a necessity as soon as the purpose is filled everyone takes their own way as for who has the role of protagonist there isnt really one and only both and furiosa complement each other and the plot drives them to stay together and have their own moments it wouldnt be enough to have only one of them and the movie did an excellent job giving both charlize theron and tom hardy enough development to make them have a good relationship while staying true to the character of being distant,reality
escaped from the pursuit of immortan joe and his troops  he worked together with imperator furiosa a tough woman immortan confidence joe  furiosa bring five wives joe  they go and want to get a better life  furiosa and along with the five wives to the green place this action movie is amazing  the visuals are very beautiful  full of thrilling action  and very realistic  so yellow and beautiful dirty and thrilling  this is a fury road movie that is pure action and tension  thanks george miller,reality
my actual rating would be negative 10 if only to balance one of the obviously paid shills that gave this a 10 in reality it should have an average score of around 3 rotten plot pitiful acting and marginal effects except some explosions this drivel makes the expendables look like schindlers list by comparisonan even bigger shame is that a lot of untalented losers made a shitload of money at moviegoers expense if you liked this chances are you are just another loser with 10 dollars less in your pocket,reality
how many of these apocalyptic trash nonepics are we expected to watch theres nothing new to this story i had to pause it halfway through to watch something more interesting came back to it the next day and still was disappointed quasiemotional scenes are dragged out too long with the overthetop score reminiscent of a realitytv dramafest seriously charlize theron and tom hardy zoe rosie riley et al are capable of so much more maybe they were bored or broke and had to take on this either way their talents are wasted some of the characters and their on screen personas are downright silly like the guitar player standing up in front of some bombastic vehicle cranking out atmospheric riffs while the vehicle bobs bounces and weaves across the desert landscape and where are they getting the gunpowder and seemingly unending supply of gasoline in the middle of the desert i understand the suspension of belief but come on the line has to be drawn somewhere if you want to see intensity and a story that makes sense watch the original and then the road warrior at least those are believable and certainly more entertaining,reality
crash bang crash bang crash bang ad nauseamyou know just like 80yearold director ridley scott and his alien movies  i believe that 72yearold director george miller and his movies is becoming more  more senile and yes cynical as his movie plotlines regress more  more into one of the bleakest states of pure cinematic tunnelvision that you could ever imagine possiblei mean  here we are again hohum taking yet another look at mans future  and guess what  yep  thats right  it stinksand above all else  what id like to know is this  where the hell in all of this utter wasteland were all of these fantastic vehicles and precision weapons being manufactured anyway eh where cause in this 150 million production where cruelty torture and deformity ruled  there was certainly no evidence whatsoever of there being anyone bright enough to even have the capability of putting together such amazing vehicles and weapons as these no way jose,reality
when looking through the reviews by other users i was surprised at how many negative reviews had been written for a movie with such high ratings it seemed that there were two main issues that the negative reviewers had 1 being a secondary character to furiosa 2 the motif of feminism being too prevalent i agree that this really is not a movie about its more about the environment as a whole and how to live in it beyond just surviving perhaps people felt that this was not in keeping with the spirit of the original movies but of course i havent seen them in regards to the feminism issue i think its great that george miller decided to mold his world to make it socially pertinent its understandable that viewers feel offended and annoyed by miller bringing his opinions into his movie but the function of art is to impact the culture of its time to disagree with what an artist or a director or a writer is saying in his or her work is one thing but to say that they should refrain from saying something of importance is essentially censorship feminism and how women are treated is a pretty important issue and its great to see a big studio movie such as this comment on it in a meaningful way people complain about how women are portrayed in movies but immortan joes concubines are shown as marginalized in a way that doesnt sexualize or objectify them onscreenin most cases movies tell stories but in this case the content was less about a sequence of connected events and more about the world that everything took place in this is probably a big reason why it won so many oscars for costumes and makeup and set design its not just that they were impressively crafted they also contributed to the story and the world of the movie in an important way the wasteland is basically a giant battleground of drug cartels the people are actually competing for water and gasoline but the resources seem to be treated more like drugs than essentials one thing that was very thought provoking in regards to the unique world was how the older women talked about our present as if it were a golden age because most people today even in welloff countries dont talk about our world like its a time of prosperityability to live apart and not rely on any larger group for his survival is potentially interesting more prominent however is how nux and furiosa live in relation to the world nux and the war boys are servants of the system worshiping immortan joe to the point that serving him is more important than their own lives in some ways this is true since immortan controls all of the water but he takes it a step farther by creating a sort of heaven on earth furiosa is the opposite of nux she has had enough of the polarized class system and decides to use her standing as a member of the higher class to turn the tablesin a craft sense there is so much to be impressed with the set design and makeup is top notch of course acting was not as prominent but all of the performances served the purpose even though there was not that much compelling dialogue or scene structure i still consider this a wellcrafted script for how proficiently it was able to pack character arcs and themes into a story that mostly consists of action set pieces the combination of camera direction score cinematography and action choreography resulted in some of the best action scenes ive ever seen if you really watch what happens during the action scenes the characters are really not that skilled combatively they know how to handle themselves with weapons but none of them have action herolevel skills like we are used to seeing the fighting is very chaotic and explosive but i never felt like the main characters should have died they get banged up a bit and shot at a lot and the danger felt real but it also felt like it was realistically evadedi would generally recommend this to anyone even if you dont like action it wont be as palatable if you dont care for action but there are a lot of points within the story that make it worth watching if you are an action person this should be a treat for you i cant say whether this is good for fans of the original mel gibson movies but this is worth watching as its own entity anyways overall rating 8610,reality
i was excited to see this movie but i didnt know what to expect before seeing this i had never seen another movie and therefore had no idea about the story but that all changed after i saw the movieoh my gosh this movie blew me away the action in this movie was amazing and more importantly practical the action is what made this movie however that wasnt the only great thing about this movie the characters and the story were also very great while i did like all the characters furiosa was the bestall in all this movie did everything right it had great characters a compelling story fantastic music and jawdropping action scenes the final chase with the pole cats landing on the vehicles blew my mind amazing movie the best movie of 2015 and one of my favorite movies ever what a lovely day indeed,reality
this will be rather brief i wanted to contribute after seeing the zillions of 12 star ratings of frustrated and clearly very disappointed moviegoers while ratings are subjective by definition 12 star ratings are very very unlikely to do this movie any justice if a 110 rating system is designed to make films somewhat comparableif it were then really low ratings are reserved for really bad movies think piranhaconda or the room this is not one of them make no mistakeclearly the strong points here are cinematography and pacing they are fantastic it is a thrill ride nothing more nothing less insane art design visual orchestration and stunt work drive home what the director intended one long chase this is what it is if the trailers mislead a potential moviegoer i would be surprised they ooze the essence of mindless action a thing that is often done horribly wrong and done very right herepeople giving 12 stars have never seen a bad film before in this authors humble opinioni absolutely loved it unpretentious fast and visceral,reality
this movie was and still is amazing to watch nonstop action that can only be described in one word exhilarating and its not hard for me to say that its one of the best action films i have witnessed in a long long time if not the best but it just did not feel like it felt like an entirely different movie compared to the initial titles for one there was too little light shed on any of the characters and that includes tom hardy the only thing we learn about him is that he used to be a cop much alike the original and that he couldnt save glory the young girl we see who comes to the conclusion that she wants to instead be a horror movie but does a pretty bad job at jump scares and being eerie furiosa charlize theron we know absolutely nothing about asides from the fact that she was taken at birth bla bla bla another sob story i and probably many others found it hard to relate to any of these characters because there was barely anything to know about themat some points the movie seems like its about to develop a character but then it just ceases to throw in another adrenalinefuelling action sequence and its back to square one driving a truck in hopes to outrun a bunch of psychopaths wait oh no their vehicle broke down best repair it before they catch upin 2 the characters seemed much more engaging the supporting characters were just as interesting as was and we could relate to some of them because they had just enough light shed on them so that we could do that and on top of that the movie was gritty it was horrific it felt like a true postapocalypse movie and it managed to tie in well with the action sequences which mind you were just as good and even better for their timebut fury road just doesnt do that it doesnt feel like it doesnt have that sense of gritty postapocalypse survival despite the first few lines in the movie are of mentioning his only instinct was to survive nobody seems desperate in this movie except for the citizens who live under the tyranny of immortan joe and they were quickly forgotten about in order to be replaced by more actionall in all fury road is definitely worth a watch the enthralling action sequences soundtrack and most importantly the special effects are nothing short of amazing but to those who have not yet seen it and are thinking you should do not go in to it expecting a gritty tense movie full of struggle and dirt its not,reality
this is the film that george miller shall had done 30 years ago instead of the tepid beyond thunderdometom hardy steps into the boots of mel gibson as rockatansky a man of few words haunted by the past and cares little of the world he is living incharlize theron is imperator furiosa who wreaks revenge on evil immortan joe by taking his young wives whose sole purpose is to make babies and be his chattelas the ladies escape they come across who is help captive by joes gang and he reluctantly helps them escape while being pursued by joe his sons and other members of his posseno doubt this reboot expands the premise of 2 and is effectively a one long bonkers chase film with stunning stunts and visualsas a nod to the original hugh keaysbyrne returns as the villain but plays a different character the sadistic immortan joe the films has form of having the same actors playing different charactersthe film adds a feminist twist with theron joining hardy as the lead character and being helped out by a group of women escaping from joes clutchesas for hardy it is unfortunate that he had so few lines and i have to say that he has yet to wrest the role from mel gibsonthe film won six technical oscars and was a contender for the best picture and director oscars i doubt this film could be regarded as oscar bait it is just an unpretentious actionadventure movie,reality
i had absolutely zero interest in seeing this movie i hadnt seen any of the previous three and had no interest in seeing this one but then i was told by a workmate that i had to watch itthat along with the fact that i have not heard one bad thing about it convinced me to give it a goi understand all the hype nowits dark and its twisted and also apocalyptic those devices the breeders immortan joes wives had attached to them and the whole milking scene were just some weird sht the scenery is absolutely beautiful all that sand more sand and even you guessed it more sandthe visual effects are amazing throughout the movie especially the sand storm scene the stunts are also worth a mention the whole pole cats scenes in the middle of a massive fight scene as well as the doof warrior are awesomei also loved the design of the rig designed with things needed for the harsh terrain theres a scene in the film where it catches on fire before a grate is lowered into the ground to chuck sand over the fire and put it outit has an awesome cast of big and small actors american and australia but most of my attention always was drawn to charlize theron as furiousathis film is definitely worth a watch even if you havent seen the previous films it would also be something i would watch again and will probably even own at some point,reality
i was extremely hyped for this film to begin with i have always loved the films i grew up watching them thanks to my awesome parents this film lived up to the hype then exceeded them charlize theron and tom hardy are a powerhouse duo it is easy to say george miller knows his audience and went in literally all out guns a blazing fury road is hands down the best film of 2015 not to compare the two biggest blockbusters of 20152016 but star wars episode vii the force awakens did not even live up to the height cinematically or story compared to fury road fury road will be immediately added to my collection and will remain amongst the rest of the greats,reality
at first i was going to completely write this movie off but since i had so many issues with it i took a step back and asked myself is it at least a good action movie and the answer is yes which is also where most of the positive points of the film arewhere the movie shinesamazing visuals this movie needs to be watched at least once on the big screen or a really nice widescreen tv at home george miller lives for practical effects and this movie didnt disappoint with great crashesvehicles they used cgi only for certain weather scenes which turned out pretty cool they didnt use cgi too much and when they did it looked good charlize theron does a great job in her role as furiosawhere the movie falterseven though charlize character was great she was essentially the main character in the movie which overshadowed himself if they both shared the lead it would have played out a little better character the guy whose name is built right into the movie name plays second fiddle for the majority of the film and is generally weak sauce for the majority of his screen time lack of storyplot as well as lack of interesting dialogue even charlize mentioned in an interview there was no plot just a whiteboard with scribbling details of how the movie should play out this is why you can summarize the entire movie as the main group of good guys traveling from a  b  c  b  a with a car chases scene that lasts the length of the movieforgetting your roots im all for reboots as long as you retain what was good at the core of the originals why were they cult classics you need to ask yourselfi ranked it 510 based mainly on visuals and charlize performance if it had a solid storydialogue and brought back some of the great qualities of the originals while at the same time rebooting the series it could have easily scored a 1010 still a great movie to watch once with this understanding of it,reality
seems like whenever we get a movie with the word road in the title its going to be great and also full of impressive action i just finished watching the bluray version along with a couple cool special featuresthere is a kind of purity to this film while it is a bigbudget movie for large audiences it doesnt make any compromises it is not your typical hollywood action movie george miller in a way took all the advantages of mainstream production capabilities but unlike so many others he didnt fall into that stream himself fury road knows exactly what kind of a movie it is and doesnt apologize for it one bitfury road isnt deep there is a simple story and a few somewhat emotional moments but at its heart its just pure chaos everything is crazy characters vehicles violence stunts camera drives everything is absolutely crazy its not only chaos but controlled chaos and its magnificent if this was an indiana jones movie it would be a 2hour version of the truck chase scene from raiders of the lost ark pumped up with steroids and acidthis movie looks beautiful im not only talking about the wonderful design of all the crazy vehicles weapons and clothes but also the cinematography in general cameras are used exceptionally well and the scenery is gorgeous and just when youre getting tired of the orange color palette swallowing everything you get half an hour of deep calm blue after seeing so many movies that try to attack my senses with excessive jump cuts shaking cameras or horrifying color filters all in the name of visual storytelling george miller shows how its really done cgi is used just the way it should be  not to make the film just complement iti have one gripe tom hardys i usually like him tom hardy is a very good actor but i didnt buy him as at all either because its hard for me to imagine anyone else playing him besides mel gibson or because every time he spoke it sounded and felt weirdly fake his facial expressions and mannerisms were alright at times and i enjoyed him to some extent but he took me out of the movie a couple times i do realize that is always less of a character than the environment crazy baddies and action itself but i guess i was hoping for morewhile remains a little distant furiosa theron and nux hoult are given more to work with charlize theron is good and she is the emotional heart of the film shes not here to look pretty but to play her part and she nails it nicholas hoult is clearly having a blast in his role he is full of energy and adds that certain precious spark to the cast i have always liked hoult now i like him even morewhat else could i say crazy characters in crazy vehicles chasing each other someone playing electric guitar that spews fire and a few grannies with shotguns and rifles if that didnt make you want to watch it go see a doctor,reality
fury road was far from a perfect film but it was much more enjoyable than i anticipated it was exciting the acting was great the story yes unlike what youve been told theres actually a story was captivating and while not really all that original it felt fresh and unique in how it was told overall this was very entertaining and i look forward to future installments the negatives were that charlize theron has way too large of a role even in the trailer and promotional posters shes clearly the star does this hurt the film not necessarily but it feels unnecessary the story shouldve focused more on we got almost no backstory for his character whatsoever and he maybe speaks a dozen lines the other element that was a weak point was that some of the scenes were a bit too ridiculous i expect some of it but not to the extent where you have a guy standing on top of a vehicle traveling at high speeds through the desert while playing an electric guitar with flames coming out of the tip yeah that happens,reality
 fury road is a visually stunning movie with great action scenes which is most of the movie but the lack of explaining to the audience who dont know the world of is confusing and can take away from the emotional connection to the story the performances are fine but tom hardy whos the title character seems like a secondary star to furiosa charlize theron furiosa is a good lead but shes not what the story should be based around barely gets any lines in the movie and seems to not be important to the plot of the movie there is a lack of understanding of the story and the world of the movie with very few scenes to explain the world and its people the positives are very good though the action set pieces are visually stunning with a lot of practical effects the chase is very exciting with a variety of spiked cars and trucks even with someone playing a rock song on one of the trucks the villain is really good but again there is no depth in the characters and the world to really get invested in the story and what happens to the charactersoverall  fury road is a fun film to watch but doesnt live up to its expectations the story and characters arent well developed enough for the audience to care ill give this film a matine,reality
i really am disappointed with this movie sure it has great action and great actors the cinematography was spot on the special fx were the star of this movie not who had about 8 lines in the entire film as much as i would love to have given this movie a higher ranking unfortunately i cannot it just doesnt have any significant plot other than a big car chase for almost the entire movie if youre going to make then it was a great opportunity to redo the original but you didnt you assume that everyone knows who is unfortunately half of todays audience havent necessarily seen the original you dont explain anything regarding except showing his medical info by tattooing it on his back no one would have any idea why hes really crazy and where it all started why would he be seeing flashes of some girl not many would empathize with because you havent explained anything that happened to him you assume too much and all of the great things that are in this movie fall flat because of it sorry but i only give it 5 out of 10,reality
at first i expected more effects than meaning in this movie and after i watched it i was almost rightthe idea of world war in the future and people living in small communities with a group dictator is not new and a lot of the other ideas of the movie are not new like the army of fanatic neonazi boys who know how to fix a truck made by 5 different cars but get blood directly from veins of living people tied to the same truckthe only surprise is that the is not really at all he looks like a calm found nirvana guy with some visionsi guess that this is the first part of many movies and i think that this movie is better places as manga,reality
i wanted to love this i really wanted to love this i came out exhausted and while that can result from a catharsis this film did not offer that for me it was impressive on many levels but ultimately did not possess the soul the original hasand then there is the er weighty issue miller utilizes the tired and insidious visual code thingood fatevil if it were miller alone doing this i could ignore it but it creeps in to far too many films without challenge in addition to being visually clichd and lazy its one of the last frontiers of discrimination and still considered not only acceptable but justifiable for me the film became less original for its adoption of this tired device i want to see works that challenge me on all levels the adoption of this predictable pedestrian device nearly ruined this one for me other than that it is one of the best choreographed films ive ever seen and the makeup effects department are nothing short of heroic ps i want a vehicle with that kind of gas mileage,reality
i am not one of the fans of movies i liked them with mel gibson in main role this movie had a potential first i saw a quite high rating here 86 on imdb and i had high expectations but as always rating on imdb is not a measure for the quality of movie this movie is dull and without a good story all is in action and action and killing and action an then stupid the end for me thats not a good movie maybe for some teenager will be great  but this movie doesnt have a plot acting from tom hardy is somehow decent charlize could be better only good thing in movie is excellent costimagrophy lots of radiation freaks that are really awesome yet this is forgettable movie i dont recommend it to you next please,reality
in a stark desert landscape where humanity is broken two rebels just might be able to restore order a man of action and of few words and furiosa a woman of action who is looking to make it back to her childhood homelandfury road is directed by george miller stars charlize theron tom hardy nicholas hoult and is the continuation of the legendary series  if you havent heard of it where have you been for the last 30 years to be honest i havent really enjoy any of the two and half movies ive seen before but it would be stupid to critic the heck out of this one just because i dont like the world created by george miller in those movies fury road is an action movie at its core its intense and rough this film is insanely crazy theres this guy that depicts perfectly the atmosphere of the movie hes playing electric guitar on top of truck shooting flames out of the neck of the guitar during the entire run time of the movie  until he eventually get killed of course this film doesnt stop from the first shot to the last hand to hand combat scenes and wide shots of chaos and destruction are very well handled it involves emotion as well brought mainly by charlize therons character due to her backstory plus i feel like she is actually the most badass of all her and nicholas hoult characters are genuinely interesting and brings a little bit of humanity in this world which is fine because we are use to root for who is the eternal good guy against all the crazies moreover tom hardy as is pretty good knowing that he had to fill mel gibsons shoes finally you see some death destruction carnage car explosions more death more destruction more carnage and at last this craziness weirdly makes sense in this film as we are way past the precipice of madness people clearly arent sain anymore overall fury road is crazy this film does millers things with a bigger budget ie a postapocalyptic movie with a two hours action sequence,reality
must see for action fans only because the stunts are captured without cgi the story plot and dialog are sparse like the landscape but the action is kinetic its really a refreshing break from all of the new school action flicks fueled by cgi effects a lot of reviews are kind of over hyping the movie though but when a studio puts in 100 million for a movie like this i need to know what they paid for if you want to see a real action movie  no cheesy stuff  this is it music score is pretty good as well as cinematography the pacing is just edge of your seat pulsating for at least the first 40 minutes which is kind of crazy in this era of filmmaking it kind of just shreds up the basic arc of storytelling and says lets just jump right into to it,reality
the good fury road has some truly awesome highspeed stunts mixed with real practical effects there are only a few scenes with obvious cgi elements the action is intense but there is a scope to it all no michael bay style 360 degree slomo or bullet time most everything looks like it was achieved in camera using real fx and real stunt people the badthere is too much action too many characters not enough plot not enough twists not enough setup after about an hour the action becomes redundant and tiresomeweird feminist undertones not really a complaint but i prefer the homoerotic undertones of the road warrior to fury roads feminismis barely in the movie he has maybe 45 lines very impersonal the rest of the time he plays second fiddle to charlize theron it would have been nice to see him do something besides grunt and point this was a bizarre choice from miller worst of all the v8 interceptor is crashed within the first 5 minutes and aside from a short appearance later in the film it is barely seen at allentertaining but forgettable 510,reality
yes it is very spectacular yes it is very violent although pg violent i cant remember more than a few single drops of blood really it is very nicely directed and shot and the few main actors are more than ok especially charlize its just that there are so many explosions you get tired after a while and very little story its not michael baycrazy but has some of his tendencies it was enjoyable at least and the 3d version is nice it is a popcorn flick so take it for what it is 2 it aint though i think i had too high expectations going in and maybe it will grow on me i would be surprised if there wont be a sequel,reality
i watched the trailer and i felt its boring cars following each others and in the desert with no stopping but then when i saw it i guarantee it will be the oscar bet  its about who you are  what you are looking for  to what you will reach  how much you will sacrifice for salvation  when you will awake from the dependency stray  it put you in front of your self any asking you all of thisif you watch it as a pure enjoying with no meaning you will not like the movie unless you like chasing cars movie the best thing is the soundtrack in action movie best visual effects best performance by actress  it was very enjoyable and interesting,reality
held me throughout the movie which almost entirely follows the usual chase but this time more adrenaline you will secrete and it aint gasoline filled tanker thats chased guess what its filled withand the movie this time shifted from fuel to  i will leave it up to you to see thats a nicer concept and more reality drivenmusic well nothing can beat the background score unbeatable beyond my expectations amazing movie 9 points straight from me will love to watch more than once from beginning till end it will hold you on be ready for being transported into the vast vast nowheresome scenes are a bit disturbing but thats what was even 1 and 2 contained too,reality
just as the thin red line lured loads of boys into cinemas thinking theyd see something resembling platoon or a mindless schwarzenegger flick fury road takes another routetheres enough action here to shake a stick at mainly where cgi doesnt really stand a chance to the reallive graphical action and the special effects are concerned but the real difference is in the human here both in the contrasts between good and bad including all of the grey areas of which there are humanly speaking manythis film manages to inject feminism into your everyday manpacked genre its almost maddening to think that this film has come into existence at the same time even a broken clock strikes the right time twice a daynot that this is a broken clock no no this is a world where civilisation is not as us rich westerners know it its a world where our poorest live in cities of dust with the richest at the top degrading the ones down the hierarchical line just along the lines of capitalism making the ones at the bottom think thats where they belong all cogs serving the greater good which in the film is named valhalla to where you gladly sacrifice your life to go whenever your master feels like it or you are programmed tothere is no mercy here no preconceptions like we are used to people are people the film starts off brutal in the wolfs cave as it where before therons character decides to go off the decided path together with the tyrannical rulers wives and gets hunted for itin an early scene when the escaping party makes a run for it one of the enslaved wives kicks the chastity belt shes been made to wear and quickly jumps into a rigtherons communication with hardy is nearly breathtaking i mean enough said right i loved the nomenclature the mixture of language words such as smeg possibly culled from tvseries red dwarf kamakrazee and guzzoline were wellused lines like is that just the wind or a furious vexation and we will mcfeast in valhalla actually made sense rather than seeming like something extremely uncomfortable from say true detective season twohow long has it been  seven thousand days and then the ones i cant remember the films antixenophobic just see the interplay where war boy and hardys character is at first the hatred is inherent almost inherited the more they get to know the situation themselves and each other respect and like is gained as with hardys and therons characters its as though naivit and innocence are shown asis good things really in comparison with prejudicethe fights the action is nearly without comparison i was slightly reminded of the introductory scene in saving private ryan when seeing the first battle but this is beyond that with a magnificent display made throughout the film its really a feministic film a world based on no bars hold or rather on men women and beings trying to break out of their genderbased cage and away from bad preconceptionsi cant even begin to say how much i loved the action scenes the cinematography and the quick editing the soundtrack is just manic wagneresque and it actually works where that method is usually 99 times out of 100 trite beyond words while you have attackers lurking coming out of every crevice its almost like watching gilliams brazil its so far from this world that its almost like watching an actionfilm apotheosis happening before our eyes in bright sparkling colours killing never looked this goodthis film really stimulates growth in thinking areas while being hamfisted in a really good way this is the way to go for all action filmsjust a thing pulled from the imdb trivia department that says a lot about this film the film editor margaret sixel is director george millers wife when she asked her husband why he thought she should do it as she had never edited an action film before miller replied because if a guy did it it would look like every other action movie i love this film,reality
what a action moviei am impressed this is by far the best film of the summerfury roads most explosive element might be its keenly subversive heartstory is greatthe real blockbuster movie i think what a lovely movie i really recommend this action master piece to all modern epic action lovers its totally goodthis movie is enjoyable to watch and it is definitely an action blockbuster the premise is simple but the execution of the movie is fantasticgeorge miller did a great jobfury road truly is an action masterpiece from genius george millerand special thanks to the man who made this fantastic movie,reality
tom hardy is magnificent in this sequel pairing him with charlize theron is simply screen magic they both take you on a 2 hour adventure ride of your life in fury roadif you like a lot of action and adventure this is the one to see the stunts alone are worth the price of admission its like bruce lee meets nitro circusthis movie is about less talk  more action and you have to have brilliant actors to pull it off they do an amazing job of telling the story by their facial expressions alonetom hardy impresses me more with every movie he makes,reality
it has been over 30 years since weve last seen mel gibson as taking on a gang of street thugs on a deserted road this year george miller reboots his postapocalyptic franchise with tom hardy in one of his most engrossing film roles yet tom hardy plays rockatansky a drifter and former captive who forms an alliance with a warrior named furiosa played by charlize theron along with five women who were hostage by a cult leader played by hughs keays byrne in a vicious thousandmile road battle against an army of bandits featuring an amazing cast including nicholas hoult rosie huntingtonwhitley zoe kravitz riley keough abbey lee and courtney eaton this scifi action thriller demonstrates astonishing special effects a compelling storyline and some of the most amazing cinematography presented this year so fari wasnt quite impressed with the original 1979 film with mel gibson but upon seeing the trailer to this one i had to give this one a chance and when i watched this i was absolutely blown away the postapocalyptic setting is so beautifully done it gives the most authentic representation of a postapocalyptic land i have seen in a long time even more amazing is the action sequences as the film progresses we are treated with prolonged car chases complete eyepopping explosions amazing stunts similar to what you find the fast and furious movies and outstanding cinematography that you will have your eyes glued to the screen tom hardy does an amazing job as the lead character and i was pretty shocked by charlize theron as the main female they both work very well on screen together and their performances shine brightif the characters special effects and camerawork isnt enough the film also boasts a deeply engrossing story in the midst of all the insane action the story never stops developing the story is near perfectly paced and never drags for one moment george miller does an impressive job at mixing heavy action with superb storytelling not a lot of action films do that nowadays miller does it just right in this film he takes time develop the characters and the plot while delivering these long stretched flashy action sequencesfury road is one of the best action of this decade so far i can easily see one going down as a classic if you havent seen the original two with mel gibson no need to worry this movie pushes the boundaries of what action flicks are capable of it demonstrates everything that an action film should be,reality
one of the best of 2015this film certainly gave me a big surprise im not very connoisseur of the previous trilogy  but i loved  fully recommended  just buy it in bluray out hopefully takes a nominations few this year and  of course win the entire cast was excellent  the performances were perfect no doubt the director george miller has not lost the touch of films and has given a great action movie the american film is classified or adults only  the good thing is that here in chile is for over 14 years or adolescents and adults  although they had many children watching this movie  this movie is crazy  the action never stops and is appreciated that most of the special effects are not computergenerated or cgi greetings from chile,reality
i had watched fury road on my phone and it was awesome as i expected from the first trailer i was speculating that the movie will be awesome and thats i found in this movie it was good as i expectedthe story is very different and it was totally different from its original film i had watched that also and i thought the reboot will be same but it was totally different but acceptablethe acting was great and the direction done by george miller is superb he has completely outdone himselfoverall the movie was a top notch entertainer and superb i heard about its plans of sequel titled the wasteland definitely going to watch that,reality
this is one of the best action films i have ever seen and this is coming from someone that abhors action films the atmosphere characters and story combine perfectly to create a wonderful film with great cinematography and nonstop action the simple plot in this film is such a relief coming from other recent action films containing plot twist among plot twist among subplots it is just simple enough that it is understandable and allows room for action and character development major complaints people have with this film is the lack of character development and being a side character the characters in this film change as normal human beings would slowly furiosa being a major change from getting away to an oasis to going back to a horribly run society to create a new life for herself and others has never been a major player in his own movies rather a plot device to carry other characters along and that is exactly what he does in this movie the fact that the women in the film rise up and defend themselves in the best ways they can makes this movie so great for me and the fact that pisses off mras also makes it super great this film shows strong female characters that arent just physically strong aside from furiosa they have complex emotions and feelings like normal human beings and do not exist solely as sexual objects which is an amazing feat in action films i hope action films follow in millers footsteps to create a more realistic atmosphere with relatable characters as well as amazingly cool action i absolutely recommend this film to everyone,reality
really well done action movie with some stunning scenes and brilliantly conceived characters and props had concerns as to how they would top the classic movies which have become cult classics but they have done a brilliant job without revising the past movies this movies stands along side the classics just fineto be fair the film was as much about the other characters in the new movie as it was about himself in this movie is much more introspective and not full of bluster like mel gibsons who was talking all the time part of his charm but this did not detract from the movie at all and as a personal fan of tom hardys work i thought he did a great jobcant wait for more movies from this new world  most enjoyable ,reality
a gripping chase of pure adrenaline that will have you clenching to your seat at any given moment the characters in this story are as bad ass as they are compelling you get thrown into the midst of the chaos and brutality that this world has to offer from the beginning you really enter the world of three characters in this film rockatansky tom hardy imperator furiosa charlize theron and nux nicholas hoult each are brilliantly displayed emotionally and physically although my complaint here is the lack of more tom hardy grips once played by mel gibson character and gives it a stone cold killer feel with gritty tactics and brute like strength immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne also carries this movie well with as of an intimidating character that has ever been with the way he is aesthetically portrayed he claws at the role of dictator and is a true foe not to be messed with the gore and brutality of this movie is extreme but you are in for a spine crushing ride that never lets off the throttle 8510must see,reality
ok this movie was just plain fun loud in your face muscle car madness with hot girls like i said more of a punk rock concert than a movie there were several places the movie could have added a little dramatic subtlety and landed itself a solid 10 but chose not to go there thats cool punk rockers seldom do either i keep considering if i should click the spoiler alert button but it seems a bit pointless cars go fast everything blows up lots and lots of people die in the fiery mayhem but isnt that why we all went to see it in the first placequestion did anyone else see wes near the end or was that just my wishful thinking,reality
there is hope for hollywood yet in an endless storm of sequels and reboots finally a group of people came together and said hey lets make the most amazing entertainment experience of the decade lets take and amp it up and thats exactly what they did ladies and gentlemen fury road is a movie for the ages yes it is a reboot but its probably the best one in recent history and the road warrior are enjoyable films but i think this movie is way better fury road wastes no time with explanations its all about the action and the pure suspense we understand the setting the character motivations and how much the world has changed for everyone without having to sit through a history lesson it doesnt matter how the apocalypse happened it doesnt matter how the main villain immortan joe built his citadel it doesnt matter what exactly happened to before the movie startsall the necessary information is there the movie takes place is the postapocalypse where humanity had no choice but to go nuts is haunted by the innocent lives he was unable to save furiosas goal is to save the oppressed wives of immortan joe from a lifetime of being used as objects that give birth to future warlords and let the madness beginthe plot may be simple and might not be the center of the story but the movie works we understand everything that we need to know and we are able to care because the characters and the setting are so visually unique and interesting i think the acting was superb and the shining star was charlize theron as furiosa the one woman army who drives a truck called the war rig and can hold her own in a fight against even she is a fearless badass but also a compassionate and noble soul she risks her life to betray immortan joe and steal away his prized wives so they can find a better life elsewherealso in the mix is tom hardy as the titular who is a man of few words he carves his own path but will still stop along the way to help the innocent another notable performance was nicholas hoult who plays a rabidly devoted follower of immortan joe who insists on driving off to war even though he doesnt have long to live the villainous immortan joe is also notable due to his incredible design and the mystery surrounding his strange cult of freaks fighting in hopes of being reborn shiny and newi would also like to note that this movie features real vehicles that the filmmakers built in real life along with real explosions and real fireif this explanation isnt enough to get you to see the film then heres a list of other awesome things that are in ita great big beautiful dust storm with lightning and tornadoes inside ita vehicle rigged with men playing the drums large speakers and one dude hanging on chords playing a custom electric guitar that shoots firea man wearing a hat made out of bullets whose teeth are also bulletsspears that explode on impactold warrior women on motorcyclesone beautiful thirtysecond shot of strange humanoids on stiltslots of stabbing punching and explodingdid i mention awesome vehicles that were built for reali cant fully explain just how amazing this movie is everything about it is so enjoyable not to mention metal as hell go see this movie take your wife husband girlfriend boyfriend friends your teenage kids it doesnt matter that its not exactly like the old films this blew the originals out of the water and into space,reality
feels like hope recalling these words to sum up my feelings for the return of george miller and the state of tentpole action films after seeing the exhilarating feminist sense shattering visual orgasm that is fury roadmiller  co has created one the best action films plus chase film postapocalyptic film and genre film that i have ever seen being a film that has littletono exposition it tells its very rich story through action and movement and allows the audience to pick up details about the characters their backstories and motivations this is masterful work of visual storytelling and filmmaking which also becomes a universal languageit has been reported that miller and his story team brandon mccarthy peter pound and mark sexton created 3500 storyboards to plan out and basically write the film and it shows add the talents of cinematographer john seale pulled out of retirement for this film and the film creates a vibrant and emotional visual energy throughout most of the action is real physical immersive and has a wonderful flow to it all this is a film that can be watched over a dozen times and you can still find something new and interesting within each detailedpack scene its an amazing feat for any filmmakergeorge miller is back in the wasteland and it has never looked so beautiful,reality
this movie was incredible one of the best that i have seen in my life the visuals were breathtaking as the entire movie acts as a giant action sequence the characters and story were very interesting and i was greatly invested the unique landscapes vehicles costumes and characters add to the sheer greatness that this film has achieved with the lack of both dialogue and slow paced moments this movie gives you little time to breathe as every scene is action packed and intense the acting was tremendous as well as tom hardy and charlize theron shine in their roles as and furiosa i can not praise this movie enough but i will conclude by saying that george miller has proved himself as a cinematic genius with fury road,reality
i just finished watching and wowthis aint your mothers and anyone who says its the road warrior rehashed is a moron at no point during the movie did i even feel like i was watching a movie this is a new beast that stands on its own its still a postapocalyptic world but with hardy at the helm and with the new story it feels like a brand new franchise the action starts early and it barely lets up for two freakin hours and what a lovely two hours it ischarlize theron is great and really shes the star hardy does a great job as but he has like 20 lines in the whole movie i might be exaggerating but it doesnt matter  it feels right hardy is exactly what hes supposed to be and hes awesome and just because he doesnt have a ton of dialogue doesnt mean he isnt always present and kicking ass he isthe movie is more about empowering women than anything else and thats a good thing its not about greedy marauders after fuel like the previous films its a human story and it sucks you in enough for you to carethe comradery is awesome theres a smidgen of a love story and a bad guy switches sides and youll love his character the direction and cinematography are outstanding and some scenes including ones of destruction are just plain gorgeous youll laugh youll wince youll get tearyeyed its fcking epicsimply put fury road is an action movie masterpiece and george miller is a genius i dont see how anyone can be disappointed with this movie,reality

written and directed by george miller this is his fourth film to date his portfolio is notably diverse and also includes the horrorcomedy the witches of eastwick and the oscar winning animation gem happy feet to date is also millers most audacious and vivid attempt to truly impress and dazzle the audience in a much less cuter way then happy feet unfortunately this is the one and only note that miller succeeds inis beautiful stylish and vivid the premise of the storyline of movies in its nature has always been fascinating a dystopian future dominated by motorcycle gangs violent heroes villains and survival as such this also might be the biggest thing thats wrong with its too ambitious there is too much happening and thus too much time is spent on showing and depicting the scenery the characters leaving little room for actual dialogues and an interesting storytelling the movie is essentially one big 2hour long chaotic chase  no wonder is a man of few wordsthe vast majority of the scenes are very fast paced and short switching from one angle to another in split seconds making it hard to concentrate or capture the full creativity of the scenery there are however a few scenes with very unusual camera angles which greatly add to the dynamic of the movie the premise of a huge long chase also makes it hard to focus on someone for a long time the colors are amazing vivid and contrasting which is very enjoyable to the eye the same way the works of frank miller are the goldenyellow desert matched with dark biker hybrid cars motorcycles and insane gangmembers is definitely pleasing and fun but only for about thirty minutes after the initial wow moment passes and one adjusts to the scenery hardys brutality and therons new hairstyle one should quickly realize that has nothing more to offerthe storyline and the dialogues are too dull to compensate for the amazing special effects background and characters i was personally disappointed expecting more of a sin city then a 300,reality
wow this movie is complete over the top nonstop action for 2 hours i would suggest this movie for anyone who loves action moviesgames and want a complete overdose of it after watching this movie my need to see an action movie is over for at least a monthfor starters this movie is all about action so if you are expecting a good story plot or great acting skills then you would the one falling in the category of disliking the movie and even while you are watching the movie you will soon realize that this movie is not for everyone all those gaming fantasies of twisted metalrage are going to come true and the way the director has captured so much chaos at once is pure brillianceaction sequences are executed very well in a wasteland with the style of attack changing every 1015 minutes which will keep you engaged and at the edge of your seat it has so much of over the top obnoxious yet enthralling action sequences that you will be laughing at some of the scenesif you are planning to watch this movie just know what youre getting yourself into and the ride on the fury road would be far more fun and exciting the movie starts with what it is and remains true to itself throughout which could be considered a boon for some and burden for others as not everyone i was watching the movie enjoyed this but they were expecting an exciting plot which it never pretends to haveso buckle up get ready and prepare yourself for a ride on the fury road because those who didnt were leaving the cinema after the first hour,reality
i know what this looks like sequels reboots and all that have been dominating the movies for quite a while now but what starts out as being a typical postapocalyptic action movie quickly becomes one of the better examples of the genre and probably the best action movie ive seen since the raid 2the plot is that gets captured by a society that worships this guy who has multiple wives and people at around the hundreds dying for his name however someone within his ranks charlize theron decides to free his wives and go to a place she grew up in one of the few places in this world where things can grow while completely unaware of this is a constant transfusion to someone going after her and after the car gets taken in a sandstorm somehow survives and through an uneasy relationship he joins theron to get there and they then must fight everything this guy is throwing at them alla big part of this getting hype was that this was all real i will say at this point this does look a lot more realistic then cg work but if youve seen this movie then youll know there are points in this movie where you have to question if there was any other way to do it but cg work either way though that final chase at the end is a spectacle of action filmmaking it really is admirable that george miller can direct this in his 70sthe cinematography like the action is also a spectacle i dont know if they filmed in outback australia like the other three but this is something to behold as well as the actionbut all of this is meaningless if i answer the question of what do i think of the story well in its basically a postapocalyptic version of the western genre and other movies like yojimbo the hero is a character we know little about he stumbles into a town with crime or all that other stuff he protects them to the end and then leaves when the work is done because there isnt really a happy ending for that character on his own in terms of that it still does a decent job i mean while it is a common complaint that it takes a third of the movie to do anything i still think it was worthwhile because therons character still is just as badass and she also has a story so she isnt like tauriel in the hobbit or black widow  she does have a character other then badass female heroid say this is probably the best in the entire series i say probably because i havent seen beyond thunderdome but id also say it is one of the better blockbusters to be made in the last couple of years id say this is worth it if you have even a slight interest in action movies i would also say this is also one of those movies where you can skip the first three and still have a relative grasp on the situation,reality
an action movie has never been more intense and delightful with its extraordinary sequences stunts and visual noncomputer effects just few exceptions fury road takes us in the middle of the one of the biggest havoc you have probably seen on the big screen yet it has everything the ordinary public could expect from the long waited brand new chapter of our beloved mr very to be straight and clear lets cut off all of these mumbojumbo complaining reviews lowering rate very i mean very inequitably its not the best option to see if you are a very feminist stanley kubricks or woody allens fan or some sort of self called critic with aspiration to find really deep envoy showing us the right way to be coz fury road is beyond all of that it was no intention of its director to face any existential problems so if you are looking for some solutions to deal with themspare your time your money and dont spit on the movie you probably didnt give a chance from the first minute its above your frustrations just like fans the real deal is fury road provides the best sort of entertainment from the first to the last minute the wastelands wont let you go till either allow you to do so or you sh your pants watching this true actionpacked masterpiece if im gonna die im gonna die historic on a fury road,reality
i never thought id see charlize theron like this but boy she really pulls it off well the makeup and costume design was just great very impressive and the special effects were incredible the action sequences were very exciting and high octane tom hardy was also very good in his role from straight up body type to his acting the actor that played the king was really done up well as far as makeup and costumes i mean wow i was very impressed with this movies visuals ill be surprised if it doesnt get some academy award attention if youre looking for a nonstop constant exciting highoctane action film with great acting great make up and great costumes then this one is for you 1010 for fury road,reality
george miller is getting back action movies dignity by fury road you will never get bored because the crazy adventure and the amazing action stunts that was built on practical special effects charlize theron gave an outstanding performance for the deep  sad and brave character along with good performance by tom hardy and nicholas hoult the movie was well edited and shoot that will remind you of some of the greatest action movies of all time  george miller has proved that the age is just an number he is 70 years old and brought us the madness of the action that we have lost through all the movie you dont know what you are gonna get  there some times in the movie you are just saying  this is it  they are dead  so unpredictable story with excellent music by junkie xl that will put you in the mood of action and heartbreaking moments the decoration  the costume design  the makeup and the sound effects will blow your mind overall  if you havent seen this movie you are missing out one of the best action movie of 2000s,reality
reviewed by dare devil kid ddkrating 55 starswith exhilarating action and a surprising amount of narrative heft fury road brings george millers postapocalyptic franchise roaring vigorously back to life the film delivers and delivers big time theres no clearer or more succinct way to put it 30 years after last appearing on the big screen roars back with a vengeancemiller once again gears up for a postapocalyptic actionthriller with fury road the fourth outing in the film series set in the furthest reaches of our planet in a stark desert landscape where humanity is broken almost everyone is crazed fighting for the necessities of life such as water and fuel within this world exists two rebels on the run who just might be able to restore order we are reintroduced to still a man of action and few words who seeks peace of mind following the loss of his wife and child in the aftermath of the chaos the second insurgent is furiosa also a woman of action and one who believes her path to survival and possible salvation may be achieved if she can take a handful of oppressed tormented incarcerated beautiful young women across the desert back to her childhood homeland and furiosa team up in the most unlikely of alliances  and for polar opposite reasons  to stand up to the man get their hands dirty and get the job donefury road has visionary moments speed and a wild sense of daring you stumble out of the theater giddy about what films even action movies can actually do when their set their mind to it transported by the breathtaking velocity in this battering ram of a picture that just goes goes goes and then keeps on going even after two viewings i feel as though ive only scratched the surface of fury road george millers bleak badass actioner is astonishingly dense for a bigbudget spectacle not only in its imagery and ideas but in the complex interplay between themit also represents a certain kind of hope thats highly implausible to materialize  for as technology continues to improve and digital effects wizardry enhances exponentially heres an oldschool master that refreshingly gets to the basics and uses the powers at his disposal for good rather than to score an easy way out the action is fast and furious and totally bonkers and yet the style is totally in keeping with its predecessors while being innovative and boldly new old west showdowns meets funk mayhem meets feminist drama seriously but the movie has so much more to do with the architecture of the frame and millers delight in throwing things right at the face of the audience than any sneaky feminism theres a kind of kinetic genius to the movie which is essentially one long chase adrenalinepumping chase sequencewe have to admit that hollywoods franchise hunger has reached the point where any level of cynicism regarding a sequel reboot or reimagining is defensible and given that it had been 30 years since the last installment one could be forgiven for approaching this tom hardyled continuation of the saga with a somewhat jaundiced eye but all that time away from the franchise clearly gave directorcowriter george miller plenty of ideas because fury road is that rarest of blockbuster beasts an action thriller that isnt content to merely string together set pieces in fact its a surprisingly thoughtful film one whose message is afforded equal importance alongside epic action sequences arranged with balletic eyepopping grace amidst all this hardys rockatansky remains a man of few words  in fact he spends a good deal of the film with a mask covering his mouth  but alongside co star charlize theron he grounds the movies gonzo outbursts with palpable human emotion believe all the hype and then believe it some more fury road will melt your face off and then slam it back on,reality
fury road delivers for an action genre  it seems it is hard to plot a strong thrilling story line as it is seen with many movies that belong to this genre most of them are just stupid and all about action but fury road is wild  insane action packed yet the story line is interesting and grippingit gives a much needed revival to the action genre which had been sidelined to only expensive budget special effect movies like transformers fast and furious well rip paul walker but even though i like the ff franchise the story line is well not strong the action sequence of fury road resembles a lot like death race but well it suits better in a post apocalyptic struggle of war lords rather than in a locked up prison race betting business tom hardy seems to own every action sequence he does the movie is epic mind blowing and lastly very refreshing for the action genre,reality
this film is can be considered a perfect summer film which was exactly what i was expecting it to be rockatansky returns for his fourth film outing this time portrayed by tom hardy imperiator furiosa played by charlize theron steals the wives of the religious tyrant immortan joe played by hugh keaysbyrne joes war boys including nux played by nicholas hoult attempt to get them back and is caught in the crossroadsthe positives are incredibly numerous within this film the cinematography in the film was beyond exceptional cgi was used sparingly and the soundtrack was surprisingly not bland like every other hollywood blockbuster released during the summer surprisingly the acting was also particularly well done i could relate to the protagonists as if they were people as opposed to them being cardboard cutouts that have less personality than a chair the movie wasnt very dialogue driven but the visual storytelling was very impressive the story was simple and the execution was masterful even when dialogue was used the film was exceptionally written even though it obviously wasnt the main focus of the film i loved how over the top and awesome the action sequences were and i wouldnt want them any other way in the end fury road is an incredible and delightfully fun time at the movies and i cant wait for the sequel to go even further with its action i urge you all this is a mustsee spend your money on this and you will not be disappointed,reality
after seeing for a second time i have to say it is fing awesome like my first viewing it is still clear it has no story just a premise but then on a second viewing i realized that is the whole pointthis is a film about the remnants of mankind surviving by any means possible in a corrupted and twisted apocalyptic future therefore there will not be any complex stories or intricacies noone is living a complex life anymore life is now just basic savagery and brutality to survive we are looking at a normal day in this worldfor this reason i think is a great film a film where a normal day no longer has subtlety or subtext just barbary and carnage i see no story because this film takes place in a world where i dont belong in my 21st century western life every day is filled with complex social and personal happenings so when i view a day in the life of i am looking at a day in the life of a person and place where there are no such thingsto me is a story our prehistoric ancestors would understand  for it is a story about a scary world where brutality is the dish of the daya rambling by me immortan fred,reality
this film should certainly be viewed on the big screen this is where you will received the ultimate experience i viewed it in 2d but it was very obvious that many scenes were made with 3d in mind and i feel alittle disappointed that i didnt get that experiencethe storyline is minimal and everything you need to know is explained briefly during the opening scenes there are too many hollywood films these days which try and cram back stories subplots character development and unnecessary dialogue into action movies making them feel cramped and boring with three hour run times knows what it is its an action movie and its as simple as that it doesnt feel the need to complicate things and kept to a reasonable run time of under two hours which is what i liked about it the only thing worth talking about here is the action it is so well done and so refreshing to see you get to see full panoramic shots of the action and the use of shaky cam is kept to a minimum the camera work is breathtaking and it is used in such a way that you feel emerged in the action without having the headachenausea feeling that so many action heavy films give you i truly enjoyed the creativity of the entire movie the costumes vehicles and weapons were all very well done the action was frantic and felt panicky at certain times some scenes felt very anxious and the edgy feeling was quite alarming as i didnt expect itthe movie is split into parts making it easily digestible and keeps it flowing smoothly it will have 1520 minutes of intense breathtaking action then slow it down for 10 minutes with some dialogue this suits the movie well especially considering that the scenes breaking up the action are kept basic and do not delve into back stories etci do have a few negatives but they are hard to comment on without giving anything away all i will say is that some of the nonaction scenes feel a little forced and clichd and what should have been one of the most important scenes in the movie was cut out and left to the imagination as to what happenedoverall is an adrenaline ride from start to finish and needs to be taken for what it is it doesnt try to have depth and i respect that viewing it in the cinema will certainly enhance your experience more so that other films go and watch it810,reality
although the structure and plot of this film is relatively simple make no mistake fury road is a high octane cinematic thrill ride and makes for an incredible viewing experience visually it is stunningfrom the fastpaced chasefight scenes to the gorgeous cinematography within the barren apocalyptic landscape theres a whole lot you could talk about but what really does it for me is simply the fantastic entertainment value of watching this crazy thrill ride that never seems to stop,reality
why the high rating this is such a bad film that i think everyone went in with blinkered vision and told themselves it was going to be brilliant no matter what why well first you barely see or hear throughout the film as a normal sci fi film it was okay dont get me wrong i wad hoping a a fantastic film that didnt come off dont take my or anyone elses word for it watch it and honest with yourself,reality
what a film lets keep this short its amazing from start to finish the cast is amazing and it has a brilliant story line a must watch by all probably one of the best action films of all time now i cant wait to watch the original 3 film 910performance 910 originality 910 direction 1010 story 1010 ending 810,reality
this movie shows that hollywood can still make good movies based on older franchises fury road is possible the best action movie of all time it wont wow you with an amazing story but its not trying to the film will wow you on its use of practical effects and that was enough to satisfy me with multiple viewings see this movie now,reality
a testosterone fest with little to no plot at all but incredibly actionpacked and fun nonetheless the lack of actual story is made up for by the awesomely defined characters and memorable scenes throughout the movie the music and special effect are amazing i may come out as a simpleton when it comes to cinematography but i was drooling the entire time while watching as i dont always need a complex story to keep myself entertainedas i was told before you dont need any details from the previous movies to watch this one and as a matter of fact i got little to no information out of this one but i was still able to enjoy it best part of the movie for me definitely the crazy guitarist that kept doing his job through explosions and pain,reality
i am pretty surprised on how much ive enjoyed this movie when i was entering the cinema i didnt see any trailers or teasers and didnt expect anything from fury road and even tho the story line is so unimportant it is almost nonexistent i was on fire from the beginning till the credits because this movie doesnt really need a plot this is no masterpiece nor something i would recommend to everybody but to those who love pure action go aheadalready in the first few minutes you gonna see everything this movie is about survival maniacs fast cars and a hell lot of explosions i think the title couldnt fit any better since almost the whole movie is playing on a desert road with a furious trying to keep himself alive and a bunch of furious enemies on the huntit was good to see hugh keaysbyrne as the antagonist who already played in the first movie but also tom hardy in the leading role and a terrific charlize theron on his side a small weak point in this cast might be the four escorts of therons character such as zo kravitz rosie huntingtonwhiteley riley keough and abbey lee who have no clue about acting at allbut i was rarely so full of adrenaline when watching a movie and that deserves my respect and 9 out of 10 starscheers,reality
fury road is one of those movies that shows that a movie can be good without character development plot development well no development at all it is just a thinly plotted car chase that runs for two hours in a breeze and only at the end suffers a little bit of overstuffed overacted overthetop in one word awesomethe story doesnt matter charlize therons furiosa runs away with the women of the bad guy tom hardys gets in an agreement with her and both of them and the women decide to join forces in their escapecue the most surrealistic and incredible carchase movie ever as said above theres barely a plot furiosa and the others running away in search of a paradise while lots of bad guys follow them trying to get the women back but how it is done is what puts this movie in a high place the visuals are amazing the car chases are incredible and the imagination in all the different moments of confrontation show a knack for the theatrical where george millers assured hand as a director shines from people using poles to throw grenades to a flamethrowing guitar to all the explosions cars flying around storms crowpeople it is crazy moment after crazy moment with little breaks to let the viewer breathyou probably wont like it if you expect more than crazy action and a car chase and it runs a little bit too long otherwise you are in for a treat nuts absolutely nuts in a good way,reality
i saw this for the first time the other night and whilst i have not seen the previous movies which i probably should have done i really did enjoy this and was able to understand the concept of losing his child and wife and having that haunt him i think the let down of this movie was a lack of character developmentalthough i thought nicholas hoult was very well done it seemed as though everyone in the movie was just doing what they had to do to get to the end of the plot and finish the movie without seeing any real change or big connection between them the story was kinda simple but it was easy enough to follow and understand and personally i feel that whilst the action cgi practical effects and soundtrack were great if the story was deeper the characters were more developed apart from of course and there was even more blood and grit to it like an r rated movie than this would be perfect all in all i think the ratings for it are well over what they should be but i believe that the reviews on imdb are drastically low fury road is a fun film and in entertainment terms in my top 10 of 2015,reality
like a visit to a world heritage site by far the best of the series and the best film ive seen so far this year the movie was excellent a true continuation of the story it was everything thunderdome should have been and wasnt this was the epic restart the road warrior deserves and i hope that tom hardy and george miller create more the film is breathless and intense and itll leave you feeling the same way sure it doesnt waste much time on dialogue or a complex storyline but who needs that when youve got a desert full of oily trucks and cars revving around and bumping into one another this is one of the purest action movies ive ever seen  certainly not a disappointing continuation of the franchise what a lovely day,reality
ive seen this movie twice now the first time wasnt nearly as good as the second i think that it helps having a decent understanding of the plot before going into this movie otherwise a lot of it ends up feeling pointless fury road follows as he travels with imperator furiosa and a group of breeders or wives as they are often referred to as in the hopes of finding a place where they can live in peace away from immortan joe the breeders lover and leader fury roads plot is decent my opinion on it hasnt really changed i think that its a good plot and its executed relatively well there isnt a whole lot of stuff to say about a plot as simple as this one but it works for a movie like this and its enough to keep the movie exciting the first time i watched it it all felt pointless due to my lack of knowledge about what it was about although it is mentioned a few times at the beginning of the movie which i guess i just didnt pick up on the first time the characters arent great my opinion on them remains largely unchanged too furiosas back story feels a bit less clich this time around but it still isnt great all the other characters are just fine you have a general idea of who they are by the end of the movie but the development isnt anything special the action was way better this time the car chase that lasts for the entirety of the movie is quite exciting and while i was never actually tense or uncertain it was just a whole lot of fun the action sequences that take place outside of the vehicles are great there are several shots that are sped up and actually almost add to the level of urgency within the movie not only that but it just looks really cool its very stylish for lack of a better word the visuals are also great in this movie from the backgrounds to the cars themselves everything looks great the fact that the cars are actually real as well really helps sell the movie as more realisticlooking and makes it all the more impressive the movie is very unique something i wasnt prepared for originally is the fact that everyone is insane in some way it was weird the first time but the second time it just makes it way more unique the movie has a very unique feel and look and it pulls it off most of the time the parts that werent unique were often clichd plot points the clichs in the movie stand out a lot when the rest of the movie is so special and thats really the only reason i havent rated this movie higher overall fury road is great its a special breed of action that i wish i could see more of its so much fun to watch yet it goes so much deeper than fun with its visuals and feel this movie is so unique to the point that any clich sticks out like a sore thumb and those parts hurt the experience this is easily one of the best movies of 2015 and one of the most fun experiences ive ever had with a movie in the end i would certainly recommend this movie especially if your looking for a heck of a lot of fun,reality
im going to say it right now this is one of the greatest action movies i have ever seen it had amazing car chases exhilarating handtohand fight sequences with some of the most realistic choreography ive ever seen and it even took time to tell a story though not in the typical way tons of exposition in dialogue painfully boring clich romance etcif youre going to review a movie i dont think its fair to start with comparing it to another you have to look at what the movie sets out to do and how well it pulls it off fury road does nearly everything right the action is exhilarating the cinematography is beautiful no shaky cam and stunning visuals and even the characters are given proper depth through their actions some of it is admittedly easy to miss like one of the girls carrying a music box and some of the characters might feel bland as a result at least if you havent read the comics but if you rewatch the movie and pay attention to the things happening in the background you will see that every single character is reacting to what is happening on the screen in their own way this is what drives this movie its the interactions expressions and the delivery of the lines that builds the characters individually and i applaud the movie for not treating the audience like idiots action is as already stated fantastic the stuntwork is some of the best ive ever seen and tom hardy is wonderful at fight choreography it might not have shown in the dark knight rises but it definitely shines through here with how he throws himself around during the fight scenes the costumes and makeup all handcrafted of course makes it all feel real and authentic and the vehicles the vehicles as a huge petrolhead i was blown away by how much effort they put into building these machines they help the movie build an impression despite the fact that some of them are a bit too big and too excessive for the environment however the movie does try to explain the more insane ones and does a reasonable job at it the plot is lackluster but never tried to tell a deep story the story is just there so that our characters have something to do while the world is built around them i must say though that the movie does get themes right there are themes like betrayal loneliness depression fear stress anger and even desperation in this movie all told through the visuals of course there is one scene where one of our characters breaks down and lets loose a scream this scene is very well filmed and is slightly heartbreaking and is made even better by the acting the themes i mentioned are pretty much all explored here in this half a minute long scene overall i dont see why nobody acknowledges why this movie is great sure its not the greatest movie ever but it does do a lot of things right it tells a story about good characters through amazing action and visualsits not a 10 its definitely not a 14 it rests in the 69 area for me its definitely an 8 good job team,reality
as far as story lines go this movie has little story for a 2 hour film but as for the action it is greatly done although it does not excuse the painful first hour of the film as the movie drops right in the action without ever explaining the story although i must admit that even though there is no real story except the simple main one the action is great and the acting is good as well although the action is way over the top but since it is executed this well it is still a movie you should watch if you love explosions without a real good storyits a movie only fit for an action oriented audience but not for those who seek a great or even passable story,reality
fury rage has a probable weak story line and the only reason it is a hit is because of its out of the box location  characters  action and adventure tom hardy and charlize have played their role well and some scenes in the movie have some vivid imagination of how war takes place at that time  the location of a deserted place lacking greenery and mankind is a sure put off for some of us  likewise there is essentially no dialogue save a few grunts from and cringeinducing awkward lines from the rest all in all this movie lacks the depth and it is a one time watch ,reality
it did well with critics but its not without its detractors i had read it was a class a action movie and on that basis alone i was excited to see it i saw in high school so i was aware of the character and the austere australian cult vibe of the movie this new version was only alike in costumes the dialog was minimal but there were some heavy themes present the evil leader gets his minions to blow themselves up by explaining some sort of after death paradise modern parallels anyonethe movie is not from the perspective of this time we see a lot from a group of women who get pregnant and supply their milk to the group for nourishment im not entirely sure how helpful this was to the plot it did however show by proxy that they had lost civilized conventions  like cows milk the chases and shoot em up scenes are top notch i wasnt bored once the movie really is just one long car race and gang war if you saw the trailer you know about the flame thrower guitar i wondered why that would be there but them recalled how in the revolutionary war the soldiers wee often led by flutes and drums by the way in addition to the wicked guitar flamethrower there are some amazing drums on the cars so often action movies get caught up in storytelling scenes avoids that its just one long running action scene with pointless dialog from time to time and in between because it didnt focus on very much and because the story was a little weak it lost points as an action movie i think it will take its place in history as one of the best,reality
wow its the same thing almost every time  when a movie receives extreme praise from both audiences and critics it is wise to be a little skeptical because its probably not that good and while this is a pretty entertaining movie its nothing too speciali wanted to like it i always want to like movies but im giving my honest opinion hereit does have some really cool elements though and some nice cinematography some awesome shots but i found it to be rather uneven we have long action sequences that are not really that exciting to be honest it got a little dull its basically the same thing for 2 hours but spread evenly around are small things details that bumps it into awesometerritory then the action bumps it down againthis was how my brain was thinking during the movie it went from is this all there is to wow ok yeah thats pretty cool to this is not that entertaining to oh that is awesome though and so on see unevenand where was all that gore and violence i was promised we see a bunch of dudes getting run over but there is so little gore that i felt like this was pg13 most of the time i dont mind pg13 but when a movie is rated r i expect more than what we got here could it be they were aiming for pg13 but got an r and didnt have time to editit probably doesnt help me much that i dont like this kind of dry deserty post apocalyptic crap but considering i dont like it i did like the movie relatively well parts of the main plot i am totally sure ive seen before i dont want to spoil anything but right havent we seen exactly this in some cartoon for children or somethingthe acting was fine i dont really have much to say immortan joe was pretty cool was a little weird charlize i have nothing to say about but she did fine mel gibson should absolutely have been in it though he has some real charisma which this movie is lacking i know hes an a hole but hes still a good actorthe effects look pretty decent for the most part ive read that there is a lot of practical effects used here which people go on and on about i dont care that much i just want to see cool stuff cg or not there is definitely cg used in fury road too btw not all of it is great either actuallyso all in all uneven movie some really good parts other parts are not that good some ideas work very well others no so much im looking at you air soul heart grab thing among other stuffi think you have to like carsenginesdriving and sand to really dig this movie plus it helps to be a huge fan of the old ones i guess,reality

i have not seen the melgibson trilogy so i went for a screening of this film for a dosage of action and also to check out what the chatter of this movie being feminist was all abouti kind of like the fact that all the men in the movie are mostly relegated to driving like crazy shooting exploding shoutingstringsofsinglewords and strumming a flame throwing guitarone guy looks sullen and handsome while kicking somebut not half as much as expected  nick hoult plays a version of a crazy zombieas compared to the love lorn one he has portrayed before the villain was more funny than menacingso it is the women who are shown to have various emotions decent dialogues and give the story some depth oh they also get the major share of the action charlize theron brings out the oscar winner in her even amidst all the noise and dust the ladies literally take the drivers seat in this movie and the more interesting takeaway is that the director imagines an apocalyptic world where even though some women will be treated as just softskinned babycarriers there will arise a group of womenage no bar who will stand up and fight and amidst the the surviveatallcosts and hopeisamirage imperatives will still show tenderness towards all life forms boys on the other hand will remain boys but have no doubts this movie is an out and out action flick and literally hits the road running well just after chews the head out of a lizard  i like the fact that there is no sex or mushymushy flashbacks and the whole movie is one long to and fro journey filled with fireworksand the 3d ensures that some come right at your from the screen it is a simple film and i would recommend this movie to anyone who just wants to sit back fasten the seat belts and enjoy the trip down the fury road,reality
i enjoyed fury road and that fact comes as a big surprise to me i was expecting a brain damaged wwe version of this remake judging by the trailer i wasnt expecting much what we get instead is a super romp of an action film that goes out of its way to keep the pedal to the medal at all times from start to finish i cant say id want every movie at the cinema to be all action orientated like this one but its refreshing to see a few at times and to see one get action right no cgi floating crap but solid real world stunts the stunts are very believable and it a well executed film the action is intense even if it is over the top and cartoonish ive become so sick and tired of wirework fight scenes that when a movie like this chooses to use raw real action instead of wires i applaud my only real criticism of this one was the fact that is too long of a running time all action wears thin after the hour and a half mark,reality
the art of cinema is a splendid medium capable of conveying many themes and ideas from romantic revelations to sinister horror to wonderfully rich metaphors for the world at large cinema is by far the most fascinating and rich canvases for artists over the past 100 yearsand it is used here to great marvel and spectacle to convey an exquisite art the art of carnage destruction and actionfrom master director george miller comes the return of one of cinemas iconic action heroes or rather antiheroes rockatansky first immortalized onscreen over 30 years ago by mel gibson say what you want about gibson who has admittedly gone quite himself in recent years but his three performances as are legendary now the mantle is passed to tom hardy and the series has been given a fresh start in the form of this pseudoreboot from the same creative mind as the original although technically this could also be considered a sequel as outside of one detail it frankly would fit in fine with the continuity of the original seriesin the postapocalyptic future formerlawmanturnedsurviving wanderer hardy is captured by a tyrannical cultleader called immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne and made into a blooddonor to help give strength to his ailing forces the war boys who joe has conditioned to worship him like a god however is able to escape and joins forces with imperator furiosa charlize theron a former ally of joe who has betrayed him and is attempting to escape with joes numerous bridesbreeders so they can start a new and peaceful life what follows is in deranged insane and highly entertaining adrenaline fueled ride as and furiosa attempt to escape the every growing and ever pursuing forces of joe and the war boys a chase that will rock the world with its fury and ferocitysomething that i see as a recurring theme is the fact that many are bemoaning the fact that despite being the titular character hardys is often overshadowed by other characters particularly the excellent theron as furiosa and while i will admit this is true i dont understand why others see this as such a flaw while the original film was indeed centric thus far no other entries have really had as the main focus in terms of story is honestly more of a conduit to drive the film forward and introduce the audience to the actual situation at hand road warrior2 and thunderdome both followed this model and are wellregarded and fury road follows suitsadly this film is also being chastised by some of the more deplorable members of modern society as well socalled mens right activists a pr friendly way to spin bitter and evil hatred of women into a more palatablesounding term who exhibit dreadful and disturbing misogyny to condemn the film for having strong female characters but i guarantee to anyone open minded who would like to see the film that their claims are far from the truth and the film benefits from its strong female presence dont listen to their demented prejudiced and hateful minority voicethe real star of the film is its wonderfully quirky atmosphere and the topnotch direction of miller who proves that even after 30 years he still has the ability to spin wonderfully compelling sequences of mayhem while also being able to tell a simple coherent hardhitting story this is one of the bestdirected action films ive ever seen and millers insistence to film the many action sequences with as many practical effects as possible gives it an edge over many other movies being released today you havent seen action so quick furious ferocious and most importantly real as this is in a long timethe cast is also fantastic although hardy is indeed overshadowed he gives a good performance as and you get a real sense of someone whose life is hollow from personal loss and the constant need to survive keaysbyrne is a wonderfully wicked as immortan joe something that shouldnt be surprising given the fact he also played the lead villain toecutter more than 30 years ago in the original but the real star is of course therons furiosa who is just a delight tough yet with an emotional core furiosa is absolutely outstanding and i wouldnt mind seeing her return in future films or even in her own spinoffi really shudder to reveal too much more about this film as to not spoil anything because the film moves so quickly and is so well paced it deserves to be seen without too much foreknowledge of spoilers or storybeats suffice to say im in love with it please see this remarkable film if youre a fan of action or suspense fury road easily earns its perfect 10 out of 10 from me,reality
ok first let me just say that anyone who decided to write a review about this movie and gave it a 1 or anything lower than 9 saying that its for mindless people who only like action should all get off this site immediately and never review another movie ever again you could say that it is just their opinion that the movie is bad and that it is a love hate type of movie but it absolutely isnt this movie is a masterpiece and there is no right or wrong about that you cannot say it is bad and isnt your type of movie cause quite frankly no one gives a sht and your opinion is completely wrong everything about this film is perfectly executed from its amazing visuals and cinematography to its exhilarating score and if you say it bored you and is a bad movie it is probably because you just watch a movie expecting it all to be given to you and dont appreciate the endless time and effort put into creating something as incredibly cinematic as this dont get the wrong idea im not saying youre not allowed to think this way about movies and i know the majority of audiences today look at films the same a good movie would be simple but decent plot good actors and a easy to understand inspiring ending well its ok if you see cinema like that but if you are going to come here and ruin this amazing movies user score because of your mindless opinion then imdb is not for you,reality
for the generation of moviegoers who are unfamiliar with george millers postapocalyptic masterpiece fury road is a rip roaring stylistic treat on wheels that doesnt stop until the very last faceripping explosioni was pleasantly surprised that they werent retooling the franchise for the new generation and instead added a new chapter to the ongoing saga and who better to reintroduce to the new generation than the old man george miller himself nobody thats whonow to be honest im not much of an actionfilm guy myself ive boycotted all of the transformer movies and i wont be watching furious 7 without somebody putting a gun to my head but give me xmen or guardians of the galaxy give me anything where action meets plot and tie it all together with a unifying theme and ill be all over it fury road has all of those thingsfor the action movie fanatic its two hours and change of virtually uninterrupted action sequence with visually stunning effects and some of the hottest girls on film and for those of us who like to think during an action flick its got some serious underlying social criticism first the most important things in the world are gas water and women this should sound pretty familiar if youre a fan the water and gas thing is a bit of a revisitation albeit realistic in that commodified resources are pretty much the stuff that modern wars are made of and if you dont think women are a commodity in this day and age you need to take a look around really people are a commodity and everyone is for sale if you really want to dissect it and the movie touches on that aspect as well and how does is touch on that aspect you ask well theres something very biblical about whats going on in the movie its true the films antagonist immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne chases after his wives through the whole movie which has stirred up controversy among mens groups because of honestly who cares why but the movie is clear in showing the importance of joes wives as babymaking machines serving the utilitarian purpose of propagating new generations of loyal followersimmortan joe byrne is more than your runofthemill psychotic super villain hes a patriarch and spiritual leader who manages all the resources in an otherwise lifeless wasteland who also purports himself to be some sort of connection to the great beyond all of the sudden it makes sense that his followers would willingly blow themselves up to carry out his will and why the only women who survive in the postapocalyptic future are the ones you want to see naked after all if you were immortan joe wouldnt you choose nothing but the bestif theres one objection i have its that tom hardy might be a little too sexy to pass as a postapocalyptic road warrior maybe they couldve given chapped lips or just given the part to joaquin phoenix but hardy holds his own as an action hero even if is more of a narrative character in this movie charlize theron on the other hand who has shown us these kinds of acting chops in monster gets her fair share of asskick as the heroine of the movie and held it down in what turned out to be the lead protagonist role as hot as we all know she is in reality they ugly her up just enough to make her a believable furiosa and her bionic hand gave her that extra edgetry and guess who gets their face ripped off at the end you might be surprised,reality
the plot revolve around furiosa a fugitive commander and her band who are all trying to escape a savage warlord immortan joe played by hugh keaysbyrne with the the help of charlize theron as furiosa is great in every aspect and tom hardy as having almost 10 to 15 dialog but he is awesome with his expression and good in portraying as previously played by mel gibson all in all fury road is gargantuan eruption of nonstop action which is jawdropping eyepopping and eradicates some of the marvel movies and series of fast  furious in its dustthe plot is very straight forward but its cinematography action sequence and the world created is marvelous and cannot blink your eyes for even a secondwatch this because it is never been seen before experience and every aspect of awesomeness dont miss this experiencei am gonna give a to this action adevnture scifi movie,reality
every second of this film is perfect it is unbelievably awesome it has permanently altered my brain there are more original ideas in this single movie than in the last 5 marvel movies combined together after 2 weeks of watching it still remember most of the dialogues the cast must have spent an unbelievable amount of effort to make it so coherent and polished we are lucky to share the same planet with these guys the acting by charlize theron and tom hardy is pure genius this is art of the highest level some of the scenes were so breathtaking that i wanted to cry my faith in humanity was restored by this movie go for the 3d iversion it is worth it,reality
i watched a lot of blockbusters they have some occupational diseases a giant pathos impenetrable stupidity lack of logic and normal stories faceless and boring characters all these diseases are successfully implemented in transformers fast and the furious the avengers iron man teenage mutant ninja turtles  from the universe of i know for a long time it was one of the favorite films of my childhood of course i could not ignore the new version and went to the moviesi went again i want to go again its awesome people in the marshes as if descended from the paintings of salvador dali goose bumps from the first chords of blind guitarist tears in my eyes from the death of the splendid angharad i forgot to blink i forgot to breathe after the end of the first chase i caught myself on the fact that nonstop kicking leg front seat fortunately it was empty in this film the actors play and play perfectly even top models usually just posing were able to show interesting and different characters especially abbey lee i just fell in love  it is the best film of this year alive bright original he quickly fast and the furious he is bigger avengers hes smarter than transformers forget the glamorous swords and boys in tights forget the stupid robots and dumb mutants there is no place for superman theres only road that can kill,reality
the first half of this movie was almost entirely dominated by special effects which obscured the story the second half was much more intense as the relationship between and furiosa developed charlize theron was marvelous as furiosa her character is the most developed and the one with whom the audience could empathize the same could not be said for he is a wanderer we know little else about him the world is harsh and is a battered wreck who is barely surviving furiosa is also battered but she is beautiful as well as heroic and idealistic she is willing to risk her life for others in a world where the value of human life is zero also is heroic but yet is still a wanderer the postapocalyptic world is presented starkly it is a wasteland where resources are scare and whoever controls the resources has power there is a dictator who reigns through terror and controls the resources he is the bad guy but is a good guy the cast is excellent their performances are powerful although this movie is science fiction its premise that civilization can collapse is not without plausibility tom hardy performs excellently as although brutalized maintains his dignity the question is whether he and furiosa and trust each other to find out what happens watch the movie,reality
i have nothing to say except seeing the unbelievable low rating and reviews for a movie won 6 oscarsmy opinion doesnt matter and 80  of the movie is practical stuff  tell me who is doing this in 21th century with all the stunts and the amazing acting of charliez or tom and non stop action for almost 2 hours with amazing soundtrack and the editing was omg and its a fantasy story in da 1st place and u find stupid reviews talking about intelligence and iq loland btw for the idiot hateres i am waiting for the next onego eat ur fingers,reality
oh i really wanted to like it but the action scenes while cool sometimes were repetitive and too fast it wasnt about much of anything and felt too fast and had too many villains at random where it was hard to follow visually stunning but emotionally overwhelming,reality
if you love period pieces about aristocrats  royalty that has shocking hand holding affairs  devastating ungloved slaps then this is not the film for youif you love flame thrower guitars fearsome custom built hotrods almost endless car chases 90 real dangerous stunts explosions an amazing soundtrack  just about everything else that is fueled by adrenaline  nitrousjust watch it,reality
i wanted to see this film for the longest time i missed the theatrical run and after buying the dvd at walmart and watching it tonight i have to admit i was impressed with the engrossing actionits all one hasty road runner epic with barely time to breath the pace is quick and you have to make sure you pay attention or youll miss out on important key points to the plot the miserable barbaric and totally cruel future is there which is the principle theme for these films a world where nobody trusts each other and everything is all about guns violence and saving the precious juice to make vehicles movethis time around theres beautiful and sacred pregnant women at stake and a hunt for the green place where everything is a utopian grassland and an escape from the desert an exciting goal for the story and even more exciting when theres a twist to the dream and the challenge to meet itthe violence is non stop and the desperate killing to survive is plainly evident in this film has flashbacks to the death of his wife and daughter and its too bad the film didnt focus more on that allowing the viewer to know the reason for angry and hauntingly bitter mentality to the bad guyscharlize theron is perfect as the rambo female but theres no kissing or romantic moments here with it was a brutal kill or be killed emotion between the two at the beginning but after the chaotic clashes with the raging villains they eventually learned to trust one anotherthe barbaric nuclear wasteland of a despairing future is an old clich but this movie brings a refreshing feel to that by making it into one wild and crazy race in the road warrior the highway chase was saved towards the end along with the climactic finale but here the chase is through the whole movie tom hardy is excellent as and charlize is equally excellent as the sherambo but the super quick movements of the characters makes it seem like the film was playing on high speed instead of running at a normal rate regardless of the flaws this movie delivers on entertainment and continuous suspense its all ontheedgeofyour seat excitement i highly recommend it,reality
one of the greatest films ever fury road is an action masterpiece delivered by george miller from the very begging of the movie till the end you get satisfied by astonishing action sequences never experienced beforethe world has collapsed due to a nuclear holocaust and apparently all cultural and technological progress has stagnated the protagonist tom hardy an excop now captive in the citadel of a ruthless and cruel leader named immortal joe whose army the war boys is hungry for war and has one purpose fight and die for immortal joedialogue among the protagonists of the movie is minimized they talk if they need to talk the only thing they care is to survive in the wasteland they try to reach a theoretic utopia being motivated by the hope and the need to escape from the tyrannical armies of the desertthese 2 hours will thrill you for sure it is important to mention that all this action scenes with the excellent cinematography are mixed together so perfect that will make you want to watch the movie more than once,reality
firstly many people whove seen this title without watching the originals say that its just one long car chase scene well welcome to the world of since the beginning has always been about a world gone and a world where people only understand violence and cars not a bad world really however fury road does give a good story behind the epic car chase with a relatively sane furiosa risking everything to help save a group of female sex slaves from an evil postapocalyptic warlord immortan joe with unfortunate getting tied up in the middle and kicking some serious ass in the process as with the previous entrys in the series fury road doesnt massively focus on he is a very important character but he is greatly tied up in other peoples affairs to summarize fury road is a fast paced action film with great acting and some very well scripted moments with brilliant costume design an epic original score and some amazing visuals you can do a lot worse than fury road and not much better,reality
george millers nightmare postapocalypse vision is told primarily through kinetic visuals with dialogue provided only when needed yet its so simple a story hes telling that the visuals are pretty much all that are needed miller relies on the visceral to move his story along this all works because the dystopian world miller and coscenarists brendan mccarthy and nico lathouris creates is complete with history customs and rituals fully developed and identifiable the viewer doesnt need a whole lot to buy in this is also true in relation to the main characters furiosa charlize theron and tom hardy they dont have a lot to say but you get them immediately miller consistently comes up with imaginative set pieces theres a knockout sandstorm and a nice monochromatic section is an interesting alternative to the mostly daylight actionthe production design is by colin gibson and displays as much gothic grotesquery as he possibly can there are alabaster bald children weird midgets and startlingly obese men on wild display and that guitar player swinging from the front of the truck gave me the creeps he gets tremendous makeup artistry from a team led by lesley vanderwalt elka wardega and damian martin every ugly imageand there are manyis beautifully rendered everything is fulltilt here but fortunately john seales cinematography and margaret sixels editing are up to the task miller has thrown away the campy shtick that was beyond thunderdome in order to revisit and fortify the series original raison detre a despairing view of a world gone insane due to a dependency on oil its relevance is just as timely as it was back in the days of the road warrior and even though its a heady theme this entry is just as entertaining as the road warrior was only turned up to eleven the soundtrack is by junkie xl he of the remix of elvis a little less conversation and its very good,reality
fury road is one of my favourite films of 2015 and without question one of the absolute best films gracing this years best picture category at the academy awards its absolutely one of the biggest surprises in the category i had feared the film would be written off as an action movie but was overjoyed to see it up for the big prize as well as 9 other possible prizestheres something so special about a movie like this proof that strong and interesting female characters can lead one of the most ballstothewall action movies that i have seen in my entire life the titular is present and tom hardy does an excellent job but he plays more of a secondary character in the movie he doesnt say much but manages to only keep the badassery up around 150 charleze theron is a force of nature as furiousa in this movie as well and leads the movie in a way that women are almost never given the opportunity to do in action filmscombining feminist overtones criticisms of the patriarchy and our reliance on fuel are things that many action films wouldnt touch with a 1000 foot pole but does that and still includes more impressive and amazing action than any other action movie has in yearsthe cinematography and visual effects that this movie employs are some of the best ive ever seen and there seems to be a seamless blending of real and computer generated effects from start to finish this creates an epic and amazing feeling that so many action films try for and fall short if this doesnt win best picture it would border on criminal to deny it the effects awards its up foran absolutely stunning achievement that needs to be seen by everyone if you havent gotten up on this one yet i cant imagine why for the life of meas i have with the previous films i kept an eye on the number of those characters who were not white cisgendered heteronormative characters and even an eye on the bechdel test the movie passes the bechdel test but unfortunately doesnt have a hugely diverse cast that said the presence of immensely strong female characters is a refreshing change and is probably the most unique of the nominees so far,reality
fury road as explosive and highoctane of a film that it is  and it really is ceases to surpass this bloodpumping novelty that draws the masses each time a film drops with the muchneeded structural pretext and development a world as intriguing and terrifying as this inherently demands it ought to just be called fury road because i just cannot see any of in this the normally hardasnails lacked the context dialogue and gritty propensity that was manifested in the lead character in previous titles he felt as empty and overly solemn as the wasteland he traversed and left a characteristic powervacuum that was taken up only by the assertiveness of furiosa something that eviscerated the burning impetus that ultimately once defined this series the brutal skinoftheteeth fight for survival  something this films lethargic near vegetative could never realistically confront the overreliance on flamethrowing guitars as cool as they are feels like a comedic misplacement in a film that is allegedly post apocalyptic it seems too kidfriendly with marketability that is appallingly and obviously aimed to accommodate the widest possible audience without completely eliminating the essence of the series that unfortunately means a big cutdown on the lore and back story components that are farcically underestimated in modern hollywood film sequels and remakes and dare i say even most new titles the new mentality is that which will blow the box office to smithereens forget originality alas the film does not suffer utter disintegration ill cede that the art style feels distinctively the cars locations sheep skulls and so on it is admittedly visually astounding the chase scenes masterfully choreographed the deaths gloriously vicious the only pressing question left to be asked is where is himself one day he may return8110,reality
witness me blood bag witness i live i die i live againtheres one word that comes to my mind after watching fury road and thats the word madness this is a perfect visualization of what the term madness means i truly believe that the creators and writers of this hallucinatory trip were fed with hallucinogens a spacious cocktail of exotic mushrooms barbiturates and other drugrelated products otherwise i wouldnt know how they could think up this crazy wacky postapocalyptic film a film that feels as if it consists of a single action scene youre not given a moment to catch your breath its undeniable that this movie adopted the concept of from 1979 a legendary cult film with young mel gibson in a leading role the same desolate and parched australian landscape with a shortage of water and petrol governed by fanatical gangsi must confess ive already watched this film a while ago and i never saw the need to publish my review i thought that my opinion would contribute nothing to the general opinion that you could read here and there on the internet everyone uses the same superlatives and glorifying terms for this extravagant action movie in general everybody agrees this is an insanely great explosive ingenious and never tedious rebootits loud its unrelenting its crazily exciting and at times its just bloody weird why repeat this again i thought to myself over and over again but recent events forced me to rewrite it a bit and highlight an additional aspect thats applicable to todays eventswe return to the scorching desert in a postnuclear world where people struggle to survive and follow crazy figures that rule over vital resources such as oil and water someone like immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne who thinks hes a kind of god and tyrannically keeps his followers in his grip he rules the citadel an old water reservoir and has his own private army of fanatical war boys this episode shows how this lawless gang of lunatics start chasing imperator furiosa charlize the italian job theron she kidnapped joes harem including zoe kravitz daughter of shes later assisted by rockatansky tom hardy who serves the first half hour as a living blood supply for war boy nux nicholas houltafter the terrorist attacks in europe and hearing a debate about the motives of a suicide bomber i came to the conclusion that the creepy war boys exhibit similar characteristics they follow blindly a charismatic leader and sacrifice themselves for the greater goal a hero status is awaiting them when killed in battle they earn a one way ticket to a paradise they call valhalla by sacrificing themselves they become immortal in one fell swoop strange but after the is attacks i immediately thought of this brainwashed gang a similar motivation and the same destructive selfsacrificeand then theres the guitarist firmly attached with elastics whos stirring up the troops into action while hes playing his flamethrowing guitar an absurd image amidst total chaos similar to the drummer at the forefront during the battles at waterloo or piper bill who walked undisturbed on the beach with his bagpipes at normandy landings in wwiiits evident that every fiction film contains comparables with reality sometimes but beyond these serious digressions that overtook me i can only recommend to watch and enjoy this macho blockbuster filled with actionpacked chase scenes with futuristic cars a with diesel and gun smoke smelling stunner that deserves to be titled furiosa fury road charlize theron effortlessly outperforms nicholas hoult its not who demands the lions share of attention you can call him drip feed insteadmore reviews here  httpbitly1kidqmt,reality

fury road was among the projects breaks jaws those that everyone around the corner we are afraid that hollywood encroaches too much on the film and that offers us a real flavor without typical blockbuster and its been almost fifteen years they are trying to make this film and finally gets a big slap in the mouth with this masterpiecethis film is an action for two hours without a break before we spring this fully filled movie with a peach of hell its all we could hope for but bettergeorge miller finally returns to the front of the stage 30 we lost miller is trying to more family films to pass babe even when it makes a big difference and i do not see a drive babe ford falcon but back then even if it is at the age of special effects green screen miller back with a big smile by telling us that 80 of films are taken from real hell it is so class it thats real crazy movie that we open our eyes to blow sumptuous postapo universe with waterfalls outsizedof the first scene we find who turns his back on us and already a certain class you feel a kind of charisma through how to filmed and decor as well as posture and bang of the first seconds the film is already laid and who we swallowed a lizard with two heads that living dragged its feet the strength of the characters is that there is no need to present them for an hour for we see we can only appreciated throughout the film we will ever feel alongside and furiosa so much so that at times we find in almost breathless i like tom hardy but i was wondering what it was going to replace mel gibson is not easy thing and yet it beautifully in fate he takes the character for him and imposes it touches there was a more tormented than ever plagued by visions that will disorient much as help but ultimately the most captivating and almost the main character is not but furiosa wonderfully interpreted by charlize theron who offers us his best performance and especially the most badass who would shake the machete or other blackmamba then to immortan joe is the evil with a capital m a sort of guru who promises his kamikaze access to valhalla that treats its women as cows or sexual slaves and who satisfies his people to blow drop water the prototype of guy we want to burn bright the quartering of the live skinning etc everything is like the road in the title angry the band sounds great electric guitar shot to overkill signed junkie xl v8 engines it smells like gasoline violence despair brutality everything we love whatbut lets talk about like junkie xl that level sounds made us enjoy during the whole movie a soundtrack overkill that had always just implanting the pace it takes up but what we take with it in fact i am goes to listen to while writing this criticism history of being in the right trip this is not a first attempt it has already made the soundtrack of several films including divergent or 300 the birth of an empire and man of steel mostly with a very good side nag as i love here the music is almost essentially on wild percussion and heavy electric guitar riffs which we see throughout the film guitarist hung before his slaps in the middle of other jalopy with guitar spitting fire with all that i become almost looking forward to see what we will do junkie xl batman vs superman onthe only gripe we could do to the film is that it has a somewhat simplistic scenario but by going to see is not coming to see a psychological film we come to see the action and at this level it is only filled after we can still see in the film some subjects or legal but the film loses it in we see feminism human cruelty we see it the fittest in particular we see environmental problems  we see a critique of consumer society aquacola emissions festin mc  if we want serious subjects are found but it is not the purpose of the filmthe goal is just to treat ourselves and this is exactly what the movie that being so long since i had not put ten out of ten so clearly i strongly advice this film to everyone the whole world must see this masterpiece ,reality
if you havent seen a flick dont be bothered because it doesnt follow what happened before well some flashbacks may refer to it but still it do stands alone this flick on the other hand it is a typical flick so for those who are into postapocalyptic flicks this is a must seenever had any problems with those kind of flicks for me it clocked in over 2 hours and that was way too long the first part until they start driving is okay and enjoyable but after a while the only thing we get to see is driving and driving and collisions and crashes and a predictable ending i admit that does make a flick but it took to longon part of the effects it all worked well some are done incamera the others pure cgi because it couldnt be done for real so if you arent into postapocalyptic flicks style then dont watch it if you think you will see something new but for the geeks of watch itgore 05 nudity 05 effects 45 story 255 comedy 05,reality
ive really enjoyed this sequel prequel remake or whatever it isset in the same apocalyptic world as the original trilogy this movie provides about two hours of continuously actionits also nice that the components of the story are not revealed eg whats that milk used for you have to figure this out by yourselfthe characters are also cool the girls are beautiful and is developed in just the way he is meant to be also ive never seen charlize theron ugly in a movie before overall its a very good work for george miller but the movie needs something more to become a legend like the original moviethis 8 ratting comes just because im expecting something more from this movie or pack of future movies than just action naked girls desert and so on im hoping that fury road it is just the beginning for what will come a trilogy that will definitely resurrect the original than just make money by reminding people about the series with the same name,reality
i have to admit im not a fan of the original trilogy im not necessarily saying that they are bad films well the third one is they just never seemed to leave an impact on me however this film is so good i went to see it twice fury road isnt technically a sequel nor is it a remake its a reboot of a beloved franchise as you can imagine although im not a fan of the series my expectations were pretty low especially in this day and age where hollywood keeps churning out more and more terrible pg13 remakes of wellrespected action films from the previous century however the reviews for the film were phenomenal so i offered for some of my friends to come see it with me thankfully i was pleasantly surprised as it far surpassed my expectationswhen i first heard that tom hardy was going to replace mel gibson as the titular hero i was actually quite excited tom hardy is one of my favourite actors of our time and he has demonstrated on more that one occasion that he has a flare for accents although i thought someone like hugh jackman would be more suited for this role as he is able to perfectly blend humour with seriousness also hes australian so he wouldnt have to put on an accent like tom hardy does however after watching this twice i think tom hardy did a good job there were times where i could hear a hint of bane and even christian bales batman in his voice but this film doesnt use much dialogue because george miller wants to focus more on visual storytelling which im all for i love 2001 a space odyssey after all tom hardy isnt the only great actor in this film though charlize theron and nicholas hoult both give excellent performances also nicholas is able to pull of the australian accent well and charlize theron finally provides us with a female protagonist on par with ripley and sarah connor even hugh keaysbyrne returns to franchise to play an even more intimidating villain you could really identify with the heroes and you wanted things to go their way as for the villains you wanted them to fail so that hope could prevail the best part of the film of course is the action sequences which there are many i might add i love slowpaced thrillers but im still a guy a guy who is a sucker for pretty explosions just not when michael bay does it every sequence is well thought out and perfectly executed i was on the edge of my seat the entire time as i was completely in awe of what i was witnessing on screen it really was as tom hardy said we were getting a glimpse into george millers mind his direction was superb although things got crazy and a little silly at times despite this i felt worried for the characters on screen as well as the actors who played them most of the effects on the film were practical which im pleased to see i despise how in action films today there is just cgi everywhere so it was refreshing to see an action film successfully utilise practical effects which look much better in my opinion however the cgi that was used looked spectacular and was always necessary thankfully this film has substance as well as style some people have said that they dont understand the story but i understand it perfectly honestly its not hard to decipher im excited for the upcoming sequels where hopefully they will expand upon what was created with this film i love the social commentary and the environmentalist message that this film had to offer and it really made me think about the corruption that power can bring and the horrible consequences that can come from wasting the earths natural resources as far as im concerned there was no matrix level complexity to the plotin conclusion this film is amazing and you should definitely go and see it i will say that it is definitely a guy film though however if you love fastpaced action explosions awesome cars an action film with a plot and tom hardy then this is the film for you seriously though who doesnt like that stuff,reality
wow i just got back from the theatre and i have to say that fury road is one the most insane blood gutting intense visual pieces of cinema work ive seen in yearsgeorge miller returns to the universe after many decades and presents us with a modern fastpaced style of what is likely going to be a new series of films the story takes place in a postapocalyptic world where resources are scarce when imperator furiosa charlize theron lead a group of rebels on a daring escape through the wasteland she forges an alliance with tom hardyand from there it is a high speed car chase from thereone of the things that i appreciate from this movie is how most of the stunts are all practical with a small usage of cgi that paid off well as the action and stunt work is eye popping but it is all executed effectively without it making it look like a sloppy messin terms of plot there is not much of it you might have trouble understanding on what the story is and i had difficulty with it too but this movie isnt designed for hard plot and if you are expecting that then be prepared to be let downthe action and soundtrack were on point in terms of acting it was decent at best although the title of the film is it felt like more of charlize theron film as tom hardy barely got enough screen time as moving on tom hardys performance was average but this can be due to a lack of proper screen time as well the constant flashbacks were distracting as it was never really explained why or what happened on that dayoverall this is a film you dont want to miss dont let negative reviews on here prevent you from seeing it at the end of the day you are the judge of the film after all film is subjective in taste,reality
fury road is the 4th film in the series from director george miller and the first to be released in 30 years it takes part in a postapocalyptic future where humanitys survivors are battling for lifesaving and potential life resources such as gasoline and water the movie stars tom hardy replacing mel gibson in the title role in the previous movies as and charlize theron as imperator furiosa i have heard that this film takes part in between the 2nd film the road warrior and the 3rd film  beyond thunderdome prior to this i had only seen the first film  which i admit i did not like partially because there was practically no explanation that it was an postapocalyptic setting which i believe was explained in the next movie long story short the action sequences  all in the form of action taking part in or around automobile chases is indeed first rate in terms of the story  i had heard you had not needed to see the others but it would give you depth my gut tells me that seeing the 2nd film would have increased my enjoyment significantly particularly as the film is not too dialogue heavy in the about the first half of the film so with that mind the action sequences make it a fun thrill ride and the actors do well with what is given when i get a chance to see the other movies i will certainly revisit this one and it may improve for now  3  stars out of 4 stars  8  out of 10 stars,reality
after seeing the road warrior i wanted to see if the great australin director george miller still had it in him to make very great action films turned out that i was really enjoying this film first the pros so now that george miller has a greater budget he is able to do more with this film first of all there are great action scenes in this film ive never seen greater action since die hard the sets are good to the whole set is just a desert but thats what makes it goodafter all the film is set in the apocalypse the villain is pretty cool to he had a lot to do in this film by the way i must warn you that this film is crazy there are psychotic people everywhere in this film for example theres one part in the movie where the camera pans over a guy on a massive truck that is playing a guitar and when he plays it fire shoots out of itenough said the movie is sorta short on story but when it is directed in a way that makes it fun and action packed then your going to have a great movie so i really like fury road it had great action intense moments and great direction this is easily the best film of 2015,reality
not just cars and flames fury roadfury road is one of my favorite films of all time because it explores complex emotions in a simple setting this film can be watched over and over again because it is so exciting fastpaced and emotional i admit that the trailer seemed like a liveaction mario kart but when i first saw the film i was in shock and awean actionfilled wasteland that is constantly moving the world of is chillingly similar to our own glory is given to machinery and power and the flat desert acts as an expansive stage to display all the action this film was a wild ride from start to finish filled with exciting clies and poignant moments as well as spectacular action sequences its advertised as a chaotic 2hour car chase and it is but the characters inside the vehicles have strong motivations and literally drive the film forward to an exciting conclusion this is the main factor that separates the film from other action films both the female and male characters have believable strengths and weaknesses and the female protagonists are given tangible drives that dont revolve around romance which was refreshing and empoweringthe action sequences have their merit but would not have been successful without the depth of character a devoted warrior battling over loyalty and glory a shell of a man determined to find a purpose and a highranking warrior searching for redemption give the story layers and meaning though the individual stories of the characters could have been explored more deeply the nuances they were given allows the audience to invest in their journeythe technical aspects the cinematography and quality of the props namely the entirely real cars and explosions created a striking look of professionalism and spectacle to make the film even more exciting and raw the rawness of this film in terms of the costumes makeup props and stark desert landscape set it apart as a world of its own where the audience is transported the score created the aura of this industrial world of metal and sand with pounding drums and screeching guitars adding to the chaos each car chase is fueled emotionally and the quieter scenes of the film explain where that emotion is coming from the score creates emotional peaks and valleys from the intense rock music to epic orchestral themes carrying the audience on a wild ride through the film the pacing of the film was a bit erratic but was all a part of the chaos of the warring clans of the wasteland i was out of breath by the end confused and slightly shocked but also very satisfied,reality
how they managed to make a 2 hour car chase increasingly exciting and entertaining is beyond me i have never seen a film that balances nonstop action with story as well as this one secondly the lack of cgi is incredible and only adds to the movie it is a beautiful movie at that some of the shots are breathtaking in the middle of chaos all the action is frenetic but easy to follow a hard feat to accomplish the characters are surprisingly endearing even with minimal development another very hard feat if you love action then watch this movie if youre sick of cgi then watch this movie we all have our own opinions but dont trust the packs of pessimistic trolls on this website this is a good movie have a little fun see what the hype is about and form your own opinion,reality
back in 1979 george miller made his first feature film a gritty little action picture that was as meanspirited as it was exciting the movie was a hit and was followed by an apocalyptic sequel called road warrior which was also a hit but which underwhelmed me and beyond thunderdome which i didnt like any better and the game fury road which beautifully combines the grit and excitement of the first movie with the big budget action that followedis broken down haunted by the people he failed to save concerned with nothing but survival but this isnt really his story in a surprise move become an unwilling part of another heros story her name is imperator furiosa and she is as tough and determined and heroic as ever wasthe movies feminist vibe with tough gunshooting chicks versus an army of bald macho religious zealots consumed with war and honor drove some mens rights people crazy but it shouldnt first off is still a tough guy doing a lot of cool stuff and second the movie is about 5 feminism to 95 of the most intense heartthumping action full of explosions and destruction that 5 though is what keeps the movie from being a hollow exercise in special effects like the avengers for all the action this is a film with a vision and a film about actions consequences bravery redemption hope and all that good stuffi have a few issues with the plot the final plan relies on one of many warring city states doing something basically suicidal and the final moment is a standard hero clich that feels false and unconvincing in the context of the movie but overall this is everything an action movie should be,reality
i didnt wanted to see this movie in the beginning but when i saw so many good reviews to it i decided to check it out i was blown away by how well done and directed this movie was fr had so many good visual effects seeing so many cars exploding and people getting blown in the sky was mind blowing and it was even more spetacular when i realized those stunts were real the direction by george miller was really good all those sound effects were also great but i do think this movie is a bit overrated my reasons why the villain was not that good he was only there doing bad stuff and the lead protagonist wasnt that interesting he only said like 100 words and was just there kicking ass mos of the time on the other hand furiosa charlize theron and nicholas hoults characters were really good and developed specially nicholas hoult i was gladly surprised by him overall this movie has amazing action and direction final grade 710,reality
full time action over nearly 2 hours usually i get bored after five minutes of action because in most movies action is only for the sake of itself maybe this is the first time that character building has been done through speed action at least it is that the first time that it worked out so what went wrong not getting an oscar for best screenplay best directing or best picture for what i can say there is not much talk in that movie but to me still too much talking injects a kind of civilization that did not match the behavior of the lunatic tribes another problem the action scenes are so complex and one scene transforming into the next it must be nearly impossible to manage the overview during directing and editing and you can see it  sometimes the scenes dont fit correctly on one time arrow this irritates another criticism which is not fair because the movie is so great anyway is the overblown happy end way too much collective salvation at the end all in all huge effort by george miller taking all the risks and trying to make an impossible movie ah yes and is incredible entertaining the stakes are high for the next at least for tom hardy it should be possible to do better he is a great actor and made 5 great movies 2015 it would be nice if hardy can manage to get more into the character of next time,reality
as the oscars this year show this is one of the best movies you can watch it has everything from epic costumes and battles to a person playing metal while hanging in front of a truck with a flaming guitar this movie can hold on the edge of your seat for the whole duration and it brings so much epicness that you wont have to watch another action movie in the next couple of months and if that is not enough it has a great story too even though its not perfect the movie certainly compensates that with visual and audio effects and did i mention the awesome costumes they are amazing overall its a killer movie one you should definitely watch witness me,reality
fury road is the continuation of the franchise that started in 1979 it is directed by george miller the director of the original films and stars tom hardy as and charlize theron as furiosa now this movie is one of a kind first off this movie is actionpacked and it never lets up the other movies have been known for their action sequences and their craziness but never before has it been so fleshed out fury road has the best action sequences ever put to film the thing that makes this action so awesome is the fact that george miller made sure that most of these sequences were practical effects that means all the stunts and all the explosions that you see are real and that is just awesome another that i mentioned how crazy the franchise is all the movies except the first one are taken place in the apocalypse where oil and gasoline are precious resources as you can imagine people will start going crazy and in fury road it gets really insane you see some of the weirdest most overthetop characters that are just insane some people might find it too insane so when you see this movie you need to know what youre getting into i also have to give props to the direction of this movie george miller took his old franchise reignited it and introduced it to a new generation the performances are also great charlize theron as furiosa is probably one of the greatest female heroines in film she embodies her character and she is arguably the main character of this movie tom hardy as is also really great in his role lastly i think this movie will stand the test of time because of how rewatchable it is ive watched 4 times not and it never gets old if theres anything bad to say about this movie it would be what other people have said the movie doesnt have a lot of plot or character development and that has detracted from other peoples feelings about this movie me personally i dont think it needs it and that the movie is already amazon without it overall this is not only the best film not only is this the best action movie of the decade this is one of my favorite movies of all time,reality
as a fan of the first at first i thought this was going to be too sterile relying heavily on cgi but the effects and editing are so good you barely notice that they are created on a computerthe action is relentless and the cinematography quite superb set against some stunning scenery its not shakespeare but it is a classy piece of film makingits hard to compare tom hardy with a 1980s mel gibson and if i have any complaint to make its that he tries a little too hard to be and ends up being more like bronson but theron is excellent in a sigourney weaver action figure sort of waythis is true enough to the original to be enjoyable and its one of the fastestpaced action thriller rides youll ever see the action just keeps on coming its relentless and very excitingthe original was quirky and this continues in that trend take it for what it is and you just cant fault it,reality
is a movie about human nature in the most basic format in a desert environment the social relationships can be exposure in your imum form and is it exactly the main point of fury road was made with a critical vision of the social structure in the 90s business environment where the boss owns the employees have a constant racing to a achieve a oasis the war for petroleum kill many people and you cant scape from this system this is the core of franchise but this movies goes beyond the critical of how women has been treated the objectification and oppression is clear but the best lesson is how women can organize and fight against this system of oppression is one of the best movies about the social submission human nature continuous auto destruction from mantoman and hope,reality
this is the movie in 20 years tons of directors will say it was the one who made them wanted to be in the business it will have the same impact as terminator 2 or die hard or any big colossal action movie its just perfect on how makes the action telling a story being the main basis on the narrative there is little time to breathe on this thrill ride and still we know exactly everything thats going onyes the movie is mostly about furiosa and says hi but maybe it wouldnt have been possible to do it on other way lets just enjoy this action masterpiece to exist and influence millions over the next years it will be high regarded on the history of action film making mostly because its old school all over againplease go and see it,reality
this remake of classic bmovie 1979the movie that made mel gibson a star in one day is george millers attempt to refilm the first and best known film of his career with a budget thousand times bigger than the one available in 1979the result is visually impressive absolutely grotesque good and bad heroes fight for gas in a postapocalyptic future society in a movie that can only be described as postmodern and cyberpunk the exhilarating action is so intense that even the rotten tomatoes critic got curried away and gave it an almost perfect score 97 tom hardy known for inception and the dark knight rises has become the next big thing in hollywood due to this remake charlize theron an absolutely top actress overall is simply great in the postfeminist role of imperator furlosa nevertheless as one might expect the fight for gas idea which was original innovative and to the point in 1979 has not aged very well and seems quite ridiculous today still the movie is top notch as an action film with some very funny moments and you will remember it for some time not for its nonexistent deeper meanings but for its overambitious and grotesque cyberpunk environmentgrade b,reality
if the world ran out of oil gas and water if it transformed into a giant desert where humanity soon devolved into savage killerswho would truly care about furthering the human race who would try their best to find a place to live permanentlyto rebuild society for the next generation george millerdirector of the previous 3 films makes an argument that its the women it makes sense when you think about it women get pregnant men dont they have a certain maternal instinct that could drive them to make the world better for their children while the men go crazyin the case of the films villains or drift aimlessly from place to placehimself this is why imperator furiosacharlize theron feels like the main character she drives the film forwardfiguratively and literally while tom hardy simply drifts along the fact that is an extra in his own movie isnt bad and its not entirely new as a character hes not that interesting he gets to engage in a couple cool moments but mostly hes just a haunted shell of a man his mind fixated on the past in the film he is captured by the pale baldheaded forces of immortan joe whose evil empire has found a way to control water supply bringing thousands of people to his mercy finds an opportunity to escape when the aforementioned furiosa a soldier working for the bad guy tries to smuggle joes concubines out of his captivity and to a mysterious green place across the desert where they can be safe also along for the ride is nuxnicholas hoult who gets to have a couple sweet and funny moments along the way what follows is not just a 2hour long car chase but an exercise in visual storytelling the films have always taken inspiration from chaplin and buster keaton according to george miller at times fury road feels like a silent movie even with the thumping soundtrack theres almost no talking and when there is dialogueit actually isnt exposition a miracle in itself the film treats its chases not as thrill rides but as art the thrill comes later each chase is like a line of dominoes getting longer and more complex by the minute and by the time they all collapse youre left thinking how are they gonna top that whats more remarkable is that they keep doing so im not going to list action scenes because thats boring and pointless see it for yourself in a culture obsessed with continuity and expanded universes its refreshing to see a movie where it just doesnt matter miller has said that is an anthology but it really doesnt matter people arguing whether this is a reboot or a sequelwhere in the time line it fits in are missing the point it doesnt matter have i said that enough fury road hearkens back to simpler time when people watched movies and enjoyed them for what they were much has been said of therons furiosa shes feminist propagandashes a strong female role modelshes a character made to pander to women no no no shes just a character a strong character driven by maternal instincts and bravery shes one of the best characters of the year not female characters not male characters just characters hardy doesnt really get to do more than grunt and whisper but he does that pretty well and his presence already adds enough gravity to the film its also visually stunning with 90 practical effects im going to say that again 90 practical effects overall is a film that demands to be seen it yanks its audience with it on a thrill ride that doesnt stop and leaves your mouth open and your heart beating hours after you leave,reality
i was told that this was a reboot of an old franchise but as i hadnt seen the previous movies this was all new to me to be honest i wasnt expecting it to be an intelligent piece of sciencefiction to my surprise thats exactly what it turned out to be as well as being noisy violent fastpaced brilliantly edited full of dark humour and on the whole wellacted charlize theron tom hardy and a barely recognisable nicholas hoult are certainly excellent in the leading roles the production design costumes and makeup are all superbly realised the twohour running time flew by the ending was perfect all in all i enjoyed it a lot,reality

george miller take a bow on and off  then 12 years in the making this high octane action flick was worth the wait it took so long that mel gibson could not longer be considered instead pommy tom hardy was cast as and in this instalment he is actually not that but just determined to survive his oppressors in a post apocalyptic desert wasteland where gasoline  water are gold the cruel despot  ruler of the unfortunate masses is immortan joe played by the same actor as the villain in the original 79 flick he imprisons women for breeding but also another rare commodity  their breast milk enter our heroine furiosa charlize theron who is a rig driver sent by joe to acquire a gasoline haul however she has other intentions that of finding sanctuary and with her sudden diversion a frenetic chase begins and boy what a chase at this stage is just a passenger an ex cop he is just used for his blood transfusions to satisfy joes insane warriors but furiosa has a secret cargo 5 of joes beautiful wives all in it for freedom too when joe finds this out he is furious and with a huge convoy of monster cars trucks rigs  bikes the pursuit is on can be trusted to help furiosa with her quest anyway there is very little dialogue but just enough to get the jist of the plot the rest is amazing action filmed on location in the namibian desert  produced free of green screen technology there are incredible stunts including a memorable sequence through a deadly sandstorm it is loud the vibrations  explosions rock the cinema along with an amazing soundtrack compliments of junkie xl as a movie fan jg thinks the unsung hero here is the cinematographer he delivers the most incredibly filmed action chase this century a sensational big screen experience folksthe real fast  furious,reality

i will start by saying that this was quite an impressive movie to say the least the opening scene started like a first chord of a beethoven music sheet  strong cool and impressive the spectator knew then somehow that he would be in for a strong ridethere is no point denying that the scenery is just absolutely stunning  magnificent  exceptional that point must certainly constitute the strongest part of the movie it compliments extremely well the action scenes a slick neutral but also extremely dry and rough environment in which the characters can go about in their own groups or one against another flawlesslywhile it also true that i read that the movie did lack a clear story or that it wasnt strong enough a fact which is somewhat true i do think this was personal take of the writers to privilege action more than the intellectual part and i think it did work well this would have been atrocious to combine such impressive actions scenes with boring dialogsthe story in itself is doubtlessly quite basic and the whole of it turns somewhat around a pursuit i did have a hard time picking up on the plot which was quite confusing until some point where you actually get the actual gist of the thing but i do feel however and in comparison to other movies of the same genre that it plays positively in the hands of the movie one of the things that i particularly hate with action movies is the fact that you can read the story before it even starts it did not feel that way with this propositionfocusing on some of the characters even if some of the characters roles were quite limited in regards to the overall weight they played in the story certain surprising actors such as abbey lee kershaw delivered one has to know that she does not initially come from acting but was an exmodel and for one of her first blockbusters have to admit that she lived up to the expectations her unusual distinctive beauty and cold naturally captivating distance that was her strength in top modeling served her quite well there she was much more convincing that i thought she would because she was tailor made for this rolerosie huntingtonwhiteley was not bad either though i thought she could have been a little bit better its actually a pity that her role did not last long enough to really have a serious idea about her in this particular movie to finish on this particular point the depth of characters and persona throughout is really just superb i dont think ive ever seen a movie with such a large palette of personalities of all kinds it comes from bizarre repulsive looking people to normal looking individuals to beautiful ethereal nymphs all cohabiting in a very hostile environmentthe sustained action scenes raise two aspects first a positive one the movie is fast pace and there is no time for bore the action scenes go from being extremely artistic at times to jaw dropping  with the help of slick well shot scenery to complement themim not much into action movies to start with but this one i have enjoyed a lot to say the least,reality
attempting to piece together the chronology of rockatanskys fourmovie journey between 1979 and 2015 would be to miss the point of the series altogether 1979 was a raw slice of grindhouse that just happened to be financially successful and genuinely brilliant and has since evolved into something so wildly imaginative and increasingly insane that to try and piece together how many years have elapsed since mel gibsons youthful main force patrol officer watch his family murdered and how he has suddenly shrunk and become tom hardy would be as deranged as the franchises latest instalment fury roadwhether its a reboot or a continuation of the story we havent seen since 1985s beyond thunderdome we are plunged back into the familiar postapocalyptic australian plains although it was shot in namibia inhabited by obscene punks raging warlords and ragged rebels following a nuclear holocaust fuel and water is scarce and the residents of the citadel are ruled over by the ageing immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne a hulking monster of a man with a breathing apparatus strapped to his face hardy is captured and is used as a blood bag for war boy nux nicholas hoult and when imperator furiosa charlize theron one of joes lieutenants goes awol with an armoured truck full of joes many wives nux and a small army pursue with strapped to the front of his vehiclelike its predecessors fury road has little in way of a plot similar in many ways to 2 the film is little more than one huge chase with precious few quiet moments in between hardy is as reserved a as gibson was but strangely lacks the charisma that has propelled hardy to recent superstardom yet is more in the background playing second fiddle to the battering ram that is furiosa one armed shavenheaded and raccooneyed theron is in equal measures extremely sexy and utterly intimidating offering glimpses of vulnerability as her trust in becomes more cemented furiosas drive is that she wants to get back to her homeland which is now little more than a distant memory from her childhood and just happens to be along for the ride but character development is left in the dust of what is ultimately one humongous chase set piecealthough he is now 70 and his recent work has consisted of happy feet 2006 happy feet 2 2011 and babe pig in the city 1998 director writer and producer george miler shows no signs of losing his touch fury road is the most aggressive yet complete with acrobats on huge wires who bend into other vehicles to attack from above war boys getting themselves pumped for violence by spraying a powerful drug called night fume onto their lips and an electric guitar player who sprays flame from his instrument and is backed by a hoard of drummers everyone involved in creating the stunts should be extremely proud as what could have been repetitive turns into a twohour adrenaline rush its not the masterpiece that it has been heralded by critics and audiences alike but it has breathed life back into a genre stuffed with cgi and former wrestlers,reality
this movie ranks in my best action movies and i havent said that in a while the thing that strikes me the most is the art direction george miller and his acolytes have created a very coherent universe that not just looks impressive but is very believable in the sense that it all fits together not that it could really happen you feel the desperation of everyone you taste the sand from the desert that gets everywhere and you understand the struggles such a dystopian society faces secondly kudos for the fact that almost all the female roles in this action movie have clout these gals can hold their own and then some they give very good performances even the secondary roles which i thought would be very weak when i saw the breeders i thought they would be the clich barbie dolls of the movie i was very pleasantly surprised to see these girl models can rub elbows with the other stars of the movies and contribute to the creation of the substance of this film and later with furiosas tribe these older women had real character this probably fits all very well because of a great script a script that could feel a bit clunky on paper but is masterfully brought to life by miller as for the two main actors the restraint that tom hardy shows or the boiling temper we sense in furiosa are outstanding i guess that since miller created this universe starting in the late 70s helps and it shows that this director started out before the cgi era the stunts are absolutely spectacular i thought i was back in the 70s with real car chases and explosions miller goes all out to bring a fabulous vision of a twisted future and believe me he achieves it 100 910,reality
an art house film disguised as a summer blockbuster fury road is an action masterpiece and arguably the greatest action film of all time a simple plot with characters who only speak when needed fury road proves action films can be more than mindless funtom hardy leads the film as a lone road warrior in a post apocalyptic wasteland who reluctantly gets involved in a chase between a warlord named immortan joe and a female warrior named furiosa after she steals joes most prized possessions his five wives they are young healthy women were taken from their homes when they were small and are locked away for the sole purpose of being breeders for joe he needs a young heir for when he passes as his current sons are deformed or dying themselvesthis film will go down as not only the best of 2015 but the best action film ever made thank you george miller,reality
yep this is one action movie  somewhat from the 1st to the last minute it goes bang bong and krapeng  and its well done action even if a little repetitive after a while so if 100 action and adrenalin in a darkdusty design is your kind of flick then it is a 10 out of 10 therefore it is understandable that it stays in the moment at 83 because many just seek for nothing else if you expect a bit more like deeper going characters dialogs acting story etc you will be disappointed because there is absolutely none of that sure action movies are not made for that in the first line but i saw good stuff combining story and action the non story here bases itself as so often on the fact that people need to godrive from point a to point b and making here a lot of noisy and crazy stuff when doing it but hey this picture goes even a step furtherthey go as well the same way back  wow that is genius i did not expected any real relation to the 1st and one and only even if the unrecognisable keaysbyrne was one but i did hope to get more from tom hardy and charlize theron damn they can act certainly tom hardy can but thats business and tom hardy knows it but i do hope for him that he is not ruining his career younger audience will be impressed by the action score design etc but anybody who likes cinema for people acting around a storythey will go home empty in there heads and one last thing before i close you need to see this on very big screen or even the action fans will be bored,reality
if you love action movies it will definitely be a great watch for you movie starts and within few minutes the movie gets too much tense all those cars oiltrucks motorcycles create a great havoc and it was enjoyable throughout but sometimes mindless action sequences get tedious after watching the movie i felt that characters were not much developed i wish i could know more about the protagonists and antagonists and the fight was too much against the odd which i didnt like that much in batman begins or xmen first class we can see initial development of the story which seemed lacking in this movie but anyway action sequences were great to watch and if you dont use your brain too much you would enjoy without any problem i wished a better story few memorable dialogue and some kind of believability in the script casting seemed good overall giving rating 7 for great action sequences,reality
i liked the idea of this movie tom hardy is excellent as and i hope he is in the next movie but i feel the movie could and should of been longer it was the same for every other movie too your at the edge of your seat the whole way through and suddenly it is over the action is brilliant especially for the last 20 minutes but the ending was not great i did not quite understand the way they left that city and then came back at the end i also feel it should not be r rated there was only one brief bloody scene at the end having said that it is quite a violent scene but i think it deserved a pg13 rating i am looking forward to the next movie and i hope tom hardy will star in it,reality
well put to one side the fact that half way through the screening i was at in newcastle a girl collapsed in the stairway which meant that i spent ten minutes or so helping her out she was fine in the end but it certainly added a degree of drama to a movie that is anything but short of thatits 30 years since george miller last directed a movie and in the interim hes treated us to rather more lightweight offerings such as babe and happy feetbut clearly its that has become his trade mark and this the fourth instalment with a fifth on the way is the best of the bunch in every respect other than the fact that mel gibson makes a better than tom hardy although truth be told this is as much if not more charlize therons movie as tom hardys she manages to look spectacularly beautiful throughout despite having her face covered in axle greaseits quite remarkable that a 70 year old man could imagine and then actually produce and direct a movie of this scale scope and energy in fact its mind bogglingand mind boggling is a very good word to describe the experience that is fury road i saw it in 3d but i dont think that added a lot to be honestthere is absolutely nothing intellectual to discuss about a movie that transports a bevy of beautiful breeders across the desert and back again on board a tanker full of breast milkthe dialogue when you can hear it is pretty vacuous the bevy of beauties are pretty vacuous but who cares because its such a splendid romp and a visual treat from get go to end creditstime and again ones jaw drops as the sheer audaciousness of the endless vehicle chases as they unfold like most goodybaddie movies it is remarkable how inept the baddies are at killing the goodies who by contrast seem to kill with gay abandon barely a shot or a strike not hitting its markbut if you can park your critical faculties at the door sit back and just steep yourself in two hours of ott nonsense then you will be treated to pure pleasure for almost every framecracking,reality
i like my action films especially if theyre done with style and originality it might surprise you therefore to hear that ive never seen the original films maybe it was mel gibson that put me off i never thought he was a good actor although i did really enjoy how i spent my summer vacation anyway i feel it gives me the objectivity to properly address the merits of fury road it feels like so much more than the sum of its parts  its certainly not tom hardys best work to date although he makes a sufficiently game so the way is open for charlize theron and nicholas hoult to steal the show early on i found myself distracted by questions of how most people survive in this dystopian future but the whole thing steamrollers its way across the screen with such demented fun that i soon forgot all about that if you dont like explosions and lots of shouting this might not be the film for you having said that the mayhem is punctuated by moments of calm to make sense of the narrative and when all hell is breaking loose which is most of the time it puts michael bay to shame shame on you michael bay why cant you make films as good as this the budgets are certainly big enough where was i oh yes sum of its parts plot really what plot if its plot your after dont come looking for it here i havent seen a film with such a paperthin one since well erjohn wick okay not that long ago but my point is still valid which is that there isnt much of a plot but who cares when its so damn cool also see it in 3d no really i usually hate 3d versions of films but this is worth it just for one scene late on in the film relax no spoilers i had a great time watching this at the cinema what a day what a lovely day,reality
i cant say this was an excellent movie but it does make for a breath of fresh air in a world of technology filled thrillers and scifi rehashes going in to this i expected very little and was very surprised when i walked out of the theater the characters are all strong i would have liked a little more in the film but it gave enough of an introduction and a back story that when became a part of the mainstream cast he was introduced well charlize therons character of furiosa was strong determined but had just enough feminine qualities to play a good strong female lead without coming off as a damsel in distress i like that in a movie anymorethere will be a lack of heavy dialogue for those who look to have the movie explained for them the low dialogue and heavy action and chase sequences let the viewer draw their own conclusions without overtly explaining everything overall i enjoyed the ability to think my way through the film rather than have my hand heldthe old woman tribe i would have liked to have seen more of in terms of action but they were presented well and had strong roles for their minimal screen timeoverall it was a well directed film the stunts are amazing there were a few parts that were probably edited down for continuity but the film kept a good pace with subtle lulls in the action to allow the audience to catch their breath a solid 810 i can only hope the coming sequels are just as well paced,reality
ill keep this straight and to the point for years ive waited for a film that lives up to the originals although beyond thunderdome was decent in its own right the film lost its dark and gritty edge due to its pg13 a bane on dark gritty postapocalyptic films well fear not for i am happy to report that fury road is every bit as dark and gritty as its predecessors tom hardy does another incredible job as the world weary a man with nothing to lose wandering the arid desolate australian wasteland with little pockets of civilization here and there well the term civilization is aptly used loosely here because most of them are anything but civilized as these roving band of savages try to eek out a bleak existence by any means necessary and this is the perfect backdrop for the story with little twists and turns here and there along with the impressive visuals and riveting action fury road is a crystal clear reminder that cgi and mtv style action does not and should not take the place of a wellwritten story hopefully a sequel is made im that pumped for it best film ive ever seen in years is back and hes better than ever,reality
fury road is like the road warrior on drugs it simultaneously kept an older fan like myself and new fans very happy it hasnt got a lot going for it in terms of plot the whole movie is essentially one massive car chase but i forgave that for what were some of the best action sequences i have ever seen tom hardy and charlize theron nailed the lead roles and it was fun to see hugh keaysbyrne toecutter and now immortan joe return to the series after the disappointment of the second half of beyond thunderdome im glad to see return to form and im very excited to see the sequelsi enjoyed it as a fan of the old trilogy but the friends i brought with me who hadnt heard of before also loved it and have watched the originals since i must say its also refreshing to see a female lead who doesnt need to bone someone or get kidnappedbasically if youre a fan go see it and if youre not a fan go see it,reality
movie is best viewed in a theater in 3d stunts and vehicle design were spectacular main leads showed vagueness in their acting maybe the concept did not go well understood by them was supposed to be a tough guy with no emotions and terminator style attitude but there was somewhat confusion in their roles but of course that was not what anyone went for it was for the skull vehicles chase sequences and aerobic stunts never thought desert would prove to be an ideal action stunt scenario but this movie showcases desert and desert is the topping for this movie because had it been anywhere else it would not have suited the movie i think the grandmas acted better than leads and gave a better fight to the bad boys do not miss this movie not for the vehicles desert and stunts,reality
quite simply fury road does one thing better than most other films in the history of cinema  actionthe film is frequently breathtaking both in cinematography and sheer spectacle from the insane real stunts most of the vehicle action was captured for real to the pyrotechnics and creative vehicle on vehicle action fury road is genuinely one of the best action film ever madefairly thin on plot and very linear but this is made up for with the exciting on screen action and creative writing illustrated on screen there are some really inventive ideas here unique characters and concepts never seen before on filmif youre expecting a heavily layered complex character piece you will be disappointed if you head into this with your mind open you will see a spectacular action film featuring scenes of madness you will have never seen before in a cinema,reality
nominated for 10 oscars george millers postapocalyptic chase movie fury road is one of those rare summer blockbusters that lives up to the hype that may be because the movie literally has its own hype manthe main characters tom hardy and imperator furiosa charlize theron bolt across the wasteland of their dying world with the captured brides of ruthless warlord immortan joe furiosa believes that returning to her homeland can provide salvation and the drifter has been caught up in the ride immortan joe and his army of insane followers will stop at nothing to retrieve his war bridesamid the literal beat of war drums secured to tricked out dune buggies the action catapults forward at an unyielding pace the preposterous villains chase furiosa and her posse through the desert atop motorcycles and monster trucks shooting guns spikes fireballs and themselves at our protagonists in an effort to slow them down these dim witted steampunk zombies are on a kamikaze mission to valhalla and die they do each one in a more hilarious manner than the lastare we surprised when the villains fail i guess i forgot to care with all of the endorphins firing in my brain this movie was designed solely to entertain you it is an absurd production that is pure spectacle so get some popcorn sit back and witness,reality
production was fantastic and of course i loved all the beautiful eye candy too the costumes cars and backgrounds were amazing i sat on the edge of my seat the entire film there was nothing cheap about the special effects in this movie they were awe inspiring complete with breathtaking action packed stunts that will leave you holding your breath the craziest most engaging spectacle youre likely to lay see for quite some time they are going to have hard time out doing this acrobatic fury road is thrilling and treats the viewer to the most astonishing action packed film yet the action doesnt take away from the emotional impact mainly accredited to charlize therons impressive performance,reality
before talking about fury road i must say a few words about its roots the franchisethe original was one of those movies from back in the days when b movies are like that  sometimes one design element or the poster created a lot of expectations i personally think is one of them the world setting and the character design is so intriguing that it spawned many works inspired by this in a way creates shadow larger than itself perhaps people who are exposed to a long list of pop culture things that are influenced by and dont even know it this list is readily available on wikipedia and sites alikeso the point is is significant as in pop culture but judging the films based on its influence many be a bit too much it was what it was  a b movie to begin withi didnt see fury road when it was released in the theaters i blame that on the promos and the character designs it felt like a cheesy reboot without mel gibson although i am not a gibson fan not interested in him since braveheart glanced at the poster and i didnt even noticed the female protagonist is charlize had i known it was her my interest level would be higherthen came the dvd release and i watched it because of the oscar buzz as a surprise this movie is absolutely stunning other than that one shot of a cg car flipped over which looked fake its an amazing execution of cinematography a movie should deliver a out of the world experience and amazing car chases and fights in that regard the movie delivers just that would it be a better movie if there is tighter story and twists and turns every 15 mins of course it would however i watched this movie very well knowing it is i gave it a 7 because it is an enjoyable watch i love the car designs in this movie there is not really parts of the movie that fells boring or too long an enjoyable watch the oscar definitely helped this movie to get audiences the movie is good ride and not winning the best picture is expected at least it was never nominated for best screen writing otherwise i would really have a problem with the academy,reality
fury road is simply the best 2015 movie  and one of the best action of all time  the film is a spectacle  george miller is a direction masterfully  the effects are spectacular the way that miller makes practical purposes is great  charlize theron steals the show  shes amazing she is the main film tom hardy is good as  but i still prefer mel gibson in the shoes of  as well as other films  the plot is the point weak film  at the beginning they try the some clues  but still nobody knows anything of history that did have this apocalyptic world  villain i found kind of disappointed  i think he died very easily the action scenes are sensational  the each scene the film is overcome  fury road can be greater than the previous 3  single hitting the front is the 2   has amazing action scenes and a fantastic performance of charlize theron  note 10,reality
watch this movie after positive word of mouth and i must say the compliments i heard were short compared to the spectacular movie experience this was the action scenes were out of this world with terrific action pieces that were intense and terrific the visuals of this movie were cutting edge and made this experience so raw and so memorable even though on title he is more of a sidekick to the furiosa character who was the lead and played terrifically by charlize theron who shines above all in this movie the plot was interesting but it did not get in the way of the action which was relentless and absorbing this is a movie deserving of all the accolades it has gotten and in the future this movie will be remembered more than the movies that won at the oscars for this movie has staying power while all the others are just willow whisp in the wind,reality
fury road a captivating movie set in post apocalyptic australia a world bathed in fire and blood and if you are trying to disappear from a long and strenuous day at work or just disappear then surely you must see this teeming with explosions gorgeous victorias secret models stunning cinematic shots and metal music it is a magnificent film that will definitely guarantee adrenaline coursing throughout your veins there are tragic moments ones where characters cant fix what is broken and are nearly driven insane and for the lovers of pyrotechnics the special effects though neither hyper realistic nor far from reality which when you consider a budgeted film is quite fantastic nearly everything in fury road is strange however and before watching it you must see three things 2 beyond thunderdomeyou will be gripping your seat with anticipation this advice is very reconcilable for it is spectacular the amount of converts to the series after watching all four films because the film grips you in an unequivocally transcending bond the time passes by less noticeably than the froth of a cappuccino amidst ones lips this i hope is the way that time passes by in a bahamian paradise without any desire to return to reality for that matter these two escapes sitting on a bahamian beach and watching have another striking parallel serendipity the average viewer for instance watches a prolonged car chase while being serenaded by brilliant and cunning dialogueno matter what they will become enthralled in george millers world and viewers devoured by their own emotions will love this film,reality
fury road is a very entertaining action movie that has a lot of style to make up for its lack of substancethis is mainly due to its visuals and action the film is one of the most visually captivating i have seen in a while a combination of great cinematography fast pace editing and creative uses of colour kept my eyes fixed to the screen for example i liked how george miller tried to sneak monochrome into this action blockbuster with the black and white bursts during lightning strikes and the bluetinted monochrome during the nighttime scenesthe first car chase in particular was extremely engaging it is edited at such a fast pace that it accentuates the calmness of the moment after it the fast paced action is accompanied by junkie xls score which sets the mood and makes the film feel epici also liked that despite this being given 150 million miller was still able to create a unique film on top of the costumes and vehicles idiosyncratic details like the morbidly obese man with the weird foot the blindfolded guitarist and a scene involving a doctor saying anything more about it would reveal an important plot point help make this film feel like a creation instead of a productalthough i like this film a lot whats stopping me from loving it are the characters they arent as much of a problem for me as they were in carol or the revenant since those films were more characterdriven while this film is more focused on action however the action does need to stop for the story and the moments in which the film takes a break would be more enjoyable if the characters were more fleshed out plus the chase scenes would have been emotional and intense instead of just visually captivating the only other problems i have are that the acting could have been better and some of the dialogue felt dubbed these are quite small in comparison to how impressive the visuals are and how entertaining the film is as a whole even if you are not a big action fan you should see this film,reality
with the movie was amazing and the characters were great and fleshedout for not having a lot of time to create a big story arc as it is an actionbased movie there were no issues with any of the performances from what i saw and i was fully invested in the characters the whole way through because none of them seemed invincible which is an issue with lots of westernmade action movies there were lots of times where the combat footage was spedup to give the illusion of fast fighting but i think it lends itself to the style and didnt take me out of it the pacing was great and they were able to fit in subtle nuances as to why is a complete lunatic without making the flashbacks and backstory cheesy overall a really good movie for what it was aiming for and i give it a 810,reality
i love road warrior and i would say it is still my favorite movie despite the climactic action sequence being a little boring to me it has a wonderful tone to itso i was incredibly excited to see george miller returning for fury road i showed the trailer to all of my friends expecting a wild beast of a movie when the reviews came out i was cautiously optimistic but didnt want to build it up too much in my head or else id be disappointedthen i saw itafter the opening sequence that leads up to the title flashing on the screen there was a massive release of tension from the theaters audience i even heard someone say jeez everyone was clearly sucked in and this was only the beginningby the end of the movie i felt like i had seen something that id never seen before and something that i dont expect to see again any time soon george miller took the ambitious idea of a 2 hour car chase and made it work it was wonderful a movie that is driven by action rather than dialogue so 5 more viewings later i feel like i can say what makes this movie so great obviously the art direction and cinematography are great and the way the story makes you put the pieces together on your own makes the experience more rewarding and engaging but what really makes it such a tight package is the fantastic editing watching this movie is like watching a stan brakhage movie or a really great music video that you can put on over and over again its because it is such a joy to watch the editing is so tight that it just feels good and it was all edited by george millers wife margaret sixel who had never edited an action movie before i cant wait for the video essays breaking down and analyzing the construction and piecing together of shotsthe only complaints i have about this movie we dont get a great understanding of personality most of the time he seems like a wild dog but other times it feels like there is still wisdom rattling around in that head of his maybe thats the point thoughim not crazy about the score and there are a couple moments where it actually feels a bit intrusivethere are a few moments during loud action scenes where the dialogue doesnt properly sync with the mouths of the actors first they take my blood now its my car for exampleeven though there is such limited dialogue some of it still feels unnecessary the line thats our fuel delivered by a rock rider chasing the tanker almost feels like it was thrown in because a test audience was confused about why the riders were pursuing the vehiclethe line its the bullet farmer theyre coming from the bullet farm yeah no duh furiosathese are minor nitpicks though overall its a great movie and i recommend it to anyone with an appreciation of action cinema experimental cinema silent films or anyone with experience in film production if you are someone who believes movies are only meant for telling stories then you may need to expand your understanding of cinema before youll really appreciate this,reality
i cant believe the number of people who have the audacity to be so inattentive and ignorant when complaining about this movie its inexcusable and its turning a lot of people off from this masterpiece so im going to deconstruct all of their incorrect arguments for those who havent seen theres no story and dialogterrible story sure theres very little dialog and exposition but that does not mean there is no story fury road excels in visual storytelling a unique and interesting form of storytelling which very few big budget hollywood titles use if you think there is no story you simply arent paying attention to the movie while the overall story is fairly basic and predictable the amount of depth put into the situations and the way they are woven together as well as small details throughout the movie and references to millers other work is so masterfully done that it overshadows all of this besides a movie does not need to be complex to be good ive seen the movie 3 times now and each time i notice a new detail i had never noticed before its all just one long action segmentcar chase  and isnt that what you pay for when you go to an action film isnt that why the name of the genre is action take a look at the latest fantastic four it did the exact opposite of in terms of plot backstory narrative and buildup vs pure raw exciting intense action and look at the difference in response between them its also masterfully directed using a tracking technique where the action is always being followed precisely between shots this was covered in the film theory video if youre interested in this technique as it really makes the film much better than all the shitty action segments michael bay puts out its feminist propaganda this is false the want to be free from oppression and sexual slavery from a brutal oppressive dictator as well as the idea of women being diverse in terms of beauty skills and character and capable of being on the same level as men is not exclusive to feminism really its an idea that all human beings who arent scumbags should embrace the film is full of cgithe film is boringother strange generic argument from someone with insanity or a meth pipe what are you talking about did you even watch the same movie did you too like the people who say it has no story just not even look at the screen for more than 5 seconds before declaring you were bored did you forget to take your adhd meds today alright rant over seriously this movie is one of the best action movies of all time theres a reason its being praised by everyone who has any sort of sense of what makes a movie good its incredibly entertaining and brilliant unique yet familiar and you need to watch it considering those points above,reality
i was really really young when the first movie of came out and it was kind of weird i liked it back then but for obvious reasons it kind of scared me so it was a bittersweet feeling back then watching this one i kind of went down the memory lane and really enjoyed it it was both nostalgic but also intense for me and it did not let me down in terms of effects or the general feeling i had imprinted in my mind the acting was ok and i am not sure if it really matters the movie is so action packed and intense that even less talented actors could have pulled it off i think i was amazed by the costumes the make up the vehicles everything the music of the movie was so good i liked the bad guys as they seemed and were really really bad and i enjoyed every minute of the chase that goes on for almost the entire movie the fiction part was there but its something you expect in such moviesi was really really close to rate it with a 9 out of 10 but i decided that an 8 is closer to the truth based on other movies of the genre if i could i would give an 85 to it,reality
im not usually one who goes for action movies but this is truly amazing it is essentially a 2 hour car tractor trailer chase through a post apocalyptic wasteland but there is so much more to it than just that ive watched it 3 times since last week and it just keeps getting better the world is detailed and immersive the characters are terse but complex and the action is like nothing ive ever seen with very little cgithis one will set the bar for action movies to come it will keep you entertained no enthralled all the way through and wanting more when its over bravo george miller is back with a vengeance,reality
reboots are everywhere you look these days in current cinema more often than not theyre cheap attempts at cashing in on something once great however when one witnesses fury road one realizes how it can be used as a fuller realization of a true artistic vision taking place in between the 1st two films of the franchise fury roads plot is fairly simplistic our main hero is captured  comes to the aid of a ragtag band of female survivors and must outrun a crazed warlord and his disciples the execution though is purely transcendent for starters every shot  frame and stunt is crafted with enormous imagination and inventiveness this film easily contains some of the greatest stuntwork and set pieces ever committed to celluloid the display of vision and sheer personality is overabundant and the pacing is heartstopping with rests perfectly utilized however between the spectacle and chaos millers film is richly emotional and dramatic in our two leads hardy and theron create two broken individuals searching for salvation in a savage world theron in particular truly embodies furiousas strength  bravery and relentless drive perfectly as himself hardy conveys a subtle yet effective mix of gravitas and palpable tormentin terms of a cinematic experience fury road demonstrates the pinnacle of action film making its grand  explosive  mindblowing but in many ways deeply personal and truly awe inspiring whether youre a fan of the franchise or of cinema in general this is one ride well worth taking,reality
from top to bottom it was an intense movie definitely the best watch of 2015the writers outdid them selves and gave a convincing story full of thrill suspense and extra ordinary story linethe actors made it even more sizzling to watch all actions were convincing emotions conveyed and there was uniqueness in the casting and roles that was playedafter a long year i am excited to say that so far no other movie has done as well as this1010,reality
review contains spoilersugh i cant believe i paid money to watch this first of all why do we need to spend 10 seconds on a scene where tells furiosa his name i dont want to learn anyones name so 1 star off for names just get to the action alreadyspeaking of this movie was probably 87 solid action the other 13 who cares all crap if i wanted to watch some stupid dramatic movie id pop in ong bak or event horizon or terminator 2 another star off for stupid drama driving waaaay too much driving around and not enough exploding i think theres probably a combined 2 minutes of driving where things arent exploding uh i paid for explosions if i wanted to see driving id hop in my car and get on the freeway no thank you minus one stardialogue i like the grunting and gesturing all that talking crap gave me a headache please fire the screenwriters and spend more money on explosions and cgi next time k thx minus one star plot stop setting up scenes so i can follow the action beats waste of time showing the exchange of gas for safe passage just blow stuff up gah minus one starcharacter development nux wasted time telling me his name minus one star had far too much character development gawd i thought i was watching a freaking hbo mini biopic in the middle of this movie stop i dont care about his transformation just do it quit making my head hurt with all this like stuff minus one star guitar guy i liked him plus one star basic story structure all movies have a beginning middle and end i was really excited because this movie had no definitive beginning or middle and it was super easy to follow the explosions so i figured it wouldnt have an ending boy was i wrong the water didnt even explode when it fell on the people what kind of lame crap is that pour gas on them minus one star well this review is already longer than the entire script of dialogue and my head is throbbing so,reality
a great film and a worth film in the franchise in a summer that also brought us another terminator film which effectively killed the franchise or at least hope for a good film in the franchise we have which revitalizes the franchise with a good film that stands on its own and not manipulates the audience with their nostalgia for the old films i do miss mel gibson and would rather have had him in the film to help with the continuity im also playing the video game which is a excellent companion to the film as you really feel like your part of the universe the film deserves all the credit its given its a instant classic and worthy of the hype heres to waiting a little less time for a proper sequel,reality
i liked not because of all the adrenaline and special effects and the oversimplified plot typical of action movies but its one of the very few commercial films i saw lately that didnt spoil my enjoyment because of abuse of sexist traits in this film a woman is an active and strong character and she doesnt wear high heels make up and sexy clothes shes even disabled and had her head almost shaved the young women in the film that we can say that look more like what is considered pretty nowadays were also not full of make up and uncomfortable clothes they were just young and fresh and they also helped a lot to solve problems in the film and the hero of the film wasnt only one super strong man it was the team work of different people with different genders and skills that could achieve a goal theres no disgusting age gap between the characters that had a crush tom hardy is even 2 years younger than charlize theron charlize theron is turning 40 the age that many actresses are considered rubbish and there was a group of older female bikes that were good warriors and this film gave an important message that people should unite despite their differences and fight the real common oppressors,reality
fury road is the fourth of the franchise and it had been 30 years after the last movie and that was beyond thuderdome which was not the greatest closing chapter for the original trilogy although if you want to find a movie to become your guilty pleasure is a great choice when i saw it it blew me away with its effects which were for the 90 of the time real and not cgi the combat on the cars  gladiator meets fast and the furious only it is better than any fast and the furious also the characters are hardcore madmen or women who fit perfectly in a environment like that my favorite is furiose which is a amazon through and through well done charlize theron you are awesome the story is to tell the truth very simplistic though that to the flick advantage in order to give space for the action to be as epic as possible and it paid of big time in truth george muller create the best action movie of the decade and we are only half way through to add to that dispute its adrenaline and gasoline fueled madness this movie which maybe be the most macho movie of the 2015 has an environmentalist and feminist message to give george muller how did you and your team did that in the end i had a blast seen it and i recommended to you with closed eyes,reality
this new installment of is filled with explosive action sequences this is one of the better action movies there has been in recent years there was very little down time where almost nothing was happeningrockatansky played by tom hardy is just a certified lunatic who is off to seek redemption his destructive behavior introduces him to captivity by the warlord immortan joe played by hugh keays byme immortan joe is depriving what is left of civilization from water and resources in order for him to maintain control and power but a daring imperator furiosa played by charlize theron dares to defy immortan joefuriosas betrayal to immortan joe leads to a deadly high speed chase in the depth of the desert with the help of they make their way through and engage in countless fights and warfare against the warlords henchmenthe vehicles used in this movie were absolutely ridiculously awesome there were cars that were mounted onto tanks cars structured like a porcupine and cars that shoot bursts of fire it just added to the already action packed sequences in the movie,reality
having a female lead character in fury road was excellent in the step forward of the portrayal of strong female characters in modern day films the other female characters in the film were stereotypically passive to the extreme where they were seen as objects being stolen this regrettably pulls the film away from positive feminist side but on the other hand furiosas strong personality balances this out and makes the film an empowerment to female representation in films she is strong physically and mentally being a brave powerful woman a con of the film will be that the name of the film is named after the secondary male character it seems odd that the film would not contain furiosas name being the lead character but alas having furiosa as the lead character is a step forward for female representations,reality
was one hell of a ride and i mean literally one hell of a ride george miller created a very interesting and intriguing world full of freaks and extreme characters the picture was colorful and the music was good nicholas hoult was unbelievably good what a performance by him my only remark on the movie was its scenario was too short not too many words were spoken in the movie i would have loved to see more conversations between take place the villains just for the sake of revealing the way they think and to give us more insights about them other than that everything was good the action was good the spirit of the movie was infectious i am expecting the movie to win at least 2 oscarsand again nicholas hoult was on fire ,reality
as greda garbo says in one of the academy awards out takes fasten your seat belts its gonna be a bumpy ride oh yeah and what a ride  fury road is every minute of this george miller movie is stuffed with incredible mobile machines of a dark art kind of origin thats just the machines the people populating this movie are even more dark and even more fantastic there is not a minute to take a breath before the next sequence of hell fire action takes place action movie junkies seeing this movie for the first time will literally exhaust themselves from the excitement this is the best action picture ever made and im including fast and furious 7 when saying this miller has out done himself and made an absolute classic an 8 is a very high rating on the imdb but it doesnt do this movie justice its a clear 10 all the way my thanks to the actors directors writers crew and producers for making this unique entertainment see this movie  you will not regret it,reality
so i saw this movie on a whim because it was playing at a small theater in a 1 screen moviehouse in a small town and boy was i glad i did i went in not knowing what to expect or really anything about the franchise or its back story needless to say but it didnt matter the entire movie was a nonstop ride of adrenaline ive seen plenty of movies in the genre that i liked doomsday 28 days later children of men 12 monkeys this one tops them all with 12 monkeys as a close second but is really in a different category since i group postapocalyptic thrillers and action movies separatelyafter watching this movie i started to try to find out if the others in the series would be worth catching up on but i dont want to be let down at this point the visual genius gripping action and intense audio would be hard to beat with movies released in the late 70searly 80s i may dive down further into the franchise but at this point im just anxiously waiting for the followup to fury road,reality
this movie is one of the best action flicks of the summer heck even the whole year this movie is filled with interesting characters and awesome set pieces it is set in post apocalyptic australia and the atmosphere immerses you into the movie the plot is pretty basic but its all about the action most of this movie is dedicated to awesome guitar solos crazy driving insane people huge dust storms and awesome explosions the acting was great and tom hardy reprises his role of very well even though he says very little and charlize theron reprises her role as furiosa excellently as well this movie should be seen in ior in 3d as the cgi is some of the best ive ever seen i was pleasantly surprised by such a great movie and can see how this series has influenced the post apocalyptic genre ever since its debut decades ago overall this movie is amazing and is definitely worth your money and time,reality
fury road review by mike smith in a stark desert landscape where humanity is broken two rebels just might be able to restore order25 years after the last film beyond thunderdome we hit fury road this film isnt really a remake it feels like a continuation of the mythologyfrom start to finish this movie grabs you with non stop heart pounding action and madness one thing that sets this film apart from most films this year is that over 80 of this film is practical effects in the heavy cg movie industry that we live in its a breath of fresh air to see a big budget film with car crashes and flamesthe cast is amazing tom hardy can do no wrong he plays just like mel gibson did but better he rarely talks but this facial expressions and intensity keeps you wanting more charlize theron plays a strong character and she steals the show theron and hardy work amazingly together nicholas hoult is always a good choice he does this gradual shift from psycho that you kind of want to see get killed off to a sweet broken hearted man who is falling in love sure lots of people can pull it off but some actors cant nicholas hoult pulled it off and was a great choice for the film now to the main villain a spooky creepy evil dictator overlord what a hell of a blend in a movie called you would expect to see more of the hero but a character like immortan joe made me want to see more of the villain this roll was made for hugh keaysbyrne and he ran with it this whole cast worked amazingly together the chemistry was dead onthe cinematography was spectacular the car crashes explosion and practical effects aside the desert landscapes were awesome and the blue cold nights were stunning the bit of cg we did see was really well done but the colours in the film were beautifulin the road warrior and beyond thunderdome there was a lot of crazy cars characters and sets well if that was crazy then this is straight up insane everything is unique and beautiful in a post apocalyptic way this was a treat for my eyethere are some nods to the first three films im not going to spoil anything one thing that worried me going into this film was will i keep thinking of the other films nope i didnt miss mel gibson at all and lets be fair if it works for 007 it can work for there are sequels planned but i hope they are released 23 years between each otheri feel like fury road has raised the bar to a whole new level for action movies in my eyes i thought nothing until star wars episode 7 would top the avengers age of ulton for my favorite movie this year well i was dead wrong after seeing this film i wanted to see it again right away so stop reading my review and go enjoy this crazy ride11 out of 10 edited by samantha locke twitter fatmiketpk facebook page httpswwwfacebookcomfatmikesmoviereviews,reality
i watched the original 2015 movie a few days ago with my friends after the 30 year later we finally see the release of the fourth movie of george millers series this movie fury road is the story of tom hardy and young women battle to survive in a desert wasteland after the collapse of civilization taking about series forward after beyond thunder dome the movie features hard taking the torch from mel gibson with a promise of a journey filled with action in unending desertsbut does the movie live up to expectations managing to please the action hungry audience as well as the geeky fan boys who have waited for this movieif we going to discuss about performances tom hardy play awesome performance of mentally troubled who is constantly in battle with the demons inside him and is a definitive step up from the manic eyed performance of mel gibson in the previous movie tom hardy dry sense of humour evident from his dialogue delivery action especially in the sequence of him talking about hope adds to the overall experience of the movie,reality
i cant quite express how great i think it is that fury road almost completely abandons the action film formula that has been ruling the box office for about 15 years fury road is essentially a two hour chase sequence there is perhaps two pages of dialogue in the entire thing at times it seems like an elaborate stage show a ballet a piece of performance art yet all in all it is exactly what it set out to be which is first and foremost an action filmi get the feeling that the film works so well because george miller didnt approach it as if he was making a movie he seems to have approached it almost as some divine overseer creating and examining a world putting the pieces in place and working out given the circumstances and the nature of the characters what anyone would reasonably expect to happen in such an insane world theres no time for introductions or exposition everythings at a furious pace so miller shows rather than tells and its surprisingly easy to get your head into this world so much so that you immediately accept a giant truck with a mutated blind guitar player in a red onesie perched at the front like a hood ornament firing fire out of the neck of his twisted metal electric axe as he makes it roar and growl thrashing and bouncing on bungee chords in front of a wall of speakers and loudhailers as a tribe of furious drummers back him upas i understand the film was originally intended to be an animation hence it was storyboarded to death this means every shot is absolutely beautiful the special effects are almost entirely practical adding further depth to the fire and sand and twisted metal 130 cars were built i believe less than half survived filmingthe plot isnt earthshattering its not meant to be neither nor charlize therons imperator furiosa are trying to save the world or even a small part of it furiosa initiates the plot by staging a rescue of warlord immortan joes prized breeders which fires him up enough to pursue her with his entire fleet of glorious soupedup death machines crewed by an army of the insane and the damned thats it finds himself part of it through chance and the protagonists simply respond as best they can in order to survive theres no grandstanding no quiet points where characters talk about themselves in an attempt to forge audience engagement not even so furiosa could talk about her sweet robot arm or why she felt the need to revolt against joe possibly with a reference to her sweet robot arm it doesnt need to have this either character motivations are plainly there for all to see due to millers approach theres not even a set up for a final confrontation no exchange of words between the antagonist and protagonist before they engage in fisticuffs as is usually the case it happens as the rest of the film does strapped screaming to the side of a v8 monster truck at 100 kilometres an hour as everyone just tries to stay alive how are you going to have a conversation about motivations during thatthis would be a beautiful albeit forgettable film if it didnt completely rework or ignore how action films have been built over the last two decades or so even despite the fantastic characters and acting from theron in particular george miller deserves so much credit for having a vision and just pursuing it how great it is that he was seemingly unimpeded by studio interests  mostly because i think it was seen as a schlock bmovie attempt to cash in on 70s and 80s nostalgia how great is it that so many just went along with it how great is it that audiences and critics are also going along with it rewarding a brave and exceptional piece of cinematic art with the plaudits it deserves,reality
the first thing that comes to mind when thinking of the many positives to this movie is that there is no attempt to slowly introduce the characters and the setting straight away the film drops you into the action and its just nonstop adrenaline from there the movie is raw violent and gritty and that is exactly what i went into the cinema expecting the tension is incredible throughout the entire film and the struggle for survival is evident through the acting of every cast member the postapocalyptic setting is also fantastic and you can really see how the world has fallen to its knees civilisation is almost nonexistent and any human principles are long gone which plays to the setting perfectly the citadel plays a huge part in the plot of the movie and is also where we are introduced to the primary antagonist immortan joe both immortan joe and the war boys are intimidating cold hearted and ruthless which shows how harsh the empire that immortan joe had created truly was however after watching the film i was definitely able to find a few negatives there isnt a lot of character development which made it quite difficult to care about the characters for example tom hardy was raw and emotionless which was part of his character and that was great but his performance was on the dull side and he definitely lacked the charisma that mel gibson had in the previous movies there was also minimal character development for supporting characters like the 5 wives or rictus the youngest son of immortan joe who was supposedly the main supporting antagonist in the movie yet i do believe that nux was the best supporting character in the movie and allowed the audience to see the transition from blood thirsty war boy to something more human in my opinion charlize theron gave the best performance as imperator furiosa you could see the pain she had experienced in the past through her acting which was excellent i really enjoyed the movie the action was intense from start to finish overall i believe it was a top quality action movie  810,reality
if like me youve heard about the original trilogy but never gotten around to watching any of them dont let that put you off from watching this movie its a stand alone film with imagery so intense itll be haunting you for days the characters all have individual and quirky personalities and  despite the title  its a film thats not solely about a man called in fact a group of strong women headed by charlize therons character imperator furiosa play a significant part in it this is not a dialogueladen movie with tom hardys mainly grunting his way through each scene and any silence being taken up with the sound of large engines revving this doesnt take away from the movie at all  rather it helps to emphasise the whole madness that has taken hold of humanityits an adrenaline fueled film with strong characters a decent story line and intense imagery never has a films imagery had such a strong effect on me  the craziness the landscapes the vehicles the chases the people are all just brilliant,reality
the story is just another one of those clich action movie stories of the hero helping the party who is running from the evil ruler it even completes with the common finale of the evil ruler dying at the end and the escaping party gets to become the new ruler nothing new from the story as theres no new ingredient added to the story as a whole not even a good enough twist yet this movie grants a spectacular display of a very crazy action from start to end from the time as furiosa starts to veer off her course the movie just doesnt give any room to stop to catch your breath and the action is the kind of action which you rarely see in other action movies with lots and lots of crazy stunts everywhere i also like how the movie keeps and even develops the original style of vehicular mods and character designs the acting overall is a great job for me tom hardys portrayal of really equals if not bested mel gibsons performances from the original movies the voice play is also nice charlize theron can really make her character stand out nicholas hoult did great to shed his previous characters and play this role of crazy eager war boy,reality
the 30 year gap from beyond thunderdome to fury road has resulted in one of the best action movies in recent memoryrockatansky tom hardy is a survivor in a postapocalyptic wasteland ruled by whoever has the guns the guzzaline gasoline and  most importantly  the water due to bad luck finds himself mixed up in a high speed conflict between immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne and furiosa charlize theron furiosa and will need to temper their distrust of others if they are to escape immortan joe with their livesthe film rounds its characters very subtly violent flashbacks provide a glimpse of past he is certainly not the main character but dont be fooled hardys road warrior is an excellent vehicle for bringing the audience into the storythe ruthless immortan joe is characterized mostly by his costume makeup and his actions he covers his deformed body with a faux muscle suit he denies water to the needy so as to keep them wanting not a very deep character but one who works as a very clear villain in a movie where the main characters are a bit more ambiguoustherons character is the only one whose fleshing out eventually becomes a bit clunky and expository not to say that she is not a great character the calm way she carries herself her fighting prowess and her single minded dedication to the protection of others goes a long way to prove that she can be counted among the ranks of great female main characters like black mamba kill bill sara connor the terminator and even ellen ripley alienokay let us not forget that this is an action movie the action is brilliant and by brilliant i mean vulgar the audience is treated to stunts explosions occurrences and visuals that would fall flat i many other movies they work in fury road because they are so obviously and naturally a part of the world they inhabit to me a body being thrown under a bigrig makes sense in a world where human lives are not appreciated this goes along very well with the fact that the stunts the makeup and the special effects are mostly practical ie reali will give this film a 910 rating not because i think it is among the greatest pieces of art ever committed to the big screen but because it is so refreshing it might be part of an established franchise but thankfully it seems the creators were mostly concerned with achieving a clearcut vision rather than pandering to the widest possible audiencegive this film a chance you might not agree with the high ratings it has already received you might wish it would share more secrets you might think that it is too over the top but i promise you this is real high octane action,reality
clip your nails because fury road will have you ruining chair arms if you dontgeorge miller has masterfully welded together a neat gritty and chaotically choreographed dance of metal mayhem this point is highlighted with scenes of apocalyptic war drums accompanied by a madred jumpsuit donned stringed ax thrasher who strums and picks notes during amany doomed pursuitsone of the most talented and varied cinematographers that exists in the industry john seale punches bold and mesmerizing hues of rust sweat life and zeal through the audiences optical pipes seizing the imaginationmadman of the hour tom hardy has few lines instead he communicates more by what he doesnt saywhich i found ideal for the character his suspicion that all minds are tortured in one way or another and how miller illustrated those mental episodes lets me feel connected to the character in that special way that elevates a movie from an experience to an interactionrebellious charming and astute imperator furiosa charlize theron must have missed the memo about the title of the movie anyone would have trouble defending as being the lead in this movie this is not a complaintremaining cast were aces in my bookcar chases were spectacular and certainly blurred the lines between special and visual effects my only complaint is that despite the movie being titled fury road there could have been less vehicular veneryspoiler alert ahead scale is scoped in epic proportions throughout much of this flick mile high dust storms desert plains hordes of monster truck luxury transports motorcycles and ratrod clod busters are barely contained onscreen encapsulating this fact is at the tail end of the clias the mixed group of protagonists contemplate their futures into an apparent dried up ocean bedgazing to the haze of the foreboding horizon to cross it on motorcycle would take over one hundred and sixty dayswhile not my preferred octane of choice fury road is an addition to the franchise that many will aspire to replicate some will use to motivate but all respectable fans of cinema will appreciate,reality
this film is a down right action masterpiece on all levels the action the setting the characters are all well realized to bring us one the greatest films we have had in a long time i dont to sound like im fanboying over this film but i have no problem in saying that this is probably the best shot action i have ever seen in a movie beautiful wide takes of incredible action are given to the audience and we are not cheated with all the shaky cam crap thats floating around in hollywood today that passes for an action movie but what struck me the most about this whole film was the vulnerability of our heros as they progress through the movie constantly someone is beating on played by tom hardy who does a great job taking over gibsons role and furiosa played by charlize theron both of these characters are so well realized for who they are there human beings they arent some super powered being who can defeat bad guys left and right charlize theron easily puts herself up there with one of my favorite female characters of all time right behind ellen ripley from the alien franchise she isnt some damsel in distress that needs someone to come save her every 20 minutes she kicks major ass and brings and leaves a great impression for movie makers of the future on how to properly make a strong female character in film if you are an action movie lover this is the movie you have been waiting for finally we have that definitive action movie for this decade to say action movies can be great again you will not forget this one guys i guarantee it,reality
first time ive written a review on here but having read some of the atrocious reviews by people who clearly dont get film i had to write my own firstly i review for bafta ive also won two myself and i rated this film above all others last year does that make my review more informed than others yes frankly it does i live and breathe film and video games im very happy to say that and fury road wasnt just a good film it was the best film of the year by a country mileit contains one of the most impressive and most dramatic scenes in modern cinema did anyone awarding it 110 spot that not forgetting the tight dramatic well performed and well polished cinematic storytelling george miller has always been very good but this film deserved far more recognition than it got for him personally and thats in spite of the fact that it has won more awards and has been nominated for more than any other film of 2015 including spotlight best oscar film winner and the revenant best bafta film winner it is a cinematic masterpiece i can give it no higher praise and it deserved more,reality
this is a movie of a lifetime the best use of cgi of this decade and the next more than anything this film is about hope and self redemption and we all know those arent easy to come by as portrayed by tom hardy and his whats the point of this attitude it surely is the best film i have seen since the butterfly effect which leads to the point that even if youre not an action fan the film is a work of genius with thrills and edges that capture your eye from start to finish its loaded with intense action and car chasing appealing realism and incredibly crafted war concepts all beautifully caught on the center frame making 2h seem like a very short timedont make the mistake of not watching this movie because of bad reviewers or whatever may have discouraged you dont be an idiot spending hours of your time reading reviews about this film time that you may have well spent watching itlisten just watch it okaywith so little content left in hollywood  this film is gonna have you googling movies like i love it i love it i love,reality
my initial thoughts was here is another remake that will ruin a classic but was surprised it was gritty dark and the characters large than life the first time i watched it it felt like a big car race and crashes which was great the second time i watched it i got into the details the stunts the characters the locations etc the fact that i rarely watch a film twice made me write this review try and see beyond the big scenes and look at the detail and scenes that make up the film they are pretty good the story line is straight forward but comparing this to the original the director and writers did a good job what made is so good is that unlike the original it is not all about there more to the story you just have to pay attention,reality
made was good in 2d or 3d and in 10 i like the bit where the guy gets his jaw ripped off and his tongue was hanging out good action and acting i wanna reeba 4554464664 46465656565656 times michael bay is scarab unnecessary sequels is one of the rare older series that actually deserves further exploration and expansion writerdirector george miller built a stunning unique and rich world with his original trilogy of films and because each sequel operates more as a tales from the postapocalyptic wasteland instead of a subsequent chapter there exists fantastic potential to keep telling those stories forever it was this thinking that got miller to put together fury road and we should be thankful because it is as crazy thrilling gorgeous and awesome as anyone could really hope and guaranteed to be one of the best bigscreen spectacles of,reality
at this point theres probably nothing original i could write about fury road following a long gestation period and an insane level of hype that it most certainly lived up to this longawaited sequelreboot was just the kind of fuel injection that the action blockbuster has been in need of for quite some time its a ballstothewall action film that is brimming with subtext in a way that most dramas dont even come close to matching what george miller has done is bring cinema back to the basics of the story told through moving images with dialogueexposition brought to a minimum in the absence of a lot of talking which some will interpret as a lack of storyplot while others will simply be turned off the characters are developed through their actions what they wear what they drive etc its basically a production designers heaven as there are no superfluous details everything and everyone in this world has a purpose but you have to be perceptive enough to catch it it will also take multiple viewings to be able to truly absorb all of the little things because a lot of them pass by so quickly in response to the ignoranamusesignorami who belittle the film for its apparent feminist stance a careful viewing of the film will put that to rest yes the female characters are strong and have agency but they are given equal status to the male characters all you have to do is look at the patriarchal society led by immortan joe and the many mothers in both power structures the absence of the other has led them down a precarious path that is only rectified when they and furiosa realize that they have to work together in order to survive the basic message of the film is redemption is only possible through mutual respect and teamwork of course theres all of the action seeing as the film is basically a twohour chase there are quite a few setpieces which only get better as the film progresses and what makes this even more glorious is that these were accomplished in a largely practical manner with a couple notable exceptions and because endless action would wear you out there are a few brief moments of respite where the philosophical underpinnings of the film are made a little bit clearer taken as a whole fury road is perhaps one of the most complete action films and a perfectly good example of what hitchcock termed pure cinema and was also a term used by miller in promotion for the film my only complaint is that some of the dialogue is a little bit silly and isnt helped by some occasionally stilted delivery however thats a minor quibble when considering how fully realized the film is george miller has come back with a vengeance and shown the imitators how its done even besting in my opinion the high mark set by his original trilogy do yourself a favor and see this for yourself if you havent already or again if you have,reality
first things first ill confess that i didnt see the trailer so i had no idea no expectations from this movie whatsoever a spontaneous plan resulting into watching this flick was nothing more i could ask for if youre watching it for the first time be ready to get blown awaythe movie opens with and his that was deep dialogue eating a twoheaded lizard wow that was something you might think that then from the next minute the action begins and results into a cat and mouse chase played by tom hardy is a road warrior who is haunted by his past imperator furiosa played by charlize theron does a fantastic job her role is flawless and so is her performance the big chase comes due to furiosa and an astonishing chase results from it casting both tom and charlize are excellent decisions as they do it wellspeaking about the chase immortan joe the warlord takes his warrior boys and also takes help from neighboring farms played by hugh keayesbryne he adds a touch of an eeriedominating warlord who wants to rule the world nux played by nicolas hoult also does a good job of supporting and furiosa his maniacal excitement of going to valhalla makes you feel hes gone nuts as he keeps on talking about it for you the chase in the first half will not be over as there is a chase in the second half add to the chase lots of guns fire modded vehicles flying warrior boys old ladies with shooting and fighting skillsyoull be surprised with a plan and the bootythe reason for all this chase the story isnt much but the action scenes and sequences make up more than for it at the end you would be impressed by the action but not by the storyline my word watch it once for the action stories arent original these days so we wouldnt miss them much,reality
there is non stop action a great and interesting world like the fallout series and many great ideas the problem is to see 50 kg women fighting 80100 kg men and having a chance  another fairy tale thats of course ridiculous in addition i had always the feeling men are bad in this movie and women are innocent like it is showed in most of our mass media there was one great dialog that i appreciate and contradict to this feeling young pregnant woman saying despicably to an old woman it will be an warlod junior gonna be so ugly old woman says it could be a girl interestingly she responds you kill people with that thing do you the old woman tells proudly how well she can kill and the young one responds thought somehow you girls were above that nice one anyway the importance of women in such a world is unrealistic,reality
this movie was basically nonstop action from beginning to end there was absolutely zero boredom factor throughout the entire movie they didnt bother forcing any needless plot or dialogue on us just enough to give context to the chase if youre looking for plotcharacter development you will not find it here this movie was all business pure raw hardcore action i cant remember the last time i watched a movie that went this balls deep with action absolutely phenomenal tom hardy and charlize theron gave believable performances charlize especially shines as a strong female protagonisti would rank this title as one of my favorite movies of all time i tried watching the original trilogy and was put to sleep does not hold a candle to the reboot i cannot recommend this movie enough,reality
in australia the original was a cultural phenomenon the 70s birthed some of the most highoctane albeit ridiculous films in the cinematic history of this country and everybody loved it george miller returned to after 30 years to pick up where he left off and it is nothing short of incredible in a world where computer animated special effects are applauded as revolutionary it was wonderful to see practical special effects you see a guy swinging from a pole on the top of a car thats a stuntman swinging from a pole on the top of a car miller had every reason to succumb to the popular idea that cgi is the only way to create spectacular sequences but he didnt millers direction was as important here as it was when he initially released 30 years ago this is by no means an american film and i am sick to death of seeing people suggesting that it is miller is a prize to australia and we are very lucky that he used all australian actors for supporting roles in this film as well as casting the wonderful hugh keaysbyrne as immortan joe so long after he played toecutter in the original the story is yes quite simple but so is the original the high emotion in this film was unsurpassed by any action film that has been released this year and i wish that people would approach it for what it is an australian director reimagining something he put so much effort into so long ago the acting is strong from all sides and the soundtrack is incredible you can complain all you want about lack of presence in the overall film but george miller willed it to be that way this is an action film that transcends the action genre this is ozploitation for the 21st century this is what action films should be,reality
fury road is the antidote for modern cgifueled blockbusters this is what big budget summer films should aspire topretty much all of the positive reviews for this film are spot on i feel that there isnt much more i can add honestly i didnt think it was a nonstop thrill ride which is what most people have called it it did have its slower moments if it sounds like im nitpicking im not the slower scenes help the viewers catch their breath without boring them even if the plot isnt the most thoughtprovoking the films technical aspects more than make up for it in this case george millers clear focused direction without shaky cam thank goodness junkie xls pulsepounding score john seales bleak yet somehow vibrant cinematography and the well choreographed action sequences with minimal cgi truly bring this film to lifefury road spent several years in production apparently creating the films real stunts took time perhaps if film writers and directors took their time and thought more about creating quality action movies rather than breaking box office records they would be more entertaining more unique most summer blockbusters feel factorymade completely devoid of any unique characteristics if youve seen one youve seen them allwell you havent seen anything yetupdate one small detail i would like to add this movie is labeled feminist which i can definitely see it mainly focuses on furiosa her friends while is sorta just there the plot consists of the slave women trying to escape immorten joes abode and live freely and independently in their homeland when they discover that their homeland is basically nonexistent they reroute and make their way back to joes abode the citadel which has plenty of lifes necessary resources the women and sorta manage to kill joe and takeover the citadel im not taking any sides in the feminist argument i enjoyed the movie for what was a gritty action movie and im not suggesting that this interpration is correct at all but you could almost say it contradicts itself the women leave the citadel because they dont need to be with joe for all intents and purposes their husband they can live without him except for when they end up running back to his home for the resources he had what they needed to live and whether he intended to or not the man provided for the women in the end killing joe definitely required strength from the women no doubt but he was still the one who had everything they neededagain i am not taking any sides in the argument so it would be pointless to call me a feminist or an antifeminist im simply offering another way of looking at the film take it or leave it 101015,reality
my quick rating  8310 there really is no reason for a long winded review too many great things about this movie to point out the way that is used was done so well to make the main character seem as though he isnt the focus furiousa charlize theron was astounding in her role as the heavy strange huh the movie itself starts off in high gear and rarely lets up to allow us lucky viewers a moment to catch our breath visually stunning in a very dark way such as the others were  a world were gasgold and water is a commodity violence is nonimportant only survival is so well doe throughout with every bit of attention paid to detail to make you feel the desperation i could go on and on as many reviews i am sure have but it is tough to keep up i may just have to watch it again go in knowing you will like this movie for many reasons it knocked me back a step since i am used to hollywood screwing up true greats but this time they definitely got it right enjoy i know i did,reality
some 36 years ago completely unknown director george miller released what went on to be one the biggest cult action films in history starring the also unknown at the time mel gibson who much like harrison ford in star wars released only 2 years earlier was the lone star of the film to make it big in hollywood mel would go onto become on the biggest names in hollywood throughout the 80s and 90s while director george miller fell into obscurity maintaining a presence as a working director but releasing radically different films like the animated hit childrens film happy feet i didnt have the highest hopes for fury road when i first got wind of it some 4 years ago i grew up as big fan of the original trilogy as my dad is a huge fan of mel gibson i knew that fury road was going through production hell and always was scrapped entirely with how long the process was taking some 10 years with changing stories actors etc when i finally heard that they were in preproduction and had a set cast in charlize theron and nicholas hoult i anxiously waited word on who the new was going to be my original bet and hope was for terminator salvation  avatar actor sam worthington when they announced tom hardy i thought to myselfokay okay after seeing the first full length trailer i was jaw dropped i knew that george finally achieved in making the film he envisioned making some 36 years ago the way he saw it in his head everyone delivers an amazing performance including the unknown hugh keaysbyrne who is only well known for his role as toecutter in the original filmi think what baffles me the most is how in the world this movie gets made honestly how does a director at the age of 70 who is only known primarily for a film series with a mere cult following at best get granted a 150 million dollar budget unlike star wars which established a massive following in its time before releasing its newest trilogy george lucas also maintained a heavy industry presence in writing films indiana jones before the new star wars trilogy was announced that was also a mere 16 year difference between the release of return of the jedi and the phantom menace i think what helped this film was the nature of the story its even more relative today than 30 years ago it follows a central post apocalyptic theme that is also very popular now it appeals to adults young and old admirers of the original story and those looking for a good action film im so excited that this movie was able to get made im still mind boggled by it but still very happy that this movie got made i saw it a month ago and im still geeking out about it to put it simply this is to the original trilogy to that of what george lucas hoped for with the star wars prequels,reality
i love this movie it is way better then the first three i love the nonstop action and explosions it just left me speechless i dont even think its right how amazing it is i loved tom hardy and charlize therons performances in this movie i loved furiosa and the guy with the guitar and the warboys immortan joe was an awesome villain tom hardy played a way better then mel gibson i really think tom hardy should get a trilogy nux was an awesome character george miller is a genius normally action sequels that come out a long time after the original dont do to well but this was released thirty years after and it was perfect this would be my second favourite movie,reality
oh what a daywhat a lovely day definitely was a lovely day and how can it not be when you watch something like this prior to watching this i did a marathon of the original trilogy and didnt liked them very much they may have been great in their own time but not anymore no idea why people loved them and i was of the opinion that this movie wont be that different from them luckily i was wrong so very wrong the movie takes place in a post apocalyptic world where nuclear war destroyed everything chaos and pure madness is what remains now in the previous movies this whole post apocalyptic world didnt really interest me all that much but in fury road i got just the type of execution that clicked with me and the world hooked me in story was never the selling point of these movies anyway tom hardy filled in the shoes of mel gibson as he played his one of the more typical roles with less talk and tough guy voice and such and he was great needed no big introduction or anything and we didnt get one either however the character who stole the show was furiosa played perfectly by charlize theron she was amazing being both toughbadass and emotionalcaring her character was the center point of the movie and it felt like she is the lead not the movie could have easily been called furiosa fury road the character development of some characters was pretty good and all of it was done on the run the whole movie is like this one big chase of epic proportions the action sequences were so satisfying and thrilling the cinematography was so perfect the editing and pacing was spot on many heart racing and adrenaline injecting sequences i was in awe multiple times throughout the movie due to the sheer beauty of carnage and destruction at display what made it even more awesome was that 80 of the action was all practical effects i mean wow just wow kudos to george miller and the teamthe movie utilized very vibrant and popping color filters making every frame all the destruction and madness more beautiful the explosions never looked more awesome and it was a very fresh sight to see too because almost all post apocalyptic movies have bleak degraded colors for dark tone and atmosphere the one thing i was most glad about was the soundtrack i hated the original trilogy soundtrack it was miscued a lot and was just bad im glad george miller went with a more modern approach and the resulting soundtrack was great and epic really made all the action more thrilling as for the negatives one thing that really popped out was that while cgi was sparingly used and most of it was great there were some moments where green screen usage was apparent and it really felt out of place because everything else was so top notch another thing that somewhat bothered me was the motion direction style that george miller sometimes adds into his sequences which makes them feel sped up and jittery all in all this was one hell of an action movie it has been a long time since i got this much entertainment from a purely action movie dont go into it thinking it has a deep plot and story and whatnot it is not that type of movie but it is still a must watch because honestly speaking it is a work of art for what it was going for 8510,reality
this is an action packed movie that truly delivers on its promisecome and see monster cars flaming guitars and hot super modelsthen watch them all go boooommmmm in a 2 hour long monster car race in a post apocalyptic desertthis movie makes a great cult classic as there is more to it then meets the eye plot is simple and straight forward however the details in this world need more then one viewing to take in it is truly a world gone insane and unlike many movies this one shows the insanity rather then tell it you see it for yourself and if you can wrap your mind around it itll all start making sense in this world anywayif you are into this kind of movies then you will love this continuation of a 30 year dome movie if you prefer character development and unexpected plot twists you will be deeply disappointed,reality
in the mid1980s 2 the road warrior represented the first time i ever saw a movie on vhs no joke there i was taking in the existential catastrophic splendor and thrusted into a funky eclectic world that only director george miller could deposit me in i was also taken aback by the aura of star mel gibson he didnt say much he just drove the big rig and gave any punk rocker delinquent the business via a veritable sawedoff shotgun when the announcement that a new installment was on the horizon some thirty years later it was also predicated on the fact that australias favorite son be omitted from the lead role brit tom hardy who seems to be everywhere these days got to inhabit the drivers seat haha the question on every moviegoers mind is can he fill the shoes of mel the answer is it doesnt matter fury road isnt entirely about the character of rockatansky and hardy for what its worth only possesses about a smidgen of melle mels ear to the grindstone screen presence for practical purposes though hell do and so will the movie its plot is slight yet there are action sequences providing enough scorched antics and kinetic motion to make your eyes shoot through the back of your head were talking apocalypse now more than everhistorically george miller has been in charge of every movie since their franchised inception back in 1979 he takes everything that made those films work and ratchets it up a few more notches here his world in fury road is made up of caricatures that for the most part are funkier nastier and much more repugnant this is imagination outside five boxes the look is more modern too cinematographer john seale he shot the tourist harbors a canvas that is ablaze drenched and vehemently dusty its like a sunburn that eventually turns golden brown as for storytelling sensibilities well they are fashioned less than in all three of the previous outings combined the script is the product of more than one writer and you think to yourself did it need that many in truth theres not a whole lot of dialogue anyway and i suppose whatever amount is messaged to the audience well it probably comes off as concealed no matter i honestly dont go to movies for the account i want to view what roger daltrey sang about that would be the tune by the who called lets see action granted this 2015 release has enough pyrotechnics villainy and aerodynamic exertion for ten movies with what seems like almost no cgi i hope the stuntmen got paid handsomely because they work some serious overtimenow the last thirty minutes of fury road are a masterpiece all in itself they make the flick better than it really is or even has a right to be you gotta use your utmost imagination or just think raiders of the lost ark on anabolic steroids what precludes is an extended chase sequence with enough semi trucks and other motorized vehicles to overrun the city of detroit there is violence in nature here and acrobatic candour that simply wears you outso who is this all attributed to well director george miller of course and at age 70 he is one feisty fellow this dude is like the martin scorsese of action directors because of his starryeyed energy thats blatantly possessed he hadnt made a film since 1985 so you know that he had a lot of time to subjugate his newest vision my thinking is that he might have checked out 1995s waterworld to mirror the costume design or to polish things up a bit or even to add some new angles there are shots in fury road where the villainous malefactors are off in the distance and you know that danger is coming it reminded me of said film so sue me his premise is in short doses and it intervenes between periods of metalgeared rubble and heavy metal stage progyou have of course tom hardy hes an australian prisoner and a man whos held captive while being used for upside down blood donation then theres imperator furiosa played by charlize theron in the token female badass role shes a war rig driver who is helping five wives escape from breeding slavery finally we have nux played by nicolas hoult who reminded me of the gyro captain from the road warrior hes a sick war boy and needs a large amount of ichor to go on surviving thats all im gonna reveal just know that all of these soupedup characters are in some way connected now your job is to buy a ticket get strapped in and let the chaos and upheaval simply spill onto the screenin conclusion this film has garnered four stars from many of the nations critics i myself enjoyed it but im scratching my head to figure where all the enormous praise came from heres how i chalked up my rating i gave fury road three and a half stars for the audacious relentless suspense and two and a half stars for the razor thin narrative that results in a solid dose of actionadventure fare but not something thats catered to magnum opus territory regardless this is still a road worth taking there are no exits no stop lights and the aspect of no passing lanes is irrelevant to quote nicolas hoults albino crackedlipped nux what a day what a lovely day natch,reality
lil pump is not ion the film really sad about this directors please add him next time and please dont report me or delete my comment thanks dudes,reality
dr george millers franchise has been pretty corny since the start fury road is about what you would expect most of the movie is an excuse for muscular people in weird outfits to go medieval on each other but i liked charlize therons performance as the renegade soldier freeing the sex slaves as for the main character it makes sense that they recast knowing what we now know about mel gibson would anyone want to cast him basically rockatansky is his usual tough self and immortan joe is the average villain but this movie belongs to charlize theron if you ask me they should have made imperator furiosa the star like sigourney weavers ellen ripley in the alien movies or any character played by pam grier furiosa is one stkickin babe watch the movie for her pretty ridiculous otherwise,reality
having anticipated this movie ever since the first trailer having seen this movie as soon as it came out in theaters and having bought it on bluray as soon as it was possible i can say without a doubt that this movie is great true i am not a connoisseur of the original movies but that doesnt mean i dont know a good movie when i see one fury road is definitely not all action and explosions though they are present from start to finish the movie also has its serene and meaningful moments these are always accompanied by stunning visuals and amazing cinematography whats almost more impressive than the film itself almost is the making of it with all cars and explosions being practical and the concept art reaching back 10 years truly a masterpiece infused with metaphors representations of industry war cult and economy all set in front of a beautifully designed backdrop,reality
disregard all the reviews youve seen saying that this movie has no substance or lacks a storyline the movie is supposed to be action packed and that can be distracting for certain viewers but when you look beneath the explosions and remember the whole point of the movie its quite a beautiful story about fellowship between those who rebel against an oppressive dictator for different reasons survival freedom peace and the most common theme of redemptionspoilers aheadthe scene where furiosa removes her prosthetic arm and drops to her knees after hearing that her home place has been destroyed gets a lot of criticism where its described as over dramatic but if anything is less dramatic than it should have been the main characters find out that their entire journey has been in vain and everything they hoped for has been destroyed of course this is hardest on furiosa because not only has she condemned herself to this horrible fate with false hope but also the entirety of her company also realizing that shell be killed even if the breeders survive and ill leave that up to you to decide which is a worse fate if that were my position id probably be upset at the moment too overall fury road is a highly underrated movie with a great storyline great character development and insanely great special effects i highly recommend re watching it if you havent yet keeping in mind the plot line,reality
well this movie is just a blast to watch george miller proves that a great movie can actually be made without a complex plot or tons and tons of dialogue with furiosa we finally get a truly strong female character turns into a side character by the and of the movie and it can be argued that she is actually the lead of this film tom hardy and charlize theron did a wonderful job as they always do other actors also did a good job playing their parts cinematoraphy is great cgi is unnoticeable and blended seamlessly with practical effects action is directed perfectly and all the hard work that was put into making this movie can be seen on the screen this movie is actually the best movie in the whole franchise overall this is not a perfect movie but it surely is the best action movie weve had in years,reality
i watched this movie with little expectations as was the case with most action movies in the last ten years i was blown away with the intensity of the high speed action sequences the continuous stunts and explosions mixed with the emotions that were delivered perfectly with minimal dialoguethe whole movie was a great journey to find furiosas homeland heaven on earth the plot gives you hope in a place where water is a luxury hell on earth almost everything around you drives your instinct of survivaltom hardy and the rest of the cast were excellent but charlize theron had the best performance in this movie fury road gave me hope that action movies can and will be great again,reality
continuing from the original film series although im not sure where this fits in continuitywise this movie finds tom hardy taken prisoner by the war boys a cultlike army for warlord immortan joe when one of joes rig drivers imperator furiosa charlize theron tries to help joes young wives escape the warlord gathers all his forces to pursue her being used as a walking blood bag for one of the war boys finds himself along for the ridebeing a fan of the original movies i was more than a little hesitant about a new one with a new actor in the role i was also hesitant with regards to george millers capabilities nowadays he has done mostly family fare since the 80s and lets be honest most of the great directors from the 70s and 80s have since lost whatever magic they once possessed to add to this the critics were all praising this movie and the hype was through the roof and im always skeptical of movies heavily pushed by the machine despite my reservations i can honestly say i enjoyed the movie a lot its action scenes are exciting and refreshing i do wish that miller couldve pulled it off without so much cgi there are many moments where the action scenes are diluted by the poor blending of cgi cartoonery in with the real but im sure i sound like an old fuddy duddy as i often do when it comes to cgi in action movies these daysi liked this but didnt enjoy it as much as the original series all of which ive rewatched within the past year my primary reason for this is that this doesnt feel especially unique in any way it feels like the previous movies visually and even homages certain things directly from those movies but it never feels like it adds anything of its own thats particularly creative each one of the previous movies built on the other and added new characters lines and moments that were distinct and memorable i also dont feel like tom hardy brings anything impressive to the table part of that is the scripts fault as is almost a supporting character instead of the star in the first half charlize theron gets the best role in the movie and easily outshines hardy who mostly just grunts his lines and tries to give his best blue steel for closeups so i do have some problems with this but at the end of the day it entertained the hell out of me and thats what matters most kudos to george miller for proving hes still got it now if only john carpenter could figure out where he left his mojo and give us one more great movie i would be ecstatic,reality
to just say this movies one of the best movies ive ever seen its great for the action blood gore insanity and mindlessness its also good for the special effects plot line unique weapons and characters of insanity if you like gory mindless action with good graphics you must watch this movie in the theaters this was a good birthday gift so this takes place in the middle of nowhere where a tyrannical scumbag is taking the lands resources and turning everybody into slaves his greatest assistant goes on a mission to bring several girls back to their home land from slavery as in the middle of this the well known is taken prisoner and collides with the assistant of the tyrant then they have to work together to fight against the continuous waves of this tyrantmust watch,reality
if someone asked me to describe fury road in one word it would most definitely be metal there really is no better suited term to this movie its just so freaking metal fans of the series know how hardcore the past films have been but this is by far the biggest thing to ever come out of not just a movie but any action movie everthe plot of the film is pretty simple so i wont go into too much detail it starts of with himself being taken prisoner by a group of death crazed cultists lead by a large disease ridden warlord called immortan joe in his attempt to escape meets up with furiosa a woman attempting to free immortan joes several wives the movie follows and furiosa as they travel across the barren postapocalyptic landscape trying to get to furiosas homeland all while being chased by immortan joe and his group of psychopaths called the war boysthe characters in this film are many particularly on the villains side but all of them stand out as an individual tom hardy as is the strong and silent battle hardened warrior charilze therons furiosa is one badass female character with a mysterious past and in truth the coolest character in the movie the returning hugh keaysbyrne as immortan joe is intimidating as all hell as well as his rag tag group of nutters however for me the stand out character was nicholas hoult as the newly reformed war boy nux he starts off as a fanatic of immortan joe but ultimately realises how his idol was just a dictator once he falls in love with one of the rescued wives his character arc is the most interesting to watch and he provides some much needed comedy in otherwise serious situations as well as having a few touching scenes with his love interest as wellof course all of this is not why you should see this movie you should see this movie because of the perfect incredible breathtaking action scenes everything that happens happens on the biggest scale possible in a way that similar to murphys law if it can blow up it will blow up the battles that take place on the road are exhilarating and in every one something incredibly entertaining happens without fail even the cars themselves are amazingly detailed and cool ranging from your basic spiky death machines to pimped out classics to a gosh darn giant war rig with a dude playing electric guitar on it the film is worth going to see just for this alone and the cool characters and insane adventure only add to the sheer insane enjoymenttrue the film is not without its flaws despite it being incredibly over the top there are a few things that feel a little bit silly and some moments between certain characters can feel forced at times but ultimately it doesnt take away from your enjoyment of the movie as a wholein the end fury road is a high octane thrill ride that is well worth the watch whether youre a fan of the series a fan of action flicks or just a fan of awesome visuals is the movie for you its absolutely mental but thats what makes it so great so get all of your friends together and just marvel at the sheer awesomeness of it get pumped when blows something up get anxious when a villain has the upper hand and most importantlyget furious road rage has never looked this good,reality
i watched fury road in 2d and when i first started watching it i thought something was wrong with the picture but after five minutes or so it became evident that the selective perhaps sometimes random variance in the frame rate from shot to shot was a stylistic choice probably made by george miller it was brave because the effect is extremely unsettling epileptics should probably avoid this and probably wont be everyones cup of tea so the choice couldve easily backfired the viewer is never able to settle into a scene and it keeps the intensity high the only respite being when they reach the green place and the frame rate is normal for a few minutes charlize theron is extremely strong and in my opinion steals the show or at least shares it equally with hardy who is like a crazed animal through most of the movie and as usual hardy does a fine job doing it easily one of the best actors around right now his vocal delivery is a little bit banelike and his is like a bronsonbane fusion my only slight complaint was the soundtrack the music is diegetic zzzz and coming from drummers and a guitarist who are part of the war boys pursuing convoy it couldve been handled better but it does add to the mayhem otherwise the sound design is a standard summer blockbuster mass of whooshes and rumbles and badly needs something like signature v8 interceptor which wouldve cut through the noise like a knifeim a big fan of the original two movies especially the second one and i still found fury road to be an amazing experience this is 100 an action movie though so do not expect to see a standard story its basically one long road chase even more extreme than road warrioroverall destined to become a cult classic and crying out to be watched a second time at least just wish trademark car had been in the movie more hopefully next time,reality
if im gonna die im gonna die historic on a fury road  nux fury road drove into theaters with furious anticipation due to excellent reviews that we have not seen from a blockbuster movie in a long while a mixture of sadly hearing i like going into movies with no knowledge of critically feedback about those stellar reviews before my viewing of this film and my favorite actor tom hardy playing my excitement for this film was a bit overwhelming could it live up to the hype my name is my world is reduced to a single instinct survive as the world fell it was hard to know who was more crazy me or everyone else this is the spine tingling start to fury road narrated by tom hardy in a world ran by the due to a reduction in the worlds oil the thought on the minds of everyone is simplesurvive in a beautifully shot opening which is consistent throughout the movie is chased down by cult leader king immortan joes hugh keaysbyrne men and imprisoned in there citadel he is used as a blood donor for halflife war crazed nux nicholas hoult who wants to die historic on a fury road while is locked up imperator furiosa charlize theron is sanctioned to lead a gas run with a convoy towards gas town on the road to gas town furiosa takes a detour and immortan joe discovers that his five wives are out of there chambers and furiosa sets the road she is traveling on a furious course the king in a desperate anger leads a historically wild and large war party to retrieve his property nux wanting to make a name for himself and to impress the immortal sets out to lead the rescue with chained to himself so he can continue to receive his blood which gives him strength the first of many absolutely breathtaking action scenes ensues between furiosas rig and joes army in a sand storm with tornados and all sorts of lovely natural elements nux drags into this sandstorm in pursuit of furiosas rig and declares it all as a lovely day lovelythis is maybe not the best word to describe the surrounding events for but for the viewerone of the straight up coolest and jawdropping scenes ever filmed the intensity captured and maintained throughout the movie is sheer brilliance displayed by director george miller the whole film in its most simplistic form is just one big chase scene but the execution and characters make this film so much more the movie throws you right into the story like so few successful movies have but the acting gives these characters such depth hardy hoult and most of all theron are so effective in a movie that is more about the ground breaking stunts and beautifully sadistic film making hardy like in many films doesnt talk very much for a main character but gives a fully expected performance marked by controlled brilliance hoult as nux gives energy and surprising heart to fury road in his quest for hope the theme of hope is rooted in this film nuxs hope began in an attempt to please cult leader joe in battle and ended in a quest to help those he was originally out to kill theron as furiosa was a gem and gave a strong women character that at times stole the show from the titled character passionately ran by redemption furiosa fights for those oppressed by this cruel apocalyptic worldfury road feels like hope in an action genre fueled by cgi and depthless characters it is unlike anything seen before and the intensity is jarring and never lets up george miller creates action scenes that are truly unique and will leave no one yawning hope has arrived not only for the characters in the movie but also for viewers and fans of action films what a refreshing cinematic experience not only because of the visceral action scenes but also the depth of the characters and themes while due to the hype the fourth installment of may not of left me fully satisfied it was pretty dang close even though my expectations were through the roof if you choose to see fury road it will truly be a lovely day for you and hopefully regain your hope in summer blockbusterscheck out more of my reviews httpwwwreviewsbycalebcom,reality
intense sequences of violence throughout and disturbing images mixed with highspeed editing a great new energy is pumped into this road adrenalin rush madness absolutely amazing a fact i really like is its not really explaining too much in the beginning so if you are new to the world its intriguing and brilliant from 10 secs in some have criticized it for lagging a plot and poor action there are much plot in this movie and great acting even the characters actions makes sense you can see what drives them and motivates them i gotta admit i loved it and i hope you will too,reality
okay dont listen to the party poopers who say this movie sucks blah blah blah you get get up and leave still the same action when you get back no no no no no no this is modern action at its finest there are parts in this movie of 1025 minutes of straight action but thats probably what youre coming to see for right miller throws in just enough character development to keep you interested  so dont listen to mr lame and uninterested because if you leave you probably will miss some of the movies soul what makes it a great movie instead of a good one the messages and all that tasty deep stuff so whats left is the action they completely exhaust action in the best way possible you wont be seeing the same mechanisms of combat again and again as the movie progresses its always changing cars are always blowing up but they wont blow up the same way they did ten minutes ago and by the end of the film youll wonder how the hell theyre going to make the sequel without showing you the same thing over again my one gripe i felt that toward the end of this film slowed down a little in terms of pace but just like a warming car engine the movie found its footing and picked up again,reality
fury road is the 4th installment in mastermind george millers insane post apocalyptic journey starring charlize theron monster hancock tom hardy the dark knight rises nicholas hoult about a boy and hugh kaeysbyrn as the movies villain immortan joeimperator furiosa charlize theron is assigned to a mission the mission is to drive the war rig and go through to the next town and siphon gasoline furiosa ends up double crossing immortan joe and stealing his 5 wives to take them back to her homeland where they can be safe along side her is a man of action and very few words together they must fight trough hordes of enemies in what is basically a 2 hour long high speed chasei have been waiting since i heard about the green lighting of this movie back in 2009 i have been waiting for almost 6 years for this thing my hype was high i wasnt sure it would live up to my expectations well i am here to tell you that it did it lived up to the hype and then some this movie is absolutely 1000 insane what you saw in the trailers wasnt even close to the level of crazy that goes down in this movie you know this movie is pretty much just all out balls to the wall action so if you think the trailers maybe showed off a little too much you couldnt be more wrongthe stunt work is choreographed and directed to perfection it is the most well crafted and stunning movie ive ever seen and will probably ever see which is kind of the norm and what to expect with a george miller movie theres explosions going off everywhere cars blowing up left right and center people being killed and blown to shreds but none of it is convoluted it all streams together perfectly you know what is happening when it happens the fact that pretty much 90 of this movie is all practical effects and all stunt work is mind blowing the cars that explode thats happening people bouncing from one side to the other on long poles at 60mph picking people up and flying then back across thats going down too too many blockbusters these days are filled with cgi and even with limitless amounts of stuff you can do with all of that none of it even is even comparable to the action in this movie the crap that goes down here other movies couldnt even dream to aspire towards such a spectaclepeople complain that theres not much of a story they wanted more well i gotta tell you the story is just what it needs for something to be great it doesnt need to be a vibrant cohesive piece of art the story is very simple and the simplicity of it is what makes it great theres enough story to keep you paying attention to it and not just going in for explosions not to mention that its not driven through its narrative or its dialog its driven by its characters and its action to which people also said they were underdeveloped and werent written very well from my stand point they absolutely werethe character of nux nicholas hoult was developed amazingly well i didnt really expect to see much from him but he really became his own in this movie he was developed enough to make you care he was written to be understandable in his actions and he was by far for me one of the best things about the movie furiosa was also developed just enough to make you feel something for her character shes one of the only good left in a world full of bad what miller does in this movie is make characters that not only do you are for but are also incredibly likable and super bad ass wasnt developed as much as some of the others but lets face it if youve watched the older ones which i recommend you do there really isnt much to him hes a man thats had everything taken from him and he has nothing left to lose all he wants is to be left in peace thats all hes every been and thats all he wants to carry on beingwhat i also love about this movie is that the lead character is a woman hollywood these days are always depicting women who need a man take care of them that they cant live without men that is definitely not the case with this movie furiosa is fierce shes skilled shes unpredictable and shes all out bad ass this is a testosterone filled movie but its not the testosterone that takes chargeaction movies these days arent normally as good as one of the reasons being is that the hero is never really in any really danger if hes never in danger or near death how can you possible expect to have your audience on the edge of their seats pondering what if the inevitable happened was in peril so many times in this film there was at least 10 times where i thought this is the end hes going to die then he miraculously gets out of it but its not the clich type when someone luckily comes along at the last moment and saves him believe me there arent many if any clichs in this movie he fights his way out of these death defying situations furiosa out other lead is also in life threatening situations throughout this movie many times where we wouldnt know if she would make it,reality
this post apocalyptic adventure film is full of action from the word go tom hardy gives a fantastic performance as the lead showing just the right amount of craziness and is brilliantly moving in the more emotional scenes the lead actress  charlize theron plays an equally emotionally stirring roll as she fights for the freedom of four young wives and the remainder of the population immortan joe the evil ruler played by hugh keaysbyrne is insane and terrifying i couldnt see the role being played by anyone else nicholas hoult plays the second male lead and like all the other roles in this film has been handpicked perfectly not many films can pull of 100 action all the way through and normally leave you bored of the plot line however this keeps you on the edge of your seat and begging for moreif you like fast cars action scenes crazy futuristic inventions and insane amounts of special effects and media makeup this is the film for you,reality
splendidsuperbfantaboulasamazing george miller has yet again magically crafted a masterpiece which sets new standards for action genre tom hardy his expressions  improvisations are just too good some actors dont need duologues to act expressions are enough  hopefully he will be at par with bale and dicaprio one day now charlize theron oh boy does she blows off the bad ones in the air and with style and bad ass action sequences she has proved that she isnt just a star she is a great actress finally nicholas hoult what a lovely day indeed what a lovely day fury road is an epic in every aspect ,reality
i havent seen the previous films but i do love the borderlands franchise which is heavily influenced by the universe so when i saw the trailer for fury road the trailer screamed borderlands to me i was totally on board for borderlands the movie and went in very excitedone thing i appreciated right off the bat was that we were thrown right into the story and action with little explanation tom hardy as is being chased and almost immediately captured while separately furiosa is smuggling the wives away the warlord immortan joe chases after furiosa with his war boys who drag along and thats the setup for the whole movie one big chase scene for survival the lack of exposition is very welcoming and the pacing is handled very well breaks in the action were perfectly timed so as to not leave one exhausted or bored is a great character a man of few words who grunts often as if its a struggle to for him to form words and when he does speak it is very simply charlize theron as furiosa is definitely the character who gets to shine in her quest for redemption she was a tough badass who could and did go toe to toe in a fight it was so refreshing that she and the wives werent helpless eye candy for to save the war boys reminded me fondly of the bandits from borderlands and i enjoyed their craziness and fanaticism what a lovely day indeedthe action was very realistic believable and intense minimal use of cgi definitely helped this movie maintain tension it was used sparingly and it never distracted me i loved the intense orchestral music and the use of the guitarplaying character and drummers was excellent george miller his crew and the actors did an amazing job if you are looking for the action movie of the year fury road is it this is a definite mustsee in theaters and i am already preordering the bluray,reality
if you are into action films this one is definitely for you non stop action excellent visual and special effects makes this film a memorable one you do not have to love action film to love this one everything is great about it plot is certainly memorable it is geared towards the younger audiences acting is great both the principal characters and the the other ones are great in their rolesyou have to love this film if you get involved into the plot and it is interesting to watch all the wayi simply have to recommend this film for the action loving audiences but you might just watch it for fun anyways even if you are not an action loving person it certainly will make your time worthwhile,reality
this film is the cinematic equivalent of eating a jar of raw ghost peppers dipped in jet fuel as you jump out of a plane as the norse gods do battle against the goons of loki as they wage ragnarok this movie is one long string of crazy overthetop action and violence that kicks in the teeth of the clich that remakes will always stink this film makes the three before it look tame in comparison being unapologetic in its own insane madness and craziness i highly recommend this entire film it does not disappoint oh what a day what a lovely day nux,reality
if you are a fan of the original movies you will not be disappointed i grew up with these movies and have them all on dvd when i saw they made a new one my first thought was that they were going to ruin it but it really lived up to the hypethis movie gave you the action of 2 with more of a story line the vehicles are just as over the top if not more they really did their homework on the original movies and did a great job not adding anything that wouldnt fit in with them i actually went to see it in theaters which i rarely do i actually dont remember the last time i went to the theaters must be 6years ago if you want to see this movie i suggest going now and seeing it in an i or 3d theater,reality
fury road didnt only live up to all the hypes it built for me it has surpassed the expectations on some levels its the ultimate action film believe the buzz 98 on rotten tomato 89 on metascore and 86 on imdb dont lie only some self proclaimed movie freak call this masterpiece a brainless horseshtblood boiling actions scenesunlike furious 7 doesnt follow the tamil action trend heart pounding musical score testosterone pumping car chasing are delivered as promised in addition i was greeted with a well written story and some of the strongest acting ive ever seen in a commercial filmim not gonna spoil it anymore like most of the producers are doing to their big cinemas with their trailers so heres the final verdict 810 as a movie in general and 910 as an action film watch it alone even if you fail to grasp the specialness youll enjoy a well spent two hours,reality
at last i get the chance to watch this muchhyped actioner in the local theatre squeezed in a thirdrate screenroom with a pretty small screen this is what i can find for a current movie enters its third week run in cairo the hardware facilities are inferior but we should all make the best of what we can acquirethis reboot of the cult brand of from the mastermind behind its original trilogy is a felicitous remedy to the generational fatigue of cgirampaged action tentpoles the world is overloaded with presently after decades of immersion into animation filmmaking paid off with an oscar trophy for happy feet 2006 with his codirectors george millers grandiose return to liveaction feature the first one after lorenzos oil in 1992 detonates the genre film enthusiasts with its cuttingedge visual spectacles which counter act the current trend with the majority of its staggering set pieces accomplished with blood andflesh stuntmen and authentic objects other than virtual fictionalisation aided by computers more pleasingly the film has already conducts a profitable boxoffice trajectory worldwide albeit it bears a hefty budget of 150 millions strictly speaking the entire picture is a longdrawnout wheelschaser it starts with furiosa theron an imperator who betrays immortan joe byrne the tyrant of a post apocalyptic world in the vast desert driving an oiltank truck back to her homeland eg the green place with joes five young wives on board and hardy joins the chase passively as a captive from joes war boys after a string of whiteknuckle experiences en route from foes to friends furiosa and one of the war boy nux hoult successfully outrun joes relentless pursuit and reach the land of hope but hope is a luxury in this world as humans are on the brink of extinction it only weakens ones most primal instinct to survive under any circumstances which abides by firmly together they embark on a more perilous journey to fight back to topple joes reign and take over the source of water and officially initiates a new chapter for the remaining humanity at long last we have a female heroine can faceoff with the main villain without sidelining to combat sidekicks or being cast as a convenient love interest for our hero during the break in this case the film is exceedingly refreshing therons furiosa is a brave warrior not once her female identity is used as a defamation or tease for cheap laughters in the battle sex is purely irrelevant we have a posse composed exclusively of women mostly grannies but they are no less combatant than the war boys here feminism is a word now has been unfortunately garbled by some very vicious intent but come what may i am absolutely in agreement with that this is a revelation and a tremendous progress of our society when we can treat woman as a veritable equal as man more essentially in the mainstream media for that reason only george miller and his team is worth a big ovation tom hardys although upstaged by furiosa most of the time is the definitive example of masculinity we should rightfully extol a man of action instead of vain words doesnt go all flirty with women especially the hot super model kind whenever he has the chance it is also a homage to hardys other wellknown character bane in the dark knight rises 2012 when he is curbed with a metal mask nicholas hoult on the other hand represents another virtues reside in a man the goodnatured innocence veiled with blind idolatry and finds redemption in the audacious sacrifice apart from its gallant stunt team the originality of its eyeopening visual parade is also superbly boosted by the unique dystopia aesthetics from the art production and junkie xls adrenalindriven score only if i could rewatch it on an iscreen it would be a paramount experience to drench ones frustration of our stereotyped blockbusters with stocky character settings and mindnumbing earth demolitions so it means a resolved no to san andreas 2015 and this is a film truly earns its entitlement for a sequel or a prequel since we havent know much about background yet hardy has already signed on for the next chapters now let us hope theron can return too and more blissfully with an equal paycheck to prove that we are not living in a retrogressive civilisation,reality
george miller returns to the big stage proving that hes got a few tricks up his sleeve yet with fury road a monstrously bold 120minute extravaganza with a road chase to end all road chases culminating in an explosive and thrilling final stretch miller clearly has a deep and comprehensive understanding and appreciation of the kinetics of cinemawhat he has displayed through this and previous films are applications of the foundations of what is needed to sustain momentum motion and fluidity of events within scenes what is displayed in fury road is as basic as what was seen in a vast array of silent filmsfury road is no holds barred through and through if you can submit to the unrelenting mayhem then i dont think youll have a better time i found myself at one stage thinking there is a gigantic truck and on the back of it is a mountain of speakers with weird looking dude playing a flame throwing electric guitar this is so awesomely weird that any argument i could make against it would be completely invalidthats not to say that i dont have criticisms the transitions between certain acts come off as cheap at times why dont you just cut instead of fading to black and then rejoining the action the unstoppable insane action can come off as exhausting at times though there are plenty of respites to help mitigate this effect the action moves forward so fast that some narrative elements and characters get lost in the mix some parts come off a bit trashier than others which leaned heavier into the realm of exploitation than i would have liked these are only minor issues thoughtom hardy and charlize theron in particular own their roles with wellchoreographed and unique physicality the stunt work is flawless the action has precise clarity the music from junkie xl is heart pounding and fits well with the action the anamorphic digital aesthetics are flawless with rich wellconceived desert night blues and scorching daylight oranges environmental factors and production issues meant that it took many years to bring this film to the big screen with mel gibson original set to reprise the titular role you could tell that miller has used every single one of those hiccups as an opportunity to retool and improve pre production aspects of the film and gladly this has made for a much better viewing experience this film does what its predecessors accomplished on the world building front while creating some brisk forward momentum simultaneously it takes a lot of talent effort and imagination for a movie that is for the most part wall to wall action to get me to still reflect on it once it finishes,reality
i have seen this film twice and remain completely blown away by the entire spectaclenormally i am not at all a fan of movies with little story that try to engage the viewer with awesome visuals and action clearly fury road is precisely in that categoryhowever i have to give credit where credit is duethey made it worki almost wish this was a completely standalone film that did not attempt to tie into the franchise because it has little in common with the releases from years past and for me mel gibson will always be the only all this latest film shares with the gibson releases is the name and a few of the general visualsso on to the actionsince that is all this movie really isi am certain at least some of the scenes in this film had to be cgi simply because there would be no other way to do them despite this it is seamless i can normally spot cgi a mile away and in fury road i honestly could not tell which effects were done with actual hardware and which were computer generated this is important because it is key to the amazing visual experience of watching thisthe action scenes were breathtakingim not sure how else to describe them they were accompanied by audio that on occasion gave me goose bumps particularly the air horns on the main war rig and the surrealistic music from the mutant rock and roller on the pursuing rigi realize this movie will not be for everyone but nonetheless i have to say it raises the bar for what can be put on the screen in the action film genre i am already trying to come up with an excuse to see it a third timehighly recommended,reality
peace doesnt the back of the leader of that place look like that of a toads that after the earth became nuked toads rose up to lead as humans from radioactive fallout caused toads best equipped to survive in such an environment there was others whom had toad like appearances some existed seemingly as where one would find a toads habitat some had legs withdrawn like looking at a toad in a resting position with its legs bent the way they do toads having to take on human forms for life to continue on earth movie i assume is portraying just how bad it is if we use nukes  whats left so sorrowful  not much hope to look forward to peace,reality
importantly its not just a matter of having a lot of action contrary to what we see in avengers age of ultron the action here is very realistic miller avoided imum use of special effects which resulted in a great and brutal sequences it does not give the impression that we are facing a game entitled only to a short presentation at the beginning the film has almost two hours of nonstop action its basically a large and insane car chase with little room for rest and no room for children who are the worst things of 2 and beyond thunder dome without fear of sounding repetitive its insane by the way it is also insane how much action fits like a glove in the script the viewer does not have much time to breathe but he did not ask for it he wants more and more as the inhabitants of the universe on the scene ask for water excellent,reality
george miller really hit out of the park with an unnecessary follow up of the old trilogy the first two are some fan favorites that still hold their effects and storytelling styles to todays movies the third was considered a let down but not a disappointment either as some young people would say like myself this movie is possibly the best of them and even could go down with some of the best action movies of all time the style that miller directs in is what i would say as a great mix of old gritty longshots action with modern effects and choreography of all the action sequences i dont want to focus about the praise worthy action and beauty of it what i like and respect most about the movie is its emotional aspect and character development the heroine feriosa is first shown as a highly respected and great leader in immortan joes empire the action starts from the getgo as the audience is not sure if feriosa is actually the hero but because of the great story telling we find that she is taking joes enslaved mistresses to a far away green piece of land becomes part of the conflict when he is captured and is used as a trophy on the front of a car of one of the warriors of joes army nux who drives the car with wants to recognized by joe and wants to be a great help to him and become a hero in his determination he catches feriosa first who everyone is after and that is where everyone meets each other as the plot moves on the audience sees nux loose confidence and become depressed that he may not redeem himself frriosa finds that she has not redeemed herself in that the green land she was to take them is now a wasteland as hope fades pulls some kindhearted ness out of himself comes up with the plan that will save everyone else for joe with no other choice this diverse group of people come as one and sacrifice for the greater good of course they succeed but not without loss and as the final is about to happen we see feriosa being praised as the hero and walk against the crowd being humble and a lone wolf the effort he shows even though he knows he wont benefit from it is the type of character that should be seen as a hero this movie has a quality action but the character development that miller shows takes this movie to the next level furry road is a must see,reality

wow i am blown away at this movie an immense portion of my childhood has now done it in this intense artwork of cinematic entertainment words cannot describe how intense this movie was or how much i loved this moviethe action amazing effect spectacular story gripping acting superb environment more than i could even imagine results an amazing thrill ride that will drive you more insane than the residents of the world of fire and bloodhighly recommend it to fans of the original series and to the new fans whos seeing this for the first time,reality
i was blown away by the action scenes when i saw it first time and it grew it up even more in my estimation due its visual poetry on repeat viewings director george miller not only perfected the genre that he created in the late 70s but adds surprising narrative heft dealing with serious themes such as sex slavery in a nuance way besides survival and redemption i found this movie so well made  direction cinematography production design costumes practical vfx effects scoreeven the acting is extraordinary with not overthe top comic book characters that i think that it could be one of those rare blockbuster which could get an oscar nomination as best picture at the end of the year my no 1 film in 2015 so far ,reality
this film is just awesome in every wayjust to clarify this is not a direct sequel to the original three films but rather the start of a new series featuring the character so you should not be terribly confused if you havent seen the older onesthe storyline while its the fourth installment in a series is quite unique and creative it is also very well thought out and compelling i like the characters just like in the older films is likable and a really cool protagonist joe is an awesome villain i like nux he is quite an entertaining antihero furiosa is also likable and i actually had feelings for her as well as those other women that ally i like the chemistry between and furiosai think all the actors and actresses played their roles very respectively tom hardy is surprisingly great as hes not mel gibson but hes about as close to another as youre going to get i liked nicholas hoult as nux as well as charlize theron as furiosa i also think that hugh keaysbyrne did an awesome job as joeminor spoiler i loved that guitar guythere is not a single thing about this film that i did not likeoverall i thought fury road was an awesome film and it just might be the best film in the series besides the road warrior i highly recommend this to fans of action flicks,reality
one one hand you could say that the plot is shallow and dialogue delivery is not up to the mark but on the other hand look at the innovation of the director each character in this movie is unique in its own way the immense amount of insanity demands appraisalyou see the movie and you will surely appreciate the vivid imagination of the director every character is interesting and entertaining tooregarding action this movie has taken it to the next level i could say it to be a combination of death race and fast  furious 7 amplified 10 times tom hardy did a descent role but could not impress owing to his weak script all racing movie lovers and all action movie lovers this is a must watch,reality
as hard as i tried i could not get into george millers or the road warrior although the latter at least proved to be a more developed postapocalyptic australia concept with progressive action it felt like a violent costume party for people who like things with engines now 30 years after beyond thunderdome miller takes his franchise out of the shed for a new ride and my oh my has it aged wellthe cornerstones of the franchise are most certainly there excessive violence overthetop characters and a story more invested in aesthetics than narrative but the chassis beneath it all this time is rocksolid and effectively compellingtom hardy takes over the franchise in fury road as rockatansky a lone ranger of sorts haunted by wife and child he failed to protect and countless others after being captured by the powderwhite war boys becomes a human blood bag for several war boys soldiers who worship immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne who played the villain toecutter in back in 1979 an overlord running his own colony who promises those who serve him to the death a place in valhalla the afterlife in what is supposed to be a routine gasrun immortan joes right hand imperator furiosa charlize theron betrays him and veers off the road making off with joes precious wives as her cargo he authorizes an allout chase to run her down and retrieve the wives a journey unwillingly becomes part ofthe plot is a straight shot out of a gun with just enough of a human element and a couple of complicated heroes to root for something the previous films were sorely lacking the context and character development is still minimal but miller and cowriters brendan mccarthy and nick lathouris use some creative substitutes such as hallucinations of his past that provide just enough depth to garner the audiences investmentyet the calling card of and fury road is the action and the postapocalyptic trappings in an era overripe with computergenerated effects the stuntdriven visuals of fury road offer something original in a sense miller has always been one of the greats at practical effects and with a little bit of help from modern cgi he blends the two in a way the feels more real and more explosivethe imaginative nature of the series also appears to have taken leaps forward even in the more ridiculously campy creative choices such as a the faceless electric guitar player strapped to one of the trucks who gets an unusual amount of screen time theres a certain cool factor that before just seemed grotesque and frilly this could simply be that the look stands the test of time well that nothing has compared to it in the last 30 years or it could be that we just dont get ballsy creativity like this in the blockbuster landscape these daysthe films have never necessitated great talent but hardy theron and nicholas hoult as a fanatical war boy named knux definitely add something to the film they arent asked to do much in the script but strong choices in facial expressions can tell a story just as well and its enough to make fury road more of a highstakes grind than a frivolous chain of vehicular stuntsand for this movie fan who for years never understood why this franchise held any degree of acclaim fury road shows miller for a true auteur whose twisted little apocalyptic lovechild will likely have a life on screen that surpasses his ownthanks for reading visit my site moviemusereviewscom,reality
great picture and sound by george miller have desire watch this film again and againwords cant express how thoroughly excitingly awesome this film is and i mean awesome in its truest sense im still in awe hours laterit is a beautifully epic insanely overthetop dangerously highoctane adrenalinefueled testosteroneinfused ballsout outrageous spectacle its a twisted darkly funny gothic symphony of violence and action that just keeps relentlessly revving up and pushing harder and faster til the very end it pushes all the boundaries and breaks all the rules but it does it while appealing to almost anyone,reality
this movie is beautifully shot im a fan of analog myself the clean digital cameras have their use but nothing beats that david fincherchristopher nolan grittyfilm look and this movie has it dont make the mistake of going to this movie for a slow building and articulate plot if youre in the mood for men you lay back in your rocker and settle for a drama if youre in the mood for you sit up straight to better get your face rocked the actors all hold their weight but the true scenestealers are the costume and set designers on top of that its beautifully shot yet it moves at a very choppy pace very little of the film footage was shot at normal speed but that just all adds to the fun,reality
phewwi loved this movie after a long time a movie so captivating 1 the story is simple no complicated script thus no calculation or cross questioning required  2 the stunts of the movie are impressive and can happen in real in other words the effects in the movie are practical in real life unlike avengers superman batman etc which are pure fantasy unreal with everything high flying and gossips which i always watch in disbelief but mm  fury road is awesome  3 its creative  george miller has been very creative in creating and imagining all those vehicles shown in movie its easier to show collection of expensive and sports cars etc  but it takes real energy to create one for your own movie but here we had 50 vehicles designed just for this movie  4 the rawness  i always used to like western classics where all cowboys used to chase each other or train for robbery this movie will give similar thrill but difference is its on wheels   5 the rockband on a war bus is awesome because it also depicts the character of the villain how much a person can be crazy or adrenalin hungary he has been shown a person rising to the cult status post apocalypse enjoy fury roadcheers,reality
look it is not a perfect film in any way it doesnt have many levels the plot is almost the same as in 2so what good solid entertainment i saw it 3d iwould recommend it 3d in my view only a few films deserve 8 even fewer 9 and no film 10 as that would be perfection so 7 is good in booksthere is a lot of action then more action then even more action only a couple of boring scenes and a couple of silly things but they are more than enough made up by some innovative action sequences there are quite a few things i havent seen in other films which is good one minus was that the gore has been tamed down a bit to get it our for wider audiences it wasnt a major issue but you could really see it in a few short action scenes where a little more blood would have benefited the filmso thumbs up from me,reality
its a damn shame that every action movie cant be as good as fury road so many action films will try but will ultimately fail for a variety of reasons pure action filmmaking and movies just dont get better than this movie fury road is a troubled story to say the least original creator george miller who made the original three films had the idea for this fourth installment back in 1998 thats 17years ago this project wasnt necessarily put on a hold shelf but a few things had happened to delay the film from being made from 911 to foreign policy to mel gibsons infamous arrest there were a variety of things that prevented this movie from seeing the light of dayyears went by and george miller went on to make happy feet which is a far world away from the likes of these films however the script showed up again and some rewrites happened and miller got all excited again hence this new film at first miller wanted gibson back in the iconic role but both he and miller decided to revamp the series and go with a different cast and angle that pretty much brings us to fury road starring tom hardy as make no mistake about it this film is epic in every way and i dont say that lightlyits a rare occasion where i get overly excited for a movie and have the highest form of expectations when after viewing said film it meets and exceeds all these expectations thats the case with fury road not only did george miller build on this postapocalyptic universe he also made one of the best action films ive literally ever seen with mostly using practical effects and not cg there is really zero down time in this film from start to finish something big is happening on screen which doesnt allow you necessarily to get one breath in let alone blink your eyeswhat i like about this film is while its a remake it doesnt need to spend any time with a backstory for miller knew that almost all of us would know the general gist of the story going into it hence we are thrown in straight to the action from scene one tom hardy escapes the grasp of an evil monster of a leader named king immortan joe who enslaves the poor people below him and keeps all the precious and rare water for himself crosses paths with furiosa a badass charlize theron who is taking five women who were impregnated by king joe to a better place to liveking joe doesnt like this one bit so he takes his insane minions and all of their weaponized vehicles along with a few other war lord gangs and chases after and these women these car chase sequences and fight scenes are legendary each and every one of the 150 stunt men and women earn their pay check the more with the chaotic stunts that are shown here plus more or less takes a back seat here where furiosa and the other women show that they can handle themselves in any situation however for sure earns that name herethis is the purest form of action which each character and story told through very little dialogue but somehow through the intense battle sequences and their facial expressions you bond with them nicholas hoult plays one of the minions named nux and hes unreal in this role i cant believe the little kid from about a boy turned into this amazing character fury road really has it all in the form of action explosions gun battles chainsaws and vehicle chasesthere is so much happening on screen that youll have to go back for a second time to catch it all i just wish that other filmmakers who were making an action movie would take notes here and follow suit because this is exactly how to make a movie fury road is the ultimate summer movie and i dont see that changing any time soon,reality
in terms of an action film fury road hits with significant impact blood rushing action and brilliant explosions its use of actions speak louder than words takes its double meaning to life to some degree it may be considered the thriller necessary to open the eyes of the blind those who settle down for less and watch this will definitely be woken instead of a generic story line and mere predictability it provides realism most havent seen in its dynamic rushing storyline as every second induces suspense within the atmosphere it proves that action is not dead and george miller is indeed a mastermind,reality
this movie is a must see i mean that literally the visual effects stunts and costume design of this movie make it worth going to see i was amazed at the effects this movie pulled off while in full speed of a car chase not to mention the high wire stunts the character dress in this film was very appealing too i found myself just looking at certain characters for their design the storytelling is good too however if you are not familiar with the previous films it will leave you in the dark for a bit however it makes itself clear before the end all that said this has become one of my favorite movies and i highly recommend you watching it,reality
before i see this movie i was expecting nothing from iti like the original trilogy but i didnt thought that fury road was meant to be like the others actually i thought it would be a disaster after seeing it i was literally happy and my hands were holding my head because i thought it was about to explode the movie was really expensive but its all there every single dollar the cinematography is perfect direction the performances specially charlize theron soundtrack visual effects and the action all perfect and for the people that didnt understood that the story of the movie was in the action all the characters were developed during the action and all the story too so yes the screenplay is perfect too like everything in this movie fury road is pure cinema,reality
possibly the best action movie ive ever seen it will also likely be the best movie i see all year why is this film so good 1 nonstop action with an offthecharts wow factor mostly based on real world practical effects which are always more convincing than cgi 2 characters who are genuinely sympathetic no matter how strange they seem at first 3 a wellthought out intricately detailed and consistent world which is certainly no real world that could exist but is a perfect embodiment of the mythic universe 4 technical perfection this is one of the most beautifully and expertly made films i have seen in a long time brilliant photography design editing costumes makeup pacing acting etc etc a final word if you havent seen it yet do so you will not be disappointed in spite of any expectations created by my gushing review,reality
having read so many high praise reviews i was naturally hyped going in to fury road after all its predecessors are great genredefining films and after all the rave this film was getting i set my hopes ridiculously high now normally in doing so id walk out of the theater with my hopes tamed and lowered not so with this filmthis film not only met my high expectations it blew them out of the water every detail of this film is diamondcut to absolute perfection probably what stunned me the most about this film is how real it all seemed not a bit of it felt unrealistic  the usual oh that could never happen this movie has an exceedingly refreshing real feel to it so often in bigbudget action blockbusters you see cgimania effects so obviously animated that they ruin the effect of the film this movie remains real  real stuntmen real explosions real people doing real actionthe performances in this film are topnotch  oscarcaliber id say tom hardy serves his purpose wonderfully as although at times he becomes a costar in his own movie but its all for the good of the movie nicholas hoult also delivers a uniquely memorable performance as nux a crazy follower of the villain immortan joe who ends up fighting alongside the real star here is charlize theron who outshines everyone and everything as imperator furiosa a freedom fighter in immortan joes own ranks theron absolutely lights up the screen with permeable emotion stunning subtextual depth and real action she has become one of the alltime female action heroes alongside the likes of sarah connor every moment of her performance is once again visceral and realthis film makes an interesting feminist story the story revolves around the liberation of immortan joes breeders or basically babymaking sex slaves with the aid of furiosa they make a daring escape alongside and together they make their way across the barren wastelands in search of the green place  a land where its green and there is hope and redemption rare is it in hollywood to see so much of an agenda shoved down an audiences throat and yet it remains completely acceptable and not preachy feminism has never shone brighter on film than this film men and women fighting together on equal footing for womens rights  it was a joy to seethere are only a few other things to be said the cinematography is beautiful  the action sequences are beautifully filmed not only showing everything in beautifully choreographed detail but the camera knows when to look on and when to tastefully look awaythe music is very apropos to the frenetic situations crazy and upbeat during the action and heartwrenching and moving during the times of sadness tenderness beauty absolutely fantastic reboot of a classic franchise 1010  would recommend,reality
not just the best movie the best action film everthe two main characters are played extremely well for how little dialog is in the movie charlize therone had the acting chops worthy of the franchise i was a little concerned about a not played by mel gibson being a huge fan of road warrior but by the 2nd watch i was used to it tom hardy is a different less human but still both a sympathetic and bad ass characterthe villains were the best most complex characters in the franchise yet with a sufficiently deep and broad back story as well as even some tangible humanity in them sure they were still villains and ultimately bad dudes but in several scenes their mostly hidden redeeming qualities are revealed they werent all scumbags like most of the villains in the previous moviesthe photography is crisp and vibrant for a film that moves so fast but the action isnt the jerky hardtotakein handheld camera junk you can satisfactorily absorb the entire movie blow by blowthe costumes are right on outrageous without being over the top lots of possibilities for halloweenthe best part the score and soundtrack of this movie really bring out the beauty in the fury and the chaos in the carnage between that and the emotion in the characters especially the villains this movie stands above the other 3 even road warrior which was one of my favorites for decadesthe only reason i didnt give it a 10 is because there are still some things i would tweak,reality
as a huge fan of the original films 1  2 id always wanted another that was like the road warrior on steroidsmiller has returned to make a chase movie thats like the road warrior on steroids and its actually so much better than what id imagined it could be i even think it may have replaced the road warrior as my favourite mm movieit doesnt really feel possible that a hollywood movie of this kind could ever really exist it defies the very conventions of the studios that churn out the same old stories because miller and because is a style of story that is not often retold although django touches on similar themesthis is a brilliant reinvention of the road warrior chase turned into a whole film and with a load more warring factions involved this far surpassed what i ever expected from a new mm sequel intensely grueling action and live stunts from start to finish and just enough dialogue and enough depth to the few words combined with clever storytelling to create meaningful and believable characterseven the cars which are the most ott and gritty of any mm film despite being real trucks and not having smiley faces on the grills have a huge amount of character and development in this filmwhile its primary visual focus is on destructive car fetishism its underlying themes are liberation emancipation redemption anarchism and empowerment its a brilliant film with a brutal retro style that i never thought i would see in modern bigbudget cinema,reality
absolutly one of the best films ive ever seen i could hardly falling sleep after watching this film omg,reality
being such a huge fan of the first 3 i was concerned that went away im 10 minutes like the road warrior this involves a big rig called the war rig it does all kinds of neat stuff ya have to look at as a story a story people tell so timeline doesnt matter imortan joe is signed on for 3 more films but he died in this one so someone else will tell a different story his car may be put together or it may not be hes just a guy trying to survive and help people when he has too to survive and the fact that 90 of it is real the guitarist actually burned himself on accident because they really built that guitar like that its insane the more you watch and the more you see,reality
you better fasten your seat belts for this spectacular rollercoaster ride through the postapocalyptical wastelands this movie is packed with action and awesome stunts captured by amazing camera views from beginning to end also the world is just so bizarre in every little detail that you will discover a lot of new things rewatching this movie definitely one of the biggest movies since the 2000s,reality
a visually magnificent spectacular adrenaline ride from the viewpoint of the camera directing set design makeup props and action at the top of the genre the music and the sound in general are fantastic but from the point of the story rather thin and without much to do with the original trilogy and without gibson thats not it tom hardy is good but he just cant replace him although i have to admit that the cast is really great and the strongest impression on me was made by nicholas hoult which is worrying when we take into account all those women big recommendation but i wouldnt watch it again810,reality
this was definitely the best upgrade of the late 1980s trilogy its action filled with mild topping of comedy it is definitely an a highly recommended tom hardy always reminds of the character bane in the dark knight risespeace out,reality
charlize theron deserved at least a nomination for this role didnt she,reality
to put this quite simply everything about this film is insane this is quite possibly the best action film of the 2000s and probably the best action film of the 2010swith quite limited dialogue throughout miller manages to engage you with incredible action with excellent cinematography to display it if you want to see nonshaky camera showing wide shots of explosions and literally what you think of when someone says action then this should please you thoroughly the way the action has been created for this film is jawdropping especially in the final act and most of this film uses practical effects and extremely minimal cgi and it looks so much better than other action films or action within films that use cgithis film is also the perfect example of showing heroicstrong female characters really well imperator furiosa is definitely my favourite female character from any action film and maybe my favourite female character from any film or very close to my favourite there are other female characters that vary from a rather young age to a rather old age actually and they are all portrayed to be capable and awesome himself obviously is a main character but to be honest the title of this film doesnt really fit whilst is in it its really furiosas film and story but nevertheless still does have a lot to do with the plot and is still a major character tom hardy and charlize theron nail their roles and put some really good performances to the screen it is also worth mentioning that the score is absolutely fantastic and really fitting for the theme of this filmto reference chris stuckmann in his review of this film this is the best 80s action film that was not released in the 80s i highly recommend this film to not just action fans but film fans in general it is currently my favourite film of the decade and my favourite action film of all timemy ratingscharacterscast  1010plot  910dialogue  910visuals  1010music  1010overall  1010,reality
how they make movie like this i cant describe this movie just perfect perfect perfectwitness me,reality
the movie looks amazing you can call it eye candy but the visuals are freaking great a shame though that once you strip that away the story itself isnt much to talk about its pedestrian its unexceptional its actually even worse than that barring the visuals its an outandout average film with propagandistic feminist undertones too bad  it couldve been a great film,reality
fury road is a wild ride that is meant for multiple viewings in my opinion good performances by charlize theron and tom hardy as well as the rest of the cast and in particular the daring action sequences and editing make this story a truly enjoyable feast on the eyes and exciting i liked the visual effects and was surprised by how well they were done and better than almost all other movies with similar postapocalyptic plots,reality
amazing use of bright desert colors and not so blue night feels quite different than the usual dull theme for such movies i love the use of live vehicles and scenes over excessive cgi depends on movie type tho building those vehicles setting up real explosions using real polecats and rock riders all make the movie a better experience 3act structure plot well defined as well as show dont tell well executed the tension escalated steadily reaching the movie cliand giving a satisfying end the return chase was actionpackedanother kudo to miller for cutting frames during any actions well thought of gives off interesting vibes theres unfortunate logic in that humans would likely use other humans as meat and milk resources like food water and oil would be guarded and tyrants would riseyou can see how poorly joe views his people war boys produce and breeders joe wasting so much fuel in his race is an amazing display of power hes so rich he has enough to throw away at least thats the image he gives to his followers since he gets called out by the people eater best line from joe is the dont get addicted to water youd expect someone to say the same but for coffee also the war boys indoctrinated from childhood and proudly dying for a leader that doesnt care for them ouchfuriosa badass strong female character represented in much more than just kick ass she earned her high rank position although im sure it cost her arm she wants redemption surely for the horrible things she had to do the war boys dont even question what she meant by detour taking joes wives was such a bold move upon discovering the green place is gone you can feel the pain with herobvious that several women have been sexually abused yet no need to show the actual act kudos for showing their trauma feelings and various reactions the 5 wives were so diverse in personalities another plus for joe treating his wives well theyre healthy educated and have their own space living the high life despite being rape victims this way they will give birth to a healthy heir itd be no good if he treated them like trash and underfed themliterally haunted by his past enough to hear voices and see things funny how is just there along for the ride furiosa drives the plot and he follows thanks to nux for bringing his blood bag along plus once nux is separated from joe long enough he becomes saner even becomes more trusting while fury road can stand on its own its useful to watch the previous three movies to get a feel of who is and the worlduse of the war rig is top notch thats one way to drive shiny and chrome best vehicle it could even be its own character at this point the storm was such a great render with an amazing quality and terror using lost knowledge and repurposing everyday objects are so realistic miller in his commentary is right that people would cherish the things they have left every scraps would be reused the unforgiving hot desert wasteland dunes and dread are both astounding to look at and terrifyinganother good note is the use of disabled people not just furiosas one arm or insanity the doof warrior is blind and i presume the drummers behind are too miller has done a great job in showing that physical and mental impairment dont prevent people from surviving the apocalypse the use of medical conditions like fever cancer tumors and stitched wounds make the environment feel harsh only a few like the wives are in top shape because reasons cited earlierthe acting entirely believable the war boys are complete lunatics suicide bombing wanting a glorious death furiosa has one arm while the actress has both and despite this you can believe an arm is missing in movement and use of the mechanical arm as mentioned the 5 eives with different personalities and nux changing over the movielastly glad joe is dead and furiosa took his place in a positive light,reality
i never watched the movies from the 80s but i recently saw a video essay on youtube about this one and decided to give it a watch it exceeded my expectations in so many ways the use of practical effects were amazing it was like car pirates on the open desert that paired with awesome characters including the bad ass old ladies just so cool and weird and awesome loved it,reality
play fury road it is fast and easy to view a good way to spend your time be the best,reality
well so much said about this film and my review doesnt add anything new just that i had to express how impressed i was watching a movie with a simple storyline but amazing aesthetics you can watch it over and over and enjoy it like the first time,reality
my world is fire and blood george miller went full maestro mode this is one of of those films that miller was probably dreaming about for 40 years this is a film in which his visionary concept is fully realized he interweaves high octane action scenes throughout an unforgiving aussie postapocalyptic world and it never comes off as unneeded or over done which is something the fast and furious franchise suffers fromsome of the vehicles are battle armored v8s that resemble metal beasts of hell some of the older films i am sure suffered from budget constraints and you wont see many vehicles lacking hereeven though the movie is a big chase scene filled with millers stylized action the movie never loses its humanity or soul out here everything hurts these arent shallow protagonists suffers from ptsd furiosa isnt just an escapee everyone has suffered except the psychopaths the reasons and motives make sense in that worldi still respect mel as and i also see hardy as can you imagine someone else playing rocky or conan the barbarian maybe rocky no conan yes for me replacing actors is not an easy feat to pull off and coming from a super fan they pull it off right awaythe dialogue is minimal but catchy and appropriate to the scene say bye bye to the neck instead of youre dead meat is fun and memorable you will never hear the word mediocre the same again the manner in which the main villain labeling something mediocre to boys is hilarious what a bullythere is directorial genius to george millers world that cant be seen in any other action films and it isnt for everyone it is an action masterpiece,reality
with its awesome visuels fury road is a mustsee for every action movie fan,reality
this is my first movie that i saw about movies the old ones i never saw it but some day i am going to saw it,reality
its very hard to review a picture that has already been regarded as a classic and best action movie of all time but here goes 2 was a damn hard film to recreate and the look and feel of fury road comes very close with jawdropping stunt work and some stunning battle sequences just like the road warrior the perfect movie its folk being runover at 120 mph which is a standard brilliant feature of any george miller movie where it fails is that the whole film is one long chase sequence and you wonder why they are bothering to risk life and limb in doing so for halfway through the movie the character has little involvement and even spends most of the second half strapped to the front of a car the narration is told throughout the endless chase but its unsatisfactory as the time expects the main character is a female so its more of a case of ine you think it would have been simple to have just cut half the chasing away developed the new tom hardy version of to a younger audience so they know what hes about his history and just crank up the violence you really miss the colourful characters developed in 2 and most of all the hilarious helicopter pilot you had such empathy for their fate and rooted for mel gibson all the way fury road just might be the most spectacular of them all but its perfectly flawed,reality
i love this movie with all the practical effects instead of cgi charlize theron is briljant and so is tom hardy but can you imagine this movie exactly the same but with mel gibson instead of tom hardy then it would be a 10 not that i dont like hardy in this movie but if i hear i think about mel gibson just my opinion,reality
this the best most grandiose action spectacle ever made it may be equaled someday but can never be topped for the result would be far too ludicrous to be any good i sincerely hope they never make a sequel,reality
the style of this film fresh deep and coherent with a voyage and return plot it flips the parts a bit around and becomes a unique piece while stile being blockbuster action with a basic story on the top layer making it a film even a kid would really like not that kids should see it of course it puts the experience of the protagonists on the edges of experience and it is not often i have been so dragged into the drama we see our heroes go through super fun stoned but im sure its ok sober,reality
there are some things that are impossible to translate for one medium to another lets put for example those unfilmable novels and how difficult was to bring it to screen like tom tikwers perfume so is punk rock music to this date the closest translation was walter hills the warriors that ended in 2015 when this masterpiece was released,reality
fury road directed by george miller is a visual masterpiece this film contains some of the best action sequences in recent years the fast paced editing stunning cinematography and limited dialogue transports the viewer to this dystopian wasteland winning 6 academy awards i give this film a 10,reality
one of the biggest surprises of the 2010s for me was this film yeah i enjoyed the original films but they never stuck with me like some other action flicks from the 70s  80s but this is a different story aesthetically this film is stunning the action scenes feel gritty and tence and the music is masterful especially brothers in arms loved this film from start to finish and my pulse hasnt raced during an action film like this for years would reccomend to any action film junkie,reality
theres not much story here but the exciting action sequences and car chases will keep you hooked if the cool costumes and music dont,reality
the action is awesome there is no shaky cam and not that much fast cuts joe the antagonist is a great menacing villain the entire movie is a 2 hour nonstop action thrill ride every scene involving is awesome of bad assbut he only reason i didnt give it a 10 stars is because there is not that much character development or building although the pros obviously outweigh the cons,reality
what the hell happened nonstop action little plot who needs it enough to hold the story together good cinematography which complements the action packed chase scenes a must watch i hope they make another,reality
quick reviewwatched this on 4k dolby atmos third time ive seen it i cant quite understand what is is about a dystopian vehiclular film where little is said that appeals but it doesits an action film with almost constant movement a visual feast glossy and full of some great cinematography and superb stunts tom hardy and charlize theron are both great and say little both trying to become the characters i suspect with little choice as the characters told you little about who they area stunning dystopian turbo charged visual feast of a film i look forward to watching again 810,reality
if you do not see the previous series it does not matter much watch a nice action,reality
maybe it suits young people very well heavy metal style watching 90 of the movies flying car battle scenes you cant help but feel passionate poor guitarist youve run out of fingers,reality
action never stopped throughout the movie this made the 2 hours movie very pleasent and bearable,reality
from the word go it does and its a ride and a half  a post apocalyptic search for home in a world where water and gasoline are worshipped its brutal and mesmerizing possibly one of my favourite movies of all time,reality
good ol y boy is back and hes hungry this visceral beauty of the future in apocalyptic australia with a backdrop like something from metallica and then some is awsome the cinematography is phenomenal so good in fact that i forgot the highest end of acting between the two dear buddies charlize  hardy who on screen are great together and perfect for this remake thats possibly better than the originalsorry its a hard one so1010 best film of 2015 easily  a must watch i also must add after seeing bloodfather with mel gibson it would have been interesting if he regained the mantel but tommy boy hardy never lets u down,reality
the practical effects are amazing to look at the characters dont say a lot but you can tell what theyre thinking about by just looking at ttheir faces the action was intense even the cars and outfits they were wearing were interesting to look at fury road 2015 is a glorious film that puts you in a world that is far out of society and gives us the most insane effects and moments that shock you and make you pumped at the same time however it is still a flawed film heres why there were unexplained aspects like the people in the swamp area or the flashbacks had its more or less open to interpretation for the viewer i at least see the flashbacks as the people let down and the swamp people arejust weird i honestly never figured out what they were the story was also simple thanks to nostalgia critic on channel awesome i figured out that the story was only a chase if you look at the film the theme is there and it can be either seen as genius or potentially lazy i find it to be something with good intentions but kinda of a weird outcome however a lot of the aspects and characters in these story make this movie worth it to watch 910,reality
this is not about tom hardly very ambitious and stylish movie an art feast,reality
this the best most grandiose action spectacle ever made it may be equaled someday but can never be topped for the result would be far too ludicrous to be any goodi sincerely hope they never make a sequel,reality
this is one of the best films ever produced by any action film maker this is outstanding with effects innovations and most of all the greatest story ever to be put on screen with such grand scale post apocalyptic themedloved it one of my all time favourites,reality
an amazingly well made movie really kept the vibe going to whole time,reality
the colour grading and photography are great but dont go trying to convince me that a load of look at me im beautiful scantily clad cast members and the regular agressive lead an endless road race and overly sexual staged fight sequences makes up for the fact that the script isnt there there isnt a story and all character are as superficial as charlize theron in a dor perfume advert 49 out of 50 meta critics gave this a positive score and i can only think that theyve been purchased as theres no sense to the content of the reviews nobody mentions the very thin character portrayals repetition of expression  nobody wants to look unattractive in their behaviour on screen  zero storyline the pouting the endlessly boring 1000 yard stares superficial surface hollywood cool performances faking and confusing dramatic intensity for staged sexual poses and a cast doing there best to be ramp up the sexual or sexually aggressive wont save a poorly written action film with thinly built characters you feel absolutely nothing for some of the photography and some of the colour grading is beautiful but good look feeling anything for the characters as your watch this hyped up commercial cataclysm that tries its best to get you hooked on bare skin sex and violence but loses its way amidst the endless sand storms of overly long desert car chases where has story script and character depth gone in the action genre bring back die hard,reality
review i love this movie because it shows the equivalent of equal rights because it sends the message that parents have been telling their daughters forever which is you can be the hero of the story and you dont have to be beautiful or all dressed up the direction is incredible and the screenplay is all over the place but the amount of action and character development more than makes up for a story that is incredibly hard to follow and doesnt make sense at times the casting and acting are incredible especially by charlize theron as the first truly human female superhero and tom hardy as but a much more real human in a sense but a war torn survivor who is not the hero of the story but still an important piece to the story all in all i would give this five out of a possible five stars,reality
in yet another postnuclearapocalyptic film an unlikely group of rebels gradually join forces to escape across a desert from a brutal tyrant and his forcesregarding action and special effects this movie is a fun ride and admirable as well the trouble is that the action is almost nonstop the scenes arent repetitive or dull but their excess seems to put the film out of balance and in need of more breaks for other storyrelated elements like character development and letting the audience know why people are doing what they are doingthe film editing also seems less than stellar during these action scenes improvements might have helped viewers in keeping up with what was being done by whom against whom also as most characters in the chase scenes are white barechested men with shaved heads it was almost impossible to tell them apartthere was an interesting addition to the story of a small tribe of women of various ages most of whom were over fifty to include such a group is a step forward for a bigbudget hollywood film but overall the flaws and lack of balance left an incomplete feeling,reality
what a waste of time to watchthe first one was the ultimate best,reality
if youre looking for a twohour car chase this is your movie but if youre looking for a solid plot more than rudimentary character development or a leading man with a personality youre out of luck the stunning visuals and charlize therons powerhouse performance could not distract me from the reality of this filmthat its full of sound and fury signifying nothing,reality
fury road has been an aficionado to the predecessor but we can not deny that it is dynamic nostalgic and thrilling but it has given very little to an aaa movie the budget was also the cradle based on historical details that george miller and mel gibson have embedded in a steampunk atmosphere and have a good actor in tom hardybut you did not come up for something youre the story of the first twenty minutes of an aaa movie flat and nothing to say its great to be able to reconsider that our hero gets from a to b and then returns in 2015 this is little it does not have the plus of less money and the worse actors could have brought such a quality it was good for her to be happy with tomlets continue our saliva on the nostalgia train and into a seemingly long journey through which a stomach asthmatic old man runs in sum fury road 610 can be viewed and endured once but nothing moregoogle translate,reality
it may sound strange but thats probably why this movie stands out as watchable compared to every other hollywood product in recent years you see americans have these rules how youre supposed to write stories what they have to include and how characters need to be built im seeing it all the time on pinterest steps to include in your story what no you cant write like that well obviously you can but if you think that there are mandatory steps for a story you can then also write a bot to spew up stories for you and it feels like hollywood is doing just that they press a button scifi and machine prints out a sci fi script it is well established fact that hollywood never wanted to be paying its writers and now they have replaced them with robots they dont have to pay at allsince this movie didnt have a script its actually good compared to everything else it works its raw you believe the characters they feel more natural than almost all other recent charactersi guess my point is if you cant produce a script that makes you stunned or if you cant produce a movie with no script at all probably dont make a movie,reality
 if youre a fan of the originals which i am you will not be disappointed  absolutely outstanding  acting  plot  production values  direction  brilliant  if not seen the originals  dont worry youll still enjoy a big action flick,reality
great visual effects along with the story line 3 y,reality
i remember first watching this movie on the big screen in i3d my eyes and my head were really hurt on that day but it was worth iton the 13th time watching it this film is truly a huge masterpiece everyone call other movies such as aliens or terminator 2 as the greatest action movies including die hard from 1988 i defiently agree with them but fury road is the greatest action movie ever madefrom the first shot until the end this movie is just an incredibly powerful chase which never stops for a moment but it really has deep story and thoughtprovoking themestom hardy replaced mel gibson but hardy is awesome the same as gibson lets not talk about the incredible charlize theronthe villain made me chills and nightmares every time he was on the screenpowerful incredible action sequences amazingly beautiful cinematography and visual effects and of course the talented cast,reality
one of the most engaging movies ive watched in a long while,reality
literally the only thing that holds this movie back from being truly amazing is the fact that its got such a weak plot and script couple of rogues travel out into the middle of nowhere to the womans homeland then basically head back to where they started out from all the while being mercilessly harassed by the various hunting partiesclans or whatever you want to call them thats pretty much the long and short of it hardly any character development to go with it which just makes the plot even more redundant the two main actors hardy and theron are dreadful on screen no chemistry whatsoever between the two and apart from some occasional and weak dialogue the main interactions they tend to have with one another is either fighting or pointing guns in each others facesjames cameron said it himself when youre making a movie if you have a good enough story everything else will fall into place and youll have a great film and thats not just coming from any ordinary film maker thats coming from the guy who directed titanic george miller should definitely take notesobviously the one thing this movie will shine for is the visual effects and the action sequences i admit they are ridiculously well done and it is a very entertaining movie to watch if a bit of mindless fun is what youre after in terms of action fury road hardly lets up for a minute and is entertaining as hell from start to finish but falls short due to its dull plot and a complete disregard for character development fury road is very much one of those yin and yang situations youre either going to love it or hate it check it out anyway its definitely worth seeing at least once,reality
while i wasnt overwhelmed with this movie as a whole there is no denying that the action sequences were overthetop in the best way possible costuming and design was brilliant along with some outstanding stunts and effects i enjoyed the action and thought that tom hardy and charlize theron contributed all they could its an action movie and thats about iti guess i expected a little more substance being a fanboy of the prior films in fact i think thunderdome is still my favorite for the amount of humanism in it maybe thats the point i missed that people are pretty much gone humanity is a relic of the old world but its more than that it seems like this script is more what youd expect from hollywood  the villains dont get to be human anymore theyre too busy being archetypal bad guys only the heroes get the opportunity for redemption i dont like black and white characters and everyone felt pretty flatthe visions that had were just odd to me too they seemed way out of character for him i know hes a tortured soul but i felt like we were missing something hes always been the reluctant hero that ends up saving everyone but himself ive always hoped would maybe stumble across never never land one day and find a new way but this is just a reboot not a continuation too bad,reality
not exactly my cup of tea its fastpaced yes and charlize theron is pretty good tom hardy not so much but my real qualm with this movie has to do with cgii mean cgi can be great but its great when you dont even notice ithere its all over the place if watching a movie is about suspension of disbelief i cant suspend my disbelief when what i see is patently computergenerated,reality
fury road is loud obnoxious shallow and tedious i honestly cannot think of the last action film i saw that i found to be so boring and painful to watch jettisoning such superfluous elements like plot characterization pacing structure or purpose fury road is left as little more than a nonstop 2hour car chasetheres beauty in simplicity to be sure like duel or the road warrior for that matter but the action in this film lacks any sense of progression or pacing theres practically no meaningful transition between fullblown action and dreary overwrought dialogue  the film is either screeching up to 11 or not at all and while the stunts themselves are indeed impressive for their practical feats they soon get lost is the films incessant white noise  at the end i couldnt recall a single setpiece from fury road just the sensation of a pounding headachenot that the story parts are much better  despite having a strong pair of leads from hardy and theron the supporting cast ranges from passable to positively awful even said leads arent given much to work with aside from the occasional grunt or maybe even a strained attempt at actual drama but these ring hollow and feel unearned in the films mindless muddle there can be great power in a simple story but fury road feels less like a bigbudget bmovie than it does a standard hollywood story with all the nonexplosive beats cut out of it more so than usual i meanthe scenery is spectacular to be sure but its also drowned in overly saturated shades of orange during daytime and blue day for night that make the whole setting look strangely fake despite the emphasis on practical effects this isnt helped by the obnoxious editing which makes heavy use of spedup footage to pace the action scenes this technique really does baffle me  yes it was present in the originals but does this really justify using a crappy technique that makes such scenes feel artificial and irritating to watch just for the sake of homage or nostalgiai dont usually like using the phrase i dont understand how people can likedislike x since it just gives the impression that youve stopped trying to engage in any meaningful discourse or in trying to understand different perspectives however the acclaim behind fury road really baffles me  this film seems to execute the worst habits of modern hollywood blockbusters in the worst possible way and yet has received universal praise from almost every quarter i usually have a positive lean with movies including those often disliked by others such as prometheus or jurassic park 3 but theres practically nothing in fury road that resonated with me on any level unless you count the migraine i received once this furious journey finally spluttered to a haltso thats one star for the spectacular namibian scenery when you can see it and another for theron who really does deserve better material than this fury road seemed to satisfy the vast majority of audiences i just wish i could be among them,reality
2 the road warrior is one of my favorite films of all time and i was really looking forward to seeing fury road when i heard there was going to be a new film i was excited at the possibility of it being a great sequel considering how disappointing beyond thunderdome wasi was hoping for a sequel that would develop character furthermore whilst building on the world the previous movies set up considering the massive budget george miller was given i was hoping for an epic story with some depth considering how the postapocalyptic genre has evolved throughout the years through movies books video games and television fury road is a horribly paced and horribly acted disappointment of a film the action is extremely repetitive the score is obnoxious the editing is awful the story is painfully basic character development is almost nonexistent characters make decisions without logic or reason is pretty much a completely different character in the original films was portrayed as a believable human being whereas in this film he is portrayed as a crazy cartoon characterthe only good things about this film are its production design and use of practical effectsoverall the film is a massive disappointment,reality
it just goes to show you can fool all of the sheeple all of the time,reality
only watched it because i had to for a school assignment the movie does speak on relevant events happening now,reality
this movie had everything from war machines to rugged vehicles guns action packed sequences everything but and his madness this franchise were all about his at times uncomfortable demeanor kept us excited every minute mel gibson did a stellar job at this at which tom hardy fails he fails to deliver emotion or charisma of the character he fails to capture the bitter experiences of well flashes of some unrelated past events would not suffice the character itself is frail in this installment plays sidekick of curiosa for the good portion of the run time to be honest i wanted to see and his madness which this movie failed to deliveri would still recommend this only for its high quality and unique caliber of action,reality

its got action a fastpaced story strong female characters and just the right amount of crazy  exactly what a good action movie needs and no distracting love story it features different ethnicities characters with physical disabilities  its very diverse for an americanaustralian blockbuster people here arent pretty they are messed up they are ugly and not just the villainsthe only thing that bothered me a bit was the lack of exploration in the characters past  but that is without having seen prior movies of this franchise so they might give a little more insight the focus here is clearly on the chase on the fury road and its enough to keep you entertained for 2 hoursif you are in for the crazy the fury and the wild  this is the movie for you,reality
now i cant really claim to be much fan of the original movies with mel gibson so i didnt really have much of any expectations to this 2015 movie and i actually waited all the way until towards the end of 2016 before sitting down to watch itand now that i have seen it i must say that i am impressed this certainly was a visually impressive movie and there were a lot of really nice details to the costumes vehicles characters and settings and that really worked out well in favor of the moviehowever the storyline in fury road was flaccid and so simplistic that it was almost insulting the storyline here was almost nonexisting and it contributed nothing to the movie in any sense and it was in fact the more than impressive visual effects that salvaged the movie and made it enjoyablei am not much of a fan of tom hardy but this movie was actually was one of his better personally it was because he had very little dialogue in fury road and that worked very well with meas i mentioned above then there were a lot of details every where and even on the characters and here i must say that they created a lot of memorable and outstanding characters here characters which stand out and carry the movie quite a long wayfury road is the type of movie that you just simply disengage your brain then lean back way into the seat and just enjoy the thrill ride the movie challenges the audience in no way or manner as there are no surprises no plot twists no nothing it is essentially just one long extended car chase scene but hey it was entertaining enough for what it turned out to be and i will actually say that the effects and visuals were so amazing that they more than make the movie watchable more than just a single timei am rating this movie seven out of ten stars solely because of the visual effects i was more than blown away by what i witnessed on the screen and as such then the lack of a proper storyline faded to the background as you were carried away on a continuous assault of special effects,reality

terminator 2 the matrix as an action film this ranks along side iti see a lot of people moaning about this film unfortunately this film came out in this decade the decade where if anything is mainstream it becomes frowned upon because we have the internet to post our thoughts if this film came out in the late 80s early 90s it would go down as the greatest film but it came out in 2015 so nostalgia kicks in and everyone shouts old is best new is never best this is one of the best action films youll ever seeits very very clever for once the action comes first and the side stories conversations plots come in little bits at a time the first or even second time you see this film you will think wow this is an awesome action film that abandons mostof the cgi most films swim in these days which is true but watch it a few more times and you notice through narrativecomments that each character has a side story that leaves you to fill in the gaps in between what they sayits genius but at heart it is an action film that miller nails and for me ranks amongst t2  the matrix,reality
although i am not the target audience for this film i recently saw the chrome version in 2015 the movie was nominated for best picturedirector among other noms and since i missed it then i thought i would catch it now i agree with reviewer tannerbrown this is one hell of a ride and the action never stops its exhausting really i dont know how the director and actors managed to make it to the end whatever the story it doesnt matter trust me just have fun and enjoy the experience there doesnt seem to be a lot of cgi stuff and if there is its hard to tell in most movies cgi sticks out like a sore thumb not here glad i saw it,reality
the sequel to george millers trilogy is finally done the new film is here to prove that miller is still one of the best directors worldwide the plot is not something innovative or pioneering but the scenery is enough to impress even the most skeptical in a vast desert full of sand george miller sets his postapocalyptic scenery which is about a rebellion against a tyrant immortan joe actually miller set a motor orchestra a war of vehicles on the humongous desert each action scene is a work of masterpiece the details of direction are flawless giving the impression that weve never seen something similar maybe we are accustomed to special effects and blockbusters but here the level is definitely up the action is exponential in a point that miller should have given some actionbreaks to relieve the audience but this is the main characteristic of it doesnt let us take our eyes away not because well lose plots continuity because the action scenes are delightful i think george miller had conceived his film as an action monologue well in order to do this miller has sacrificed all his characters its a fact that he doesnt give a complete portrait of his characters only some specific elements for example we never learn who is tom hardy the complete story of furiosa charlize theron and many other clues such as how the world ended i think thats the one and only films drawback it would be much better if we knew more things about the characters s background there are also many other elements to bear that is magnificent as the six oscars winning the sound the makeup the costumes and generally the way the film is produced indicate the overall great work as for the interpretations we didnt expect less from tom hardy who is possibly the hottest name in hollywood at the moment and charlize theron proves one more time that she can play in such movies any given day fury road is extraordinary a few words need to describe this film if someone is looking for something deep and profound then this is not what heshe should see fury road is full of action from first to last and due to this is considered a great film,reality
fury road is furious entertainment at break neck speed from the very get go its action packed with stunning stunt sequences and jaw dropping visuals despite the speed of the action we uncover a solid story line at the pace of which the movie moves this gives the whole experience fantastic rhythm the acting is good particularly from charlize theron and nicholas hoult however its the direction special effects and stunts that really steal the show and make this one of the best action movies in 2015 this is a movie that you could watch over and over again and still find thrilling there didnt seem to be a wasted moment and the two hours flew by,reality
 fury road is not your typical action film after watching i can honestly say i havent seen anything like it the action is relentless and the effects are spectacularthe action nothing beats a giant war rig screaming across the wasteland being chased by a fleet of armor plated vehicles piloted by an assortment of strange characters the action scenes are intense and choreography in this film is top notch i was on the edge of my seat the entire timethe effects so often i go into an action movie these days and see a film riddled with cgi effects and honestly its getting a bit old is a blockbuster using practical effects and its glorious from the vehicles to the explosions to the weapons it brought me back to the days of terminator 2 the soundtrack a gigantic vehicle drum with a wall of amplifiers and a personal mini stage where a crazy looking person shreds a flame throwing electric guitar while dangling from bungees while hurling into the depths of an epic battle this movies soundtrack was genius because not only did it have a great score but this vehicle at times became the soundtrack heavy guitar riffs during intense action sequences with the shredding guitar man in the background added another dimension to the film also the score was unbelievable particularly in the ending scene absolutely epicoverall  this was one of the best action films i have ever seen and one of the best films i have seen as a die hard action fanatic this satisfied my craving for high octane destruction if you havent seen this movie yet what the hell are you waiting for,reality
fury road is the fourth installment in the postapocalyptic outback based series and the first to follow the new played by tom hardy this time is dragged along quite literally into a two hour car chase of a movie that all at once showcases some of the greatest action sequences put to film a celebration of practical effects and a story with characters who are several times more interesting and layered than what many expect from action flicks in the age of micheal bay and superheroes i cant recommend watching this enough and i cant recommend going into it blind more either,reality

fury road is the sort of fascinatingly original moviegoing experience that one almost never sees from an existing franchise and when it comes to part 4s in the history of all of cinema i cant think of one ive ever liked more george miller who directed the series other three entries is back to do the job again here almost 30 years after the last one and he proves to be cinematically as sharp as ever the fine accomplishments of actors and all the technical people notwithstanding this is a directors film more than anything with a sweeping vision of a postapocalyptic world that however crazy it gets sells itself all the way through you dont question what you seeyou feel you are thereit stars charlize theron as imperator furiosa and tom hardy as thats in order of importance is a good character the continued tortured soul trying survive and yet finding the humanity in himself but with all respect furiosa is the real soul of this movie the best performance id put it therons best character since her oscar winning turn in monster a woman strong cunning and skilled yet also at points vulnerable as she leads a troop of wives away from their powerful malicious husband who chases them basically from one end of the movie to the other gets caught up with them along the way in an interesting evolving relation towards furiosa and the wives these wives five of them dont get a lot of lines but the qualities they bring in something different from both and furiosa is important to the films success vital too are the host of villains who come in such variety of interesting dark flavors from the head evil master down the hierarchy of his lowerranked cohorts to the followers convinced of the glory of selfsacrifice for their leaderthis movie is marvelously thick with postapocalyptic atmosphere it is also thrilling and so varied with every action or chase sequence that rolls brilliantly off of the previous one there are moments of slowdown so to speak where there is verbal interaction more than a couple words at a time but as far as character building theres as much during the action as in the less hectic times this is a constantly surprising original film frequently exciting sometimes funny sometimes touching and absolutely never for any minute stretch uninteresting the technical expertise to create such wild highflying figuratively and literally things as are shown here is just mindboggling but creativity is where it really excels its one captivating experience not quite like anything else thats been made before it must be seen,reality
since very first minute up to very last minute it just keep going moving racing running and chasing actionchase scenes are gorgeous and created by real master of its occupations george miller after all these year when you think what is going to be next perfect and moving movie you would not expect action sciencefiction movie to deliver it from cinematography to every little detail all people that worked on movie thought about everything furiosa is such a strong character that fights and stands for something that its just beautiful to watch her in every scene played by hardy huh hardy proved to be one of best upcoming actors that can play anything just remember locke but at the same time no gibson and you wont be disappointed because hardy made even better job personal opinion i like action and scifi very much but when i look at i find it more powerful than any movie given 100 on metacritic or any movie given 93 92 and 90 on imdb 44,reality
i liked the first two es from the trilogy but this one blew my mind and will be a gold standard for action movies for a long time i was also glad that miller came out to do this and much practical effects were used and also found that screen is centered in action type of editing very nicelike i said in summary this is an nonstop rollercoaster of action from start to finisheveryone who loves postapocalyptic movies this is an must watch i also like how much they have dedicated to the lore costumes etcso if you like cars postapoc and action go watch this now ,reality
buckle up for this one this movie right from the getgo was a non stop actionpacked thrill ride and youll love ever moment of it watching it was like riding in the front seat of the worlds fastest roller coaster for two hours and i think thats exactly what the movie was aiming for it felt like we were right in the movie alongside the cars and trucks the movie gives you no breaks or pauses to check the time read a text or even eat your popcorn it is intense my hat goes off to the makers of this film beautiful directing filming scenery sound wow thank you thank you thank you for making a movie like this ok so there was minimal dialogue minimal character development and a lot of unanswered questions but it doesnt matter this movie breaks the typical movie format and they did a hell of a job doing their own format important note  this is not a movie to watch on your phone tablet or laptop you will be doing this movie a disservice please watch this movie the way it was meant to be watched on a big screen tv with highdef surround sound you will love it oh and if there was ever a movie to watch while trying to showoff your new tv or subwolfer its this one,reality
i say that because today i watched fury road and it was awesome honestly one of the best action films i have ever scene the music was bloody incredible the pacing was great and the visual effects was some of the best cggraphics to date my only real complaints i have are the followingtom hardy  people are praising him like he is a god and he barely did anything in general i think hes an ok actor his best performance of last year though def came from the revenant lack of story  i did come in expecting a story but was let down however this was a minor issue you dont watch fury road for a story you watch it because of the actionoverall great movie and i cannot wait to watch it again 810,reality
a review for fury road postapocalyptic wastelands entice the general population of human for the simple reason that those worlds are being more and more imaginable by the daycapitalizing on this macabre tendency of mankind australian film maker george miller in his movie fury road has shown a skeleton of a ruined civilization that is subsisting on scarce resources and brutal dictatorships under a flashy veneer of actionpacked scenes and special effects miller has touched upon environmental and social issues that plague our society at the present moment while the general premise of the movie is consistent with the previous movies in the franchisee the very fact that miller introduces strong female characters and fosters feminism is a welcome changethe story starts off with wandering around in a desert and who is finally captured to become a blood bad for a warrior called nux the villain has a stock of breeders who are supposed to be his wives and bear his children most of his children turn out deformed and thus he is always trying for more we awaits us is an show of patriarchal society suffering from a huge water crisessome pieces were missing in the jig saw of story line movie was mainly bases on action which is delivered at par with the expectationsin this bleak landscape comes inperator furiosa who helps the wives to escape and goes with them in search of the green place of many mothers gets caught up in the whirlwind and what ensues will make you think deeply about issues such as environmental crisis and feminism at one point in the movie we see one wife ensuring another by saying we are people not things we see nux the warboy crack under the expectations placed on him we see an entire population of human beings suffer because of the greed of a few people we also see a flaming guitar in an armythis is a brilliant movie in its layering and one can take a lot out of it if one thinks about it movie is a must watch for action lovers however expecting a lot sense out of the story would be an injustice dont let the flaming guitar distract you from the real issues of the film,reality
really great movie and such a nice break from the normal ordinary cookie cutter hollywood staples there was art action excitement and just a wild crazy ride all the way throughnot everything has to have some deeper meaning or enlightenment movies like this can inspire you to create in new ways through art direction and creatingif something in the movie does not make total sense that is ok just have fun with it and you will find it to be a visual journey that you will not forgetcan not wait for the sequel  just wish there was a toy line that went along with the movie  just imagine the possibilities,reality
few rare films are simply not interested in impressing everyone unanimously since they neither have any interesting storyline nor any intense show of loving relationship between its key characters these are the films specifically targeting the viewers who love watching high paced actions sequences coming one after another in an unstoppable mode making you feel the adrenaline rush providing many electrifying entertaining moments in those two hours and further can also be compared to an unbelievable roller coaster ride that refuses to stop once it starts pressing the accelerator with a promise to make you scream and yell like hellso if you are one amongst those who are eager enough to witness this astonishing show of exceptional or rather impossible kind of stunts extremely difficult yet superlative cinematography and breathtaking execution on screen by hundreds of performers together in the location of a hot desert then just buy a ticket and fasten your seatbelts to have one of the best actionoriented cinematic rides you might have enjoyed so farcoming after a few decades of its original trilogy this latest venture surpasses them all with many unreal firsts showcasing an incredible qualitychaos featuring brilliant performances superbly led by tom hardy  charlize theron long car chases amazing bikers giant trucks big explosions and jawdropping action that forcibly gives you the thought that how the hell they could do all this and then capture it on camera too so brilliantly made on an admittedly weak plot of a group of girls being rescued the film also focuses on the strong women power displayed by its female protagonist but what actually lifts the movie beautifully along with its action are its meaningful life teaching one liners included in its short but powerful dialogues for instance what are you doing praying to who anyone whos listening or you knowhope is a  mistake if you cannot fix whats broken you will go insanemoreover the skillfully composed background score successfully brings you on to the edge of your seats especially with the already famous rockstar on the truck playing his explosive guitar along with the people hitting the huge drums at the back plus this is one of those few movies that remain bright throughout due to the chosen locations and never becomes a pain watching in 3d due to its fascinating sequences both shot  performed extremely wellhaving said that fury road also might not be the film for the ones not much interested in such pulsating action or a loud brutal fight for survival shot unbelievably with its own limitations of concept and storyline but if you really wish to experience many highly charged thrilling moments in the theatre like never before then do opt for the film especially on the bigger screen to respect  honour the amazingly mindboggling achievement made by its entire teamin short it can also be referred as one of those remarkably conceived eyeopener films that actually make you realize the huge amount of backstage preparations hardwork time energy and resources required to shoot such a challenging film on location so do watch it at a must to take your own lessons of filmmaking from the masters on work both on and off the screen so majestically,reality
one of the best movies i have seen in all of 2015 sure some might say it was awful but i loved it loved it loved it it kept me wondering what was going to happen next i seen the older versions of which i enjoyed but this one took the cake it told a story with limited dialogue and nonstop action not many movies can do this nowadays and still keep you entertained there was so much going on that it felt like a thrill ride the scenes were put together so well that i felt like i was there there were also so many epic scenes that brought this together and the characters within the movie were astonishing it may not be for everyone but a metal head who loves action and seen this movie about 6 times now ranks it 1 for the entire year of 2015,reality
this movie is crazy absolutely insane the camera moves in fast motion sometimes and when it doesnt there is still so much going on that it can be hard to follow this movie hits the nail on the head in terms of aesthetic however it captures the single most important thing in any dystopia and that is a sense of unfamiliarity knowing not whats happening is really quite intriguingthe only negatives are that the bizarreness does get in the way of what we would see to be a good story and character development is rather minimal these minor infractions however dont stop fury road from being one heck of a fun ride,reality
all in all good movie tom hardy one of the lead casts just didnt feel like he was the war boy seemed to get more screen time tom was good in this movieloved the actionneeded little more tom hardy and little more action consider that for filming next three films tom hardy has sex appealbritish accent charming but warning eyes and can pull off a smile leaving you confused use his personality traits and acting skills to the mstheron was on point in this film but again she needs more action in her scenes also both have played some rear kicking roles drawn many once viewers in now longtime fans dont use their name for ticket salesuse their ability to play the roles they are givenjust step it up,reality
in my opinion this movie was awesome but it has his ups ans his downsups the music was just the best part of this movie the action that never stops and all the battles in the cars were so awesome and made with so imaginationdowns i didnt connect with any character at all the story was ok its just another action movie the movie didnt teach me anything new over all i really recommend the movie for the people that love action movies with no stopi hope that you like my review and if you have something to tell me to improve my reviews send me a email,reality
this movie has some nice and good looking effects and is all in all a beautiful movie however i think the plot is kind of lame i missed an explanation of what would happen next so at the end i was like was that it whats going to happen now there is a lot of driving in this movie which got less and less interesting all in all the movie was okay and the acting was also good except for the disappointing ending the story was good i like how a lot of the effects were costumes and only a few things her hand for instance were special effects furthermore the editing of background and surroundings was very good,reality
it was with some trepidation that i watched this film too many times i have watched films that claim to be reboots but are poorly conceived imagined or simply bear more than a striking resemblance to the originalsin my opinion this isnt one of them the most notable cast are theron and hardy and they are both excellent there are nods to past but the film is also well filmed and finished product could easily have been the third part of the trilogy i wished wed had instead of thunderdomethe film is bleak as youd expect but some of the slightly sped up scenes such as trying to remove his mask all took me back to the earlier two films there is humour here as well and that is always welcome in a film with a lot of violence that they have chosen to use sparse special effects and rely and reallife action is a credit to the production the fx here are used to enhance small aspects of the film but in no way dominate iti liked the first two films a lot almost because it didnt look slick and filmed to death i liked this one as well so maybe there is hope for reboots,reality

australian writerdirector george miller who gave us a trilogy of dystopian thrillers from 1979 through 1985 is back with his new incarnation fury road for those who love scifi and action blended together should be your thing millers postapocalyptic world takes place out in the desert where a group of mutants are lorded over by one immortan joe a king worshiped as a god by his subjects who sports a mask that resembles a human skull his warriors look like modernday skinheads and theres also a grand coterie of joes subjects akin to medieval peasants joe controls the water supply at his fortress called the citadel and also owns a small harem of sexslaves he maintains for breeding purposes these women appear to be the only healthy ones in the realmthe protagonist is rockatansky now played by tom hardy of inception fame rocktansky is captured by the skinheads and makes a futile attempt to escape from the citadel early on the character with the bigger part for a while is imperator furiosa played by an enervated charlize theron furiosa moves things into act 2 when she kidnaps joes concubines and drives in a souped up tanker truck headed for the mythic green place which supposedly is some kind of aquainfused paradise joes minions give chase in a crazy assortment of different vehicles all patched up from parts remaining after the apocalypsewe dont hear much from since his face is hidden by a steel mask and hes strapped to one of those weird vehicles which is chasing furiosa after a series of spectacular chases and crashes finally gets free of his captors but still must have furiosa assist him in cutting a chain that binds him to one of the skinheads nux who ironically joins furiosa and her group after deciding theres great glory working for the rebels than bad guy joe the long continuous chase to capture furiosa temporarily slows down when the good guys must navigate their way through a canyon controlled by hostile forces after successfully breaking through the canyon blockade furiosa finds an old woman who belongs to the vuvalini the clan which furiosa was kidnapped from as a child wouldnt you know it but the old woman makes it clear that the green place is indeed a myth so what are the good guys to dothe plan is to finish off joes forces on the way back to the citadel which they successfully accomplish and then kill the king and gain control of the water supply much to the peasantrys delight this of course allows mr miller to stage another big chase scene just as spectacular as the one in the first halfthats basically it fury road is nothing more than one big chase scene after another after a while the whole thing just gets a little tiresome one can admire the production design and how the chase scenes are choreographedbut the script is so paper thin that the best rating i can muster here is 5 out of 10 sorry,reality
as for action this ones packed and loaded like a machinegun from hell no need to think too much now and why should you keep driving puny instants of dramatic respite but our dusty fumed sight may just be playing tricks on us so much sand in my eyes a redemptive fatamorgana multiplied into beautiful sun goddesses of ruby wheat and mahogany who shine in creamy eeriness and make peace appear less futile a fury road full of mutilated kamikaze war pups ready to heroically enter the gates of valhalla and two es  the fool and the imperator furiosa  forever fighting to repress the guilt of past lives,reality
every day is a fight to survive in a harsh and unforgiving postapocalyptic landscape in citadel one of the few cities still standing a ruthless overlord maintains an iron grip over every resource and human being when furiosa charlize theron one of his top soldiers steals his wives and flees all hell breaks loose she crosses paths with tom hardy a man haunted by past failures whos reduced to a single instinct survival together they just might be able to restore order to the world fury road is a reboot of the franchise from the late 70searly 80s but knowledge of the original films isnt necessary the best way to describe the world of to the uninitiated is as follows engines roaring guns blazing people jumping from vehicletovehicle sandstorms in short complete insanityfrom citadel to the desert to the action sequences everything about fury road is massive and wellcrafted most modern directors choose to make huge action films like this with copious amounts of cgi for the sake of ease george miller director of the original trilogy went to painstaking lengths to ensure the films authenticity and it makes a world of difference the stunts were real theres very little cgi and the props were fully functional even a flame throwing guitar hooked up to a truck full of amps a type of postapocalyptic war trumpet if you will the highoctane action sequences which take up a large portion of the film are aweinspiring gritty and imaginative however they are precise enough where they never feel like they are too overthetop or overstay their welcomebecause the focus of the film is on the action there isnt as much room for story or character development and furiosas pasts and motivations are compelling but most of their time is spent kicking ass not necessarily a bad thing the world that fury road is set in is full of fascinating details concerning how humanity continues to survive in such a harsh and unforgiving world which makes up for the fact that the plot isnt as unique as it could bebottom line fury road is one of the best action movies in recent memory 810,reality
you will not believe the action that is happening before your eyes such a well written and scripted entertaining movie its fun its enjoyable and its much more than watchable tom hardy seems to fit the role of like no one ever has down to his tone to his hair the role really seemed to fit him the most amazing car chase you will ever see furiosas character wasnt so bad either wasnt fond of rosie huntington whitley nor zoe kravits role but hey it wasnt so bad but just maybe if they found people who were not so known of already to play the role we could have seen some fresh new raw talent no complaints here,reality
action in movies is not what i look for most of the timethis is an action movie for filmmakers only filmmakers and film enthusiasts will understand the balls it took to make this movie to a regular movie goer it will look like just another action film a pretty weird one at that to action movie enthusiasts it will look like a good action movie to filmmakers its brilliant it goes against so many of the clichs that have been plaguing the genre in recent times while embracing the clichs that made action movies great in the eighties and early nineties all that plus godlike cinematography also this is one of those movies you have to watch at the cinema and not at home with netflix and things like that the only flaws in this almost masterpiece are the absence of character development and a very normal and clichd plot which didnt really bother me in terms of entertainment but it could have been better 810 in my top 5 of best action movies of all time,reality
saw fury road as soon as it hit theaters in my country being quite honest i had not seen any of the previous movies so i was totally out of context that being said i entered the theater with very specific expectations or should i say with a standard movie in mind  dialogue characters to root for back story instead i witnessed a bunch of explosions and pretty much what seemed to be a video game mission go to to point a to point b then head back to the starting point as a matter of fact even some of my friends left the movie when it was approaching its middle  i suppose they also had something way different in mind the lack of straight exposition and fluid dialogue might have discouraged them cant really blame them most likely they were truly expecting your typical action movie with one liners clichs and predictable plot points not even the stunts kept them interested now that was the first time i did notice that the movie kept getting quite positive reviews so i took my time to watch it alone in bluray in my living room and boy did i have a blast as i watched the scenes each line of dialogue seems right short but effective the images were eloquent the events taking place were always building up to the plot that however simple offers an original story even the very start of the movie tells you a little bit of background he used to be a cop and the subtle but constant flashbacks they hit you and him in the right moment as part of his motivation help the viewer fill the blanks and construct the world this adventure takes place in furiosas another remarkable addition shes so determined we can understand the motivation through her actions and that is amazing storytelling in my opinion i did find a lot of feminist messages and concepts disguised or intentionally delivered in several scenes through different objects lines of dialogue and actions it blew my mind not to mention the jawdropping real stunts and the fact that little cgi was used in this movie it heavily relies on millers fantastic ability to show explosions and cool cars and vehicles that yeah as many other have pointed out remind me of twisted metal  in fact thisll probably be the closest thing ill ever see in a movie that truly resembles such bad ass gamerolling around and the more you look at them the more you realize just how much effort was put into bringing them to life the guy with the flamethrowing guitar the war boys the post apocalyptic hints of what mightve happened again i did not see the previous movies but this one clearly gives information if ones to pay attention to details id only say that just because i happen to be a huge fan of characterdriven stories i wouldve loved just a bit more of fleshing out scenes however i do love those scenes at night and the dialogue between furiosa and once again we see how effective and carefully chosen each word is totally recommend this movie and cant wait for whats to come,reality
is really a movie from start things happen that you dont really understand but fortunately as the movie proceeds things get clearer and clearer i wish i have watched it in 3d rather than the dvd version as the best part of the movie was the action scenes and the huge cars racing the desert but the story is good too noted i havent seen the original movie so im not sure if the story is the same and thus i cant make comparisons but for what i have seen the movie is rich with action and it will keep you interested throughout its length sure the performances arent award winning and the emotion never reaches a high point and so if you dont like action movies and prefer dramas my suggestion is not to watch but if you want to have fun watching an adventurebattlinghigh speed movie this film wont disappoint you,reality
to let you know i had not watched the original movies when i had watched this film so my judgment comes from the film on its own basis and using that fact i must saw that george miller does a good job as far as the cinematography of it john seale the cinematographer does a exceptional job here there are many shots of the film that feel like the belong here john seale also did some of the harry potter movies were he also did a great job in the action is directed to perfection and left me in awe struck at the amount of time and special effects put into this film with no cgi being added to boggle it down as for characters tom hardy is good as he hardly says a word and i really love that when watching the film i loved that he was all about action and doing stuff and not so much about talking because a lot of times in the movies just your facial expressions can say so much about a scene and tom hardy was no exception the fact of the matter is that he was undoubtedly now charlize theron i adored as furiosa she was what won the movie for me and made it awesome i still remember after seeing this film the first thing i thought was dam she could be a great wonder woman i mean seriously forget gal godat and get charlize to play diana and bet i would love it along with everyone else i mean the woman really does lead these women from the terrible and crooked husband nicholas hoult and hugh keaysbyrne sadly were not as good or interesting i mean they were just raging fits of anger they didnt think and they had no brain i mean really they were not compelling villains at all in fact i found myself quite bored with them to the point were it didnt make any sense now with that being said i am going into all the problems with this film the lack of story while there were interesting characters it lacked any type of good characters which hinders the film quite a bit for me cause i do like a good story that being said there is some story here unlike what people are saying it just takes some time to get to itthe entire first 20 mins were boring i mean at first i was into it but it felt like the action sequence would just keep going and going and honestly if it wasnt for my desire to finish my food i probably would have gone to sleep not good movie not good at all the villains suck no really they do there bad and awful villains to the point were i wanted them all dead  ok now that the issues are out the way the film is still decent enough i wont be recommending it to anyone probably unless there just really into action films tho still tho there is a lot that we can still love with fury road which is why i am still giving it a 710,reality
i have somewhat mixed feelings about this one on the surface level this film is quite dull one car chase to a promised haven which has ceased to exist second chase back and thats it the promise of the green place stimulates imagination so it is a big disappointment as actually no mythical green land is found the terrain is also very monotonic the battles are too long dull and repetitive very much attention is paid to detail of the objects though technically the film is splendid rated on this level i would give it a 5 out of 10however the film also spoke to me on a deeper level the postapocalyptic scenario is used to create a world in which people are exploited like livestock and the whole culture has has decayed to accommodate this abuse in the beginning of the film nux is just one warboy he follows blindly the dictates of his leader sugarcoated by promises of glory for those who die valiantly in battle that have allusions to the pagan norse religion in the course of the film nux is forced to make personal choices to choose who he is and wishes to be so that his life gains independent valuethe same topic is also explored through the five wives of the gang leader immortan joe who in the course of their escape are transmorphed from objects to subjects their original childishgirlish irresponsible and spoiled behavior contains in my opinion heavy critique towards modern womens culture one does not need to be a feminist to see this side of the story  rather the film shows that the golden cage is not built just by men of power but requires from women a decision to pursue the path of a trophy object the wives are granted a personal liberty but use it to make different decisions some wishing to flee the rough real world back to their captors also for imperator furiosa the fury road is a road to personal liberty though she takes more an active roleon this level therefore the film can be considered an existential movie which explores the relationship between personal choices and cultural pressure a story of the birth of an individual personality when one is liberated from the pressure created by oppressive cultural forces the journey of the film can therefore be seen as a kind of allegory in which fleeing to the emptiness of the desert represents the flight from those cultural forces it even carries a hint of a religious journey towards a promised land though in the bleak atheist existential view of the film the promised land no longer exits so that each person is given the task to forge his or her own destiny on this existential and allegorical level i am willing to give the film an 8 out of 10 when i consider the both scales together emphasizing the existential merits the film does in my opinion deserve a total 7 out of 10,reality
the saga began in the late seventies with polarizing reception the desolate wasteland of beyond thunderdome was criticized for its clash with the overly stylized life of its ruthless inhabitants the latest chapter fury road marries these two elements with a skill that is rarely successful director george miller takes the blinding colors and overt violence that has become a cheap thrill in many films and put them to use to their greatest potential what separates this film from say a transformers extravaganza we care if there is nothing else beautiful in a wasteland the violence can be gorgeous it could be argued that the characters in this film are in a desperate search for their own respective glimpse of beautythe story picks up roughly where the series ended in thunderdome tom hardys is still a survivor of the impossible elements and is taken by the war boys who sell him to the half dead blood breeders from its first frame this film is a desperate fight struggles through the bowels of a labyrinthine citadel ruled by the imposing immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne every villainous character in the film is eyecatchingly attractive yet hideous regardless of the importance of these characters they are fabulously memorable it is a great feat indeed that the character of immortan joe still maintains his position as immortally memorable with a monstrous voice and boned steampunk breathing apparatus he resembles a mix between tom hardys bane and a gollum created by the misfits joe controls the most important currency in the world water he doles it out in controlled doses like a methadone clinic to the desperate populous joes second in command is the beautifully rugged furiosa charlize theron we meet her in the middle of defying joe in a rescue operation attempting to smuggle his gorgeous breeding woman to a safe haven meanwhile has become the property of a war boy nux nicholas hoult who uses blood intravenously to support his own half life while taking to the fury road to intercept joes beauties with the whole of joes army the entirety of the film takes place in the whiteknuckle chases on fury road the situations and characters are so well established that the nonstop action functions as it should monumentally engaging of course finds himself with furiosa aiding in her scheme to steal joes angelic women to her former home and last known land of sanctuary hardy plays in such a low key that he sticks out in contrast to the vibrant and restless surroundings due to almost nonexistent dialogue the character of furiosa does occasionally upstage the dynamic but it does nothing to hurt the story i will not spoil the visual crescendos that make this film unstoppably watchable i will simply say that refraining from using the restroom midfilm is possibly worth the uti there is nothing profound about the plot standard and linear the profundity can be seen in the characters adaptation to their hostile environment some find their personal beauty in the mania of battle others like joe prefer the more traditional form that he finds in his slave women as for this world holds nothing for him he exists because his greatest talent is his curse survival in any other environment his past would be an unbearably tragic tale that would isolate him his isolation here has nothing to do with his past its doubtful his is better or worse than anyone else that he is so damn good at living makes him tragic,reality
i would say that this movie is pretty much the kind of movie that i expected it to be that being said i think it was a bit softer than i hoped it to be i think that again the hollywood plonkers have opted to make a movie that got a more palate rating to them and their cash registers than what it should have been it is not as obvious as with robocop and a few other movies but the feeling is thereit is still a fairly entertaining movie it is of course yet another special effects movie and as such it does not disappoint it differs from a lot of the usual special effects movies in that the effects are pretty down to earth in a bizarre way we are not talking about superheroes or near magical technologies here but instead we have a devastated landscape scrounged together equipment and a totally ludicrous desire to blow up the last remains of human civilisation the bizarre vehicle designs and the totally ridicules behaviour of a lot of people in this movie is alone worth watching it to be honestas with the previous movies this one stretches the bounds of reality i hope when it comes to human behaviour and how they waste the few precious resources specifically gasoline and bullets that remains after the apocalypse it provides some spectacular scenery but it also puts a bit of what the f feeling to it all not that this part is not expected from a movie thoughwhat i think was my latest letdown in the movie was the character itself to me he is supposed to be a real badass in this movie he was not really that impressive he certainly was far from the original character in my opinion and was really overshadowed by the furiosa character i could have lived with that if this character would have been really impressive but she was not she was cool but she was still underwhelming when comparing to anything in the original badass universe i would say that tina turner and mel gibson still rules still it is a decent futuristic apocalyptic action movie maybe not living up to this old movie geeks expectations but not at all a wasted movie evening the sound track of the bluray certainly gave my subwoofer an exercise as well,reality
is not so much a character as a figure a myth kinda like james bond only with more inuniverse justification if batman was a moviegoer he would likely sing this movies praises as if it were an angel that brought his parents back it is thus not an issue that mel gibson is replaced by tom hardy they are simply two faces to the myth of the desert known as hardy delivers an admirable performance though he is not the main character his starting monologue sets the tone for the film and his grunts and groans and occasional line propel it onwards through the adrenalinesoaked landscapeand what a stunning landscape it is millers filters make the desert a bright orange and the sky a deep sapphire blue at night everything is covered by a thick deepseablue fog that perfectly fits with the barrenness of the desert oh what a film what a lovely film it is indeed it is a piece of poetry in fire and blood and dirt and cars and dystopian and hope and redemption there is a scene in the first third of the movie in which they go into a dust storm as imperator furiosa the true main character and the showstealer from all accounts that seek to be considered reasonable drives towards it you are awestruck not as an exaggeration or a figure of speech you are literally struck with awe it ripples through your veins and sends your heart beating out of your chest and into the air of the theatre or living room in which you watch it you are certain that this cant be topped that they cant show you anything better than thisyou are wrong as they enter the dustcloud you can see that this is not any kind of normal storm there is lightning and tornadoes you look into the pure heart of chaos and see that it is one of the most beautiful most deadly most arcane most fantastic things you have ever seen in film or otherwise and that is only the setting the action here in no terms the ultimate highlight of all the action that takes place throughout the movie involves cars burning up and getting thrown into the winds it involves chases that would make even a typicallyaccomplished action filmmaker hold their breath and then the dust blows over and the main characters emerge alive but covered in sand perhaps for the first time they know what theyre in for and so do youthis is one of the most beloved movies in the country as i write this as well it should be everyone has that one moment when they knew that this wasnt just going to be another action movie that it wasnt even just going to be another movie this was going to be something grand something monumental something that would be studied and respected and learned from for decadesmiller himself has been at it for decades i have been born and raised in the lull between the last movie and this one but if this is what twentyfive years of waiting and learning and making happy feet two gets you then i would recommend it to anyone this isnt just a mindblowing film if you come into it not knowing what to expect it is inherently a mindblowing film it carries such through its very essence but it is even more than that perhaps far morethis is the movie that miller always wanted to make when he made those other movies as fantastic and thrilling and immersive as they were he was always thinking of this this is the magnum opus of one of the greatest action filmmakers in history if i went to an alien civilization and was asked to show them a movie this is the one i would show if they asked for an action movie this is the one i would showthe cinematography stuns you feel as spent as the characters when the film finishes the soundtrack fits so well that i can hardly dare to call it a soundtrack soundtracks play repeatedly on video game levels when you are taking a break to drink a soda this music is the natural essence of the film played out to a sonar format as a whole the film is what id call a symphony if it was more perfect and restrained and classical as it is its more like one glorious rock opera played out to the arms of the massesthat is not even to mention the angles and shots they conjure up there are many thoughts that lay dormant in my mind of what a movie could do but hasnt yet this twohour chasefest filled perhaps more of them than any other film it accomplishes what could only be before thought of in the realm of imagination from subtle touches to entire action sequences miller is a virtuosoi have compared these films to miyazakis works if so then this film is mononoke or spirited away a defining work that leaves all others in the sand it races ahead day and night through the desert sometimes looking for a purpose sometimes looking for redemption sometimes just lookingis it the best film ever maybe not but it is the most adrenalinefueled a unique decision that is handled well and makes the pauses mean only the more it is one of the greatest films of the decade and its characters and ideas thunderpoon anyone will live for eternity action can be understood by all great action speaks to all superb action puts all on a high from which you will not permanently egresssee you in valhalla,reality

 spoilers  the movie has proved again that it is not only for entertainment but also shows how a human is capable of without resources the movie talks about the world after it collapses and the madness that goes in it it also talks about how dictators who are supposed to be leaders can be abusers the movie takes a place in a desert where water is almost nonexistent to the people in addition the colonel joe moore the lord of citadel controls the distribution of the water to the people in the movie water is more needed than oil and no one is able to get enough of it or get it at all also in a later storyline the movie talks about a lady warrior imperator furiosa who was supposed to transport the 5 wives of immortal joe those wives are called the perfect humans due to their lack of any radiation the nondefect humans imperator furiosa then decides to escape the wives to a safer place then she gets help from a loner and former captive rockatansky the ending was assumed because of the nature of the movie the movie finished of course with a happy satisfying ending george miller has done a great job in directing this magnificent movie i believe this movie has a hidden message on how human beings can behave based on the environment they are surrounded by in my opinion the hidden message in the movie is about the evil that can be found within us humans the movie describes humans who were effected with radiations as savages and monsters in reality and as proved a human has the capability to be a monster and aggressive if needed we all see it on the news everyday the movie had some minor glitches and errors such as using the same vehicles that were used in the previous movie in addition there were some actors who did not fit the characters or couldnt do well acting the violence was beyond thoughts and too graphic but we were warned before watching it some of the scenes were not even close to reality but it is a movie imagination had to be used other than that the movie was enjoyable to watch and to learn from the affects and graphics were reasonably good most of the actors performed very well and in an engaging way the plot was well written and interesting in my opinion the movie was very excellent and engaging one thing i would rather change in the plot is the reason why humans are savages is because of radiations and there are perfect or imperfect humans i would suggest that the reason for humans being monsters is war hunger and chaos moreover instead of the idea is being perfect or imperfect human it would be more reasonable and easier to adopt if it was healthy or ill human in my opinion the change would make that particular point more interesting and logical overall was good if the viewers were into those kinds of movies it would be a great choice to watch it the plot was very interesting and the acting was too the directing and camera shooting were marvelous if you find yourself tolerable to too much blood then it would be a good choice to watch fury road,reality
i never watched any of the other films so i wasnt too sure what this movie would entail and this movie left me in awestruck in this thrilling ride through the fury road rockatansky played by tom hardy takes us on a journey of survival through a postapocalyptic world this movie franchise created and directed by george miller is based on a time in the world has ended several years ago ruled by corrupt warlords only a few sanctuaries still exist in this desert of a wasteland citadel being one of them is a desert fortress populated by apocalyptic survivors these survivors rely on a limited water supply controlled by their warlord leader immortan joe is a character of few words but his actions are unrelentless at the beginning of the movie is running from a group of warlords and eventually is captured we dont know much of this character at first but experiences concurrent glimpses of a little girl shouting out for help this gives us a little bit of background of past although it has not been confirmed in the movie we believe that he had a daughter whom he failed to save and is now being haunted by his guilty conscience the stolen warrior imperator furiosa played by charlize theron along with the warlord leaders five wives attempt to escape the shackles of immortan joe and furiosa join alliances during this high speed chase as they run through the desert wasteland in a war rig away from immortan joe and his army of halflife warlords in this high speed adrenaline rushing and action packed film we get to see the dynamics of each character as they embark in their own journey filled with sacrifice romance resentment betrayal and the last hope of humanity george miller takes us on a science fiction fantasy that will have you at the edge of your seat from the beginning of the movie all the way to the end credits if you are not familiar with the movies franchise you will be left puzzled with the first few scenes but fear not you will get the gist of it all a phenomenal job well done to the cinematography of fury road that captures the massive destructions and explosions that will leave you wanting more if you werent an adrenaline junky already this movie will have you convinced otherwise i only wish that the movie explained more about the wives stories and how they became immortan joes property the movie ends with immortan joe dead and furiosa taking back citadel humbly disappears in the crowd and sense of a new beginning and new kind of hope is left to interpretation i highly recommend this movie to those who are looking for a rock n road thrill ride tom hardy and charlize therons dynamic is unquestionably profound they embody two leading characters and furiosa as troubled souls on a quest to search for the diminutive hope at worlds end what a phenomenal movie,reality
spoiler contained the movie furry road is set in a postapocalyptic world in this wasteland violence rushes throughout all cities and resources are diminishing there are two main characters in the movie that attempt to restore order history includes losing his wife and his son during the war and violence that came about furosia is a strong leader who wants to work towards progress in the world she initially is under orders from immortal joe but she has her own plans and escapes with 5 women who were going to be bred by him is held hostage by immortal joe who uses his blood to supply a wounded solider named nux furiosa and find themselves working together after escaping from immortal joe who is the main enemy of the film he possesses a lot of power and has a lot of soldiers on his side one of them includes a character by the name of the farmer immortal joes army name is war boys tribe furiosa and have an intense standoff against immortal joe and have a lot of struggles throughout the movie upon their escape in a dessert furosia and flee towards a city called citadel in the journey nux ends up dying as he was found to be in the truck with and furosia on the way furiosa is also heavily injured during the battle that occurs nearby the city saves her life by supplying his blood to her in order to sustain her life joe ends up dying during the battle at citadel and furiosa are greeted with respect and full of joy at the site of joes death i have been a fan of these action and related genres for over 10 years although there were some sections of the movie that could be improved the story didnt matter as much as it was full of action and battles the plot line could have been more refined to include more character development and twists the overall film production was adequate and the characters roles were fairly good the characters roles did seem to twist a bit but they stayed true to their roles for the most part the main conflict which involved immortal joe and and furosia ended with joes death the movie was different from anything i have seen in a while which is why it was enjoying to watch the main setting includes wastelands and worn down structures the wardrobes were a also very different as they attempted to match the state of the world they were very minimal clothing on some characters but they wore mostly open costumes  the background was a backed by very good production that helped to increase the quality of the film the director could have had more variations in setting for a bit of change the angles during the movie did seem a bit all over the place there is a lot of battle scenes which do require angles switches but it seems to be overused throughout the entire movie another factor that was a bit lacking was the sound from the vehicles to weapons the audio seemed a bit harsh it wasnt that large of an issue and didnt interfere with the story plot of the film the music was prominent in the action and suspense scenes and was a bit over powering,reality
wow 1274 reviews for this film and counting and an average rating of 83 that should tell you a great deal about this revampi saw the amazing trailer but somehow sadly missed it at the cinema damn especially as i had read nothing but positive reviews about itso caught up with it on bluray but it couldnt be that good could ittheres not much in way of storyline but youve probably figured that out already by the subtitle fury road yup its a chase movie and quiet possibly the greatest chase movie evergeorge miller the director returns to film the 4th movie a series of movies ive enjoyed since why back when i was but a teen back in the 1980s mr miller takes what clearly was the best of those road warrior and pumps it up to the sorry with steroidsthis is a wonderfully directed and simply gorgeous looking film which i knew id like within the first few minutesactionactionand more actioni simply dont know how they managed it all the choreography and planning involved in filming most of these sequences in the film are just breathtaking all involved with this film should be very proud of themselves in what theyve accomplishednow a few and i do think only a few might be a little disappointed in that its not simply all about tom hardy makes a good job of taking over from the iconic mel gibson who was always a normal average type of guy trying to survive what had become a post apocalyptic type world at first he just wants to be left alone but the caring we know and love is still in there somewhere and it eventually finds its way to the surface in order to help out the quiet incredible furiosa the magnificent charlize theronid be disappointed if there were not 2 sequels to this film one for hardys and another possibly for furiosa but how do they top thisim currently rating it a high for me 85  10i will need to see it again possibly to readjust this scorea terrific allaction film that will be loved by most,reality
boy what a ride crazy action and visuals but the movie is far from perfectthe first hour of the movie was simply amazing the movie dives straight into the world of i didnt question anything i just enjoyed the view and for the first hour of its runtime the movie more than deliveredit was in the second half where i encountered some problems the movie is essentially a 2 hour long car chase the action doesnt revolve around the plot the little plot this movie has revolves around the action this was fine and i didnt even care about the lack of story until the action stopped due to the lack of the story i was incredibly bored when there was no action and im not even an action junkie there simply were no substance apart from the actionit would seem that charlize therons character furiosa would be the most interesting character since she is the one who had perhaps the biggest story arc out of all the characters but having the biggest story arc in this movie is not a whole lot i actually found the title character by tom hardy the most interesting his actions and his rough exterior fits him right into the movies brutal worldwas a lot better character than furiosa her character was trying to have some emotional depth but ultimately it fell short in my eyes probably due to the lack of story in the movie was just a real fighter and a survivor and the filmmakers didnt even try to make the character anything more i really liked that despite what their characters were in the movie both charlize theron and tom hardy gave good performances tom hardy sure knows how to grunteven though the action was amazing i became a bit numb to it towards the end of the movie the clididnt have the same paralyzing effect to me anymore like the first half of the movie didoverall it was an enjoyable movie but i cant even think how awful it would have been if the action wasnt as good as it was,reality
its nearly impossible for me to take seriously any of the 1star reviews that i see below either these people profoundly missed the point or they have an agenda fury road will stand the test of time as one of the greatest action movies ever made maybe the greatest but that isnt to say its a piece of mindless entertainment far from it sure the dialogue is sparse but there is quite a lot of story to be gleaned from contextual visual clues if youre the type to reflexively cringe at millers punkish postapocalyptic stylizing youll miss out on the careful and plentiful worldbuilding that went into this movie and while the slambang action rarely relents over the playing time there is nevertheless rewarding character development and rich thematic content despite claims to the contrary this is one of a handful of movies that i know i will watch many more times before i die,reality
they are on their way to valhalla witness this is a reimagining of the original movies with mel gibson there is no direct link other than on these boards i asked what is the basic story a couple of interesting replies are  in the new world order there is a family faction in monopoly of each of the resources one has the water another the oil production and another the gun production furiosa escapes the clutches of the water baron taking his captive breeding women he pursues her with the help of the other monopoly members she realizes her dream homeland is gone so she returns to the water barons place killing him en route and taking over his fiefdom along the way furiosa encounters who decides to help her  leader of bad guys has 5 models who are his brides who have his children for breeding the pale white guys girls run away bad guy chases them across the dessert helps the girls and battles the bad guy wins by ripping off the bad guys face end of story boooooring as hell but pretty to look at scenery and oh so cool chase scenes so whether one considers this boring or exciting depends on ones frame of mind in the chases across the namibian desert it is almost nonstop action chases shooting flamethrowing guitar playing cars and motorcycles crashing explosions i have to give credit to the filmmakers and the sound track has much deep bass to emphasize all the action you need a home theater with a good subwoofer to really appreciate all of it i watched it at home on dvdi enjoyed all the main actors tom hardy is and charlize theron is the crazy lady furiosa who takes the truck and the women to set out to find the green place of her childhood memories,reality
my rating is comprised of the followingspecial effects 10 cinematography 9 costumes  make up  props 9 writing 5 character development 5 story line 4i grew up on the road warrior and thunderdome knowing these movies filled in some of the left open questions  ambiguities in this supposed sequel to thunderdome according to miller that is where he places this installment sometime after thunderdomeat the same time the original series and fury road dont necessarily intertwine completely expect deviations from the original story linefury road can be watched stand alone but i would recommend watching the original first two at least before watching this onethe special effects are pretty stunning if not a bit overwhelming at times 80 of this movie is comprised of action and visually stunning cinematographythe acting was fine i thought the lead character furiosa played by theron did a suburb jobon the down side the plot is weak and not much time was invested for decent character development there isnt really much in terms of writing  dialogue it lacks substance and is quite far removed from reality in every aspect its best to not try and make sense  use logic while watching this if anybody is concerned about the feminism hype this production garnered dont be this is a guy flick if there ever was one every last inch of it is dripping masculinitythe lead female could pass as a guy and the rest of the young women look like theyve just come from a model photo shootenjoy ,reality
the real pleasure of the film lies in its maniacal action its impossible stunts and the sort of images that tend to stay embedded in your memory theres utter chaos in the attack scenes which defy both logic and gravity and yet seem to make perfect sense in the world miller has set up its truly a roller coaster ride of a film and im happy to report that the 3d never feels intrusive shot against mostly bright saturated landscapes the film has a very different visual palette from the first movie sure its a slim plot and theres very little dialogue but the writers do a good job constructing a surprisingly feminist tale,reality
there were more injuries  real death in the making of ben hur but looking at the intense action scenes in  fury road it is hard to believe that no one was hurt or severely injured it made me want to see the movie in 3d tom hardy has some big shoes to fill  does a great job but i have to admit he is upstaged in almost every scene by his costar charlize theron she plays imperator furiosa  she is the star of the movie poor is just along for the ride there was a strong female actor in the last movie  namely tina turner nicholas hoult is also a stand out the photography  music are excellent many of the scenes were filmed in the african country of namibia,reality
years after the end of civilization the authoritarian immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne enslaves survivors inside a dessert stronghold known as the citadel once a fierce warrior called imperator furiosa charlize theron makes an escape taking joes five wives she aligns herself with a wanderer and a former captive named rockatansky tom hardy protected by their massive armored truck they must try to outrun immortan joe and his henchman as well as other foes in a dangerous highspeed chase through the wastelandive read everywhere that this is the greatest film ever or just the best film of the year i personally wouldnt go that far with my praise its a good film but not a great one maybe because when i saw it the first time i saw the film ex machina afterwards and i couldnt help but to compare them to each other it probably isnt fair but thats just human nature i also never saw it in 3d either time and i have never seen any other film before i have been saying this a lot in all of my reviews but this has to be the best looking film ive seen this year from the cinematography to the color palettes yes i know most of the film takes place in the desert and the contrast between each really makes things pop on screen so those kept my attention throughout i will admit to being a little confused about the story as i wasnt sure what was going on until around halfway through the film despite not having ever seen a film i should be able to figure out what is going on pretty quickly i also found the story a little repetitive since most of it takes place in a truck running through the desert with a few occasional car battles to liven things up i got bored when there was no action taking place if the film spent a little more time in the citadel at the beginning it may have helped as it wouldnt have made the middle as long i didnt care as much for the wife characters either but luckily they did not get too much focus nicholas hoult plays a war boy named nux who i found quite annoying but did not get in the way of the stars of the film who were theron and hardy the films is called but imperiosa is really the main character of the film as she gets most of the screen time and the emotional moments but i didnt mind because of charlize therons performance where she was able to make her go through a range of emotions and made the character very likable hardy was okay as well with hardly any dialogue overall this is a decent action movie that is beautiful to look at but i wish the story had a little more depthscore 7510,reality

where to begin everything about this action film was stunning simply stunningwhat i really love most about this movie and the original movies is that all the cars are actually real yes they literally do build these machines and sets so it gives the movie a realismhollywood please take note real life beats cgi every timewhile this movie does use some cgi and to excellent effect its the real life actual explosions and car action that really makes the movies from the very first movie through to this movieim also blown away by mr edward thomas hardy who does a superb job with we all love mel gibson as but sadly his time has passedunless he makes an appearance as an aged looking back and telling a story from his past perhaps that might work mel certainly still has it the expendables movie roles were great but the age is showing that said i noticed some original actors from the original series making appearances in this recent film and they were brilliantim kind of puzzled as to the whole story issues people are having and i think its a movie that youll either love or hate with no in between the story is very and i felt it really did fit in well with the road warrior anyone who is winging about this new film really needs to go back and watch the original movies this movie actually had more in it than what people are giving credit for it unlike the other movies however this one requires that you fill in the blanks yourself its a story told on the run its a post apocalyptic world that doesnt give you the luxury of reflection and thats the way george has put this installment togetherits big bold constant full throttle nail biting action and thats what at its core is about people trying to live in a world gone madthe effects the acting and yes the story were great it was the we all know and love given an upgrade it rightfully deservesmy only gripe for all 4 films is that the continuity with the original 3 films was a touch off base but overall this movie really did deliver in fact far more than i was expecting and its great to see george is back with his signature film creationhighly recommended and anyone knocking this movie mustnt have liked the road warriormy only wish is that bruce spence gets to make a guest appearance in one of the sequels to this film the gyrocopter flying loony was a great addition to the original films and would really thrill fans of the serieswho knows maybe even get angry anderson to make an appearance or possibly tina turner,reality
i have to admit i was somewhat disappointed by fury road if only because the super hype led my expectations to be way too high theres a lot to love in this film and it is obviously a very meticulously planned and executed picture if we are judging it on its technical merits and the imagination behind its world than could be considered masterful i want to stress how gorgeously shot and imagined the movie is the action sequences are painstakingly choreographed and have thematic weight to them the problem as stated earlier is that when it comes to dissecting the script it is so flat on emotions and characters id be surprised if there was even a good ten pages worth of dialogue in the film there just isnt any real sense of conviction other than the story dictates that there must be to move the pieces from a to b the characters are all competently brought to life by very talented actors but i think there is just the surfaces of characters when furiousa has her moment explaining a vague back story it actually seems sort of goofy as if miller and his screenwriter collaborators were just making up big sciencefictiony words frankly in particular feels entirely superficial as a character i think its a movie where the aesthetics are so impressive that you just have to look past a very weak story with very weak charactersi think if fury road were released in the eighties it wouldnt be considered the masterpiece many consider it to be now that fury road is raised to such a level is a testament to how bad action films have become and not how excellent this particular film is  you must know fury road has a lot of excellent things about it if this seems to be a review that tanks the film i think people going in for just the experience of wall to wall action will be immensely satisfied those who want an elaborate action film with characters in the vein of the better action pictures fury road is said to be a successor to will be disappointed i hate to be the contrarian but there you go,reality
i liked the movie but it wasnt what i really wanted to see there was way too many explosions chasing parts was really exciting to watch because of the shooting and killing the best part on was the guy playing guitar so hilariousi liked the actors especially charlize theron because she was freaking bad ass perfectly fitted to that role the short hair made her looks even better i think she looks better with short hair tom hardy have always been a good action actor he really does his acting wellfirst and maybe last reviewim literally not the best person to write reviews,reality
there have been many who wrote negative reviews for this film but i think if you start watching with the right frame of mind you will find it worth watching set in post apocalyptic australia it features stark but stunning landscapes of sand and craggy rock tom hardy as and charlize theron as furiosa are excellent and very believable as people traversing this gritty and violent world in search of something better hope and redemption as the film puts it through blood gunfights and car chases they try to stay true to their hopes for a happier future best seen on a larger screen to take in the scale of the vistas and the numbers of vehicles involved in the battles but still very impressive on the smaller screens the gigantic but empty landscapes highlight just how small they are as they continue on their quest and also how small their chances of success are the film at times has a theatrical quality almost like a shakespearean play as the individual characters reflect on their situation the battle scenes are elaborate and almost circus like sometimes you will get your fill of car chases guns and blood in this one but besides the action makes an effort to fill out the backgrounds and hopes of the main characters these days you dont find that attention from every hollywood film powers through with the steady pace of an 18 wheeler and you will get a steady supply of action to keep you interested till the end,reality
i watched the original movie back in the day where the plot went about trashing a gang of motorcycle riders after they had destroyed his family very satisfying it ended with him riding off into the sunset and they followed it up with one called under the dome if i am correct this new movie in my opinion lost the plotfury is a great movie but little over the top compared to the first two the vehicle scenes were great in fury but it was a bit of a thin round about story with no real meat showing any of the real world possibilities of other colonieswhat about in the city,reality
first of all i do want to say i enjoyed this film and i think it is worth seeing again it was exactly what it was supposed to be entertainingbad news first then the good news bad news is there is way too zooming in and quick cuts obviously it was made for 3d ill probably never watch a film in 3d again so this is just irritating because there is not really a purpose for 3d also there was no story yep no story at all nothing and no one to care about also why was the film called he didnt talk at all he had zero story the whole thing could continue if his character died tom hardy is pretty good as an actor and his talents were absolutely wasted in this it shouldve been called imperator furiosa crank the gauntlet wasteland i do have to say though my least favorite thing about the film is that they didnt get a single judas priest song in there i mean cmon other than that there may have been some dialogue that was really stupid but it wasnt supposed to be an intelligent film at all it was supposed to be fun now for the good news if you wanted to see an amazing car chase film than pretty much any car chase film in at least 15 years this is your film the vehicles were all modded and retro it was awesome and very creativemy personal favorite thing about this film was the costumes and the voice overs the art direction was spot on it really felt like a retro fantasy cartoon film brought to life with clear as day inspirations from light years gandahar super shredder in tmnt ii the secret of the ooze and quan chi of mortal kombat,reality
this film took director george miller 12 years to make and it shows there is a great deal of depth to this fictional postapocalypse world here the same back story is depicted with a larger and more ferocious telling i expect this film will greatly influence future action movies primarily because the elements of this action film are so fresh and unique director george miller should especially be recognised for getting performances that get the characters emotions without much dialogue much needs to be said about the action cutting of this film first there is little or no shaky cam for me the ferocity of the pacing for an extended action sequence seemed almost impossible yet it kept my adrenaline going im not sure how many edits are in this film but it feels about twice as many as a normal action film yet it doesnt suffer from michael bay syndrome addicted to quick cutsgeorge miller has created a look to his films by undercranking the camera this means instead of playing back at 24 frames per second the motion is sped up so there is perhaps 26 fps passing by within a second next is starting the story as the chase begins giving the character momentum how to make an original action film spend months designing and building wild vehicles previously only seen as bubble gum stickers i used to collect as a kid the personality designed into the cars and trucks rivals some of the actors there was an interesting shifting of the weight of the story to the supporting characters allowing the main characters to go through most of the movie without any dialogue it is a bit of irony for tom hardy to have so little dialogue while spending the entire movie in a traveling vehicle around the time of the release of was locke in which he spends the entire movie talking while in a moving vehicle charlize theron needs no backstory to understand she is tough a lot of good adrenaline inducing tribal drums punctuate the soundtrack one of the chase vehicles has six drummers bashing away while a fire wielding heavy metal guitar player assaults the sonic landscape no other film this summer has this kind of well paced action with original visuals,reality
the film may be called and it may start and end with him but anyone watching soon realizes that is actually about her with providing the vehicle no pun intended for her story it is she who is trying to free the birth mothers and take them to the green place her story of redemption for past sins as much as redemption and she who the films villain imortan joe is trying to kill in fact joe never so much as acknowledges existence at any point during the film charlize therons performance is a refreshing defiance of the typical female role of helpless love interest and shows that a strong female lead playing an emotionally scarred physically tough character can be just as believable as male actors this film and charlize theron in particular left me wondering why more films dont have stories written for strong independent women if characters like furiosa are the result we can expect tom hardy where the character of furiosa wore her emotions on her sleeve the audience had a much more difficult time discerning what was feeling or thinking due to his extremely limited dialogue and his largely quite demeanor hardys performance was subtlety at its finest since his dialogue was so limited he could not act through his words as most roles do so instead he used his eyes and his body language to convey his characters inner turmoil the jittery manner in which hardy moves throughout the film is one example of how he effectively demonstrates borderline insanity without speaking another being the way his eyes are constantly shifting back and forth in his head the director george miller should be applauded for his decision to use as little cgi as possible only about 10 of the film is cgi in order to make the film appear and feel as realistic as possible the flames shooting out of the guitar are in fact real using the australian landscape combined with enhanced color filters to make the film as vibrant as possible miller was able to achieve his goal of creating a uniquely colorful postapocalyptic world this was a conscious effort by miller to prevent the audience from feelings of bleakness and destitution this method was simple yet also highly effectiveanother area where miller imprints his directional style is his transitions throughout the film there are several moments in the story where there is a shift in the storys pacing usually from a high action sequence to a much slower one and a lesser director might have struggled with these transitions appearing choppy instead miller uses scenes like these to further enhance the audiences feeling that they are not only watching a car chase but they are experiencing it one example is the scene where we see the flare in the desert after storm slowly dim and fade to darkness as the music builds and then suddenly the scene switches to bright morning sunlight with bright sand and a very slowly rising this quick shift from high speed to an abrupt halt is not unlike suddenly braking in a car and gives the film greater depth in a very subtle way another example of this technique is that right after is caught while trying to escape being branded and has been shown at a higher film rate he is thrust back inside the cave and we are immediately shown the brand on furiosas neck in addition to creating a carlike transition this also serves as a way of introducing furiosa and immediately creates a connection in the audiences mind between her and george miller and his cowriters also strengthened this films story by avoiding the temptation to fall into overdone and tiresome clichs having the intestinal fortitude as a storyteller to kill off nux a young boy who the audience grows to like and sympathize with rather than sparing him to preserve a happy ending was a bold and commendable decision the greatest trap however that miller avoided was the temptation to have and furiosa form a romantic relationship by having kiss her when she was on the verge of death not only would this have weakened her character significantly and turned her into yet another damsel it would have shattered the bond they had formed over their shared desire to achieve redemption sometimes it is not what directors and screenwriters do that makes their stories successful it is what they choose not to doanother significant part of what made this movie interesting and unique was the many creative concepts that miller brought to this post apocalyptic world the types of war boy warriors pole cats flamers war rigs etc as well as the many different car designs especially the rocker vehicle gave the audience something to look at as well as making the film less like a typical car chase the concept of being a universal donor and used as a blood bag which ends up saving furiosa was also very clever at the heart of the story is the concept of the war boys being halflives who are trying to reach valhalla while also worshiping v8 engines this along with the idea of witnessing with chrome and being reincarnated shiny and chrome like cars is a very creative concept of a fictional religious cultfury road is a revolutionary new action film which incorporates strong female characters and a unique story in addition to breathtaking visuals these visuals are not overdone and neither is the story this film is fast paced and action packed yet somehow also makes great use of subtlety through millers directing and hardys acting charlize therons performance is incredible particularly in the still limited genre of an action film but even more impressive than her acting is the creativity and skill that directorwriterproducer george miller brought to this film,reality
if you want to watch a film where name of film did not suggest about its main contentit is all about women empowerment in this film and end of movie you may feel that is just supportive character who just help that main characters to go aheadthis is the blockbuster and movie that you should not miss in this year watchlistgeorge miller is also maker of man of steel and after that kind of science fiction here we say fury road where we saw such a unbelievable scene where we cant believe in that but that was such fun and excitement in to watching this scenesfully entertainingand human touch also that make it most promising in 2015what a lovely day,reality
dont go to the cinema much but thought this is a film worth going to see didnt like it in the end  just wasnt tom hardy i like as an actor but his version of was this overly quiet characterthe film focused on everyone else more than him i know is all about car chases in the desert but not one pretty much solid film a long long car chase just wasnt for mei would be surprised if they make sequel let alone a decent one off the back of this i liked the villain a bit and charlie therons character but sadly lacking,reality
i am old enough to have seen the original road warrior in theaters as a kid and i enjoyed it immensely this movie gave me the same sensation i cannot recall the last time i have enjoyed watching a film so much maybe the first time i saw aliensevery detail was epic the cars the war boys the sandstorm the wild cars and that was all in the first act i was especially pleased that they had original v8 interceptor and tom hardy is the best man for the role he has the grit needed for a postapocalyptic but with a hint of sane incredulity in his eyesi watched road warrior first then the original and loved them i was rather disappointed with the thunderdome but it was the 80s this entry into the franchise redeems it wholly please dont talk about character development because that was done in the original this is just big loud  and crazythe scene where the whole war boy army takes off is an amazing spectacle the modded cars were something i had never seen before with strapped up front and the rolling guitarist to spur this crazy horde onwardthis is not terms of endearment if you like this kind of movie then you will love this one,reality
fury road was a movie i decided to see with great trepidation i thought it was a remake of the road warrior a friend of mine pointed out to me that this was a reboot of the franchise im glad i listenedall i ask for in an action movie is well action however some have failed to live up to a very simple premise such was not the case here the action began at the start of the movie and it did not end until the movie was over the cinematography and art direction were absolutely superb colors were used to the greatest effort to depict various moods the story is simple a crazed ruler lords over a vast area of wasteland he is in charge of the water and the vegetation he also pedals flesh in the form of his breederswomen who are sent to various places to repopulate this barren nothingness and his band of merry widows so to speak are trying to find the green patch in all this desolation tom hardy as and charlese theron as the female lead were terrific the supporting cast was very good and the stunts and visual effects were out of this world this movie is rated r for violence and adult situations i highly recommend this one,reality
with a bare bones script and set in a bare bones landscape the movie wacks the audience with visuals and helter skelter chaos in what boils down to one long pursuit through a rocky desert that recalls 2 the road warrior is this the road warrior redux perhaps it is in a way but then its infused with a touch of borderlandsthe game for its over the top weird characters with names like the people eater the doof warrior and the bullet farmer there is no way describing them they have to be seen the movie keeps a stringent pace once it gets going which is almost right from the bat after we are reintroduced to and the setting tom hardy is a worthy successor to mel gibson perhaps even better for he has a rather more edgy attitude which is why is called after all in the first scenes he gets captured and while he tries to make his escape he finds himself dragged along as war trophy perched in front of a car that is part of the pursuit of the war rig a massive trucktrailer combination commanded by imperator furiosacharlize theron who is trying to escape the war boys of the tyran immortan joe with his most adored treasure his five nubile wives the chaos increases when the first of the pursuit catches up with theron and tries to escape them while the war boys try to kill him furiosa and get the war rig to stop at the same time without killing the wives once the first of the war boys have been dealt with by and furiosa the fight is between them at first but eventually necessity turns them into allies later on they are joined by nux a warboy who is forced to switch sides a lot is smartly interwoven with the pursuit there is the awkward love relation that develops between nux and one of the girls there is a kind of respect developing between and furiosa there is even some pondering that gives the movie a deeper feel and there is even a very boschlike scene when the war rig travels to a swapland where the crows live the fight scenes are a marvel to behold almost everything fanciful is flung at the war rig pole riders trucks bikes monster trucks armored cars flamethrowers hooks chains and a high speed saw among them all in all this is a well made movie in which the star is theron who overshadows even hardy due to her personality its not because she pretty in this one for she is not she is gritty dirty and bald but it is because she brings imperator furiosa to life it makes me wonder whether the next installment in the series will be called ,reality
what a thrillride this film is what an elderly lady said behind me  as i was leaving the cinema  perfectly summed up the intensity and raw power of this accomplished blockbuster i felt like i was shaken around for two hours straight that is the broadest way to put fury road i was extremely excited for fury road considering i am a massive fan of the mel gibson trilogy yet even going into the cinema with the highest of expectations this movie did not disappoint what i loved about it most was not the action and gore and explosions but the underpinning themes that tie this masterpiece together in such a way that the action and exquisite acting by tom hardy and most definitely charlize theron told most of the story themes of hope home glory ecological breakdown and redemption shaped the action blockbuster into a more subtle postapocalyptic actiondrama  which is uncommon i thought george miller did a wonderful job with the cinematography  the stunning visuals and lighting as a devoted musician as well as filmgoercritic i became totally glued to the screen when we first witness the crescendo loud raw amazing and unusual characteristics of coma the doof warrior spoiler if there ever is a like apocalypse i want to be coma overall fury road is a joyride of constant action expositions extraordinary stuntwork amazing direction and oscarworthy acting theron deserves an oscar nod,reality
i think you will either love or hate this movie it is excessive lets get that out of the way and incredibly silly but no one surely went into a film called fury road expecting anything else did they yes the plot is pretty weak we could pull apart some of the gender issues for hours but for what it is i found it massively entertaining and visually stunning the main cons are relatively weak plot it is just a car chase for the entire movie lack of realism if this is always a con poor acting from some huntington whitely kravitz which may be down to the writing and tom hardy is unable to shine the pros are it looks excellent its incredibly fun if you can take it for what it is and charlize theron is excellent it is not a film for everyone or for all occasions but if you are going to pick an action blockbuster this is as good as any on occasion i felt like it was trying to make some sort of political point but then more explosions happened and i forgot about it again however i do agree it has been overhyped and many may not enjoy the comicvideo game esque visuals,reality
having worked with george miller on all three previous movies over 30 years ago i was really keen to see what he would come up with number four well the lack of story was a little disappointing but as a comic strip action movie it scores well however a two hour chase from point a to point b then back to point a was a bit pointless and without some decent dialogue one just didnt care about the characters top marks to john searle for his fantastic camerawork which provides a visual feast to compliment the spectacular stunt workthe hard task was to replace mel but tom hardy does a decent job nicholas hoult was great as nux and it was good to see hugh keaysbyrne playing the bad guy once again he played toecutter in the original film overall this is an entertaining action movie that certainly delivers what it sets out to do and should keep the action fans happy,reality
the original road warrior part 2 is well known in movie circles but i am still amazed at how many people do not know of its existence let alone having seen it the first movie of the series is even less well known but it is also a better story beyond thunderdome is an average conclusion to the mel gibson trilogy of and rightly ended as an attempt at making money yet such is the cultishness of the trilogy that this new version fury road was made both for those of us who know the original and for those that have no experiencethe original road warrior was so good because it took all car chases make them bigger put a purpose to them and centered the movie around them there was real plot involved too though nothing like the movie gibson later directed for his oscar the postapocalyptic setting of the road warrior was also unique and it all combined to make a wonderful movie that probably is slightly above the level of cult classic it was never even in any awards discussion and fury road is also like that but both are very entertaining the two movies were meant for action not drama though fury road is more action driven and has a lesser plot when compared to road warriorwhy miller decided to remake the movie is a mystery though money is probably a motivator that said he had a lot to live up to and he mostly succeeded the major sticking point in this movie would be the ability to match the car chases which were both outlandish and interesting in the road warrior as in the original they were over the top but not in a way that was cartoonish and the uniqueness of the cars was quite good too with very little mimicry in the remake though that giant driving guitar speaker was stupid and along the way there were quite a few small homages to the original series which were clearly meant for fans of the original performance wise it really amounted to tom hardy charlize theron and a group of models my first introduction to hardy was with inception and since then he has quite a few good roles in another review i espoused his performance in the drop here like gibson in the road warrior the script is not dynamic but he takes what he was given and runs with it like gibson in the road warrior hardy plays the role with the same persona and with the same presence this time though has a costar this being the wellknown charlize theron it has been interesting to see her change from the pretty girl roles to ones with more grit this certainly is that and anybody who has really paid attention to her career would probably not be surprised to see her with a sheered head for this role and just like hardys part she needed to have a similar persona and presence to which she does well the two really do well playing off each other given the scripts limitationsjuxtaposed to that grit is the quintuplet of models that is supposed to make up this feminist version of the road warrior while none of them are as dynamic in screen persona as hardy or theron they each do well on their own and as a group and none of them are really out of place they also each have a grittiness that grows as the movie progresses that is a nice counter to their typical model life credit to this last bit must go to miller who was able to make these models both visually beautiful and dirty overall this is a good movie and exciting though far from oscar worthy i do recommend watching the original trilogy first but it is hardly necessary though the movie is r rated none of the violence is graphic there is only a single profane word and no nudity just to have a naked body there is some but it is purposed and not graphic i would even be comfortable considering this as a pg13 movie though i understand why it was rated r recommended probably not late at night as the energy level is quite high and if watching with kids probably a good idea to let them do something afterwards also this movie is for fun not seriousness,reality
this is one of the best movies i have seen it was awesome great actors like charlize theron tom hardy nicholas hoult rosie huntingtonwhiteley it was a thriller non stop action through the entire movie the movie gets you jumping out of your seat its action packed and full of surprises your cheering for the girls to get away from this sick guy those vagina locks are just ridiculous lets you know how bad they needed to get out of dodge those wild people who spray their faces before they sacrifice themselves are out of this world jaw dropping the whole time you dont see too many movies like this the video footage quality was insane out of this world the producers did such a great job its wild and just like the title,reality
i was skeptical watching a remake of 30 years this is one of my very few straight 1010 wish there was a higher score really i found everything so well done the photography the wasteland images the hellish characters the pace the simple straight plot the reality of a nightmare i never liked the mades in the first place 30 years ago but this has nothing to do with that genre this is a visual masterpiece a stunning production without a plot but filled with images and techniques that set a new standard in film production it is pure spectacle pure creation pure inspiration everything you see is brand new here never seen before in any post apocalyptic series or flick,reality
its not often you walk into a cinema expecting anything great usually you just go in to shut your brain off for about two hours and then you leave feeling refreshed isnt so obliging however oh nofury road grabs you by the neck twists till your eyes pop open and takes you for a wild wild ride through the wasteland never letting go until the end of the movie when the screen goes blacktwice in my life ive left the movies feeling grateful those two films were fr and pacific rim if you want to get a look in on my greasy soul dissect a body write a love poem and see these two films on the biggest movie screens possible just another friday nightwhat is life but a series of remembered moments go see and picture immortan joe whenever you smile while youre at it see george millers other movies if babe will turn you off bacon will turn you off human flesh,reality
i finally manage to see the 4th episode of the series still written and directed by the talented george miller once again we are drowned into this postapocalyptic world where the resources are limited and life conditions are precariousthis time its not the gas that is what everyone is after but water the precious liquid is indeed only available to a few minority the movie is a nonstop furious action with sequences that last for a solid 10 minutes the story is there as a guideline but most importantly the film managed to squeeze just enough of story and a huge dose of pure concentrated action i was a bit afraid at first because of the change of actor i love tom hardy but was mel gibson for me anyway hardy did a great job and i look forward to another episode of the franchise with him in it it is a pleasure to look at the old and see that the camera work hasnt change much compare to the new one they did an excellent job at using all techniques to give it a sense of old school moviegreat movie,reality
some people only see whats directly in front of them this move is truly a work of art very little cgi off the chain real stunts with extreme difficulty and mastery color and film stock are awesome every detail in the movie should be appreciated i mean just the cars alone im not even going to mention the cutting edge editing and camera work plus the complications of shooting in this location people who watched this and bagged it know nothing about film making and are simply numb and have no vision do the research this movie is like an iceberg there is much more underneath than what you see at eye level love this film and for people who whine and cry about it not being like the gibson grow up no one wants to see the same outdated movie i say this with all due respect to the older versions once again move forward and just enjoy everything that went into making this epic action film film and photography major in school and professional photographer,reality
i will keep this simpletheres two kinds of cinematic approaches tagged along with many genres those we call arthouse and those we call blockbusters the most important thing with films is to enjoy yourself andor have something to think about some are direct with its message others are indirect using little language in dialogue and the rest goes through symbolism and analysis the direct in some occasions are just to milk money i call that shallow cinema its not just based on nostalgia or just to milk money the perfect excuse for this film is the growth of technology filming in digital makes it easier and the quality is greater both in sound and imagethis one is something else and to be honest i havent enjoyed a blockbuster in yearsgeorge millers career has been there but throughout the years his work is a small catalog but this one feels right in this time of age being a fan of the previous classics well they are classics but theyve aged and not too well this is a fresh start and feels like a dream come true with a vision that is meant to be the quality will age well through the years with all in mind this is a masterpiecea previous reviewer complained that is it too much action  but thats what is about thats part of the experience its not the type of film to milk a franchise it really is a dream come true its visual presentation even customization this movie had to be made and perhaps this is what george miller always wantedthis movie is a long ride and i mean it to me this is the best action film of the year and i havent enjoyed one in yearsthe main protagonist isnt really but furiosa charlize theron and she steals the show with a great cast score and set those who appreciate a good film and are fans of the concept and the series will love this if you havent seen ittreat yourself with this filmthis is a new beginning and i cant wait for a second filmthis is a movie that needed to be made now,reality

entertainingset in a postapocalyptic future an evil ruler immortan joe keeps his subjects under tight rule then one of his most trusted lieutenants imperator furiosa sets out to escape his regime taking with her all his wives along the way she meets rockatanskydirected by george miller who directed the original mel gibson starring in 1979 plus both its sequels fury road is two hours of nonstop action the plot is rather basic and theres very little substance to it but the action is frenetic and constant however while this makes it entertaining it does feel monotonous after a while theres only so far you can go with an all style no substance approachultimately reasonably interesting but vastly overrated,reality
fury road is 100 the best action movie this year every aspect about it is perfection from the magnificent cinematography which captures gorgeous wide shots of car mayhem to the snappy editing that doesnt have 7 billion quick cuts in a fight scene to hide the fact that there are stunt doubles another thing that stands out is the unbelievable effects there is little cgi in this film and mostly what you see is what you get you see that car crash in to that car and do a barrel roll and explode yeah well that bloody happened george miller who is a 70 year old man who has somehow managed to create a fantastic action film coming off of babe and happy feet 2 and gifted us movie goers with a film that should be rewatched for yearz not to mention the amazing but subtle performances from tom hardy and charlize theron however nicholas hoult steals the show with his amazingly crazy and also human character i cant wait to get my hands on the bluray and witness me the bright vibrant colours and dolby surround sound this is an absolute must see for anyone,reality
the film marking the fourth installment of in george millers series follows a prisoner and blood bag for a war boy nux a soldier for the cult that has taken reign since societys post apocalyptic collapse as its core this part is a one long action sequence on fury road this is a thunderous achievement of pure filmmaking technique and a film that makes most other blockbusters of the 21st century look amateurish it could be argue that the films real star impostor furiosa who betrays immortal joe by freeing the five wives the movie sets into the action when furiosa takes a detour to green place consequently joe leads his entire army in pursuit of furiosaultimately this is one of those movies that are fun to describe but hard to write about fury road is essential inthemoment entertainment nothing sticks after leaving the theater but the george millers direction makes the every single moment of action exhilarating there are so many moments in this movie where i found myself saying wow i cant believe im seeing this  either because the visuals were so insane or so extreme or just because there was intense beauty filling the framethe main theme of movie was survival the film completely justifies the opening lines i am the one who runs dead as well as alive their isnt much of story in the movie but cinematography and direction was so fabulous that it can compensate anything miller exaggerated every single aspect of movie thereby making it a thrilling experience for viewers detailing of mechanical rigs elevator and vehicles was overwhelming which can easily allure anyones eye if im gonna die im gonna die historic on the fury roadas you can clearly see i m in complete awe of what george miller has accomplished here fury road is everything an action movie should be its a masterpiece in terms of cinematography direction screenplay and editing,reality
if im gonna die im gonna die historic on the fury road hardy is a loner and a drifter who has been captured and is being used as a blood bag imperator furiosa theron is charged with leading a group to a distant city when she takes a detour the ruler of the village isnt happy and sets out to find her and bring her back and furiosa form an unlikely alliance in order to save a group of prisoners from the tyrannical leader i wasnt really looking all that forward to this movie i wasnt a huge fan of the mel gibson series and wasnt expecting anything great from this movie it may have been my low expectations but this movie wasnt that bad and it was pretty entertaining throughout the best part of this movie is that it didnt try and do too much it knew what the audience wanted and it is basically a 2 hour car chase movie there is nothing amazing or horrible in this movie on one hand it was better than i expected but on the other hand it really didnt do anything to wow me or add anything extra special to set it apart from the originals or death race for that matter nothing else really to say other than this is pretty much what you are expecting it to be a very safe feeling middle of the road action movie overall entertaining but didnt really take any chances and didnt set itself apart from other movies like this it is very watchable though i give it a b,reality
i can absolutely say without a doubt i am blown away fury road is a two hour action masterpiece with thrilling stunts incredible vehicles and disturbing costumes the action sequences are wonderfully executed 95 of the special effects are practical giving the film authenticity the film is edited with fluid feel while simultaneously keeps you anxious and uneasy tom hardy and charlize theron play the leading roles their unique on screen chemistry magnifies the tense action nicholas hoult is a sleeper in this one george miller held nothing back and provides a new take on an over saturated genre if you cant feel adrenaline coursing through your veins while youre watching fury road then you are most likely dead,reality
spoilers before i get bombarded with hate comments from the 14 star community let me make my point clear fury road is not completely lacking a plot yes this movie was not plot intensive and yes it was mostly a massive scale car chase however that is fundamentally what is here is the plot of fury road imperator furiosa is tired of being under the tyrannical of immortan joe so one day on a supply run furiosa decides to drive into the desert to get away from him she also has the opportunity to use the war rig to find her home when she finds out that her home is now part of the landscape of the desert she decides to take the citadel because joes army kidnapped her as a childon the other hand we have rockatansky he was kidnapped by joes warboys which naturally pisses him off so he joins the fight against joes army also he is looking for redemption so he decides to help furiosa and her friends take the citadeland because it seems like nobody realizes this heres nuxs story a warboy since birth he and everyone around him are insane once he finds a group of survivors with sanity he helps them against joes forces so that he himself can find a sense of sanity this is just the way i looked at itaccompanied by gripping action and outstanding cgi fury road is worthy of a 1010,reality
madness madness likable madness some movies are meant to be reasoned with some are meant to pique your interest this one is meant to take you away to things youve never seen on screen before its good to watch something like this after going through countless hours of watching mediocre movies ill recommend to friends i dont remember having watched previous installments but i think i will do just that thank you mr george miller i look forward to the next installment tom hardy and charlize theron deserve awards for this moviei think this is the movie of the year for me ill keep looking though,reality
i did not know i could like an action movie  i saw it at the movies on a huge screen and i loved it  it was my first movie now i want to watch the original seriesi had a great experience the film is a mix of drama anticipation and action it might be too explosive too noisy sometimes but this is what makes this movie wild and furious and it is not just explosive but also captivating and movingi really liked this strange world and especially the girls the actresses are great women are the heart of the movie this can be called a feminist movie charlize is amazing here,reality
i said overrated because this is not a movie above 8  10 this is a good action movie not necessarily an expected sequel doesnt have that mystic sensation given by the older versions with mel gibson but tom hardy is a very good selection considering the way this movie was constructed also theron teams up with this guy pretty good against the maniacs from the wasteland i saw a lot of people say full action movie from start till the end for me there were moments when you could get bored precisely because too much action without a fully logical correlation so some moments of thought and discussions wouldve been approved by many i think our road warrior is now an agent of wasteland that went through this episode like another day in paradise maybe the next one will settle things better,reality
fury road has some of if not the most intense action sequences of any movie it spends much of its run time giving the viewer a heart attack by throwing and company into seemingly inescapable danger the thing that makes the near nonstop action work is the feeling that our heroes are actually in real danger keeping us on the edge of our seats throughout once one gets beyond the shell shock of the action sequences you will notice an incredibly well directed movie with some surprising heart to itthe action in this movie is nearly unmatched so i will not waste time retelling the ways this movie puts to shame all the superhero movies that have been pretending to be great action movies looking at you dark knight what really makes this movie stand out is its fantastic pacing and show dont tell approach to story telling the movie does not slow down to have someone hit you across the face with the theming instead it uses the characters actions and visual symbolism to accomplish its goals the movie posits that compassion is what makes us human and it shows us what a world without it looks like a place where we are all just things to be used and disposed of and wanting to know the name of a person seems frivolous it does this with what some may argue are strong feminist undertones pitting a society where masculinity has been taken to the extreme and thus a lack of compassion against and a mostly female ensemble the theme is brought home in character arc in which he starts in a world of fire and blood reduced to one instinct survive and ends with him regaining some of his humanity fury road is sure to excite with its action but still has depth not seen in an action movie in some time in the end this movie places its self squarely in the running for greatest action movie ever,reality
this film in simple terms was amazing it was a non stop action thrill ride the fight scenes were so fluid and easy to follow and the imagery was fantasticl i also loved the range of characters george miller has created furiosa was by far my favourite she was just a pure bad ass but i loved how everyone in this movies got an awesome moment even the bad guys got an awesome moment the plot follows on from a nuclear holocaust the world has become a desert wasteland and civilization has collapsed rockatansky a survivor is captured by the war boys the army of the tyrannical immortan joe and taken to joes citadel designated a universal blood donor is imprisoned and used as a blood bag for the sick war boy nux meanwhile imperator furiosa one of joes lieutenants is sent in her armored truck to collect gasoline when she drives offroute joe realizes that his five wives are missing joe leads his entire army in pursuit of furiosa calling on the aid of nearby gas town and the bullet farm the action is beautiful and actually tiring to watch this better get the all important best picture nomination and maybe a few acting nods for tom hardy and charlize theron,reality
i am shocked when i think that the director george millers last film was happy feet two and his last live action picture was babe 2 pig in the city that said i was a huge fan of the original films so given the relaunch i went in to the theatre with a mixed feelings but open mindi have to say when i left i was just blown away absolutely amazing i think i was actually out of breath the speed at which the film flows so many fast flow sequences each one flowing into the next it was fantastic just no time to breath edge of your seat actionworth every cent,reality
after three decades we finally get another film and from the original director to boot and if we learned anything from indiana jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull it is that these kind of movies are to be feared which is why its my great surprise and pleasure to announce that fury road is not only amazing it comes very close to being the best weve ever hadcouple of reasons for this first of all it is an unbelievable action film eighty percent of the whole running time is spent in one kind of action sequence or another but the directing and the pacing are both so iron tight that youll never feel overwhelmed i was at the edge of my seat the whole film biting my nails trying to rein in the urge to leap to my feet and yell oh yeah it also helps that this movie is one of those rare movies nowadays that are confident enough to utilize practical effects where they can and only rely to cgi when the effect is impossible to replicate in real life and that shows you really believe that all the cars are there and that the explosions really happen its a nuanced difference but we see so much cgi these days that weve become able to spot the differencethe actors are also phenomenal tom hardy is perfect as the new sure he doesnt have the underlying suave charisma mel gibson had but this is a more jaded were seeing in this film and hardy is perfect for that but the real breakthrough performance here has to be charlize theron as imperator furiosa i demand more action roles for this woman shes everything someone portrayed as equal has to be and then some undeniably badass utterly skilled and frightening in her fury shes one of the best action heroines weve ever seen if not the best more pleaseand thirdly the surprising depth and emotions shown in this film and yes the themes are largely feminine it deals with subjects like forced pregnancy slavery treating women as objects to be owned fear suffering and loss all this in the middle of the most straightforward action gorefest youve ever seen yet the thing is the themes never take away from the action it wouldnt be a better action movie if you dropped the themes away or replaced them with something more masculine it works precisely because it can be a movie for both the adrenaline junkie muscleheads and for those looking hope and redemption in cinemaand that is why fury road is so great because it pulls of the miracle of not only being a fourth part in a franchise thought having died a long time ago but also being a movie about humanity redemption and equality while also being the movie most likely to cause perpubescent boys to drop their voices by two octaves,reality
i have a feeling the script for this movie was three pages long the first page said the most epic explosions  car stunts ever the second page was dialogue the third page said remember page one lets put it in fourth gear the reason this movie gets a 9  10 is because it delivers perfectly on what it wants to be this is exactly what george miller wanted to do back in the old films with mel gibson there are parts of the movie flashbacks which if you havent seen the older films will not really make sense to you but they are not so confusing that you wont enjoy the movie like i said if you are wanting a film to blow your mind with over the top action  pure insanity like youve never seen before this is that film,reality
all right folks today i am going to review the movie fury road now i know the movie has been out for over two months but i finally got around to watching it just last night and i kicked myself in the butt for waiting so long as the movie is not a ten out of ten for me it is still really good not as good as the masterful original but equally as good as the second one yes i said it the original is better than the road warrior i still say alien is better than aliens accept it because its true now on to my reviewsynopsis an apocalyptic story set in the furthest reaches of our planet in a stark desert landscape where humanity is broken and almost everyone is crazed fighting for the necessities of life within this world exist two rebels on the run who just might be able to restore order theres a man of action and a man of few words who seeks peace of mind following the loss of his wife and child in the aftermath of the chaos and furiosa a woman of action and a woman who believes her path to survival may be achieved if she can make it across the desert back to her childhood homeland stars tom hardy charlize theron nicholas hoult director george millerlike i said in my build up this movie is a masterpiece just as much as the first and second movies were lets forget about the third forwell ever george miller returned to the series reportedly fifteen years ago trying to get this one made now little is known but if i had to guess i would say it was if the script was the same back then as it was in the film truth be told im glad that he had to wait this long to make it the effects were that much better there is a story out that tom hardy admitted was true where he got into millers face about the dust storm scene just imagine for a second if miller tried to make that scene fifteen ten even five years ago it would not have looked the sameas for the storyline it was very simple is trying to find peace but gets caught up in the problems of others with exception to the first movie it is the same storyline as the others and there is nothing wrong with that you cant come up with something for a loner who never talks besides doing either one of two things this storyline is one of them the other is that he just stumbles among the bad guys such as in the first movie so really nothing wrong there doesnt even really say anything until about twenty to twentyfive minutes into the movie thats something that everyone should expect from him no way around itthe acting was right on the mark granted the wives were mostly the worst part of the acting aspect and the real reason the movie isnt higher up on my ten scale but thats okay because of everyone else in truth the one that really stole the show was nicholas hoult as nux nobody had any idea what he was going to do in the movie and he surprised even me charlize nothing can really be said about her because she is awesome in almost everything she does tom was just tom a lot of people will say and some that i have heard before that he was trying too hard to be mel in the movie but he made his own character something that mel has admitted he wanted tom to do which is also one of the reasons that mel kept his name out of this one sure he could come back for one of the two other sequels but well seethe music was the same as it always was just right for the tone of the moviei really dont know what else to say about this movie if you havent watched it then you need to get out and see it you will not be disappointed i can promise you thatrating 85 out of 10 i really wish imdb would allow a half a pointthats it for me folks tomorrow i will post a book review if you would like to continue to follow my post go ahead and like this page go check out these sites and dont forget to check out my book a family affair i have added the sites to the bottom of the pagetwitter timyingling facebook httpswwwfacebookcomtimyinglingauthor publisher wwwsolsticepublishingcom blog httpbitly1mcinwha family affair sites amazon httpamznto1cozhpb solstice httpbitly1j7oxfz createspace httpbitly1hrsqvz,reality

the story to a certain extent is secondary to the action in this film due to it essentially being one long action sequence must of cost a fortune nevertheless they pulled tugged it off its a visual spectacle that keeps you hooked in its a cracking watchthe actors play their respective parts  theres not much more to say because it isnt about indepth storytelling its about the shinyshiny things so because nobody actually reads these reviews  only looks at the scores heres a story about a bunny rabbitfloppity the rotten rabbitfloppity  flappity were rabbit twins they would play all day  sleep all night they liked to play in mr cheeks garden because the large rhubarb  cabbage patch made for excellent hiding they would take turns to hide  have such fun trying to outwit oneanothernevertheless hide  seek wasnt the only reason they liked to play in mr cheeks garden as the fruit  vegetables mr cheek grew were exceedingly yummy however mr cheek wasnt best pleased to discover floppity  flappity had been gnawing on his fruit  veg in fact he got very angry and laid snares around the garden to entrap floppity  flappitynow children snares are string and stake devices designed to capture a bunny rabbit by its neck or foot the more the bunnyrabbit struggles the tighter the snare grips this results in a lack of blood to the appendage caught in said device for example if the snare is around the bunnyrabbits neck the bunny rabbit will suffocate or on occasion break its neck in the panic which ensues entrapmentone day floppity  flappity got into an argument whilst playing in mr cheeks garden flappity was unhappy that floppity was mocking his name for flappity wasnt actually flappitys real name it was brian brian had gained the name flappity from floppity for displaying a nervous dispositionyoure always flapping flappity floppity said sneeringlyno im not er i just like to think things through which is hard to do when you keep pressurising me replied brianflappity floppity sneered once more just pick a bloody cabbage leaf  eat it old man cheek will be along in a second with his shotgun remember what happened to motherat this flappity snappeddont you dont you ever talk about mother again it was you who made her go back into the garden to retrieve the cabbage leaf that you dropped floppity looked at his irate twin  with the demeanor of a clergyman giving sunday prayers he methodically replied calmdown flappity old chum stop flapping cock flappity crackedbackqu pasa floppity repliedbang as buckshot flew through the emeraldlit undergrowth of cabbage utopia so did floppity  flappity like two grey wigs shot from a cannon they sped to the outskirts of the garden in an instinctive lust for life flappity got to the hole in mr cheeks garden fence first but instead of darting through to safety he stopped  slid a loose fencepost across the exit into which floppity chargeddazed floppity got to his feet let me through brother quickwhats my name greeted floppitys call for helpfloppity looked around in a panic then screamed theres no time for this let me through now flappitywhats my name came once more from behind the fencebri floppitys response was cut shortbefore floppity could finish the name that flappity so longed to hear another shot pumped from mr cheeks gun not only peppering floppity with holes but flappity too through the fence as the buckshot ridden rabbits lay grasping at the final cabbageleaves of life floppity could hear flappity faintly murmur through the fence dickhead,reality
i just grabbed a dvd of this in chinaive been reading all these reviews and people are expressing themselves almost hysterically ooohh its the best film ever made or boooits the worst film ever ridiculous its not either in my opinion it is oktom hardy plays in a reasonable way remember the gyrocaptain he said hes never seen a man beat a snake before dont forget is quick the movie often showcases quicknesspeople bang on about the the flaming guitar man and how ridiculous that ishold on a minute there is a guy who controls the resources his name is immortan joe he is blatantly an aristocrat type bloke who created a society and a culture to perpetuate his ideas hes a posh fella posh people have created and developed the society we live in today from central banking to corporatemilitary social hegemony well thats what they do and we are all born within their systemfactimmortan joe is a representation of a posh fella whos realised with his access to resources he could create a new society and so he did but he didnt consider the feelings and therefore actions of willful people like furiosa the flaming guitar man is a social motivation thing he egged the warriors under immortan joes control on it makes sense to meimmortan joe also created a religion that would motivate his warriors to sacrifice themselves to his cause hence the chrome mouth val halla thing hes a bright bloke look how many people have died for king and country or americuh and freedum or the emperor japan china england the chrome mouth nonsense makes sense to me as does the guitar dude if i created a society i would use sonic visual and religious motivators too blatantlythe film is a bit deeper than people realise at first glance however that said miller is fantanstic at visualisation  just look at 1 it is a shame that hollywood denied the essence of millers deep point  but it is still thereyeah alright the deaths arent as personal as they are in the original films but of course not this isnt an indie project like was you should watch in the australian version to see what i mean nevertheless tom hardy does express wellin this film however is not a central role there is very little character development or story arc but this is a film that shows our beloved dealing with the here and now of a future predicament he finds himself in much to his chagrinpsychologically this movie doesnt explore deep human developmental characteristics in a thespian al pacino way but it does strike a chord especially with those poor girls plighti found this film to be curious and fun ok its not as good as or the road warrior in fact i feel that this film would have been brilliant if miller had secured aussie entrepeneur and aussie corporate investment but such a film would have taken a long while to establish itself as a crazy violent classic what would you really do if you had to persuade people to cough up their wealth or if wealthy people said do this do this well throw our money at you obviously the second case happened  after some persuasion this does make the movie appear a lot like an american mass consumption movie but it still exists and so many people spent some of their working lives to make the movie happen im glad and grateful they didfury road is alright it isnt great though well i like it but the old movies are way cooler,reality
fury road is jam packed with nonstop action and chase sequences but the seriously lacking story line resulted in a movie with no depth or real character investment this is a shame because the little bit of back story teased was engaging and could have been developed into something that would have left an impression beyond explosions and crashes the imagery set costumes stunts and visual effects are impressive and if youre looking to be entertained for two hours with high energy trucks supedup cars motorcycles and creepy humanesque things going boom then this is the movie for you also how is all the oil being refined into gasoline in this future wasteland,reality
i came into theaters to see this movie hoping that it would be absolutely amazing as thats what all of the critics and the freaking 87 rating on imdb said but honestly i dont see what all of the hype is about sure all of the effects were pretty cool and the action scenes were entertaining but at the end of the day what is it its a movie about a post apocalyptic car chase that has a couple battles while they are driving the characters werent that in depth and they had little development and i have not enough knowledge about the little civilization that immortan joe has that they overthrow at the end to actually be rooting for them the acting was relatively good and the three main characters portrayed by charlize theron tom hardy and nicholas hoult were well played but i wasnt that enthralled in the movie and i was expecting more action that i got and it wasnt as gruesome as i expected probably shouldnt have been rated r it really wasnt that gory or sexual and i dont remember any swears some scenes were very well done though but if all the scenes were done as well as those id definitely like this movie a lot more maybe its because i didnt watch it in 3d,reality
fury road is a film that portrays a future dystopia where chaos lingers amongst every part of the worldthe film revolves around a character known as hardy who is captured by a race of people obsessed with plunging resources the race is run by a dictator called immortan joe keaysbyrne that promises a valhallastyle heaven to his fallen warriorseventually escapes his imprisonment but winds up with furiosa theron  immortan joes wives the group have to collaborate to escape immortan joe whilst also finding a way to return to furiosas homeland where it may still be possible for people to live in a sustainable manornow the film does have great cgi whilst the music included is very apt specifically tailored to each scene the best thing about this movie was definitely the action with the final action scene being one of the best  longest action sequences i have watched throughoutthe film however i just feels lacks something the character himself whilst i understand he is the kind of superhero that is a man of few words did not come across to me effectively  because of that i did not feel his pain anguish and actually did not care about him that much i cant help but liken to riddick from the chronicles of riddick but i have to say that i felt riddick himself was not only cooler but the way he was presented i cared a lot more about him also the whole concept that they left the citadel to just then go back just does not seem right to me finally i understand this is just a movie but the amount of times survives impending doom well it is slightly unbelievable even for a superhero,reality
fantastic photography amazing car chases and vision of the apocalypse is chillingly realistic think robert heinlein and the religious nutters he thought would take over the world and you wont be far wronghowever the scene in the desert where the skimpily dressed women in white are bathing in a hose is a tui moment yeah right use google to search for tui billboardshere for foreigners if you want to understand the referencethe scenery is amazing and the creation of the world post gene fading explosions was amazing and for anyone who has seen outback australia incredibly believablei had a few heart stopping moments however it was worth it,reality
it took me nearly a month and a half to finally see this movie and thats mainly because i am not into postapocalyptic movies they literally depress me as theres very little to look forward to in any of their finales but i gave this a shot and every single thing my friends had posted about this couldnt have been any truer this movie was unyielding merciless and yeah furious with its action and almost exclusively noncgi visuals and stunts while i mentioned im not a postapocalyptic movie guy im less a cgi guy so this was refreshing the story was void and what was on screen wouldnt confuse a 3year old but the whole point of this movie is to see strong leads and an absolute roller coaster of a car chase downyou guessed it a road of fury theron was excellent as always and hardy though good was mostly just present the real star of the movie was the superb and extremely long albeit welcomed detailed action scenes so many for so long that you probably have 1015 minutes in the two hours to catch your breathwasnt a fan of the connection to part three the neverending battle in head to give him some depth i give them kudos for attempting to add development and understanding but it came off like a deep background story for a friday the 13th teen thats just gonna distract what we bought our ticket forstrictly for action and i mean real action  phooey on cgi and nothing else totally recommended actually this is hard to not recommend since the action is so intense so mindblowingly awesomewait im just circling here and if you saw this movie like you should youd see what i just did there,reality
fury road takes elements you might expect to find in any rock concert that utilities lots of heavy metal props and tricks and marries it up to a hard core petrol head driven world of ordered mechanized post apocalyptic chaosthis is a highly visual film there is an economy of dialogue instead the actions of the key protagonists tell the story that needs to be told as such its hard to offer up much insight into the quality of acting as there is not really a lot of acting as such on offer that said this films works well because it adheres to its action formula its exciting and the pace builds and builds right through to the closing scenes perhaps the only downside is the rather anti climatic confrontation with the films key villainin summary this is an quality film its entertaining throughout and never dull nine out of ten from me,reality
through sand metal and blood i bore witness to the intensity and chaotic world that is fury road with a run time of 120 mins i found myself immersed in a world based on instinct survival and carnage it was evident the world was broken charred and without remorse and the mastermind george millers vision of a post apocalyptic world engrosses us and allows us in an experience like none felt since the release of one of his earlier films 2  the road warrior though being released 30 years after the last movie beyond thunderdome this fourth installment in the franchise has cemented itself as a cinematic masterpiece both visually and as a story after leaving the theater i felt myself wanting more believe it or not i walked out havinga lovely day in the introduction of the film we hear after a short we hear static accompanied with a narrative echoing the events that have that have transpired decades precluding the events of this film we meet rockatanskytom hardy a lost remnant of an already perished civilization he is quickly dashed in a chase for survival at that point we are shown glimpses of that grim that has overrun the planet minutes later we see tagged and locked away in a cage being used as nothing more than a blood bag for our next and if not one of our most memorable characters nux who is played by the talented nicholas hoult a war boy whos sole purpose in life like his many brothers is to gain the approval of their surrogate father and idol immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne the villain and main antagonist this fuels him and many other war boys like him to gather their war vehicles and witness their way into valhalla  nux i live i die i live again before going any further i also have to make mention to the key protagonist in this film and fury roads proposed heroine and gladiator the imperator furiosa charlize theron she in my opinion would be the very result if wonderwoman and the terminator decided to have a baby pure aggression driven with unwavered purpose to rescue the five wives breeders held captive by immortan joe and transport them to the green place the film brings all these characters together and molds them into an artwork unrivaled by any other postapocalyptic action film in the last decade you may ask yourself why so much hypei pose this question to you have you seen fury road if you havent stop what ever it is that you are doing now and do your adult life some justice and go to your nearest movie theater and watch this film and after you have done that and witnessed the masterpiece and epic gospel that this film is go tell your friends your co workers fk it get some boxes cut it up and walk around with a sign around your neck and a megaphone in hand preaching to all who have either eyes or ears to go watch this movie now that my rant is out of the way fury road is a rare film the whole idea or premise has been tried time and again but never in this scale or magnitude i myself was brought back to the feeling of emotion with each death however minor the characters were you could feel everyones struggle for survival or their cry to be immortalized as their deaths bore witness to fruitful carnage tossing feministic or misogynistic views aside we as an audience are able to experience strong leads from both genders and trust me in this review i try hard not to spoil the movie for you as i truly wish for you to experience the beauty that this film is its a film that has layers yet doesnt condo lude or go off point it steers you in a no holds bard adrenaline rush of visual spectacle and story commingled into one as the characters not only fight for their lives and freedom but also to maintain their grip on humanity we are not things this film is littered with memorable quotes an awe inspiring score and the camera work is spectacular i didnt go to film school but this is how i wish to one day make movies with all said and done and all bias tossed aside i give fury road 5 out of 5 stars,reality
this movie is just beyond my expectations so called the best movie of year 2015 george miller returns with a bang this time the story the presentations and the action is just mind blowingtotally impressed with the look and role of tom hardy as the stunts and action sequences are spectacular i have also meet one guy in the cinema who exactly dressedup like i was quite surprised to see him like this so for the remembrance i take picture with him the outfit was just perfect and he suggested me to buy the same from online store fjacketshis movie is great for anyone that wants to see a white knuckle wonderfully crafted and action based movie,reality
i left the cinema completely amazed by visual and acoustical masterpiece very impressive i was sitting in my car wondering where is the desert and charlize yet no so dark and scary as i expected george miller delivered one of the best action movies in the last 10 years comparable with nolans batman movies or bays transformers i this movie is a must for all action loving audience and this movie experience is worthy every penny so why only 7 starsi would love to give 10 of them but there are some weak sides of the movie 1 tom hardy as  i was disappointed by tom hardy in child 44 and the performance in just confirmed that mel gibson as was kind of crazy guy tom hardy is somehow teleported bane from batman 2 the bad guys  it is visually very attractive to watch the road battles however you are missing any scary or nasty part watching the bad guys eg compared to bane  joker in batman the different tribes could be described more precisely perhaps even showing their home bases 3 happy ending  i know there is always happy end however finding a new place for a quiet living somewhere at a seaside would be fine as well no need for greenpeace happy endingnevertheless go to a cinema and enjoy this action masterpiece,reality
so many bad reviews about brainless action movieso many people not seeing below the surfacefirst  the stupid plot is about reaching a world of green and life for the future its not complicated but doesnt make it stupidsecond  you have a protagonist who has stolen a valuable resource chased by gas war and provision monopolies if youre because shes a strong woman then you have issuesthird  is caught up in the plot exactlty the way he was caught up in the plot of the other films he is not the main character for the entire story just a player even in the first film he was just out for revenge in the second he joined a refugee camp in the third he stumbled into a childrens cultnow  look at the obstacles an apparently mutant leader starving his people for water his mentally impaired brotherson drinking mothers milk for sustainance his warboys brainwashed into a valhalla like belief in the afterlife islamchristianity  just sayin i dont want to dive deeper but this is not some stupid action filmthere is more going on here than on golden pond,reality
fury road comes racing at you like a steam train with nitro boosters from the get go you have action that thunders at you and there are few stops to take a deep breathtom hardy is our mostly reticent hero who seems to play second fiddle to the real heroine charlize theron as the pair get entangled to help a set of wives to escape to some hoped for land chasing them across the barren desert is the warlord husband with his masses of punk underlings ready to die for himyou get explosions smashes blood and bullets yet underneath is a story that is enjoyable the action and few moments of respite paint an interesting picture that makes for a story its very much a live graphic novel and it is actually a complete break from the norm of late thankfullyprobably the stand out is the settings beautiful cinematography wonderful scenery and well used lighting that makes is all a joy to watchthe only issue is that it can get heavy going and the action scenes so long it can get exhausting id have liked a few more respites and story but it still works well enoughsets up fine for a new set of movies and after this i believe most will be happy to see this successful rebirth of the franchise,reality
dear lord charlize theron is a fantastic actress its amazing what she can communicate with just her facial expressions and line delivery even when her dialogue is sparing and simplistic shes also a superb physical actress has great scene presence and is stunningly beautiful why not simply call this movie furiosa its really that characters story the titular says and does little that is plotrelevant he is a superfluous character who is here only to attract the fanbase for the original moviestheron is one of two things that fury road has going for it the other is pure spectacle i dont love this movie the way that everyone else seems to id give it a 7 out of 10 but i really did enjoy the action special effects costume prop and set design this is like a modern ben hur 1959 on acid  the characters weapons sets and vehicles look great this movie is like a really good heavy metal album cover made into a feature length filmmy attention wandered though the action is often difficult to follow thanks to too much michael baytype directing tom hardy is really just a onenote character as despite efforts to render him in depth with clich flashbacks of a lost family and i liked this guy a hell of a lot in the dark knight rises 2012 i thought he made the masked bane a great villain with physical acting that compensated well for an obscured facei submit that this is a somewhat brainless movie that barely qualifies as science fiction we have a sparse opening montage that tells us about worldending wars for resources and then the rest of the movie is really just an extended gladiator battle in the desert with baroquely costumed bad guys its like a monster truck rallyits sometimes fun but it doesnt make a great film the good guys are too thinly drawn to engender viewer sympathy the bad guys are too cartoonish to be scary you also need to turn your brain off lest certain questions occur to you1 doesnt gasoline degrade over time i dont think it would be worth warring or bartering for after a year or so unless there are oil rigs and complex refineries to seek and develop it we see evidence of neither2 what do people eat out here in the neverending desert the disappearance of green places is a plot point there is no arable land3 how often does this dictator big joe or something give his subjects water once per day i thought dehydration killed or immobilized people fairly quickly4 where the heck are we i hear a lot of united kingdom accents5 im pretty sure that blood transfusions dont work like that and even if they did youd see a hell of a lot of opportunistic infections in such unsterile conditions6 why does one young woman immediately fall in love with a sleeping barbarian whose teeth are spraypainted silverwhatever im not saying that this is a bad movie im just suggesting that its a little overrated given its current accolades by fans its fun enough if youre in the mood for a movie,reality
early on in fury road immortan joe hugh keaysbyrne the films gasmask huffing overlord dont call him bane 20 or you will have tom hardys permission to die jeers at his pitiful subjects not to become addicted to water as it will take hold of you and you will resent its absence the warning may as well have extended to the films audience to not get addicted to breathing george millers retread of his apocalyptic 80s asphalt nightmare is arguably even more bonkers than its predecessors bludgeoning viewers at such a gleefully manic pace that holding ones breath becomes as much the norm as the pounding sands of the films eternal desert the film undeniably is capitalm moviemaking at its most batsht as miller finally gifted with a 150 million budget orchestrates his apocalyptic feverdream with frantic energy and furious passion the film undeniably takes some acclimatizing to no time is wasted on extraneous exposition after a brief grim tom hardy voiceover the viewer is immediately thrust into a world of bonecrunching fight scenes demented and often deformed or otherwise grotesque  characters hooting and bellowing while attempting to kill one another constantly covered in sand accompanied by the inceptionontwelvecupsofcoffee soundtrack by tom holkenborg constantly blaring like a car horn from hell so absurdly fun that hearing it on cinema speakers is worth the admission price alone the prospect of spending nearly two hours in this world initially seems intolerable and this is all before anyone even starts a car nonetheless millers wild ride is one absolutely worth taking amidst the constant cacophony of overstimulation framing an almost cunningly simplistic plot drive that way then drive back miller has crafted a fascinatingly thought out society and allows discrete scraps of bloodbaths over water and oil feudal politics and ramshackle cultish spirituality to hit the viewer like bugs on a windshield and lest it seem the film had begun on too calm a note the insane momentum steadily picks up  chase upon chase upon explosive spears and flamethrowerguitars and concussive sandstorms and blood and screaming and swallowing silver spraypaint and drums drums drums until it finally quiets down perfectly timed to just avoid audience heart attacks all of a sudden were watching a different film quiet reflective poignant and gently desolate  a softly heartfelt interlude of a skeletal matriarchal society credited as consultant is eve ensler of vagina monologues fame of all people all of a sudden the contrast to the blaring first half of the film is striking this is whats at stake and worth the spectacularly named imperator furiosa charlize therons dash to flee the dystopic wasteland with immortan joes imprisoned sex slaves in tow there is so little beauty left the film suggests that the few dregs of it are worth fighting for worth giving anything for its an inspiring message which curiously enough even extends to its antagonists sadistic rapist overlord joe is genuinely devastated and grieves when one of his harem bearing his unborn child is killed in the chase giving his musclebound behemoth of a son nathan jones the chance to issue the most oddly sympathetic line in the film i had a baby brother and he was perfect in every way by the time the film ricochets to its even more haywire clialmost exclusively filmed with practical car chases and stunts and all the more aggressively thrilling for it it has earned its insanity on an almost primal level with the fate of the world feeling like it actually rests on one of the most insane car chases ever filmed tom hardy has always been at his best when punching things ferociously muttering like an unhinged maniac so its impossible to imagine a more perfect piece of casting as a postmel therons furiosa easily grabs the show by the horns not only perfectly essaying the quintessential badass but imbuing her with more aching emotion and raw talent than anyone would ever have expected out of a sequel the films most joyful scenes involve the two of them forming their uneasy alliance taking turns passing guns and the steering wheel back and forth as they clamber over one another in impeccably choreographed symmetry forced to collaborate not out of trust but more out of whos more likely to kill me first each of the quintet of wives  particularly rosie huntingtonwhiteley and zo kravitz  impress providing crucial doses of indignant humour courage and pathos alike even the normally grating nicholas hoult coughs up a compelling character his nux a teenage gollum desperate for validation like a kicked puppy becomes steadily more sympathetic and likable as he evidences the films most evident emotional arc in an age where too many audiences sneer at the cgibloated contemporary blockbuster fury road provides enough of a tangible cathartic glut of chaos and melodrama for even the most jaded to feel like theyve finally watched a movie again by the time the viewer is finally left with a moment to catch their breath they are caught between wanting to pass out as if theyve just spent hours at the gym or prepared to burst into a round of manic applause fury road is a gloriously committed budgetbloated bmovie that is more engrossing and infectiously fun that it has any right to be to paraphrase one of the films most bombastically emotional moments witness it8510,reality
this film was great birthday viewing in 2d on the huge hoyts xtreme screen  melbourne central then 2 weeks later in 3d on the huge 25m iscreen with friends  family the 3d sound  crisp visuals made for an exhilarating ride we saw the 2d version as some of our crew werent keen on iin 3d im just really glad its not fast  the furious in the outback as i first anticipated the film is jam packed with action sequences and real stunts with no cg a game changer hopefully where the big studios will follow suit  go back to the old days of making something spectacular with real sets real stunts real explosions also it wasnt overly laden with crappy dialog or cool sequences it plays out like a real apocalyptic survival of the fittest film another bonus was the focus on charlize theron as the female hero while tom hardys plays back seat to her really there is a strong focus on females from the start right to the end which i dont mind at all but the film is called so its still a bit of a mystery to me why the focus was taken on the location they shot in africa for the dessert scenes are amazing the costumes  the characters are all fascinating with so much detail cinematography by john seale and score from junkie xl are a perfect fit which paints a very distinct and bleak dystopia world that has as much intrigue as what george lucas has in star wars i wanted to know more about these different characters their background how this class order came to exist at first glance i could understand the feminist remarks  how plays a back seat but after thinking about it further i realize that its not as clean cut as that tom hardy especially in this film is like the man with no name from sergio leones westerns  akira kurosawas samurai films sanjuro  yojimbo  this character doesnt always play the front seat or the hero all the time hes more strategic than that choosing to play it like a game of chess letting others take the limelight  the action but he always played a key role in the decision making of where the story was gonna go  then played his part of making it happen i see charlize theron more as like joan of arc the female heroine among a male dominated society who is very courageous skilled  will go beyond to get to her goali read that if this film made money george would do 2 more considering it made 44m of the 150m budget in the opening weekend in the us alone its safe to say this will come to fruition which is a great thing  hope it goes on to be one of the most successful blockbusters in recent years so it shakes up the hollywood system on how things should be done  with realism no cheese with intensity  an actual storythis is a big screen experience that has to be witnessed dont download it dont wait for it to come out on dvd  bluray definitely dont watch it on your phone go see it  support something actually worth seeing at the cinemas you wont regret ithttpsamuellbronkotumblrcompost120008465792madfuryroad 2015georgemiller8910,reality
fury road is good the action is astonishing and at one point i just couldnt believe how insane what i was seeing was and you gotta love a gang that brings along its own guitar and drums accompaniment the use of real stunts over cgi was refreshing but i wish miller had resisted the temptation to monkey with the editing in post with all the digital ramp zooms and jagged editing and color saturationthe plot is so thin it could have been written on a napkin and some of the dialog is frankly embarrassing with therons redemption line being so drearily spot on i was hoping it was supposed to be ironic hardy is a fine actor but doesnt approach mel gibsons charisma in the role and miller has sidelined to a virtual supporting role alongside charlene therons ferocious furiousa characterwith the road warrior miller raised the stakes and brilliantly created a world gone wild with sublime action scenes  but some of the central dramatic core was sacrificed i like thunderdome but for its slower quieter second half with the lost children it again restored the balance with drama over action fury road is road warrior on steroids  bigger faster furiouser ahem this time there is virtually no drama  essentially some beaten up dude meeting an amazon who is leading her truckload of playboy bunnies away from an evil warlord repeat for 120 admittedly thrilling minutesi havent seen thunderdome since its original release 30 years so i will have to revisit it sometime for now fury road is a terrific action picture in a fine series  but also the least dramatically satisfying,reality
unfortunately at this current time i have not been able to indulge at pleasure of viewing the original work of george miller original trilogy though with the modern twist of fury road i can comment on my opinions are of this film not of the franchisefirstly i would like to bring to light the outshadowing of as we all know the character of is of course borderline insane i love the way miller has presented the audience with this information with hallucinations of what seems a family member and a quote he says something along the lines as hope leads people into insanity now we know a little snippet of i think we all expected him to be a silent bad ass like he was back in the original films as i have been told though it seems that imperator furiosa portrayed by charlize theron in a sense takes bad ass attribute though is still a hardened warrior and at best a veteran surviver its as though is playing a supporting character to furiosa however that is my opinion of the subjectone other aspect of the film that i would like to bring to light is that for the whole duration of analysing the film i felt that it was wholly just a massive chaotic car chase it is more than bearable however with dynamic shots and the sense of visual story telling there is much more at large than just distraction there is a real element of narrative told by action and emotion even if the dialogue is vague as a film student focusing on becoming a film editor i really devote most of my notes to the post production of the film and i must say that i am indeed impressed all of the transitions to different scenes are staggering especially the the sand storm scene not only is the colour correction utterly stunning with flashes of a deep blue but it is the end that captivates me the most as we reach the climatic end of the very action orientated scene the transition to the next scene is a slow burning flair reaching the end of its brightness and i love that to slow down the pace of the film a really good job there guys without giving away any spoilers of any sort this concludes my review of the fantastic fury road film i would highly recommend people of the action genre to see the film at an cinematic experience i know that i havent really focused upon acting skills and other aspects of the film i wanted to give a little taste of what the film has to offer so as a film maker myself i say to you fantastic people view this fantastic film i will leave the rest to you,reality

has a very simple maybe even laughable plot it is a typical guy takes his revenge movie it can be easily summarized as keanu gets pissed and shoots people in the face for 101 minutes but the thing is you actually can see it is really keanu who is doing it instead of shaky cameras and dozens of superfast cuts you can see kickass long takes which are amazingly choreographed since this is their first film the director duo has a few problems with storytelling but i am glad that they made me realize how much i miss watching an action movie and actually see whats going on,reality
the best way i can describe is to picture taken but instead of liam neeson its keanu reeves and instead of his daughter its his thats essentially the plot of the movie reeves is out to seek revenge on the people who took something he loved from him its a beautifully simple premise for an action movie  when action movies get convoluted they get bad ie a good day to die hard gives the viewers what they want awesome action stylish stunts kinetic chaos and a relatable hero to tie it all together succeeds in its simplicityas an action movie buff all i wanted to see in this movie is some inventive action sequences and i was not disappointed every single action sequence in this movie is fastpaced beautifully shot fluid intense and you never have trouble understanding whats going on the direction of this film is fantastic as is the writing theres no melodramatic soapy story lines  everything is straight and to the point and the point is to get to the action not one moment in this movie is boring the short dialogue is effective from getting to action sequence a to sequence b without any confusion as to any characters motive its all laid out in front of you  all you have to do is sit back and enjoy the insanity happening on screenremember when live free or die hard came out and people were upset that john mcclane only fired pistols throughout the entire movie i like a little versatility when it comes to action heroes and evidently so do the writers wrecks face with pistols assault rifles shotguns knives even manoamano the man can do anything the difference between and other modern action movies die hard 5 and taken 3 for instance is that you actually believe is killable hes not some invincible superhero like bruce willis was in die hard 5 having his car crash and flip like a hundred times and the second it stops he gets out without a scratch and starts running no takes a beating in this film numerous times in fact but most of the time hes kicking ass and taking names and instead of acting as some unstoppable killing machine he just seems like a guy whos an expert in his field he used to be a hitman after allis a blast to watch really its just a mindlessly fun action movie it has largescale shootouts cqc sequences and a classic herovillain handtohand confrontation at the end the only negative i can say about the movie is that the villains arent anything to write home about theyre russian mobsters which weve seen a million times and their leader isnt given enough to work with as far as character goes willam dafoe has a brief but important role though as former colleague regardless is all about the action and it goes above and beyond in every respect its a breath of fresh air after all the poor sequels weve been getting and thankfully has the potential to be the next great action franchise an absolute mustwatch for action fans,reality
it looks as if the filmmakers realized that the public was sick of certain movies most movies nowadays are full of wire work scifi etc often topped with icing made of needless or predictable background stories that add nothing for example the beautiful girlfriend who gives the moral speeches or the troubled teenage daughter who arent present herenothing of that is in adds hardly a story no character development no needless character or background no misplaced drama no misplaced humor and not too much eye candy nothing of that what offers is action action and more action in fact it is one long action scene with some lines and close ups added but that is not a problem the directors promise action and deliver while delivering they made it look good and convincing without trying to be more and theyre smart enough to give the movie a satisfying beginning and endingand for those who claim that keanu reeves is a horrible actor you are right but his blank expression is perfect for this movie leave the acting to the bad guys and the delicious guest part for willem dafoeif youre tired of movies with forced drama or loaded with cgi will be a pleasant wakeup call,reality
2014 is the best revenge flick from keanu reeves of 2014 from the matrix 1999 to 2014 another action fast paced entertaining slick action packed film which kind i have never seen before it is a very fun straightforward action movie with an 80s sensibility its nice to see keanu doing these types of roles again it is one of my personal favorite keanu reeves movies keanu reeves is a bad ass what a great action packed blood packed film movies should really learn from this on how to make a decent action film especially with the crap we are getting today like escape plan bullet to the head and such this film to me is the greatest action film to come out in this century keanu was phenomenal the action was so fast paced and exciting my jaw literally dropped as keanu took out all the bad guys i personally think this film is better then all taken films combined it was simply brilliant it was made for 20 million dollars and i am glad it made 40 million in the us i think this film deserved to make 100 millionold school action with no shaky cam definitely the best stuntmanturneddirectordebut ive ever seen the story is set about keanu reeves a retired assassin who gets dragged back into his field when the russian mob put a hit out on him but instead of killing john they steal his classic mustang and kill his newly acquired puppy this sets john out to exact revenge on the whole mob in a no nonsense kind of waymultiple shots to the chest and one to the head for good measure type of justice ive never seen a film where the gun play is this to the point and precise as this i dont know what the body count is but its gotta be up thereway up there ohand another thingthey actually reload the guns dont see that that often in films its got an all star cast of cameosmall roll characters from ian mcshane william dafoe and john leguizamo and i swear one of the bad guy henchman is that mayhem insurance guy one of the best movie that keanu reeves ever made from start to finish non stop action all scenes look very realistic  the best action movie of the year  i love this movie so much i think the people behind this movie made a great astonish action movie there are other things in the movie that i love so much i even think is so much better than 47 ronin 2013 that keanu reeves made the most that i love in this movie is adrianne palicki as ms perkins i think she did one of the best job portraying and playing the most memorable female assassin i have ever seen ms perkins made me realized and inspired me that there are a lot of women who choose occupation as a female assassin hired by the mob there were a lot of female actresses who played an assassin but i have never see any women portrayed like that adrianne palicki is a bad ass she even played lady jaye in the gi joe teams covert operations a specialist in the movie gi joe retaliation 2013 one of my favorite movies the fight sequence between and viggo tarasov is real and very realistic i did not see any cgi in it this wouldnt be an action movie without some action theres plenty of it and its perfectly done the the stunts are completely insane in scale there is a lot of gun play and powder even the guys reload guns there are even daniel bernhardt from bloodsport ii and the matrix reloaded in it and he was perfect in here and the fight scenes with keanu reeves were well done by him this is the first time in the movie i see willem dafoe been the good guy i havent seen him in decades playing the good guy since platoon 1986 my favorite vietnam war movie the last thing about the movie i want to say that was a lover and i love i love how he avenge the puppys death by mobsters who killed him and than he saved another puppy from the animal shelter when he was wounded he wasnt a superhero without any bruises on him he was wounded keanu reeves did a wonderful job better than he did in knock knock 2015 i only hope they want screwed up the sequel and making much better action movie than the first waswhen sadistic young thugs senselessly attack keanu reevesa brilliantly lethal exassassinthey have no idea theyve messed with the wrong guy with new york city as his bulletriddled playground embarks on a merciless rampage hunting down his adversaries with the skill and ruthlessness that made him an underworld legend that is the main plot the rating i am giving this movie is a 1010 because it deserves it,reality
keanu reeve is hes a deadly and unstoppable hitman and it shows is short and to the point but so much fun at 1 hour and 36 minutes running time there is never a dull moment in what may be one of the best action films of the year the film starts off quickly and never stops it doesnt spend too much time on the backstory or development of life yet it still succeeds so well in building up his character within the first 20 minutes is called out of retirement when three robbers break into his home steal his car and kill his even before the action begins though the film builds up so much suspense and gravity into who this is resulting in a satisfying and exhilarating moment when his enemies realize hes back in the game while the plot may be simple and straightforward it works sufficiently in setting up a situation where the rest of the greatness can happen  stylized and awesome fight sequences where goes through dozens and dozens of kills seeing this in digital imax really helped boost the mood of the film the intense sound design and visuals the slick fighting and choreography on screen theres this one scene in the film where assaults his way through a club and all those elements combined make it an absolutely incredible sequence to witness besides and his fighting the film does set up a very interesting world thanks to all the other little details and characters it brings in there is an organized system of those on the other side of the law operating and exchanging gold coins while staying at bases such as the continental hotel this definitely allows room for sequels and spinoffs still keanu reeves is the star of the show and this is the best i have seen him in quite awhile again the story is straightforward and audiences know what emotional journey to expect but keanu displays a good amount of range in his portrayal of that is still nice to see just like his character states im thinking hes back is an awesome and enjoyable action flick that i would recommend rating 810,reality
at first glance sounds like a terrible film on paper but with the slickness of keanu reeves performance as the titular character and the sheer brilliance in its action sequences this marks the best action film of the year and one of the absolute best in the past decade following a brutal home invasion that leaves his beloved murdered by thugs from his past vows revenge on the ones who have taken what he loves most like i said on paper this seems like a directtodvd slopfest starring john cena but as a film with keanu reeves as the lead it marks the very welcomed return for reeves to the genre is insanely fun violently brutal and an overall romp especially for those disappointed by the expendables 3 is propelled by tarantinoesque dialog mixed with the swagger of action stars from the 70s reeves literally emulates cool in this film and does it with such confidence that we dont even doubt the charactereven when he kills countless bad guys with extreme force in some utterly ridiculous and implausible situations we dont doubt it for a minute this is exactly what you want out of an action film it is briskly paced brilliantly shot and meticulously choreographed and keeps you wanting more and more the supporting cast filled with the likes of john legiuzamo ian mcshane and willen dafoe also keeps this film very interesting these guys dont play good guys hell by traditional standards would be a bad guy in any other film every character is more ruthless than the next and pushes to be more ruthless than they are creating a very cool dynamic between the character and the plot regarding the idea of how far is too far however dont expect some revelation from regarding the morality of bad and evil this film wants you entertained and does so with brute force it never lets up not even for a second one scene in particular that will have your blood pumping is a showdown between thugs and in a nightclub this action sequence remains the best in the film and will have you grasping your theater seat because of the sheer intensity of it overall is slick violent fun that turns into a remarkable surprising film that will catch you off guard it is that good i highly recommend this film to action buffs especially but im sure those who just like a good movie will love it as well,reality
lesson learned dont get on retired legendary hitman john bad side in the film of the same name he goes back into action shooting up bad guys in a city where it seems that the cops have all simultaneously taken a vacation played by surprisingly youthful quinquagenarian keanu reeves john style of shooting baddies is reminiscent of my days playing whacamole duck hunt or any of those arcade games with the plastic guns is a vengeant superman and this is the basis of the entire movie although he doesnt have a clear weakness that can be exploited like most heroes does get into enough trouble for the audience to be sincerely worried about him if youre planning on seeing because you like movies with clever or meaningful story lines then youre going to be disappointed if you are looking for raw well choreographed action and machismo then look no further house greyjoys alfie allen stands out as villainous russian mafia brat iosef tarasov and michael nyqvist girl with the dragon tattoo plays viggo his mob boss father adrianne palicki willem dafoe ian mcshane and dean winters round out a strong supporting cast overall i enjoyed as a pure action film it doesnt have a storyline like the matrix or speed but it was visually entertaining and the simplicity of the story allowed for appreciation of the action this movie is manly and primitive and proves that at the age of 50 keanu reeves can still mix it up as an action star,reality
had been out awhile and at first i had little interest in seeing it as for me keanu reeves is generally whatever the opposite of a selling point is however i kept hearing about how this was a bit of a throw back of an action movie and upon reading the connection between the director and keanu i thought i would have to put aside my preconceived notions and give this movie a shotthe movie had two exstunt men one of which was keanu reeves former stunt double helming this film this resulted in a lot of practical effects instead of heavy reliance on green screen also familiarity with reeves likely left the directors with a base knowledge with how far they could push the star this left the films action scenes clean realistic to the point and a hell of a lot of fun to watchif i was going to break down the films format well it is of the semigeneric punisher type ex bad ass comes out of retirement to take on other bad asses type variety it was 75 japanese yakuza film 20 film noir and 5 video game one stylistic element that jumped out at me right away was the choice to go with a narrow scope of field for focus at first i thought maybe this was the projector in the theater but then i realized it was a choice made for the film normally this would annoy me slightly and i suppose still did as i am a big fan of depth of field miseenscnes set ups citizen kane is one of my favorite films i came to terms with the stylistic choice made for this film as it reminded me so much of eastern influences in this case it was reminiscent of zen ink and brush compositions where the sharpness lies in where the brush first touches down and the edges disappear into an almost mist like effectwhile keanu sold the action pieces well he wasnt asked to do too much to stretch his stoic emotional range which is just what the film required he was pretty much perfect for this part if i had been for some reason been asked to recast this film i would be hard pressed to find a better fit this would have been right up jason stathams alley however there is nothing more he could have added to it there was something quietly instance about reeves that made you feel that he was one not to be trifled with statham will always remind me of the character he played in snatch which was not at all overly menacing or intimidating rather if i had my choice of an alternative i would delve further into the japanese gangster genre and extract chow yunfat reeves was 49 in this film and still convincing as an ass kicker chow yunfat would have been ten years older but that would have further added to the realism of a retired hit man that is unwillingly dragged back into the businessspeaking of performances this film was full of great character actors from the action genre and otherwise one of these performances that i was not overly fond of was that of alfie allen you probably know him as the dickless theon greyjoy he worked in the part in that he was highly unlikable however i was not sure which accent he was trying to commit to this brings me to another flaw of the film many of the baddies simply did not measure up to be worthy of the challenge a spoiled brat son of a crime boss nor the crime boss himself an old man that the film gave no hint as to any physical prowess until the anticlimactic final battle gave any feeling that the fight would go any other direction except to a single minded killing strokei highly recommend this film if you are a fan of good action this easily ranks as one of the pure action movies of 2014 judged as just a movie it is simple in story structure but what it does it does very wellblarv score out of 10 88,reality
the only word that keeps coming back to mind when reviewing this movie is exhilarating the fun factor this amazing action film has is probably the highest of any movie this year i could not stop myself from having a blastfirst and foremost being also the first thing you notice is selfconscious of what it is and doesnt for not even one second take itself more seriously than it should fortunately this doesnt shut out the place for character connection and empathy people often think the two of these things exclude themselves but that is not what i think and this movie is proof of it it has such a genuine sense of fun and humor so much so that you are often laughing with not at the movie at the preposterousness of everything and at the same time feeling genuine tension for the characters youre rooting for i know it sounds ridiculous but every single fing kill by feels exciting and liberating it was incredible how much i was rooting for him to this contributes some stunning fastandfurious level action scenes that benefit amazingly by the practicality involved hats off to the director and the special effects guys for staging such a flawless string of adrenalinepumping scenes in particular to the director for the highly energetically stylish direction that never feels as a gimmick or out of place yet instead makes everything all the more enjoyable furthermore this is one of the few movies in which sound actually stood out and contributed in making the film a great success keanu reeves is perfect for the role and brings to the screen so much charisma i could not help but root for the guy he is surrounded by a great cast too that has very fun moments on their own if all of this wasnt enough has some great original ideas and plays with them in the best way possibledespite having a blast in the theater and wanting to maybe see this movie again in a year or so it isnt original stylish or innovative enough to say weve seen this plot before but not quite done this way yes it has its brilliance but it is kind of cheesy even if in a good way and predictable it doesnt rank up to a higher standard of action movie because of its straightforwardness it does have some stakes but all in all there isnt really an overwhelming set piece or twist that makes it highly remarkableobviously that is not what its aiming for and because of that i could recommend this movie to anybody just go and have the best action entertainment fun in the theater,reality
is something special it takes as much time setting up elaborate action sequences as it does the world with which it all takes place in and what a world it is it reminds me of millers crossing and it is cooler than any other recent attempt at noir we are shown a criminal underworld where if you are connected many powerful people know who you are and show you respect was connected but he got out he is the rare killer who has found peace and he is grateful for that peace some young kids steal that from him and he does what he does best he wages a one man war against the russian mafia it might sound like the film takes quite a leap but it all makes sense the motives of john and the people who get in the way of his bullets are all very clear even if it does come across as rather simple thats the plot at its most basic then theres the action the film is directed by reeves stuntman from the matrix so this guy knows action there are sequences that flow so smoothly it puts other action films and their quick cuts to shame keaunu moves so fluidly throughout the film and comes across as such a natural that the only disappointment is that we have not seen him like this before along the way are plenty of character actors fans of the matrix and the wire will recognize a few people then there are more obvious ones like ian mcshane and willem dafoe everyone seems to be having a good time that is another plus for this movie it gets dark at times but overall it is quite fun not very chipper but fun i cannot recommend this movie enough i believe it is a must see for action fans and for anyone looking for something a bit different from the usual fare,reality
its pretty much a comic book the universe step up from the matrix minimal cg which was cool its over the top because thats what it was going for,reality
he never misses he is literally unstoppable hes got a particular set of skills that would make liam neeson look like a catholic priest did i mention he shoots a priest in the leg this action movie was perfect is it in the realm of the best subjective movies of all time godfather shawshank or the dark knight well no but in terms of the genre its self im giving it a perfect 5 out of 5 stars hell continuity was even good the dialog was sound and had moments of humor at every beat and keanu actually shows some range yeah you heard that right raaaaange not only that mr even takes time to reload again everything just worked perfectly with this movie i dont have anything to nitpick the supporting cast was even good this is a perfect fun action movie dammit i gotta see this again remember children when the boogie man goes to sleep he checks under his bed for john  ,reality
this was the last time i watched a movie based on imdb ratings seriously if you are 15 years old  you may watch this pile of otherwise acting sucks gangsters are brainless idiots plot is terrible russian language hollywood can you at least once hire ok russianspeaking people hellooo just a few notable momentsis a killer ghost man he can kill three man armed only with a pencil but somehow manages to overlook a couple of brainless thugs hack into his house lets them beat the crap out of himself kill his and steal his car wowis so famous that even the policeman the bartenders the mafia all the town knew him but the son of a mafia boss for some reason did not even hear about him is very skillful  he managed to do impossible task he can head shot everyone in the dark but then he somehow manages to miss five times in a row at iosef incredibleis a ruthless killer he wants to kill everyone but when he encounters a female assassin he decides to leave her alive how touchingviggo mafia boss hires most professional killers and puts 4 million bounty on johns head but when he captures him he decides to play a little bit and leaves him with only two imbecile guards seriously if you have more than a couple of brain cells do yourself a favor and do not waste time and money on this garbage,reality
based on the reviews i read in here i was expecting much more from this movie yes the movie is action packed but very much over done certainly not a quality movie by any means with a weak story line it was like being in an action game where the lead had unlimited liveshe is invincible no matter how many times he is shot there are assumptions that we will understand the rules of the committee but these are never explained and we are left with very few answers the end in light of the over the top and often excessive violence and killings i must say keanu reeves performance is the only highlight of the film overall however a very weak story with unnecessary and excessive violence and a plot that is more suited for a playstation game,reality
my only guide to this movie was imdb ratings which im sorry to say but are either being used only by people with very low standards for movies or are somehow riggedim giving it 3 stars for whatever little entertainment value it hadmovie begins by showing a regular guy spending good time with his girl friend but he is not really a regular guy he is a legendary baddie who criminals tell each other about as their bed time horror stories mafia is so scared of him they call him the boogeyman yet armed burglars get inside his house and take him by surprise without any resistance from himbut wait he is a ghost a shadowman  yet when he doesnt have a gun he might as well put on a tshirt that says piata because even lamers are beating the crap out of him all the timebut wait he is fast he is ruthless and he is on a revenge mission  yet rivals keep slipping out of his hands he cant shoot anything unless the target somehow presents itself two feet from his pistol and he needs to be continually rescued by his only true friend who our hero doesnt give a damn abouti think what failed this movie for me was the script period,reality
wow what a great surprise this was i was told by a friend this was good but its been awhile since i liked a keanu movie so i was hesitant to try it retired hitman keanu reeves loses his wife to cancer after her funeral he receives a puppy she left him a few days later some thugs led by the son of a russian gangster john used to work for break into johns house they beat him up take the keys to his beloved car and kill the puppy they did this not knowing who he was they just wanted the car now is out for revenge and the russian gangster is trying to save his sons life by sending killers after johnkeanus great here glad to see him doing something watchable again willem dafoe alfie allen ian mcshane and lance reddick lead a good supporting cast michael nyqvist was made to play villains even adrianne palicki was good oh and hey the beatup guy from the allstate commercials is in this the stuff with the hotel for assassins and the way they all know each other was pretty funny about the only problem i had with it was the unrealistic scene where the bad guy finally gets the upper hand on the hero and doesnt kill him this sort of thing is common in movies but its always unbelievable and reminds me of the old james bond villains this is easily the best action movie this year possibly the best straight action movie since the first taken englishspeaking action movies that is it doesnt reinvent the genre or anything but its entertaining,reality
i thought this was one of the worst films of alltime i only went to see it because it had an 83 rating on imdb wow it is still rated over 80 as we speak holy crapamole batman this film was boring lacked any character depth and wasnt amusing or visually interesting i have literally never been so shocked at the poor quality of a movie script or character developmentwow this is the worst film ive seen in many many years and ill tell you it boggles my mind that most of you found it enjoyable just boggles my fracking mindand here is my tenth and final line so that i can post this review which most people will dislike but a few random souls will agree with passionately,reality
i do not know what a lot of you others are drinking before you watched this attempt at a film but i will not be imbibing thats for sure there are comments in some of the reviews here that this will be a new cult film that it is the best action film of the year etc etc etc sorry but fail is the only word that comes to mind the gratuitous and total violence is just pathetic and i might say a serious low point in american culture keanu has returned from what he looks like a very sad has been actor forced to not act so that the film maker can get his rocks off on this masturbation or a movie i hope that the directors and producers of this garbage are duly banned from ever making another attempt seriously people if you liked this film then you need to seriously look in the mirror i mean really if the mirror dont crack then just be thankful if i had to find just one redeeming factor i would be very hard pressed ok  i liked the little yuk,reality
is one of those few movies a year that seemed like it would be absolutely terrible but when you finally sit down and watch it turns out to be incredible not only is it one of the most fun films of the year but its so much different than the action films we have today it doesnt try to be inventive or overthetop it just plays to its strengthsi have never been a huge fan of keanu reeves even in the matrix which is a great film his acting falls pretty flat to me he hasnt showed me anything that can make him a true thespian on screen but as hes perfect the role doesnt call for anything more than just being a likable bada is a man dealing with the death of his wife and retirement of his past associations with assassins of sort he finally feels like he gets closure with his wife and then its all ripped away from him by the very gangsters he was once affiliated with he goes on an absolute killing rampage to say the body count adds up is an understatement goes to great lengths to find the people who took everything from him but its not exactly easy for him being someone who just came out of retirement means you may be a little rusty well is definitely that thats one of the many things i appreciated about this film it never seemed like he was blowing through these guys without danger sure he effortlessly kills plenty but he also struggles with a few as wellkilling a cute little would tick off anyone so i dont blame the character for being mad but im not sure there needed to be this many deaths there are plenty of innocent security guards who die at the hands of at times it just felt like a little too much for a revenge film but i really loved all of johns interactions with people from his past they all seem to be as surprised that is killing again as we are that this film turned out to be good i thought it was a nice touch that the police officer simply let the fact that there were a bunch of dead people in apartment go alfie allen plays the main villain and it seemed as though his storyline is very similar to that of game of thrones hes constantly underappreciated and so he wants to prove himself but ends up doing something terribly stupid it was also nice to see bridget regan from agent carter briefly pop upbut besides the fact that the script was pretty weak and the body count was pretty high the film is just awesome the drive sounding music and score to go along with the breathtaking action sequences made for one helluva ride keanu reeves should stick to these less demanding and fun action roles just dont try and do too muchstunts  action scoresoundtrack reeves makes it believablevillains arent stupid body count weak script 8410,reality
first of all there are obviously two versions of this movie as reviews sway from top notch straight to low bottom deadly missing the golden average i watched the second version the movie exploits the idea of bad russians and how they are put in place by a retired hitman the plot is extremely straightforward and would be easily fit for a video or a computer game without any changes there are no intriguing twists or any interesting supporting characters humour is absent completely but for one small joke plenty of music which has good tempo but a bit loud as if moviemakers tried to compensate for bland taste with high decibels the mobsters are very well portrayed as degenerate halfwits with very basic vocabulary making one to think that they really should be put in prison for mentallychallenged rather than brutally shotup quite frequently right in their silly heads speaking of which  shooting scenes are reasonably well orchestrated but when it comes to hand combat for some reason characters would forget karate jiujitsu kungfu etc and instead resort to classic wrestling which looks comical to me allinall i caught myself looking at the watch anticipating when the digits 2300oo appear thats how interesting this movie was and i do not understand why keanu reeves walked into this one futher text may contain spoilersjust one thing  all killersassassins in the state of new york know each other very well the do not hide under false names in some forsaken motelsbungalows no they live large and judging by for years have been reelected as local hitman of the year they also have this secret hideout that happens to be a luxury hotel with all the perks except a swimming pool on the rooftop coming next year and they use this secret currency in a form of special coins goodbye us dollar that are so unique that no one can churn out a thousand of them per hour using basic stamping machinery and ruin their fragile assassin economy yeah on top of everything police fbi cia and even nsa now without mr snowden but still running strong have no idea what is going on under their noses in the middle of new york this was the moment the movie turned from bad action into bad comedy for me,reality
i know it is too late to warn you not to go see this movie but still i am writing this review to express my disappointment and to say i have no idea why this movie can be rate 7 here there must be something wrongi am a big fan of keanu and i do not mind action movie with simple plot as long as it looks cool nevertheless i was brought down big time the plot is unbelievably ridiculous it will leave you amazed wondering if whether someone proread the script before they made it a movie no twist no surprise no character development nothing thrilling or exciting whatsoever it is utter boredom i felt intelligently insulted to be honest and the action does not look cool either seriously if you expect something like lets say taken you will be massively disappointed does not really fight he shots randomly move randomly and grunts and moans nothing else everything cool about him is what you heard the others say before the fighting startsi hope this review can actually reach someone and help to stop them from wasting their time watching this movie i genuinely do,reality
what a great movie this movie is a nonstop fun rollercoaster ride i love keanu reeves he is perfect in this film this is the type of movie people will see over and over again waited in a long line to see it but it was well worth it amazing special effects great acting great everything best movie i have seen all year keanu reeves is back after a long break and he is better than ever this is like a combination of speed and the matrix combined directors leitch and stahelski have created a beautiful looking action picture one that is large enough to deserve the imax experienceis the real deal it is a amazing action picture filled with strong performances by a cast along with superb action setpieces and a genuinely interesting world to boot reeves commands the screen and reminds us why he is still a genuine movie star,reality
this is one of those movies that makes you get out of the theater and you want to kick someone its full of action no excessive drama no background history asides from the fact that everyone has to be scared of just by pronouncing his name just like the boogieman keanu reeves is perfect for this role no expressions no feelings just a couple of lines and shooting a lot of bullets very precisely by the way the real acting is on the hands of willem dafoe sort of alfie allen is kind of on the same role as the one in game of throne sorry but i have to say it i watched him and cant stand thinking about how hes useless here toofor an action movie i really like this one and im thinking whos better or maybe bryan mills,reality
interesting action movie what i really liked about it is that lack or normal exaggerations in the movie continuity john does not shoot 100 bullets from a handgun without reloading he does not fight for 20 minutes with the bad guy at the end and he does not have superhuman powers like flying through windows dodge bullets or fall from 50 meters without repercussions yes its a bit brutal 90 of the guys get shot in the head but its exactly what i would expect in real life if a person like would really exist and would go rogue besides that some clichs some cars miraculously exploding i think the only thing which was really amateurish made in the script and the normal lack of story in a bangbangshootdontlook movie but at least goes after the bad guys for killing his not the woman he loved like in most of the others overall 910 to watch 410 to watch again,reality
no major spoilers if you like the action genre done well watch vehicles flying around at high speeds great gun play and kungfoo stuff this is an action movie yes a very violent one and done wellits been a few years since we have had a well made action movie for a mature audience that could warrant being a new trilogy unlike the expendables this one is it but if it dose not happen its sure to be a singular cult classic especially with its refusal to be a shoot em up style of show but a shoot em in the face style of show as well that one of the main plot features put simply is that is seeking out vengeance because of the murder of his puppy any way no more info watch and enjoy,reality
whether or not you are going to enjoy this movie depends entirely on what it is you hope to get out of it i fear for many it has been overhyped or just the high rating on the page leads folks to expect more than the movie is actually trying to sell what its selling is extremely well done action and if youre content with just that then it will deliver in spadeskeanu reeves plays the retired superhitman hes pulled back into the world he left behind when the arrogant and ignorant son of a mob boss roughs him up for kicks its a little more personal than that but i dont want to spoil it this sends john on a rampage through an underground world of mafia figures and hired killers it really is that simplewhile the plot is as bare bones as it gets theres a surprisingly deep world being built its a world in which there is a hotel specifically set up for hired killers to whole up in while theyre on the job its a world where a body clean up crew is just a phone call away its a stylized world to be sure but its an intriguing one as well it also helps that its populated by some recognizable faces just the casting of folks like ian mcshane willem dafoe and john leguizamo turns what are fairly thin characters into something that works many of the actors bring a certain caliber just by their presence that makes this world workbut really youre here for the action and its stellar firstly there are wonderfully long takes no rapid cut trickery here you know exactly whats going on and where everything is and i personally love the fighting style that john uses while he appears to be a decent shot his tactic is to get in close and then pump his target full of bullets its actually been a long standing pet peeve of mine that in so many action movies the bad guys especially henchmen go down with a single bullet to some unspecified part of the body is a professional and he takes no chances even one of the innumerable body guards is going to get three shots to the gut and two to the head just so john can be certain that he doesnt have to deal with that person again its fast its efficient and its thrillingthe film loses a little big of steam towards the end the natural climax of the film happens with about 20 minutes left to go and the final action scene isnt as thrilling or as poignant as it wants to be that said its not a deal breaker and the action scenes that come before the climax more than make it worth going through the slightly weaker ending,reality
2014 has not been the best year for movies there are many movies like this one shoot em up type of things the expendables was one of them and from the previous 2 films this one did not excite all 3 of them in my opinion are terrible many of these types of movies are terrible with the plot being too clich or unable to make sense with or it is too unrealistic this movie was much differentwhen i first saw the trailer i was happy to see keanu reeves back for he had not come out with many things since the matrix then i realized what the movie consisted of and my emotions changed quick i went to the theater hoping it was at least better than the expendables or any other movie that is like that but it was entirely different the plot i admit was clich and the fact that could kill that many people and survive is a little ridiculous but the movie is very enjoyable the actions scenes are amazing and very fun to watch keanu reeves is perfect for this role and this is probably going to be a reboot to his career he does not disappoint in this movie in fact this is in my opinion his best acted movie if this movie didnt have good acting in it it would not be as good there are some flaws to the movie as in any other but i can honestly say that this is one of my favorite movies of the year this film is rated r and for a reason there are an occasional f bomb and no sexual themes in it the movie is rated r for violence there is some blood spray when people are being shot or from being beaten there are also some mature thematic material in the movie involving the death of his wife due to i believe is cancer or some other disease and the brutal murdering of his that was given to him by his wife now take note that the movie revolves around the and john getting revenge on the people who killed it i would strongly recommend not showing this movie to anyone under the age of 14overall this movie is excellent it doesnt take much thinking to watch but definitely excites if you love movies get it on bluray 910,reality
this movie was excellent there are a lot of new faces in this movie which would make me feel its low budget but the actors have all put their best in to this film and you can see iton screen i have seen so many films that just dont capture the viewers eye this movie keeps the viewer glued to the screen in till the end it also ends of a cliffhanger which i always find is best keanu was a great choice for this role he plays a hitman with ease but there is always a little spark which he puts into his acting which makes him stand out from the crowdall in all 9 out of 10 by far better than any other action movie of the past 2 years,reality
it is b level action movie you can easily remind of other movies like this equillibrium district 13 the transpoter and many other action movies with handsome heroic guy keanu fights usually with guns in this movie but it brings more body action into the shooting scenes so it becomes more stylish great to watch it at home not boring at all if you dont expect something like 007 series with daniel craig or born series keanu kept his face and body almost perfect so he is still handsome and fit good enough for the film like this but the enemies have less impression they are fine but not new bit similar to villains from 90s action movies i recommend this movie if you are looking for something easy and fun and youve already watched every other great action movies like born ultimatium or 007 casino royal,reality
this movie is a huge joke ive never seen anything so ridiculous in my life its even worse than runnning scared keanu goes around and kills everyone like hes god incarnate i mean in the professional at least jean reno kills them in a very believable fashion except when he shoots the cops from the ceiling of the room i mean in this movie nothing is believable 30 of the people get head shotted while moving thats just retarded and nobody can headshot nobody can even shoot him in the arm hands leg or feet in the beginning they send a commando squad to his house like 10 people they are getting killed one by one or two by two i mean thats so retarded even if these guys dont know what they are up against the fact that ten of them are ordered to kill one guy would tell them they are up against someone good i mean john just kills them one by one and headshots them like its nothing i mean i can just fire blindly while hes fighting 2 of my buddies and get at least a shot on him then ill just empty the clip into him or go in and empty it into his head theres a scene where the boss leaves 2 goons to take care of who was hand cuffed after seeing like 50 of their fellow goons headshoted you figure they wouldnt leave much to chance but no they decide to suffocate him to death with a plastic baggie they hardly even tortured him before doing it and they exposed themselves to open windows i wouldve just put 3 shots into his head johns friend violated the code by helping him when he said hes gonna kill him and he was ratted out by a female assassin but that earned her death wtf what did she do wrong johns friend violated the code why cant he be ratted out i dont even know why the directed bother to give the bad guys a chance why dont they just bring back neo and keanu can just off them all with his mind and the movie will be 5 seconds long oh by the way keanu cant act i can grab any random people on the street and chances are theyll be at least as good,reality
one of the best action film it keep you eyes focused on screen the whole time i was amazed by the sequence and story line perfect movie to watch on holidays and with familythe hotel rules were amazing and the code word use for body disposable service was greatthis movie is really good action in itthere is a underworld mafiacontract killers people work for gold coin instead for case recommended to friends yes action 810 storyline 810 acting 810,reality
there is a scene in  the new shootemup starring keanu reeves  in which the hero is about to be interrogated by the bad guys in true jack bauer fashion viggo tarasov the sinister russian crime boss and former employer  played by michael nyqvist  takes the moment to sermonize people dont change he says to times do keanu reeves used to be one of the biggest stars in hollywood following the success of the matrix but afterwards he never recaptured that superstar persona despite his attempts at kitschy roles like the ones he played in 47 ronin or constantine but viggo was right people dont change and this film signals keanu reeves return to the role of asskicking leading man that we first experienced in speed and loved in the matrix and time has tempered him into a stronger and grittier actionstar than he was 15 years ago reeves character is one that we all know the veteran hit man who is reluctantly pulled back into his past life to bloodily take revenge on all those whove wronged him this film is essentially an assassin film with a fresh coat of paint but although its been done to death i never had a chance to get bored as the gripping pace and beautiful cinematography will keep you investedjohns wife dies earlyon but from cancer not bullets is initially a grieving husband and reeves emotionless stare is actually put to good use the only company he keeps is a small puppy  his wifes last gift to him when russian criminals follow him home one day to steal his car  a sleek 69 mustang  the is viciously silenced as lay stunned on the groundthe men were members of the russian crime syndicate led by viggos hotheaded son iosef alfie allen thinking an ordinary man but he was actually a hit man for viggo before he retired and was so successful that he was nicknamed baba yaga or the boogeyman the storybook embodiment of vengeance that punishes those who misbehave like the storybook character is an unstoppable force of nature and the film follows him from gunfight to gunfight chasing iosef and gunning down subordinates while the russians try to escapethis is an astonishing film for a directorial debut david leich and chad stahelski are both prolific stunt men  and they know how to film an action scene the choreography strikes just the right balance between acrobatics and brutality with scenes that smacked of 2006s casino royale when the dapper bond was reinvigorated with the frenetic energy of an action hero the film may appeal more to that side of you that claps and squeals excitedly at explosions and loud noises but there is enough character and personality here to justify a brief excursion into the land of campy blockbusters mentor marcus is played by a grizzled willem dafoe and the owner of the continental hotel  an establishment that caters specifically to hit men  is played by ian mcshane even john leguizamo puts in an intense yet brief performance as aureilo the owner of a chopshop where the russians take car everyone works for the russians so when returns to the biz to exact his revenge everyone knows him and continually ask him if hes back its funny and the running dialogue refers to not only but also to reeves and it must be said that whatever the film lacks in depth it makes up for in coolnessdrives not just one sexy muscle car but three he alternates between wearing the rebel without a cause leathertshirt combo and the tailored suits of a professional killer the music also alternates between groovy guitar riffs with rock overtones to deafening dance music with pounding pacesetting percussion and the fisticuffs on display will have home viewers pausing and rewinding often to catch every crunch twist and snap this is a film to be seen in imax late in the film escapes one hairraising situation with a shower of bullets and attitude spoilers i know and is once again asked by a former associate if hes back in the game while he stands covered in gore and glory yeah he says im thinking im backwell mr reeves i think so too welcome back,reality
i think part of the reason that i enjoyed this movie so much was that yesterday i watched taken 3 that action movie was such a steaming pile of ineptitude that it makes look like shakespeare in comparisonhas its faults believability being the obvious one but it believes in itself just enough to carry it off and not descend into farce though it skirts that point very closely at timesone of the big draws for me here was the fight choreography plenty of thought went in to the extended action sequences and there was some imaginative use of the surroundings add to the fact that the shots are held long enough to let you see what is going on and the action is thoroughly enjoyablethere is plenty of violence and plenty of blood though not overly graphic or gratuitous it doesnt shy away from it either there are bodies and blood galore after every shoot outit is difficult to describe the level of the action here but the thing it most closely reminded me of was the gun kata motif from equilibrium if you liked that movie then the general flow from one target to the next that performs here will be immediately familiarstorywise it is a simple revenge tale and the reasons for the warpath mentality of are spelled out in the first twenty minutes or so after that it is all action pretty muchif the action had been done badly a la the aforementioned taken 3 or the fights hadnt been interesting then this would have been a tedious borefest but thankfully all is well in that department and as a result the movie is enjoyable repeat viewing maybe not so much but i can think of many worse movies to sit through a second timesummary imaginative fight scenes elevate this above many similar action movies simple plot and larger than life characters well worth a watch and can probably be considered as hollywoods answer to movies like the raid,reality
i got to go to a press screening last night the movie is brilliantly paced with fantastic nonshaky cam action that all feels fresh new innovative and unique had the theater gasping through each action set piece the main character despite his unique skill set is very relatable keanu was at the top of his game and the director used keanus strengths and didnt bring up any weaknesses also dont watch any more than the first trailer because i thought it spoiled a major part of the first act minor spoiler alert but was mentioned in the trailer so it shouldnt be a spoiler the fate of his is revealed and would be better not knowing it going into the first act of the film the supporting cast was great except whenever i saw the state farm guy mayhem it took me out of the movie a little bit but the film brings me right back in i cant wait to see this again it doesnt necessarily need to be seen in theaters but any movie is better in the theaters the most surprising thing about the movie is how funny it is i found myself grinning and laughing along with the rest of the theater throughout yet it doesnt drown out the intense drama that is the sturdy shell holding the movie together smoothly the world that was set up was done perfectly and even though i dont want a sequel i would definitely see one either set in same universe or continuing the story arch from this movie however the movie does stand on its own two feet as one that has a conclusive ending the only flaw i found leaving the movie was that the dialogue at the end was a bit muffled but this was a test screening so im sure that will be fixed by the time the movie is released so for that i give this movie a 9510 and recommend this to pretty much anyone with a like of action movies yes even if youre female you will still enjoy this movie at least for the first 2 acts,reality
gone are the days when you could trust the internet ratings on rottentomatoes imdb hell even wikipedia entry is so wrong about its reception and critical acclaimthis is one of the worst movies ever its a shame imdb ratings movies like these will keep coming out and rigged ratings will keep earning them money hollywood is losing it do yourself a favor and do not watch this garbage the positive reviews on this website are so clearly made up by the possible stakeholders maybe the producers nowadays are hiring marketing teams whose jobs are to make multiple ids and post as much positive reviews and ratings on sites like these to fool the public and guess what it sells some of the positive reviews are so clearly typed by the same fingers it is a shame,reality
keanu reeves gives us the best baction flick in the longest dont even know the last time i saw a movie like this on the big screen feels like a straightto video type of film reeves plays john a grieving widower who days after burying his ill wife gets carjacked by russians who kill his a gift from his dying wife this was the event that spark what would be ninety mins of non stop mindless action ironically reeves does a great acting performance as a man focus on nothing but vengeance and he gets it with the best gun play and violence the western cinema could possibly give us but i expected noting less from the actor who directed the man of tai chi just a year ago his love of asian action films is reflected in this picture keanu is no chow young fat but hes an impressive runner up with this filmthe movie had a similar quality to denzel washingtons the equalizer but since ted theodore logan does not have the acting chops of the great denzil the movie has to rely on choreographic style something that keanu has been good at since the matrix the action flowed like neo was fred astaireit was an action spectacular filled with guns fights car chases hot girls like adrianne palicki as a hot girl with a gun  dont wait for it to come on video see it on the big screen,reality
onedimensional story check onedimensional characters check terrible dialogue check bad acting check uninspired action scenes checki checked imdb before watching this people talking about how this is going to be a new cult classic or the revival of keanu wtf are you people on crack or something it was terrible from start to finish this movie is all about the action and even that feels completely generic and uninspired the dialogue is just plain painful to watch i actually felt shame for the people acting on screen the story what story its virtually nonexistent every random person you find on the street can write something better than thisthe only thing going for this movie is keanu looks cool even when his acting sucks,reality
this movie has some of the best quotes i have heard since a tarantino movie a past assassin who tries out a new life of marriage and bliss when he looses his wife and someone kills his only thing given to him from his wife before she died he has to dip his feet back in the pond of chaos and ends up taking out the whole russian gang of new jersey to kill the bastard son and everyone infected with the curse of being related or working for the kids father who is the russian mob boss of new jersey great acting great actors and i noticed keanu is doing a lot of his own stunt work in this movie and had to do a lot of close combat training for this movie and future movies to come i seen he stars in knock knock a recent sun dance movie just released but akira is the movie i am waiting to see him in this movie is great and keeps on you on the edge of your seat watch it to find out if he gets revenge for the person who took everything from him after he lost the only thing that mattered in his new good life,reality
keanu reeves always comes back with a little gem but this one is his best film in agesits a pure kill film nothing more and nothing less keanu as has the only two things he has left in this world taken from him at a time when he has nothing left to live for and so entirely understandably he decides to take revenge keanu then proceeds to kill a significant amount of peopleheres what i liked about clearly whoever was in charge really loves film andor knows exactly how to improve upon every mediocre revenge film out there the clichd bits seemed almost deliberate like a teacher showing his or her film students how to make a tired and overdone scene interesting and uniquei wont expand too much on this point other than to say that there is something engaging about every scene no matter how often it has been done beforewhat i really want to talk about is the fight scenes this is the first time since the bourne films that i feel someone has done something different and unique with fight choreography all the fights seemed to be filmed in one take and without stunt doubles there was one extended fight scene in particular in the middle which was stunning i genuinely cant think of another actor who would have pulled off keanus character and choreography as well as he didduring the inevitable sitdown with the bad guy and his men they missed an opportunity to mirror a previous scene with a captured female assassin nevertheless keanu gets an opportunity to really let go and bring some much needed emotion to his character i thought he could have gone further and this could have been more poignant but he delivered the scene really welli think its time to officially acknowledge a new genre of film the kill film i wouldnt label it as action because i expect action films to include action as part of the main story not the other way around if you want to watch a good revengekill film this is definitely the one910,reality
this is my first review and probably to you will not be see something like you have seen before or it mighti would like to begin with saying that im quite a fan of this kind of movies where one guy kills loads of other guys but this movie is special its little bit different because this guy doesnt kill because he feels like it or something he has a reason and he is determined to fulfill what he is about to and he will not give up my personal vote is 9 because ive seen few errors in the film not about plot just something they missed to finish few times plot in this film is easy to understand and i really enjoyed it the more i watched the more tempting film got i wish it was a bit longer but still im satisfied with thisi think keanu reeves has fit the role really well and looked as a great assassin i have to say on some parts he looked insane but i understood it because they have killed his after alli warmly recommend this film to everyone if you think its too violent well from my perspective there is no such thing as too violent nowadays i really liked the film so i think everybody who likes actions or at least keanu reeves a little bit would like this movie,reality
as an animal lover especially for this movie is satisfying this movie is just epic,reality
put your brain on hold and just sit back and relax for an hour and forty five minutes while keanu reaves finds a multitude of ways to kill many nasty people the story is silly but the action is continuous as is pursued throughout by men and women with bad intentions he is a karate expert and is also skilled with a variety of knives and firearms which are quite useful to our hero his background is sketchy and never really explained but one must just suspend belief and just take the ride as if on a roller coaster willem defoe shows up to fill out a decent cast with reaves carrying most of the load as he is in almost every scene it looks good and the new york locations are a good choice a final 7510,reality
if i could give this piece of crap 0 stars i would this is easily one of the worst movies ive ever seen even cheesy 80s action movies like cobra had better writing so many other reviewers already pointed out so many of the completely terrible plot holes nonsense and idiocy that ill just leave most of that out of this review that being said theres terrible video games with better stories than this movie youd be better off staring at a wall while punching yourself in the side of the head for 2 hours than watching this piece of crap skip it,reality
cannot think of anything to redeem this movie fight scenes were boring with baddies unable to find their target at 3 feet an expert as was supposed to be was unable to fight off 2 thugs and an idiot in his own house he could shoot every other baddie but when it came to iosef he kept missing why didnt he kill ms perkins what was the significance of the gold coins or was i too uninterested to catch what it was also willem dafoe was just a pointless addition could have put anyone in that part who just wanted to collect a cheque for little contribution again keanu fails to impress and this was 100 minutes of my life i will not get back do yourself a big favour and give it a miss really,reality
if you took this movie back in time 30 years it would still be a bad movie there are two story lines here my review of the movie and how this movie got a 79 imdb ratingfirst the movie there was a early moment in the theater when i thought maybe this is all a gag a clever gag kinda like those mini feature spots reminding you to turn off your cell phone they do a nice job on some of those in theater messages perhaps this will evolve into a djangoesque tongue in cheek graphic novel all this critical analysis language doesnt belong any where near on location the actors must have looked at each other and saidreally or maybe my agent said we are supposed to shoot a movie today any movie fan with an eye for action movies will notice the poor fight scenes i counted 6 identical fight moves straight out of the 70s cop shows on tv where somebody is flipped over using one arm and a throw every fight scene was the same fight movie audiences have evolved quite a bit since the 70s is predictable its heartless its painfully slow with no shortage of terribly awkward dialog i am done throwing fancy words at this messnow the rating i have relied on imdb for solid reviews for many years now for the most part i have agreed with their rating i could argue a half point here and there but 46 points my guess is the studio has found a way to game this system crazy idea right to me its more plausible than the plot line of the movie somebody at imdb should look into this because it would be our loss if this gets out of hand,reality
i had an opportunity to see this movie at an early release showing and i passed it up once i saw the film i couldve kicked myself for missing it this is a relatively straight forward action film that spends just the right amount of time setting up the main character then the movie kicks into high gear and it doesnt let up until the end believe the hype on this one it is a gem of an action film the fight sequences are wellchoreographed and this cant be emphasized enough filmed cleanly with no shaky cam keanu gets a lot of flack for being a somewhat wooden actor maybe this is true but it suits him well in this film hes supposed to be some truly fearful man so when he decides to tell you why he is on this quest for vengeance you better listen the nightclub scene is iconic and he owns it the rest of the action is solid but not much can hold a candle to that scene the film loses a beat in the last act but not enough to take away from the enjoyment of the film on a somewhat personal level the opening scenes establishing johns relationship with his wife when he receives her final gift and when he finally tells viggo why he is on this mission of vengeance along with the absolutely excellent action combine to make a movie that is well above the average one of my favorite movies of 2014,reality
i have watched probably close to a thousand movies in my time hardly ever have i seen one in which a major hollywood actor has had to endure such a poorly produced crime drama as john it is a shame that an actor with the potential of keanu reeves has to work in such a meaningless film i sure hope he does not go the way of nicolas cage whose last good movie was made in 2003 matchstick men my fears though of a career collapse are slowly but surely being realized with keanu as this makes a twofortwo terrible movies list 47 ronin was in the category of wtf i will have to watch generation um and man of tai chi to see what calibre of production reeves has been partnered with of his last four filmsas for the film itself is a totally unenjoyable movie not only because the plot line is yet another us state department propaganda piece using russians as the bad guys but because the audience is not given the tools to sympathize for any character both bad and good alikethe aftertaste of is a dark dreary monolithic crime drama revenge movie that elicits zero compassion respect or other noble feelings and imparts not one lesson of humanity to the audience it does its job though of leaving a dark impression of russians and a vaguely justified negative thoughtimpression of that particular strain of people,reality
this movie has no script bad acting and my wife and i considered leaving before the end which we never do it is not the first time i notice a big difference between the ratings of the first weeks and the ones after a few monthsread the positive reviews a lot of them sound like prs selling you the movie with lines like best movie of the year a cult classic etc nobody writes reviews like that and im under the sensation that studios hire people to write positive reviews to promote the moviewhen you wait for a movie to end you cant give it more than 1 out of 10,reality
though i usually enjoy more movies where there is a delicate balance between substance and style  the film has an intelligent story and characterization that produces deep emotions too  i also find great and perhaps a little guilty pleasure watching action films once in a while but this is one of the films in its genre in which i simply do not find anything enjoyable or pleasurable at all it is totally boring and utterly ridiculous watching experience and i only wonder why on earth it was ever even made in the first place there is nothing original everything has been seen hundreds of times in hundreds of other moviesthe characters are silly the story is totally predictable almost in every turn and there is absolutely no humor which may be the worst thing of all all the people concerned producing this piece of stupid crap take themselves so damn too seriously and that is the most apparent source of yawn breaking boredom most viewers must feel at it it is just another stupid piece of dull action cinemakeanu reeves who is still a sight for most female and many male sore eyes even in his fifties cannot save it i think quite few women would have the overwhelming interest to watch the film despite its handsome protagonist reeves as a retired professional hit man is as irritating cardboard character as anything else in the film for most male viewers it is still enough if you slaughter a hundred guys around you with a relevant weapons arsenal and sprinkle blood on the walls in endless killing euphoria while on your vengeance tour de force but that kind of treatment when consistent all the way from the beginning to the end rarely makes a very good action movie there must be something morei admit that south koreans who are the real masters of the action genre nowadays have sometimes managed to do a fair movie from the scratch but this film crew has not been able to do sototal waste of time,reality
first time making a review here and this movie made me to do so this movie has nothing at all a guy is shooting dozens of people one by one thats it what i will suggest that start movie watch for no more than 10 minutes by expecting somethings then close your eyes and go deep sleep dont forget to switch sound at lowest lots of shooting will bother your sleepi have nothing to add for this empty movie it doesnt deserve to get more to saybut imdb wants me to add more lines,reality
cannot believe how weak and pathetic this movie was i was expecting at least a plausible story line and gripping action with keanu reeves in it but reeves acting was so shallow and unbelievable as was everyone elses the plot was barely existent and everything in it was just a repeat of so many other movies the action was stiff and repetitive and absolutely lacking in reality the story was unbelievable to the point of being ridiculous and the concept of reeves being able to do even a small portion of what he was pictured to do was just absurd can hardly believe actors of reeves caliber could even consent to act in this bgrade rubbish its like a kids movie  all impossibility and fantasy nothing gripped me at all not for a moment one of the worst movies ive ever seen,reality
warning  may contain spoilers no wait  that was the movie  one giant spoilerthis movie has a tired and terrible plot kills an amazing number of people and is just generally a pile of junk it has the same imdb rating as a beautiful mind and butch cassidy  the sundance kid it should be rated somewhere slightly above that other cult classic snakes on a plane or maybe conairdo not waste your time unless youre home its on netflix or amazon prime and youre drunk or in wa or co  stoned then by all means waste 90 minutes of your life watching countless bad guys get shot in the head,reality
weve all seen the guy getting whooped  coming back with a vengeance this is that but so much more keanu as always shows his dedication to the maximum as doing over 90 of the stunts himself the fight choreography is a ballet of violence  the stunt driving also mostly keanu is outstanding  professional thats what separates this movie from the rest in the genre keanu is underrated as an actor in my opinion his range in this film varies wildly  its good to see him expand  broadening his talent willem dafoe is outstanding no matter what hes doing or the size of the part the best parts of the film is that theyre always expecting him  nothing can stop him hes a bad guy thats done very bad things but got out as they say after the death of his wife he tries to put his life back together  expecting her death she arranges a puppy be sent to him after she dies which break him down showing a new acting range keanu performs without flaw what follows must be seen it would be a shame but expect a dance of beautiful violence post puppy,reality
shitty movie honestly after the first 20 minutes i had to turn if off really killing a was that necessary also it hurt my ears to hear the terrible russian being spoken by the bad dudes and the guys who play the gang members arent even russian for god sakes and as a russian i gotta say i am also incredibly sick of hollywood literally always using russians as the bad guys change it up for once keanu reeves has played the same character even if different movies for the last several years blah blah revenge exhitman blah blah good guy versus bad guys blah blah blah hollywood movies these days are all identical and lack originality save your time and watch something older like an action movie from the 80s and 90s,reality
this movie is an offense on my iq  it was 100 predictable from the beginning  complete waste of time so disappointed with imdb for giving this movie 75  why i am expected to write 10 lines of text about the movie that doesnt even deserve one i could easily say it was one of the worst movies ive watched recently  give you my word actually the reason i decided to open an account in imdb was to share my displeasure with the actors the plot and pretty much everything else there was a countless number of moments when i literally couldnt believe the producers managed to get away with such unsophisticated b class stereotypical unengaging movie so my word of advice is no i watched whiplash only yesterday and it made me feel like changing from form mustang to fiat punto,reality
so disgusting is this piece of filth that after one hour of perpetual killings many of them graphic and sadistic i simply had to leave the room and get some fresh air i then immediately destroyed the dvd as a public servicethe makers of this material should be arrested and imprisoned for corrupting society and anyone who actually enjoys watching this ordure should immediately seek mental health advice what plot there is can only be described as infantile and absurd the film is simply a vehicle for promoting video games where the player searches out black hooded figures to exterminate themwe are expected to believe that a trained hitman is woken at night by his puppy only to be hijacked by three naturally russian mafia gangsters who beat him up steal his treasured car and kill his dogthis same man then kills literally hundreds of security guards and other hit men who come at him one by one in a morbid procession of death night club revelers carry on regardless as security men are gunned down in their midst other security guards have their throats cut whilst seemingly standing there helplessly waiting for deaththe concept that all these security men all have partners mothers and families does not deter the hero we are encouraged to think that any scale of revenge is permissible under all circumstances and to all proportions even though most of these murdered guards didnt actually do anything against himthe only merit of this film is that it represents perfectly the mentality of american culture namely that if a cell of terrorists kill a few thousand americans we are entitled to launch decades or war thereafter bring tens of millions of innocent muslim civilians into endless suffering and destroy the entire culture of the middle east disproportionate revenge is the spirit of our age and is its prophet,reality

the scale does not have a 0 despite a whole lot of famous actors and 2nd role ones lots of killing lots of killing and againk reeves needs moneythe whole plot is about a guy that got his car stolen and his killed he wants revenge for this and he is gonna kill a couple of hundreds of mob people for that charming waste of timebarely watchable nice costume thoughhe wants is fxxx back,reality
i didnt know what to expect out of this movie when i saw the trailer i wasnt really impressed nothing about it really caught my attention but then i started hearing things about very good things and ratings for it were high thats what really caught my attention for itis a former hitman who retired from his profession when he found a woman he loved when his wife dies suddenly john wishes to grieve alone until a few days later when he realizes his wife left behind one final gift for him a puppy after a minor altercation leads to an even bigger one when thugs decide to break in steal his car and kill his decides that retirement would have to wait until his revenge is fulfilledwhat makes different from other shoot em up movies is that were provided with details of johns former life including old partners and a hotel front which leads the audience eager to wonder the many tales that can be told about the movie is fast paced never really a dull moment and it always keeps you wondering what hes going to do next and how also his style loves using the double tap to his advantagewhat else can i say is an amazing movie and i cant wait to see what the sequels will provide for us,reality
wow this is one of the worst action movies of all times and i cant believe it has 72 rating as i write where do i even begin no character development  awful script you wont even remember one line after the movie  sloppy acting no one in the movie is good  no story  poor ending  environment screenplay and visuals are also not that good  action sequences are barely tolerableat the end i would like to ask those who like this movie what is wrong with you people have you not watched any halfdecent movie recently and to those aspiring to watch this movie i wont say dont watch it id say watch it and come back to imdb and rate this movie  as a service to mankind,reality
a single guy kills more than 100 people zero story only action even action is worse than we have in fnf james bond mi ip man etc i usually never rate any picture 1 star but this is exceptional if your iq is above room temperature you wont like this movie,reality
its actually hard to remember the last time when keanu reeves was in a truly noteworthy memorable and quotable film despite him being one of my favorite actors 47 ronin 2013 aside from being a notorious box office bomb was completely forgettable generation um 2012 was a mess the day the earth stood still 2008 was an unnecessary remake and man of tai chi 2013 despite being a solid and wellmade directorial debut from reeves didnt leave much of a lasting impressionhowever ive always felt that reeves would eventually make another film that was worth the price of admission and not just a cursory glance and rental in a video store thankfully reeves has made a fantastic return to his old actionmovie roots with 2014 a film that seems to have been designed specifically for fans of reeves and after finding out about how the film has performed better than expected at the box office i can only hope that this film will help reeves get back into the spotlight hes definitely earned it as he is in one of the best films of the yearthe actual plot of the film is incredibly simplistic which in this case is a good thing keanu reeves plays a retired hit man who has recently lost his wife helen briefly played by bridget moynahan to a disease that is not clarified finds out that his wife left him a puppy named daisy but before can attempt to move on with his life russian mobster iosef played by theon greyjoy actor alfie allen and his thugs break into home mug him steal his 69 mustang and then kill daisy then grabs his old guns and returns to the violent also sophisticated oldfashioned and honorable mob world that he had once escaped in order to find iosef and exact his terrible vengeance i must admit i think this is easily the best performance reeves has given since the matrix sequels came out back in 2003 is a man of few words but his expressions and actions mostly violent more than make up for it which really works in reeves favor dialogue has never been his best attribute and im looking at you bram stokers dracula 1992 is by no means a hero every character runs into remarks about his terrible and legendary past and i quickly realized that was simply the best bad man in a world of terrible characters reeves clearly gave his all in this film as in every action scene i could tell his career decision to perform a majority of his own stunts pays off i never saw keanu reeves taking down bad guys in this film i always saw and it was a performance that truly felt realreeves may be the star of the show but he also has an impressive ensemble cast helping him out michael nyqvist of the swedish the girl with the dragon tattoo trilogy fame is excellent as viggo tarasov the leader of the new york russian mob former employer and iosefs father you can tell that viggo is the sort of man who is willing to place the life of his family no matter how idiotic over his former friendship with which creates an intriguing conflict alfie allen plays another greedy foolish character which has become a well played but too familiar archetype william dafoe and adrianne palicki have solid bits as marcus and perkins close associatesenemies of and john leguizamo and ian mcshane have memorable but important cameos as aurelio and winston what impressed me the most about this film besides the excellent action slick and stylish choreography a diverse and cool soundtrack and great performances was the world that inhabits it is revealed that is a former member of the continental a society of hit menassassins who reside in a fancy hotel and live by a strict code of honor chivalry and rules and if these rules are broken there can be severe consequences it was really creative and i found it to be a world that could be expanded upon in future fingers crossed installmentsis an action film that arrived at a time when a film of this caliber is so desperately needed first it managed to bring keanu reeves back into the spotlight second its an old fashioned action film that still managed to feel fresh and finally its a film that i could tell had a lot of heart and effort in it i truly hope that reeves efforts will result in a sequel or similar film and a resurgence of interest in actor who played the one overall is a blast and is a mustsee for any fan of the action genrefinal verdict 910,reality
so he goes out and kill 1000 men and get a new that is about it the movie is so bad that its a stereotype of a movie the acting is non existing the dialogues low and the music loud reeves is a great gymnast but no actor defoe has expired and nyqvist cant even fake a russian accent this is more like a homage to video games and american v8 engines than a story unfortunately it netted more than 100 million dollars i see which explain why they will probably never give up throwing these things out in new versions for as long as the market can stomach them i am sorry i watched it will be more careful next time promise,reality
this is basically a movie about vengeance although if someone kills your it does not really justify a bodycount of 100s after the first 20 minutes this movie merely offers up set pieces of violence and killing set to grungy rock music the violence reminds me of a fps video game where killing is cool and fun indeed i must confess to fastforwarding briefly during the final fight scene yawn a predictable and mindless offering if not for the delightful ms perkins then i would have given this movie a zerodont get me wrong the production and violence and well executed on a good budget if thats what you like then go for it but as a keanu reeves fan i remember great movies like constantine the gift matrix alas this movie is not great just violent mindless drivel set to a noisy soundtrack,reality
this jerk who wrote this film is unbelievable i cant believe anyone thinks its okay to kill an innocent puppy in a filmyou should be very ashamed of yourself derek kolstadit was completely unnecessary for you to kill the puppy in this filmmaybe thats the best you could doif i was your mother i would be completely embarrassed by youi will never see anything that you are associated with againit was a waste of my time and moneyive always liked keanu reeves but im surprised he would associate himself with someone that would write such crapshame on you toovery sad,reality
the poster looked really bad specifically the suit so did the summary of the plot but since kianu was playing i had to give it a shot the movie starts really bad for the viewer when the unnecessary killing of the cutest every occurs during the first few minutes i was that close to stop watching the movie but i said to myself its a multi million dollar budget kianu is in it if they did something so cheap as to kill a to grab my attention may be it will get better it doesnt the plot is dirt cheap and clich sad portrayal of the mafia unconvincing cast poor choice of music no thrill its just a really bad movie remind of steven segal movies after exit wounds which was goodi can go on about why the movie it got worse but i wont since i bet many people worked hard at it and i dont want to hurt their feelings it just didnt work that time in all aspects the only good thing about the movie was the appearance of ian mcshane and the move with double shooting the guys in the head the sound too may be everything else was like equivalent of action soap opera,reality
say you hate somebody who knows a bit about films well not that much buy himher a ticket you will never be forgiven  there is one thing that called my attention plot dispensability no efforts were made in the making of this film to make any sense at all this movie is a mere exercise of keanu kills them all everybody but keanu dies there is some experimental value regarding film appreciation df has done a good job the atmosphere in general makes the image appealing to watch there are at least 10 things that dont make any sense so it makes you wonder is the director challenging traditional film conventions guess not,reality
very poorly written and executedmore importantly the protagonist is worse than the bad guysa huge body count over a car and a dogi have no sympathy for a crazy evil man just like the people he goes afterthe only decent character is the dead wifei could forgive that  if the film had some other redeeming attribute it does not loved the series dexter and movies where the protagonist is an awful bad guy but there were excellent scenes of violence etc and interesting charactersi am glad i paid nothing to see this movie but upset i wasted my free redbox movie on it,reality
normally im not a fan from the onemanarmy against a 300 menand i must say i didnt had much hope this to be good after the first 10 minutes i was thinking to turn it offbut then it actually took off and didnt stop with good solid action and some unrealistic but very fun to see shootoutsgood action movie definitely worth your 90 minutes of timeill give it a 78 out of 10 lets hope america makes more of this kind of movies in the future i need to write 10 lines ill give it a 78 i have nothing more to add only to make sure i have 10 lines of text so imdb machine is happy,reality

so the whole idea of justice and epitome of firstworld problems goes to the fantastic plot of invincible kiwi reeves who starts going all crazy killing everyone in the world over a car which he gets replaced for free and a he didnt really like and had around for two days despite the fact that the was a gift from his freshly dead wife he chucked some blankets on the floor and took it off the bed the same man who had no feelings over the had no feelings expressed when his best buddy got killed are viewers supposed to root for such a spoiled rich boy are viewers supposed to believe that a hitman incapable of loving can all of a sudden switch to his cell phone video of his wife and think about her from time to time kiwis character is full of contradictions like the movie for a 5 year old,reality
went to see cause i like keanu and i had read the reviews and they were mostly positive but i wasnt expecting much even used my free movie tickets just to make sure i wouldnt be too disappointed if it suckedwell it almost sucked is your basic shoot em up that doesnt take itself too seriously and thats what makes it average you know what youre getting from the start and you get a lot of itthere are some interesting characters marcus ms perkins but for the most part you know whats going to happen to everyone except maybe you can sit through it but the stylized violence starts to repeat itself over and over and by the end you kind of lose interest,reality

personally i am not really a big fan of the clichd revenge plot especially when its applied to big hollywood action movies however as soon as the positive buzz about started to come around i started to become more curious about checking it out in theaters it felt weird seeing great reviews out of a revenge story at first but in the end it turned out to be a pretty good action thrill ridetakes the plot of a hitman coming out of retirement to duke out justice on those who dare to mess with the things he loved and turns it into a fairly unique story sure there are certain clichs and a delivery of cheesy lines at times but the movie manages to not take itself seriously and makes those aspects work although it may a paper thin plot to begin with its serviceable enough to introduce our characters and jumps straight into the actionthe acting throughout is also serviceable enough for the type of actiondriven story the movie was going for keanu reeves may not be the greatest actor in the world and i can probably name 10 other actors that are worse than him he somehow manages to put on a good performance its his best work of acting since the matrix and i believe reeves was meant to be an action star along the lines of schwarzenegger and statham as for the rest of the cast including michael nyqvist alfie allen william dafoe and dean winters lets just say that they do a solid job portraying their given characters they arent really bad by any means its just the main focus is on since he is the title of the filmin terms of technical aspects its pretty much the strongest part about the movie the lighting gives the film a very dark and gritty feel throughout its runtime and its certain shading of blue colors also adds to the films bleak environment every camera shot is smooth and steady and they keep a tight focus on showcasing the fast paced action on screen speaking of action scenes they are also executed brilliantly through excellent choreography and great editing all without having to resort to unnecessary shaky camis one of the best american action flicks to come out in quite some time it may not be on the same level as the raid 2 it still come in pretty close in terms of high octane action its simple story and characters give you something to work off of and its adrenaline fueled action sequences will have you on the edge of you seat and wanting more when its all over if you are the type of person who craves this crazy level of vengeance and violence then you owe to yourself to go and check out definitely worth a recommendation,reality
what is the point of this film this is probably the most violent movie i have ever seen although other movies show more blood and gore this is pretty much nonstop with no real story i wasnt surprised to read it is a video game because thats all it seems to beshoot shoot shoot with some punches and an occasional knifedespite all the actionviolence i nearly fell asleep i only stuck it out because i was hoping there would be a point to it there wasntthe site says i need to say more in order to have this review printedseems silly but oki did not like this movie it is pointless it is violent it is completely unbelievablemy adviceif you are a kid who plays video games you might like this movie,reality
after a recent barrage of rather forgettable action films its refreshing to see that provides excellentlychoreographed energized fight sequences as well as elaborate chase scenes in addition to a likable protagonist who you can easily root for in essence a revenge flick details the titular exhitmans mission to hunt down the people that stole his car and killed his the latter being a final gift from his deceased wife as it turns out the people hes pursuing are related to his former employer im not the hugest fan of keanu reeves as an actor but he nails the role of john its largely a physical performance with john being a seemingly introverted rarely talkative individual this sympathetic almost vulnerable side is juxtapositioned effortlessly with the brutal merciless part of him that reawakens on his quest for vengeance a great return to form for someone who hasnt really had a decent role since the matrix trilogy or a scanner darkly a lot of the other cast members such as willem dafoe and john leguizamo as well as a surprisingly large amount of people who have worked on hbo programs receive very limited screen time considering their impressive portfolios nevertheless they are all still able to maintain a hefty screen presence being directed by a stunt choreographer it doesnt really come as a surprise that has some ridiculously wellmade shootouts and car chases a highlight is johns rampage through a nightclub gunning down countless dozens of thugs in his pursuit of his killer as opposed to a lot of the uninspired uninventive cinematic action releases of recent years john setpieces maintain a highly fluid and energetic qualitythe film itself has an interesting portrayal of the complex criminal underworld that lies right on the brink of normal society a world that john is forced to return to everyone appears to know each other john included from waste disposers to bartenders to hotel guests it comes across as an unorthodox yet welcome hybrid of guy ritchie and david lynch tropes on the whole is a standout production in a list of otherwise banal recent action films aided by its excellentlycrafted actions scene and a solid protagonist in the form of keanu reeves john,reality
the story has as many plot holes as the count of gun shots in the movie so if you are so invincible why on earth just at the beginning of the movie gets his ass kicked by three masked men and in all other places but his home heard of a home alarm those three dudes didnt seem quite as intelligent as to bypass it and why wear masks if you finally take it off not to mention that they spoke in russian between each other oh well who that might be and if is so infamous why the hell didnt three guys know it especially the son of the mafia boss so what good can you say about the movie that gives you so many unanswerable questions in the beginning of it the movie is a nice action flick so im giving it 4 stars but please turn off your intelligence and enjoy the violence that at first had its reasons and then it lost it somewhere in a gutter and didnt care to pick it back up,reality
john keanu reeves a former hit man who was considered the best is attacked in his home by thieves they injure him kill his but there biggest mistake is that they did not kill now will stop at nothing until they all are hunted downi liked keanu reeves here he was quite the bad ass like payback1998 youll be rooting for the bad guy but unlike payback had some layers to him there are some great fight and shoot out scenes also great supporting cast like willem dafoe also i felt it just wasnt just a simply revenge film it also shows the darkness within a mans soul,reality
keanu reeves has been called a lot of things but a good actor with range is not necessarily one of them dont get me wrong i like him as an actor but he has a very narrow range in the roles he can accept either he plays the big dumb doofus or he plays the loner of few words in those movies he can truly shine and this has been shown time and time again his dramatic roles they tend to come off flat and stale his attempts at accents they tend to be terrible in every sense but movies like bill  teds excellent adventure the first matrix movie or this one and you can see what hes really capable ofis the story of a hit man whos left that life behind he wanted out but things force him back into it and he does not go happily hes described as a man of focus commitment and singular will he never fails a job he never gives up and he once killed three men in a bar with a pencil hes that much of a badass we catch glimpses of another world where assassins get contracts where theres hotels and services that cater to these people and where everything is paid for using gold coins it truly gives the feeling that this is a fully fleshed out universe with history a code of conduct and its something happening just under our noses without us knowingthe movie itself is a work of art whereas in a lot of action movies theres a lot of shaky cam work and quick cuts to hide the lack of skill of the actor this one goes the opposite way and shows everything there are long shots of doing his thing theres fight choreography that is just beautiful to behold in its brutality and execution keanu trained for this and it showswhen you get down to it its a revenge flick but one the likes of which you probably have never seen before its keanu at his best and with luck he will continue to make movies like this in the future,reality
seen it one hundred times before russia bad usa good bang bang the enduninteresting story line filled with average performances and russian accents that swing between convincing and awful every time they open their mouthsi dont know why this has become one of those you gotta see it movies ive had more entertaining and challenged bowel movements,reality
whilst the plot of this action movie was no different from many revenge films the pure violence and gore in combined with the intense and fantastically choreographed fight scenes left me openmouthed and full of adrenaline there was just something new and thrilling about the way in which keanu reeves portrayed his character that left me in love with this film i highly recommend it,reality

fun just fun not your typical action movie not messy like a lot of them are typically now the fighting and gunplay is very smooth yet also highly graphics and violent the story about a retired hitman seeking revenge over the death of his is simple but since jon is portrayed as a tragic sympathetic character its good enough reeves also turns in a surprisingly good performance if nothing else this movie deserves respect for its attention to detail these filmmakers really know what they are doing they craft and layer this thing with a passion that makes it highly pleasurable to view right down to the subtitled conversations being very in sync with whoever is speaking to a degree that makes reading them faster thats what this movie is fast quick constant action with a simple effective story and great performances also with a passion and professionalism that makes it stand out from the rest it has earned its spot as a milestone for the genre based on that alone,reality

this is an incredible action film i was surprised by how enjoyable it is it has heart wrenching moments amazing fighting great music incredible cinematography and editing spectacular acting and among most cliche action movies this was the most realistic also the element of an assassin society is incredibly interesting and makes the film not only more meaningful but makes the sequels more meaningful too if it was a trilogy of the same revenge story with new villains it would get boring however with the addition of an overarching element things are more interestingalso the film scores extra points for willem dafoe david patrick kelly and music by marilyn manson,reality

first of all i just have to say that a lot of the action movies ive watched are filled with cliche sometimes unrealistic and over the top and especially predictable in lifeordeath scenarios but is different in my opinion and thats why i liked this film plotwise there isnt really much after all its just going after and taking revenge on people who have disturbed his peaceful life by stealing his car and killing the his late wife gave to him the real gemstone shine and luster of this film is none other than the cinematography the action scenes were all very well shot they bring a sense of awe and surprise at its execution and deliverance everything is all stable no shaky cam this time yay fluid paced well with no dragged out elements and they did it in such a way that still lets you understand what is going on you dont need to wonder to yourself what is happening it isnt like a lot of action movies these days that use shaky cam a lot dragged out and shot with lots of cuts to the point you dont understand whats happening and gets boring really quick moreover everything is still kept realistic as the action never forgets reloading and proper stance as well as attention to detail from everything ive gathered here it is yall the movie that has very wellshot action scenes that you dont need to wonder to yourself what is going on so sit back and enjoy the fun i have mentioned earlier in this review that a lot of action movies i watched are filled with a lot of cliche and sometimes very over the top predictable and unrealistic when it comes to life and death situations seriously ive seen this happen a lot im no stranger to it so you may be wondering how exactly did defy our expectations even mine of an action movie especially given these regular aforementioned flaws that we regularly see in action movies well first and foremost one common thing i noticed with action movies then again is how they may come off as unrealistic and over the top especially when it comes to predictability however is different from this as stated earlier he is not an unkillable person like we always think with main characters in action movies take fast and furious 8 for example that movie may have been a fun watch for me but it came off to me as too over the top and sometime through i realized they werent gonna die and that something would happen that would save them in the end in some unrealistic way in contrast gets hit and beaten up many times and even gets captured and even almost killed at times it is with this that you start to believe in the stakes of this film that in his quest you actually worry about him and think hes been through a beating a lot i wonder how this is gonna play out you also may be thinking at this point how exactly he seems to kill tons with ease so doesnt that make it a tad bit over the top like you said well let me tell you this if you remember the one scene where viggo tarasov chastises his naive arrogant and bratty son iosef for starting a war with it is stated that he is a former hitman who used to work for the russian mafia notable for clearing many missions deemed difficult for the average hitman even one that viggo acknowledged as being impossible before parted ways with them thus earning the nickname the boogeyman this manages to shed a different light on this argument as is presented as being an expert in his field who with the level of skill he has presents himself as a literal oneman army that can take down people with ease that adds a logical foundation to how he does what he does he is presented with a background instead of something illogical that many would deem hard to believe  to end if you want to see an action movie that will undoubtedly defy your expectations is a mustsee it wastes no time getting down to business does not drag things out to the point it gets boring has extremely welldone action scenes that will leave you on the edge of your seat with palms sweating and to top it all off has a very intense tone and atmosphere all throughout that makes you feel every single thing this movie has to offer you absolutely cannot miss out on this if you havent seen it yet go and see it now i promise you will not be disappointed,reality
this is definitely one of the top 5 worst movies i have seen the only interesting part is the first 5 minutes where you hope its gonna be maybe a good movie but what a disappointment you then see and its not that i dont like action movies i do actually a lot but this is just insulting my intelligenceand i am also very disappointing in imdb i know maybe you guys cannot do much when you have whole teams giving good reviews because they are payed for that but it is just very sad i know for myself that i will not really look for reviews on imdb anymore i also had this before that i was wondering why does a movie have a good review on imdb when it is bad but kind of thought ok there are different tastes but this 7 is not different taste its quite an insultwasted 15h of my life,reality

this movie was a waste of my time with movies like the equalizer and the remake of oldboy the idea of the revenge concept is become more and more prominent they have also become extremely exciting but what was the appeal of those films the characters were interesting and made the action more fun and promising over just seeing some guy beat up a bunch of people was that it as a beat em up revenge movie it was a pointless movie that dragged on i mean really why do i care i didnt feel a reason too i didnt care about who was or what he wanted and the whole mythes about him this film gave me no reason too people wanna talk about transformers age of extinction pfft talk about john lets just fight movie cause that is all that it was,reality
a lot of video games have been influenced by films  the plots the characters the framing the cinematography and increasingly a lot of films are now influenced back by video games  the plots the characters the framing the cinematography and so it is the case with john its set in a world where everyone seems to be a gangster or an assassin or a formal part of that world its all rather cold and detached there is the flimsiest of back stories but it mostly consists of a very wooden keanu reeves shooting people in the face sometimes stabbing them and of course the obligatory throwing people through sheets of glassthe whole point of a video game is that you control the character even if the game consists merely of killing people the fact that you are controlling them makes it an immersive experiencejust passively watching a wooden game character shooting people in the face sometimes stabbing them and of course the obligatory throwing people through sheets of glass makes for a rather pointless and tedious 101 minutes,reality

youll regretwas this a video game turned into a movie whom ever said keanu reeves could carry and action movie alone lied this movie has some major plot holes along with some serious bad acting warning spoiler it all starts with the same guys whom harass him at a gastation breaks into hes home kick hes ass kills hes and steals hes car you never get to know how they found him without knowing that john er is the guy you dont mess with even though hes car is apparently legendarysince what i assume is the best car chopper in town wont touch it cause he knows who it belongs toanother thing that struck me odd is since when did the russian mob do home invasion just to steal a classic car to chop to me that seem kind of petty for a organized crime syndicatejohn is suppose to be a professional hit man the best of the best cream of the crop yet he get hes ass kicked by a couple of thugs wastes a lot of ammo by shooting people 56 times he cant even take out 56 guys with a machine gun and a 30 round clip not even when he has the element of surprise on hes side and the hand to hand combat is mostly bad he got no style no class no elegance over it i almost feel im watching american ninja all over again were hand to hand fighting mostly consistedof judo throwswide punches and a few simple locking techniquesthats how bad this movie is every bad guy in the russian mob seem to knows martial arts cause 90 of them get into hand to hand fights with him most of the times he act like a rank amateur instead of the super professional everyone is so scared of that they start shaking in their pants whenever someone just mentioning hes name i really wish theyd give these types of roles to jason statham hes better at playing these types of bad to he bone roles keanu reeves are better suited for something else like playing stoner in bill  ted best part of the entire movie is when the scene when the head honcho of the russian mob finds out over the phonewhat hes son has done,reality
oh my where do i start ridiculous script based on the clich one versus entire russian mafia painful acting senseless shooting scenes one after the other sorry to see 2 fine actors from the excellent tv series the wire in such poor roles keanu reeves plays a guy so bad ass that killed 3 with nothing but a pencil but was owned in his house by the 3 stooges that beat him up killed his and stole his car one of them his former bosses son which was about the only living person that didnt know whom he was makes sense right i gave it 2 stars because it made me laugh and i laughed again when i saw its score here on imdb but i have to say that it is still a bit better than 3 days to kill,reality
i signed up to imdb specifically to write this review imdb ratings are almost always exactly what i would have said but this one is so overratedfirstly the action it is just keanu shooting people in the face the whole movie sometimes he rolls around before shooting them in the face sometimes he grabs their neck then shoots them in the face needless to say this is really boringsecond the acting keanu still cant act his face is a bit older which makes him seem less like a goof that is the only positive thing about the moviei really am in shock that people think this is a cult classic or at all good it is painful to watch from the beginning you know exactly how the movie will go down the only thing surprising during the movie is how camp it is corny subtitles with different fonts bad acting extremely overused tropes redone with no extra effortavoid seriously i have low standards but this was awful,reality
the movie is just pure action no story what so ever the writers didnt do any effort to create any intrigue or suspense the shift from the movies lame beginning to the action was abrupt keanu didnt even prepare well for the movie his body lacked the necessary muscles for such a super strong bad ass yet he was hit so many times thrown off floors and he just gets up and continues fighting like it was nothing i gave it 4 our of 10 because the action sequences were kinda slick totally unrealistic though but still cool and even still the action sequences are repetitive without much change as the film progresses long story short this movie has no plot no logic no hype abrupt transitions and a super hero with a white pasty body,reality
my goodness there i was thinking that usually keanu reeves makes movies that are worth watchingin this great big pile of dreadful formulaic twaddle full of loopholes wider than the gap between here and mars it appears we have a superhero who can kill 12 huge grown men all toting sophisticated weaponry in about a minute and yet struggles with one tiny woman for what felt like hours totally unable to either disarm or do away with her did i mention formulaic drivel reeves the boogeyman manages to annihilate reams of people in a revenge spree filled with rage at the death of his wife and well the theft of his carthe very worst soundtrack in living history the longest nightclub fight scene in all time no script no acting over dramatized utterly dreadful dark barely discernible scenes quips nothing said nothing really accomplished nothing worth watchingif you cant wait to watch a really bad c grade movie yep thisll do it for you if you believed any of the botched reviews full of lies and hoped this might be a thinking persons crash and bash movie dont waste a cent of your money like i just did garbage,reality
was by far one of the worst movies that i have seen in a very long while there was no plot no point no script and absolutely no acting reeves as was a joke i hope he got a stupendous amount of money for this awful attempt at a movie because picking up his carrier from this mess is likely going to be a tall order save yourselves not just the time but also the frustration of watching this debacle i came out feeling that if someone had handed over the same cast to a group of aspiring college students and offered one tenth of the script and production budget they would have worked wonders but this was just shameful,reality
its funny but i am not sure what is 74 about this film is that keanu reeves well this guy may know how to act but he doesnt show that in this movie how about the plot what is the plot you killed my and stole my car and now you want to apologize common man you cant apologize i got to kill you and few thousand people around you cause i cant make a movie otherwise and a way he kills man i think every single video game maker would envy this director oh i must admit that this movie fulfills the hollywood mandatory condition where russians are the bad guys has anyone noticed johns replies in this movie to most of the questions asked he just repeats what he heard and sounds like michael armstrong in the hot fuzz all in all i would recommend this movie if you are still with segamega drive but if you have ever played a game called counterstrike then you might consider this movie boring for all other viewers just dont bother,reality
had high hopes for this film after seeing good reviewsbut it was really bad after the first ten minutes it turned into a video game with all the bad guys getting shot so easily keanu reeves just grunts the whole way through with most of the other characters acting as if they are from another planet maybe next time ill scroll down the page to read a few more reviews rather than the headline ratingthe penny dropped when the credits started to roll and i saw that most of the direction and producers were from russia so it was made for the russian market  has there ever been a good russian film please dont tell me there is a 2,reality
this film bombed so bad theyve rereleased it in uk cinemas  dont goi went to the flicks to see this based on several reviews mostly from imdb i love a good action thriller the bourne franchise blew me away and set the action thriller bar far higher as a result of its originality and success howevermrreeves was his usual unemotional wooden blister self the plot line was the basic revenge story used a thousand times before without one jot of its own originality i figure the producers want the obviously planned for sequel to better part 1 it wont be hard to dothick gangster even stupider gangster muscle gangster gangster gangster and top gangsters psycho son make an appearance  just to keep the clichs coming many many guns many many choreographed fight scenes but not much elsethe lavish budget looked to have been plowed into amazing sets rare muscle cars and designer wear for a myriad of extras and probably some freebies for most of the critics or how else did it get good reviews i stayed as long as i could hoping things would improve they didnt so 1 hour 10 minutes in i had to admit it was totally pants and left the cinema feeling ripped off and cursing every teen reviewer on here i still dont know how it ended and i dont care but let me guess against all adversity and many lethal obstacles finally gets his revenge at great personal cost many bloody injuries and sacrifice but at least he avenges his probably with an almost funny one liner as the cherry on top am i right go and watch anything but this even a mindless frat movie would be more intelligent and entertainingto the many positive reviews on here  when you grow up maybe you will learn what a good film looks like,reality
i havent seen no preview to it and went to see the movie based on the good reviews here on imdb  after i saw it last night ive got to say that they werent describing the movie at all honest  thats why i decided to put out my view of the movie on hereit all starts and already falls with the poor script some described it as a straight forward story i just remained asking where is the dn storywhat you get presented with in this movie is a  up until the end still  flat character who is taking revenge for the loss of his shortly after the death of his wife who also gifted him the so this john is described as a professional with amazing focus and at the same time with great inner rage why he ends up going for his revenge no matter the consequences but the movie doesnt succeed in delivering this believable character combining both these extremes he sometimes is forgiving and other times scrupulous it doesnt add up it rather gave me the impression that he is nice to people so they can come again later and make the movie longer but so is it on the other side with the bad guys too why are they sometimes nice i couldnt understandif you though look from the prospective of the storytelling it makes sense it delivers more movietime there are a couple of scenes where it became very obvious that whatever was going on was for the single reason of prolonging the rather nonexistent storywhat remains most prominent of all this watching time is seeing many headshots of faces you cant really make out enough to have some kind of emotional response other than the excitement of the fighting itselfi liked the music though its fitting to the excitement of this one man offensei hope with this you can better decide for yourself if its worth your time and money,reality
after watching this movie yesterday im still struck dumb the plot action and acting was so mindless the whole thing is just killing everyone and everybody it is made by a person who plays lots of violent computer games this genre can be very good if reason for revenge is believable i loved matrix movie and i only went to see because of keanu r but i can not understand why he took this role people say this movie has a good sense of humor but i missed it somehow its just 2 hours of total violence shooting and killing for some reason hollywood lately has to include women killers who are as much ruthless as men killers are this is not womens lib i dont get it neither,reality
i saw this movie rated 84 and that decided me to go see it i thought there was more to it than just point and shoot what a waste of time and moneybasically the hero is an exhitman whose wife dies but we dont know why and it doesnt matter actually only to put you in a dramaticmood  his gets killed and his car stolen by the retarded son of his exboss as we are in the us its normal to seek revenge and kill about 60 guys before killing the son  talk about efficiencythe scenario is really that basic and i thought the movie was just formatted to become a shootem up game with the obvious levels at home in the club at the harbor  but now ive read that it was originally a game that became a movie so im not surprised by the dullness of the scenariothere is no morale nothing positive in this movie to be recommended only for weak people who have low selfesteem and want to take revenge on life,reality
keanu reeves has had problems being believable in most of the roles he has had throughout his career i dont think he is a bad actor but his acting coach must surely have been the most incompetent in hollywood history he plays exactly the same character in a tender love story as he plays in an action thrillernow he does this an action thriller designed purely for 14 year old boys with pictures of cars on their bedroom walls it plays out with the stock grunty voices because tough men have no tonsils and the villains are russian with russian accents only found in los angelesthen they kill the cute puppy keanu gets so miffed that he opens up his secret basement full of big guns and even bigger bullets at this point i gave up i dont mind mindless fun but i do object if i have to be the mindless participantkeanu do the lake house part 2 that was a half decent film this is juvenile garbage that juveniles dont deservestaggeringly formulaic dismally predictable and hilariously bad,reality
many times i have found myself to strongly disagree with the rating of a movie in imdb but not as much as this one73 from 68000 voters is this a joke there is no point at all watching this film unless you have two hours of your life to wastethe film is inadequate from every aspecti guess if someone gives me tomorrow a camera to shoot and a pencil to write the scenario of a film the outcome will be more or less the same i am sorry for what i am about to saybut this is what comes in my mind every time i get so disappointment from a movie that has so high rating but mine is far far below i believe that the imdb should introduce two different rating categories one for the citizens of us and one for the rest of the world,reality
the good the visuals and action the bad everything else thats all i can say on the movie lacked substance and keanu reeves is washed up i loved him in the matrix but recently hes been is some dooies what i really want to comment though is on the blatant paying for positive reviews on here i had a look at a few profiles of the uber positive reviews and ye know what i found either the account is a few weeks old or the reviews on other films are all uber positive and all from this year i may be wrong but something smells fishey and it aint smoked cod i just had for my dinner although my apartment does smell fishey i know it goes on in the movie and music industry but its a joke if imdb dont look into this just sayinchers,reality
you can describe this movie in a very short schemejohn gets his killedjohn avenges his and kills a hundred men that is totally normal john gets a new the endthis movie is one of the worst movies ever 95 of the movies have some good lessons for you this movie has no lesson everything is negative this movie is so morally wrong is a psychopath and killer the worst thing in this movie is that john slaughters innocent people and hollywood makes it look as a good thingim really disappointed that keanu reeves decided to accept such a shitty role usually i like action thrillers but this this is too much,reality
i wish there was a way imdb could check and make sure reviewers arent part of the production crew cast or distributors of a film because thats the only possible way this thing could have gotten more than 5 stars from anybody i have to hand it to keanu reeves though for a guy who cant act in anything but a bill and ted movie hes managed to make a decent living at itsome might even call it a career amazing because hes got to be one of the worst actors in the industry gary grubbs everett mcgill and keanu reeves should do a film together they could call it the tin men other than keanus absolutely awful attempt at acting the plot of this thing was laughable and the action sequences perhaps the choppiest thing ive seen on film since that korean guy did the whole gangham style dance craze foolishness i hate myself for watching the whole thing and i hate myself even more for enjoying it,reality
this movie is lazy formulaic and completely lacking in originality or flairthere is no character developmentit is instantly forgettable keanu reeves displays the acting range of a coat standmichael nyqvist plays the standard issue russian psychopath where have we seen that beforespoilertheres the usual car chase with lots of bumping and shuntingthe baddies get killedkeanu walks the doger thats it,reality
keanu reeves is back and better than ever after a long drought on bad quality films reeves aimed to get back into the good graces of audiences by making this completely over the top action film while the story is pretty generic the action and the directing is simply top notch if you want intense action scenes that are simply amazing r rated fun mixed in with some fabulous acting then you are looking in the right direction this is my review of john the film was written by derek kolstad and this is only his third writing credit his prior two movies were both direct to home video action films i have watched both of those movies he wroteone in the chamber and the package having already watched some of his efforts in the past i knew story wise this wasnt going to be perfect however the story is good cheesy fun reeves characterhas a tough life with the recent passing of his wife she leaves him this sweet little as a gift to remember her to grieve with someone one afternoon is at a gas station and these thugs start up a conversation about his sweet 1969 ford mustang the one thug ask how much he wants for the car only to reply that it is not for sale they of course arent happy so they break into his house at night to kill the and rough him up they of course have no idea who this person at the gas station was this starts the chain of events that leads back into the game while the underlying story is cheesy it is sweet fun for this genre of films while kolstads effort wont net him any awards it should make his name more popular as the characters and the set up for the action is simply amazing i give his effort on this film a big thumbs upthe film was directed by david leitch and chad stahelski neither of these two have ever directed a film before they have both worked as stunt coordinators reading into that before you go see the movie could sound some alarms but they shot this film perfectly in my opinion the action scenes are fast and very intense the hand to hand combat is stellar work and with no shaky cam action the audience can really savor each moment in the bigger action scenes while there is some downtime in the film the acting plugs those holes keanu reeves headlines a fabulous cast that also includes michael nyqvist willem dafoe dean winters adrianne palicki and ian mcshane the acting as i just said was top level in this film having so many acting legends in this one film is great because action movies do have downtime where characters need to drive the film while there is some downtime earlier in the film the amazing acting more than makes up for it the first outing for these two is none other than something perfectly done this is a fun action film that hardcore fans of the genre will love to watch the r rating also helps as there is a great deal of blood and other over the top moments that you cant get away with on a pg13 film this was a fantastic effort and i cannot wait to see their projects in the futurejoel j richard scored the film with some original music from tyler bates both have worked on bigger action films so they know how to add a great deal of depth to a score i really enjoy the score in this film the bigger action scenes have some great pieces as the action is moving along there is never really a moment when i was underwhelmed by the score i love a great score and this is certainly one of the better scores from 2014 both richard and bates get a big thumbs up in my opinionoverall this is one thrilling joy ride the action is fast paced with some downtime that fills in perfectly with some great acting the actions scenes are shot perfectly and the hand to hand combat is very intense my only real complaint is some of the downtime tends to drag on a bit but it doesnt hurt the film all that much fans of the 1980s action genre will love this film those on the fence well jump on over this is a great film to see and it is worth every pennyi also want to talk about the imax version as that is the version i watched the imax version adds a tremendous amount of quality sounds which in turn adds to the fantastic score the picture level of course is certainly not there as the film was not shot using imax cameras if you can view the imax version on a discount showing that would be the best bet otherwise i dont really think it was worth the extra price of admittance910,reality
i bet it would be a great movie but unfortunately i pressed stop after a couple of minutes the first scene was about who loses his wife and he is sad and angry second scene his dead wife sends him a present which was a puppy for him to take care and love how sweet and sad third scene some creepy guys break into his home cause earlier they wanted to buy his car but john did not sale it to them so because the movie wasnt so tragic and dramatic all ready you probably thought that something was missing what about killing the puppy of course you killed the puppy and you made the movie worth watching now or not to sum up a wife dies he is depressed violent guys want to kill him for his car and because there is not enough drama already they kill the puppy what a start i wonder if after that becomes hit man and tries to get revenge for his puppys death driving his car thank you and sorry,reality
the film is so contrived you know whats going to happen from the off character development and everything is so basic its laughable you could have got a film student to write and direct the entire thing im flabbergasted that people actually think this is a great film whats so unique about it that no other film has got the acting is wooden the scenes unbelievable and this just a payday for those involved trust me youve seen it all before if youre willing to put all common sense behind you and take everything at face value then perhaps this film is for you oh my god its just finishing as i write and i cant believe the final scene now i know this film was rated by kids for kids,reality
this will be a short review because i already wasted enough time watching this drivel i could have watched it while flying a stunt plane through the grand canyon and not missed a single character or plot development  because there really werent any everything played out in such a predictable and formalistic fashion that i was beginning to think it was double bluff so what were the redeeming features it certainly wasnt the acting and im a big keanu reeves fan perhaps he failed to connect to the character the same way i did i couldnt really fault the fight scenes they were pretty well choreographedlooking at the imdb message boards a common defense seems to be that the movie shouldnt be taken too seriously in order to be enjoyed but theres no evidence that is in any way trying to be a tongueincheek parody or intentionally clich telling people not to take a poor joke too seriously doesnt magically make it a better jokejohn character is talked up to be one of the cleverest and toughest men in the world but its evident that hes actually just one of the luckiest ive seen storm troopers hit more targets than his enemies and there were a few occasions where his lack of basic precaution left him needing to be saved by his old pal willem defoe a good example of incompetence came from one of john old hard man pals when he had handcuffed a deadly assassin to a chair in such a way that all she had to do was stand up to be detached from the chair i cant help notice these little things in films and each one adds strain to the suspension of disbelief which in this movie ultimately broke it and left me wanting the movie to end as bad as wanted to avenge his dog,reality
if you like fast cars squealing tires gratuitous violence shootem up bangbangs and a weak plot then this is the film for you dont watch it with a fullstomach the very essence of the film will make you sicksome top notch actors but they are miscast what are ian mcshane and william devane doing in this garbage i guess times must be tougha is killed very early in the film the plot is very unlikely and is tailored for the violenceif you are anywhere near civilized stay awaythis is not a movie for children its not one for adults either so save whatever money and time you can by not viewing it,reality
the movie is as american as they get and i mean russians running over each other to catch keanu reevess bullets seriously they just jump from behind the camera and land in front of his pistols and man those russians at an early point of the movie i started feeling bad for them and how not to right from the start its obvious that they stand no fg chance the evil russian mastermind is scared shtless since the 10th min or so and seems like he just wants to make his end more amusing to the american public by sending all his men to the guyi wont even get into the plot the lamest excuse for super violence and namely they killed his its a spoiler for those who saw the movie too so swallow it so far so good but it was not the movie that made me write this review its the high score that 50k fellow earthlings gave it as if they want to trick us all into seeing it i understand the social function the movie is supposed to play the russians are bad again yey  i get it but cmon guys its kinda sad when you look at it from asideheads up if you can spell your name  dont see it youre welcome,reality
that was one of the alltime worst movies i have ever seen and a sequel is coming out in 2016 that adds insult to injury so many things in this movie just do not make sense here are just a few 1 vigo and iosef are right it was just a car and a now i am an animal lover but the does not justify in any universe the wanton destruction of dozens of people brutally and in public places 2 a real vigo would have killed him and never let go after his son after spending all that time and money to prevent his own and sons murder his actions when he catches make no sense just off him oh yeah then the rest of the movie cant happen 3 kill a priest in front of his church in broad daylight rubbish 4 suddenly vigo is no longer afraid of 5 marcus has no reason to set up his expensive equipment and elaborate stake outs to not kill 6 a hotel that is so out in the open about being a hotel for gangsters really and men dripping blood show up at expensive hotels all the time7 a hotel that has a doctor whose stitches and staples gangster wounds for a living so unbelievably disappointing i just want to blame someone  and get my money back but alas i only have myself to blame for sitting through it,reality
this movie clearly wants to be in the original taken category but alas it cannot be its just a boring one note action flick that would be a b movie if not for its a list star and obvious polished locations i like looking at keanu as much as anyone but him punching a lot of people does not a good movie make its as good as the taken sequels that is not say not good at all there is no time spent to create a world behind each character its just heres a guy punch him shoot him it feels like a cartoon for very stupid boys there isnt a good line in the entire thing the most memorable scene is a girl entering a swimming pool in high heels,reality
one sure way to spoil this movie is to watch it dontone star means awful as it says here on imdb yeah thats about right awful did i say awful sorry i meant offalor did i mean fecal is another action movie obviously written by someone who built the script with the clichs of a couple dozen other lousy action movies not a bit original or cool on any levela summary a murdering psychopath falls in love quits his job and becomes a sweet and lovable charmer who likes wife dies ok even if that isnt the stupidest introduction to a character you dont need 12 minutes to say this on screenthe mistake of many hacks for motivation you kill his and take his car really is that all you could think of how long did it take the writer to come up with this gem he kills 12 paid assassins who invade his home yet he gets his butt kicked by three punks i guess he wasnt wearing his superman outfit he kills a whole heck of a lot of people i lost count after 17 or so most of them had nothing to do with killing his puppy or stealing his cari kept waiting for something even remotely interesting to happen something that wasnt a complete insult to the intelligence but it never came,reality
this movie sucks in everything i gave a try to this movie after all this hype around this franchise and it falls flat this is mission impossible movie but too dark and gory which i like same boring story dull actors except keanu reeves i dont think this movie even deserves 7 stars,reality
no plot no depth of character unbelievably wooden acting grunts and inane dialogue just a sequence of poorly choreographed cartoon style gun fights tedious and repetitive i only created an imdb account to comment on this movie how did it get a 73 rating its moronic trash  grow up,reality

if death wish is a revenge for a murdered wife or taken a revenge for a kidnapped daughter then takes vengeance over a death of a and a stolen car at glance people might find it quite silly but the movie touches no irony within that plight it simply just pictures a desperate man with nothing left to lose however it still displays a strange mix of tones it introduces the story as some sort of a serious tragedy and then we discover that this world turns out to be surrounded with a punchline of him having a normal reputation of killing people the combination of gritty revenge thriller and tongueincheek world of assassins is fine but how the film connects them can be a little uneven but once the guns appear the fun is presented perfectly it just lives up to what it is meant to be there isnt anything big neither mind blowing is as straightforward as any fine revenge movie must be plus an odd brightening flavordespite of setting up with a bleaker drama actually builds a cooler mythology of its own sure basically has a legend of being the most lethal hitman his enemies will ever face that also defines to the characters who personally know him example is a cop who just found him wacked a few bad guys and still lets him go because he is its his thing everyone else in this world also has their own backstories there must be some richer stories behind them but in the end thats just the movie giving this typical revenge flick some personality and it indeed helps keeping the experience from being stalethe plot never compromises with any twists it just slow burns to the point until the antihero finds his target this slow burn can be a little dragging it introduces too much exposition that most of it turn out not going to matter in the end they are probably designed to build more tension the movie is better when its finally on the action the film biggest credit here is the camera work there is not a shot that misses some sort of violence every gunshot and fist has to present the consequence on screen which manifests his boiling anger and even without the fights there are still some slick stunning sights to see around predictably keanu reeves must be the only one who is taking this silliness seriously which makes sense since his character is the only one who is in real pain in this fancy mission that vast seriousness just perfectly suits at depicting desperation and madness also his fighting hits even harder compared to those days in the matrix but the show stealer here is michael nyqvist who brings the joy in his nutty yet menacing performance as the villainsometimes feels like there is a larger world meant to be explored or a deeper theme to be considered but the film has priorities of following the classic roots of the revenge genre its not so bad since it makes for an easy viewing through its fine looking action scenes but it also leaves a lot of potential hanging but if you are only here for keanu reeves back in action then this movie totally sells in fact that is what we are all here for anyway still we might have thought of some possibilities if the movie was more ambitious but then most of us wont think it matters its already stunningly crafted if not original or special just sit right in for a straightforward show of violent gunfights,reality
i feel really bad spending my saturday afternoon watching this disgrace of a movie very bad whole plot is described in description and theres nothing else to see except american hero saving his world possibly ours too from bad russians also the movie grade shows much of imdb general population which is sad tooas someone said is a killer ghost man he can kill three man armed only with a pencil but somehow manages to overlook a couple of brainless thugs hack into his house lets them beat the crap out of himself kill his and steal his car wowis so famous that even the policeman the bartenders the mafia all the town knew him but the son of a mafia boss for some reason did not even hear about him is very skillful  he managed to do impossible task he can head shot everyone in the dark but then he somehow manages to miss five times in a row at iosef incredible,reality
predictable juvenile revenge movie for 8 year olds reeves mumbles his way through 2 hours with matrix like fight scenes that defy believability mindless childish crap,reality
it is impossible to write a spoiler for this movie because it is completely predictable just read the storyline  the movie doesnt take you anywhere else yet another movie where the only driving force is revenge i wonder if most movie goers find hate and revenge to be acceptable motivations in ones live i dont think one can blame the actors to make the same facial expression throughout the entire move  i rather think that the story doesnt have characters but rather figures like in a chess game that you move from here to there and that can perform only a single type of movement but for those who like it loud with a lot of bangs perhaps it is good relaxation and to take emotional revenge on ones boring job and unbearable boss,reality

was a pleasant surprise when it showed up in trailer form a little over a month ago coming out of nowhere this indie action pic with a fresh director and great cast wowed a lot of people and for good reason it boasted the promise of excellent action with keanu reeves returning to form as the badass lead and a badass he is is the kind of action film we dont get these days and the director clearly knows what he is doing in delivering a truly excellent action filmfirst things first isnt going to win any big awards it doesnt really do anything new even in terms of innovative action none of the characters are fresh and the story isnt really that original but none of that matters because its so stylishly crafted the acting direction and writing so smooth and the world so well designed that any action junkie can get behind this slick heavily stylized action packed romp after a flashforward the film details the current state of john life his wife has passed away and he is obviously taking it very hard after her death he receives one last gift from his wife a puppy to help him keep from being alone but it isnt long before he loses both his prized car and his last precious gift from his wife with this taken from him we find falling back into his old life of assassination and violence see was once part of a world of criminals assassins and killers and according to the primary antagonist he was the one who was hired to kill the boogey manand it is here where the film picks up where those first quiet moments in the film were somewhat slow and dreary from the moment becomes the victim of crime to the very end of the film its almost nonstop action the biggest challenge the film had was setting up keanu to meet the legend he is described in as the film but i can completely reassure you that keanu is a complete badass here while he still is not the fine domineering actor you might find in other recently christened killers like liam neeson he has the skills necessary to prove that you dont mess with whether its playing up the role of a superman capable of tackling a younger equally talented killer while suffering a severe injury or taking on a dozen men all armed in a matter of a few minutes keanu doesnt need to rage pull out a booming voice or make speeches filled with slightly ambiguous threats all he has to do is flip you over his back and put two in your head with ease if you dont believe keanu is the feared killer hes trumped up to be at first you will by the end of the filmwhat helps pull this off are the thankful decisions of first time directors david leitch and chad stahelski as stuntmen they clearly know their action they eschew the typical modern style of action of close ups and quick cuts in favor of nice long medium and wide shots minus the quick cutting this offers us practical action scenes and puts trust in the actors skills keanu has certainly proved himself capable physically with his time spent in the matrix and more recently man of tai chi and ronin 47 the directors allow him to use his skills to deliver action that never feels fake or trumped up its authentic and completely badass supporting him are an array of actors including wilem defoe as an old friend in the business adrienne palicki as a fellow assassin given an assignment to take john out and michael nyquist and alfie allen as father and son gangsters the latter of which who is the perpetrator of the crimes against nyquist is especially good a villain that isnt completely evil and even a bit likable who were immediately introduced to as someone who doesnt necessarily want to do what he knows he has to do hes entertaining in the role and makes for a criminal that under different circumstances might have actually been an ally to action films of the guns and martial arts variety have kind of gone by the wayside in the past few years with few theatrical releases and most being vod but is a welcome addition to a legacy of great cinema action for any action junkie is an absolute must and i can only hope that this isnt the last time well see this ,reality
this movie was so bad that i decided to leave a review for the first time ever so many things wrong with this1 has serious communication issues basically the movie glorifies this guy who think its okay to kill hundred while putting the public in danger because someone killed his and took his car2 suppose to be a dangerous man well his security system is bad people apparently can just waltz into his house in the middle of the night unnoticed plus im not convinced that unskilled thugs can just waltz into some exhitmans house and kick his face in supposedly these exhitman sleep lightly and carries something heavy at all times3 why do all the brainless thugs just walk into circle of violence with their guns drawn pointing down so they can get their face kicked in who does that 4 right he doesnt miss anyone except when he tries to shoot at iosef thats a naked iosef running around without shoes maybe is gay and wants some fine piece of greyjoy for himself5 who the heck are these people and their stupid rules oh no shooting at the continental or else well round you up with 4 guys all shooting at you standing in the middle i was hoping theyd miss and shoot each other6 never got his car back and got a dodge instead john is okay with this id keep on shooting until i get my freaking mustang boss back just to keep the story line consistentless cramped with poo7 the question is can keanu reeves sleep at night knowing how bad this movie is wait these people dont care when you as an audience hold the bar so low you have only yourself to blame for bad movies8 how is marcuswillam dafoes character always at the right place at the right time and how the heck would viggo know that marcus betrayed him when viggo doesnt know anything most of the time 9 was it necessary for to take the stab from viggo so he can break viggos arm and counterstab wait it is necessary i was hoping they would both die from this stupid nonsensethis movie glorifies violence over senseless crap the live is worth more then the thugs went after this movie is perfect for people who over simplify the world and want to resolve issues with overthetop violence the action will keep you mind occupied but at the cost of having to accept twisted logicthe thing is i dont think ever wanted to retire and was hoping something like this would happen remember this is the guy that doesnt really have job or hobby and likes to drive his car on some airport tarmac for fun while he feel sad for himself maybe thats why he let those thugs kick his face in in his own home he needed a reason to go back to the only life he knew ill bet he was awkward as poo trying to live a normal life with the wife can you imagine how terrible itd be trying to live with an exhitman who has communication issues who knows maybe the wife faked her own death so she can leave him since i dont think an exhitman with communication issues can just casually breakup or divorcewhat a dysfunctional piece of crap,reality
if you are going in with a expectation of being surprised by complex plot lines and twist you will find yourself being disappointed go to see a well composed action movie with nice effects and creative ideas on how to kill a man then you are in for a treat the pictures are filtered to set the scene of a sinister city of sin which helps move the film along cutting down the actions scene would help the plot reach the full potential alas the director seems set on cramming in a maximum of killing scenes that may not all compliment the storyall in all you will be entertained 80 of the movie which i would say is quite good for the genre,reality
terrible film typical massproduced garbage regurgitated from the same massproduced garbage from the past there is nothing original here and was made for 15 yr old boys that need a hit of violence why take the grueling time to write a story when you have another plot you can build on from 25 years ago with modern movies everything goes into marketing this is the new art form the commercials the distribution the target audience are all far more the focus than the actual content of the film  all in the name of profit this movie definitely shows keanu reeves inability to act at all the plot was like water and of course very predictable they really build up his character then when the fight sequences begin its like watching something that they did back in the 70s the movie the drop with tom hardy is the same movie really however 100 times better tom hardy is incredible and has just begun to shine as an actor in film  so i recommend that film over this for sure this movie is a complete waste of time and i dont normally write reviews but really had to for this one,reality
disappointed on several levels i probably had too high expectations but the onemanarmyrevenge concept has been done so many times before and done much better than this the movie is rather boring  no real story here and the characters arent very interesting the action scenes are mediocre and too much over the top the whole thing just gets really tedious after a whilethe revenge concept needs to generate sympathy from the viewer and we need to be interested in seeing the revenge getting carried out this movie didnt manage to do any of that for me i was surprised to read quite a bit of positive reviews of and a metascore of 68 was also surprising im normally in line with at least the imdb score but this time i cant find much in this movie that warrants more than a 40 rating,reality
i spent 2 hours watching this movie and found it really silly especially the father of iosuf how he gave his son to john after he was protecting him from john and then suddenly he wanted revenge for his sonotherwise it was only showing off cars and guns,reality
a lot of action but the fight sequence was just ok nothing makes sense and it didnt plan to its a movie that planned to win you over with style a comicgraphical novelvideo game type of style sadly that doesnt work for me i can see fans of such genre loving it which explains the high rating,reality
one of the best revenge stories ever if you like action films and revenge stories you need to see lighting is a little weird at some times but once you watch the movie you see why they did that lighting,reality
mindless action even if it looks good a guy who cant be killed because god knows why by an army of other professionalsand he is killing everyone because a couple of guys killed his but he didnt do anything when his was being killed in front of him oh yes he was a bit depressed bur amazing ,reality
is an incredible action movie keanu reeves gives a great performance emotionally as well as physically ian mcshane and john leguizamo give great supporting performances the world is interesting and well explored the direction is great and the music both composed score and songs are really good the action is amazing and the best part of the film,reality
keanu reeves the other super crime fighter from new jersey the one without a mop retired from being a hitman for the russian mafia when the undisciplined son alfie allen of the mafia steals john car and kills his puppy this sets off for some overthetop revenge that includes the entire russian mafia in new jerseythe film is action driven with moments of humor and dark humor some unintentional for instance the mere mention of name makes men tremble reminding me of the south park keanu reeves running gag personally i would have loved it if they just left the name at keanu reeves yes he once killed three men at a bar with a pencil again a running storygag in hitman films is not the boogie man but the man you hire to kill the boogie manthere were some safe zones in new jersey places where mafia people cant kill each other this was a bit weird and awkward as was the soundtrack during the first major fight which was like listening to someone trying to play metal grindhouse with drums which stutter start and stop it worked better in subsequent scenes but not the first one it was also odd that someone could get the drop on john which started this whole thing off and that john would sleep with his curtains open after all he did kill three men with a pencil imagine if he had a ballpointfor those who like overthetop action films with the improbable and impossible plus some humor this is itfbomb no sex or nudity,reality
this is keanu reeves best since bill and ted with a perfect amount of violence amazing acting and great action is obviously a the action classic,reality
review i really enjoyed this movie because it shows you that even though people may not believe it there is honor among criminals the direction and screenplay are both really good both the casting and acting are really good also the camera crew did an amazing job using a low angel everytime you see vigo or losef this is really interesting because vigo is a very honorable mob boss while his son losef is an entitled asshole waiting to inherit the russian mafia family all in all i would give this five out of a possible five stars,reality
a man with a mission when done wrong keanu as the brooding non sensical man of few words could do no wrong even though he certainly does love him in both and cant wait to see the third installment he totally rocks,reality
im about to write a spoiler but take that with a grain of salt theres not much to spoil youll also thank me for saving two hours of your lifethe plot spoiler alert  hitman exits the business for love of course  his love dies from some disease and gives the ex hitman a  some russian gangthugs like his car so rob his house to steal it in the process they kill his  ex hitman goes ballistic pun intended he then kills about 50 people on a revenge warpath  he gets a new in the end because conveniently in the docks where the final showdown happens theres a veterinarian hospital at the shipping docksok thats it thats the movie two hours of incessant violence headshots more violence and bad acting i kept sitting there thinking is something interesting going to happen will the acting get better will there be a plot twist no no andnothe fact that this movie currently has a 72 rating makes me want to believe in widespread movie rigging conspiracy as i dont want to think so poorly of my fellow humanity,reality
its good to see keanu back on the silver screen but unfortunately this film wasnt his best choice if youre into shooting killing or one man against the rest of the world then this is for you the movie reminded me of 3rd person shooter game not only because moves like a game figure also because theres seems to be a certain range of skills he uses to bringing the bad guys downif youre into thrill story or dialog simply forget about it theres nothing like that in this movie the plot is so weak i think you hardly can call it a plot its rather a cause and effect thing you did me harm so im gonna do you harm too thats itwhat i liked the most about the movie was its cinematography and style and that actually kept me watching until the end the cgi is ok although in some scenes shooting from close range too obviousall in all i found this movie very disappointing and i think its more a huge budget bmovie,reality
if you dont like action movies dont bother however if you do like action movies this is a mustthis movie fixes everything they screwed up in jack reacher im quite proud of hollywood on this count if you liked jack reacher youll love if you didnt like jack reacher but still like action movies you will like thisthis movie belongs in the greats for male character development right up there with crank and riddick but somewhere below army of darkness gladiator rambo and die hard i know its been a while since keanu reeves has done something good thinking matrix reloaded but he has seriously redeemed himself here,reality
despite starring in some undeniably iconic roles early in his career keanu reeves has struggled to maintain any sort of momentum with every critically acclaimed performance or box office success followed by a string of disappointing and underwhelming projects but thanks to his former stunt double chad stahelski reeves once again finds himself headlining a solid action flick that has plenty of buzz around itdespondent over the death of his wife retired assassin reeves spends his days moping around his house with a beagle puppy as his only companion the arrived on his doorstep shortly after his wifes funeral a final gift so that john wouldnt have to carry on alone but an untimely runin with iosef tarasov alfie allen the son of a local russian mobster results in the theft of johns 1969 ford mustang and the death of his puppy leaving john with nothing to love  and nothing to loseyes thats a ridiculous segue but it also perfectly conveys the tone of the premise is unapologetically silly but reeves approaches the material with such fervor that we quickly forget about his motivations it doesnt matter that is singlehandedly disassembling the infrastructure of the russian crime syndicate because of a  what matters is how much fun the film is having while he does it stalks from scene to scene with the precision of the terminator scarcely wasting a single movement as he dispatches bad guys in impressive numbers with equally impressive methods surrounding the nearly nonstop action is an interesting mix of supporting characters including ian mcshane as the owner of a hotel for assassins whose roles dictate that no business be conducted on the premises and willem dafoe as mentor marcus himself an expert sharpshooter and we cant forget adrianne palicki a fellow contract killer out to collect the 2 million bounty placed on head by tarasovs father viggo michael nyqvist who also happens to be former employerstahelski who first doubled for reeves on the matrix before moving on to several other films with the actor including constantine man of tai chi and both matrix sequels has teamed up with longtime collaborator david leitch for a stylish revenge thriller that heralds the arrival of a bold new voice while stahelski is credited as the director due to dga regulations this is very much a team effort as stahelski and leitch have channeled their decades of experience as stunt coordinators and second unit directors into a remarkably original film that boasts some of the best action sequences in recent memorywhile certainly isnt a perfect film  the script is paperthin in more than a few places and reeves has a handful of laughably poor dialogue deliveries  it never stops having fun this is a film that refuses to take itself seriously opting instead to just strap in buckle up and enjoy the ride and as long as audiences can follow suit rather than searching for some deeper meaning they should find themselves pleased with the results brent hankins wwwnerdrepcom,reality
im glad so many people like this movie because i figure somebody has got to like this movie a little dull many skilled actors given sht to work with lots of action to forget the real world but so sterile like ive never seen gun violence so repercussionfree in my entire life just fire a bullet into the air no problem i would say my major complaint is that the movie is not exciting despite a lot of gore and gun violence  which is good it works for me  it all so obviously happens in a slick fake world that theres no sense of danger for any character if anyone dies its glamorized and therefore less real even the double taps to the face stylized and melodramatic,reality
forget all the nancys that want a movie with meaning if youre looking to get some kind of emotional connection or value out of this movie then this is not the movie for youhowever if youre a guy that ever enjoyed renting vhs or dvd action flicks with your pop then this is one thrill ride you will enjoy cool music from marilyn manson as well as some techno accompanies all the great action if you like the replacement killers or running scared paul walker flick not the 80s movie then you should enjoy this alsokeanu reeves plays one serious bad azz and could potentially become the next action star,reality
would benefite of court restraining order that chad stahelski must not come closer than 300 meters to camera vicinity since derek kolstad didnt have hard job to write garbage that anyone can write if have pencil between fingers on left leg only one sentence that sound smart am i looking civilized could not make him look good even in his parents eyes keanu reeves i personally admire is too old for the role movie all copies should be destroyed but main issue is imdb credibility on line allowing high rated misleading reviews to be added if i was not clear let me repeat this is shame for industry intelligence and human kind shame for tarantino director to give positive rate once again this is serious mislead of general audience not experienced before on imdb chad stahelski and derek kolstad work is digging grave to cinema as industry and promoting values inappropriate to any social environment,reality
i really dont even see the point of this film the plot is so stupid basically a hitman is retired the son of the hitmans former boss steals his car without knowing it was one of his dads old employees so the hitman is annoyed and it is now set in stone for some weird reason that the hitman will be killing his former bosses son even though hes presented as someone fairly coolcalm and not mental so i mean you wonder why they couldnt just talk it out the boss apologise say his son didnt know he will be punished and compensate him for it but no instead now this former hitman gets all of his old weapons ready the boss decides to send loads of assassins to kill the hitman already this is just really stupid and it becomes some kind of boring boring revenge movie with the point of the revenge being stupid and one of the most easily avoidable and irrational reasons to go on a killing spree of any revenge move where the hitman is killing generic henchman after generic henchman who are sent in waves and really stupid just there to die so all the killing is kind of meaningless its not realistic or anything and you know these generic henchmen are just there to die before its begun so i dont know what this film even is supposed to be,reality
is an instant classic action film it doesnt have a crazy plot that makes it easy to get lost its just basic you dont have to wait long for the action to begin and when it starts it goes pretty much right through to the end i really hope that this is the beginning of a franchise because it certainly looks that way i hope this film gets some attention because i didnt hear much talk about it and its run in the theater went by fairly quietly although it did make 50 million bucks of profit it also great to see keanu reeves find a role that seems to spark a comeback for him keanu has been a huge action star for over 20 years and its nice to see him back on top may become one of his significant roles in the future,reality
an exassassin loses his wife to cancer her last gift to him is probably the worlds cutest this lasts for maybe a day or two as a couple young punks break into his home kill his and steal his car turns out the guys who did this too him is the son of his former boss now you learn throughout the movie that is known by just about everyone in town so why this kid didnt know who he was is dumb but its what makes the story take offis an action film that you need to just sit back watch and enjoy dont nitpick at the little things such as the dialogue being a little bit corny or the many clichs that occur this movie has fantastic gun fight choreography in my opinion its in the top 10 for gun fights i also liked the world they created the world of contract killers was different from what i had seen in the pastthe good guy is a likable character and you feel for him you also despise the bad guys especially the son bottom line its a good time and if you like action films i highly recommend it,reality
the movie is no brainer similar to the action movies made in bollywood how it can get 73 whereas some of the good action movie like eraser collateral damage commandoover the top escape plan are still below 7total waste of time a man kill at least 50 person and the mafia for killing a the storyline is very weak the action scenes looks unreal it looks similar to south indian action movie i was expecting a much better from this one the storyline is 1 minute a was killed by mafias son and in return he kills everyone in the end why he put a knife into himself and then kill mafia does not make any senseat last finally got a to get started again,reality

even for an action movie this film is as simplistic as it gets even for a mindless diversion its boring i found myself interested for a full 4 minutes during this hour and a half drone in a world cram packed with action movies this offers absolutely nothing new interesting or beneficialthere was some action which was no different from every other action film there was mindless machismoism based around tired meaningless revenge completely void of inspiration there was no plot whatsoever its no more than a long series of repetitive uncreative triggerpulling scenes with no redeeming factorssave yourself the agony and watch something that will bring you reflection over base retrogressive diversions,reality
i wanted to like this movie i went expecting big action lots of fun and keanu reeves at his best what i got was the big action sequences that would have benefited from a lot less talking the script was a slight rewrite of a old country song stole my car and killed my thats on par for the rest of the script visually the movie is stunning linguistically dont expect higher than a fifth grade level vocabulary or language skills and the emotion one note no depth things blow upquite well in fact beautiful gorgeous growling muscle cars grace the screen and upstage the actors driving them wonder if the count worked on them and the dramatic cinematography earn this flick 5 stars but the plotdialoguecom on even mr reeves looked pained to say it at times dont waste your money five out of ten for movie craft and pretty things wait for the video,reality

the film has well deserved my straight onestarrating for the fantastic looks of keanu reeves and the absolutely cool musicunfortunately the story line is not at all carrying the whole length of the film an alighted former order killer who started into a normal life again is just mourning about the death of his beloved wife when he is being attacked by the brutal and greedy son of a former opponent the nasty guy and his friends not just stole his nice car but also killed his cute little now he is seeking for revenge the whole story is told in the first quarter of an hour and the remaining film is focusing on the merciless seeking for revengenot too much surprising content a lot of clichs black and white characters not even the dialogues are too bright either funny impressions just arise from the absurd exaggeration in violent scenesa certain amount of dullness and murderous frenzy is very helpful to enjoy the amount of blood squirting out of heads and chests during almost the whole filmmr knows no mercy and theres no satisfaction until the last one is dead unfortunately that takes incredibly long you will inevitably get bored of it although there are some minor variations in the killing methods presented dont trust the average rating of this film its possible that the ratings are provided by some enthusiastic violence and  or car lovers and  or numb heads among those who are switching their brains off as soon as the film starts all you disappointed viewers why dont you share your opinion to balance this completely inappropriate good rating for this film,reality
uncreative amateurish plot with terrible acting like most keanu reeves films ridiculous shootemup action throughout with no redeeming moments i gave up after reeves had slaughtered his 153rd victim with little more than a few scratches in return one of willem dafoes poorest performances and typical of keanus highschool acting even one of my favorite actresses bridget moynahan drowned in the murky waters of this garbage film the musical score sounded like it was produced by a bad garagegroup of teenagers the cinematography sucked and it took an uncommon stayingpower and determination to sit through it til the end this flick is a total waste of time and anyone who gives it more than a 2 has been smoking bad weed,reality

awful but im happy to concede that there are plenty of folks out there who want to escape with just the kind of strong feelings this work will conjourits just a pity it had to happen in my living room and the people to blame for that are the western european censors who presumably are working to definite guidelines in rating this film suitable for mediumsized teenagers to watch why is this why is this gratuitous violence that has no redeeming features at all certainly no artistic merit rated suitable to stream into living rooms full of ordinary young people i can perhaps understand a 15 rating in a cinema because the wellrun cinemas i know are not lax enough to allow smaller adolescents in to this but to rate this a 15 for home use is to confuse it with gentle memorable and even great works that dont get a 12 for one difficult scene or one awkward adult plot line this though is r for every scene even the one or two where reeves just drivesi do understand why people want to make films like this there is money in them i do occasionally watch them myself although i didnt make it all the way through this one because the plot was so flimsy it just got blown away along with the first wave of carnage and you knew there would be no more story after what 20 minutes does that amount to a spoiler telling you that theres nothing to spoil i limped on and dipped in and out after that so at least im confident that im being fairif there is any idea that arises difficult to credit really it is this people do things to us that instil strong feelings of revenge but we cross the line if we allow ourselves to act instinctively in response the message i would urge upon both the filmmaker and his audience he shouldnt have allowed himself to succumb and actually make the nasty little film and you should have ignored his plea to help him recoup his investment the alternative is nothing but dead puppies some of them human,reality
i thought the imdb ratings should tell us about the movie before even watching the trailer this time the rating fools me as it probably did with many of you i could not even complete the movie stopped after about 40 min or so after making sure it is not up to the standard i wonder who gave it the high rating and why a lot of scenes is not easy to understand like the one in which john was doing a reckless driving in an open area what is all about in addition although john is very well known to almost everyone in the movie including the mafia boss  the police the son does not know him then how they reached his house when they hit him and killed his these three guys look to be the only ones who dont know since when the police keeps complete silence on murders and accidents at least question him one more vital notice who is i watched 40 min and i still dont know him is he cia agent police agent what why everyone in the movie knows him he killed three people using a pencil while he did not show any resistance to the people who hit him in the middle of his house and killed his i simply cannot understand this easily i cant just tell everything here the above are few examples,reality
i thought this movie was a good 710 in the beginningbut then as it progressed into the later stages andspoilersthe nightclub scene played out it gave the movie a huge liftit was one of the coolest and best looking scenes ive seen in a long timethis movie is straight forward cool and very good looking it knows what it is and it does it well the movie also takes place in a very interesting world which in some way sets this movie up for another one i really hope they will do a prequel for this movie1010,reality
i dont have enough words to say about this movieit is perfect i love action movies and this movie has everything to be a great actionthe story is very nicethe acting is greatthe fighting and shooting scenes are great and everything else is awesomei waited so long for a movie like thiskeanu reeves is a great actor and the way he played is greatalso they worked very good on the back story in the movie which makes the movie perfect and enjoyablei know some people always have doubts about action movies because some of them can be boring not a good story lame characters and etcbut not this one this is a masterpiece this movie is one of my favoritesand i think a sequel would be great,reality
ok i gave it a 2 because i like action but this is 90min filled with people getting killed my mr reevesthis ripoff 1 red 2010 bruce willis goes into the basement and sledgehammers through the floor to a hidden depository where a packed bag money weapons and ammunition he does the same 2 payback 1999 the outfit and the hotel from payback is a reflection on how poorly this plot was written not a single new idea84 people killed just stupid ridiculous and never happens in real life  i could only find 2 serial killers after 1990 who had more kills than this movie luis garavito  138  pedro lopez  110  the usas 10 worst has bundy at the top with 30 killed so come on hollywood stop ripping off other peoples work and stop killing for the sake of killing action can be done intelligent and funny lucky number sleven,reality
feels like a second rate wannabe tarentino film minimal yet cringe worthy dialogue poor acting awful accents and the worst plot line ive ever heard of reeves is an unconvincing lead character but i can understand why none of the big action film names would want to be associated with it just glad i didnt pay to see it,reality
john will come for you and you will do nothing because you cant do nothing do you hate complicated films where your brains hurt while trying to keep up with the story do you start to drool spontaneously when watching endless violent action scenes you answered twice yes sir wellthen is cut out for youbecause the story is simple in a way that even your goldfish can follow it easily and it it contains a concatenation of roughcruel liquidationsi never thought that stealing a ford mustang and wringing the neck of a puppy could result in a neverseenraging revengethought otherwise this retired former hitman leaves a bloody trail in new yorkafter they steal his car and kill his dogdonated by his deceased wifethe fact that this is committed by the son of his former bosswhos from the russian mob doesnt impress himinstantly he demolishes his basement flooryears agohe buried his whole arsenal of weapons and other adult toys therejust to forget his past and change gear in his new lifedigging up keanu reeves againcertainly wasnt a bad ideathe man has a natural talent for portraying an icy cool killerhis emotionless visage is perfect for the roleand the less dialogs in a filmthe betterits not the dialogs he has to struggle throughthat gives him the appearance of a coldblooded assassinbut his stoic calmness and the expressionless gaze doeshe demonstrated this already in the matrix and also in 47 ronin wrongly considered by many as a pulp filmif you want to keep track of the number of victimsyou should purchase a large oversize abacusi enjoy a straightforward action filmwith not to much frills and where the emphasis lies on mindless brawling and shootingit shouldnt be serious all the timealthough after a while i felt kind of impassive about it and sank deeper into my cozy seat to watch it with such an infinite looki compared it with a ride on a wildly popular matchless rollercoasterduring your first rideyou feel the adrenaline rushing through your body and you rush back to the entrance full of enthusiasm just to experience that indescribable feeling once againduring the tenth drive youre sitting in it very relaxedlooking around in search for the next challenge thats in a nutshella flashy rollercoaster ride that starts fiery and impressivebut as the journey takes longerthe euphoria fades away slowlyin terms of genre its ultimately of the same level as the equalizer only the latter contained a bit more story i thought in you have a stolen car and a dead on the one hand and on the other hand an increasing number of corpses thats it and yet its pure enjoyment witnessing the flashy action and shown coolness chad stahelski a former stuntman interesting fact he was the one who played neo in the matrix during dangerous scenes doesnt beat around the bush and creates a series of precisely choreographed fight sequences without much effort he succeeds in giving reeves the reputation of a boogeyman but as viggo michael nyqvist remarks it himself john is not exactly the boogeyman hes the one you sent to kill the boogeyman and this top assassin moves in a swirling way to eliminate his enemies with a wellaimed shot his shooting technique is slightly offtrack and looks somewhat forced but that doesnt keep him from transforming the place where he appears into an outright shooting gallerythere were some pretty surreal scenes which impressed the imagination like the continental hotel the professional cleaning team and the reputation of in itself and his cult status hovering around him as an aura the continental hotel could serve as a scenic design in a future batman movie which bathes in a real cartoon atmosphere its a famous meeting point for notorious assassins with its own monetary system an unnaturally friendly desk clerk that meets with all the needs of the guests and a resident physician who can be called for when guests return reasonable damaged after taking care of their business there is only one golden rule which is mercilessly punished after being violated its prohibited to arrange matters in the hotel itselffor most of the supporting acts you can safely say that theres a total lack of character development most are no more than a shadow in this film who come momentarily into view and then theyre mercilessly being slaughtered but it seems as if they are suffering from anemia because despite the continuous aggression there is very little blood splattered around so only michael nyqvist alfie allen iosef and willem dafoe remain michael nyqvist wasnt very convincing as viggo and was at the times too theatrical alfie allen played the wellknown roll as the conceited imagininghimselfbeinguntouchable son of a criminal who as he starts to realize what predator is hunting him needs a larger size pampers not that very original and willem dafoe tries but gets little screenplay to play himself into the spotlight so reeves is the only one to steal the show and he does that with panache and style once he slips into that measured black suit and swings a duffel bag full of toys for adults in it over his shoulder he walks confidently towards you while the camera zooms in and then you can brace yourself magnificentisnt exactly of a high level in cinematic terms but does meet the requirements of the targeted audience a pure action movie full of spectacle unfortunately there are rumors that the sequel is planned already i admire reeves that hes still capable to portray a character as at his age of 50 he can take that kind of personage to a next level but im afraid that this sequel will be a weak carbon copy from the originalmore reviews at httpopinionasamoviefreakblogspotbe,reality
i dont think most of the people who write bad reviews on this movie seem to grasp the fact that hes been retired for a couple years so when it comes to fighting hes not as good as he used to be second the reason viggos son doesnt know about is because hes young and all the other gangsters have been around a lot longer than him plus everyone thought was retired so why would they tell the son about a retired guy lastly in my opinion an action movie would be quite boring if the protagonist won every single fight perfectly without so much as a scratch overall in my opinion it was a great movie i thought the actors played their roles brilliantly and the story line pretty good,reality
this is a badass movie with a badass main character called played by keanu reeves and this actor gave a good performance and his character was so cool and he kicked everyones ass in the film i thought this was a very good film it was fast paced and action packed from beginning to end which is what makes the film so good also the story is straight forward and to the point the film may not be perfect or great but it is a fun action packed film that never gets boring the acting was good from everyone and i liked the character despite the fact that he used to be a hit man john was just a very cool character hes a character you will route for while watching this movie i know i did this film has no major problems in my opinionthe only negative thing i can say about the film is the story was not great or original but who cares about originality when a film is this action packed this is one of the most action packed films ive seen all yearit was just as good as captain america the winter soldierthe story to is pretty simple its about a retired hit man who loses his wife and he is so miserable after losing her that he wants to leave his old life behind tries to leave behind his old life and just be a normal guy and he receives a gift from someone which turns out to be a puppy and his wife wanted him to have it when she passed awayit was her final gift to him bonds with the puppy and grows to really like it but one night a group of gangsters break into his house and kill his and beat him up then they steal his car and get awaythe next day the boy tells his dad what he did and his dad figures out who the person is and tells his son that he messed with the wrong manwe find out the boys dad is actually a gangster too and he knows a lot of dangerous people including i love the dialogue he spokeits not what you did son its who you did it to that nobodythat nobody is john nobody messes with the son says im not afraid of john the dad says you should bethen the boy says who is he the bogeymanthe dad says hes not the bogeyman hes the man you send to kill the bogeymani thought that was really funny dialogue and i laughed at thatthe film has touches of dark humour in it which i liked but the best thing about this film is the badass over the top action basically goes after the same men that attacked him and killed his doghes angry and he wants vengeance and he takes his vengeance and beats up and kills dozens of gangsters without a doubt is one of the coolest gangster revenge films ive ever seenthe fight scenes were well choreographed and the directing and editing were also good and the film has a good idea about a motel for hit men which i thought was funny in all honesty is more of a serious film and not a funny one but i noticed small bits of dark humour in it one of the best scenes in the movie is when shoots and beats up dozens of people in the night club just blows his way past all of them like a killing machine and he keeps going until he gets to the boy that killed his the story may sound ridiculous but its notit actually works in this film because of the seriousness of the situation also has fun lines of dialogue like people keep on asking me if im back well yeah im thinking im back knows how to fight and he is a badass killing machine in this movie and i wanted him to get his revenge on the gangsters that ruined his life was a brutal character but hes also a character you want to see kick ass and get revenge because the bad guys deserve it basically the character snaps and goes on a massacre it was obvious that losing his wife was hard enough for him but when he lost his too it sent him over the edge which is why he did what he did to sum things up the film has good fight scenes and good gun fights there is never a boring moment in this film its pacing is great it was always moving and it was a blast to watchit is a very entertaining badass action film,reality
the guys wife dies his gets killed he kills 100 people and steals a from a shelter great plot great acting such a wonderful movie,reality
all i can say is woah absolutely brilliant i never expected a hit man movie to be this awesome in fact i am surprised that i completely missed this movie and the only reason that i decided to watch it was because the poster for the sequel was just awesome okay maybe one shouldnt judge a movie by its poster but unfortunately i happen to be one of those people that get completely suckered in by a really cool poster however after watching this film im not really all that convinced that the sequel is going to be anywhere near as awesome as this film i have to admit that i have always been attracted to hitman movies though as it turns out pretty much every hitman movie that i have watched has ended up being little more than rubbish that is until i saw this movie which left me absolutely gobsmacked almost every aspect of this movie was brilliant that it pretty much grabbed me right from the beginning and dragged me in right until the end that is one amazing thing about this film and that was that it ended really really well and even had quite a number of interesting twists in it that left me breathlessis a hitman though he has since got out of the game however his wife dies of cancer but her parting gift is a little puppy one day a couple of days after her funeral this guy decides he wants his car so he breaks into his house kills his and steals the car well it turns out to be a really big mistake mind you this kid happens to be the son of the head of the russian mafia but that doesnt phase one bit because he used to work for the russian mafia and he was really really good at what he did this is why the russian mafia attempts and fails abysmally and getting rid of him firstone of the really cool things about this film is that within a short space of time it creates this world in which inhabits and it is a world where things dont always go according to plan it is a world of shifting alliances and friendships that allow people to control their destiny even though is the protagonist he doesnt kill all of the antagonists because this world that has been created actually does a really really good job of dealing with these problems in a realistic manner further not everybody dies which also adds to the awesomeness of the filmthis is an action movie pure and simply honestly i really dont know why anybody would have expected anything along the lines of the godfather  it was never meant to be as such it is its own film set in its own world with its own laws it is a film where you can walk through the streets of new york with a machine gun and a world where the police who know who you are will turn a blind eye to what is in effect a mass murder in the end it is one awesome wild wide and if you love a good old fashioned action film then you will simply not be disappointed  especially since it comes down to the fact that they killed his dog,reality
yeah corny title for a review of a very not corny movie i knew going in that it was going to be a solid frame of gratuitous violent action and i was not disappointed ive rewatched this movie a number of times and i love it every single time i hate the killing scene as i have of my own but root for him the entire time he takes his violent vengeance as is completely justified and should anyone ever harm one of my they should expect similar response from me   but it honestly makes the plot so much more it actually engenders an emotional investment from the audience as they cheer on john in his quest to avenge his fallen petthe best part though is the fact that keaneau reeves actually understands what he is doing and it shows that little bit of authenticity theres video of him training for this on youtube and he does it every bit as well as the pros do just takes this movie up and over the edge to awesometheres not a lot to think about here but when you just want a nice chill evening with no deep thoughts this movie will definitely work and it wont put you to sleep,reality
i got a couple recommendations to see this movie from friends and heard online that it was great huge disappointment i am legitimately annoyed that i watched that at times it was so cringe worthy i wanted to look awaythe plot is very shallow there is little character development and the action movie clichs are off the radar its like a preteen action movie enthusiast wrote this and no one critiqued it my favorite part was john leguizamos scene but its all downhill from therei thought maybe keanu wrote and directed this himself since he is so adept at shooting guns in real life and maybe he wanted to show it off also since you would have to be so full of yourself to even do this movie but the firefights were boring and as you can imagine gun handling prowess is not exactly entertainingthe thing is straight from the beginning you can tell its bad but you say well maybe it will get better there is nothing original about the badassness being displayed it is painfully contrived i am gonna have to draw up an action movie script myself to see if maybe being original is hard at this point just to try to justify the staleness of this moviethe whole boogeyman thing was corny and keanu did not do anything we havent already seen a million times before and how about when he was taking a shower and all you see is the pillsbury doughboy and you expect me to believe he is the deadliest killer alive i would have liked to have seen a more cerebral assassin style of rampage mode movie do not recommend i would recommend wanted over this its got a better stylized action,reality
you could have written this on the back of a napkin guys is murdered guy goes mental efficiently killing those responsible the end theres no colour to the story whatsoever there are only garish colours in the nightclub scenes if all you need to think something is cool is to see people getting beaten up or shot then join the army indiscriminately colouring random subtitles to look like comic book speech panels got old fast toothis is going to make me sound all get off my lawn if i hadnt already but action movies used to be done so much better these days apparently all you need to make a popular action film is some fast editing and fight choreography with the barest hint of a premise that absolutely no thought has gone into fleshing out  the end result being that the finished product has less depth than a puddle i must be demanding but for what i want out of even the most streamlined revenge flick that just aint good enough,reality

never kill an action heros all hell breaks loose in the sadomasochistic rrated revengethriller because the malevolent villains not only steal our heros to die for vintage 1969 mustang but they also murder his had these unsavory felons had contented themselves with the mustang they might have survived the ordeal watching the ferociously violent rekindled memories of director antoine fuquas conspiracy theory thriller shooter 2007 where the villains made the fatal mistake of killing mark wahlbergs bob lee swagger the wahlberg hero in shooter cleaned everybodys clock after he buried his basically keanu reeves does the same thing to the heartless hooligans who slew his adorable puppy pits our resilient hero against the malignant russian mafia infesting new york city like a cancer much like denzel washington did in the equalizer most of the ruffians who died in the equalizer perished offscreen and we were shown their twisted bodies sprawled like bloodstained laundry after the fact unlike denzels sympathetic goodguy vigilante keanu reeves is cast as a retired russian hitman who exterminates everybody in sight without a qualm along the way our hero has his nose bloodied his ribs kicked in and stitches sewn up in his stomach matrix stuntman turned film director chad stahelski has taken scenarist derek kolstads formulaic bmovie screenplay and fashioned it into a cynical rapidfire actioneer with the doubledigit body count of asian director john woos classic hard boiled if you havent heard of john woo then is comparable to the two gareth evans hardknuckled nonstop thrillers the raid 2012 and the raid 2 2014 kolstads largerthanlife script recalls venerable genre classics like the lee marvin shootem up point blank 1967 and the hardasnails mel gibson movie payback 1999 a lone gunman in both point blank and payback wipes out the mob in a metropolitan city if you cannot tolerate seeing dozens of gunmen getting riddled with bullets you should skip after a string of forgettable halfbaked thrillers and fantasies including the day the earth stood still the private lives of pippa lee man of tai chi and 47 ronin reeves appears to have recovered his poise with this high body count pistol operathe hardbitten keanu reeves title character hung up his hardware after he fell in love with helen bridget moynahan of battle los angeles an angel in disguise who saved him from a life of crime unfortunately she succumbed to a fatal illness and died at the hospital with john at her bedside before she passed away helen has the presence of mind to write a farewell card to her husband and attach it to a pet taxi containing a cute floppyeared puppy our dryeyed hero weeps at the memory of his long lost wife and prepares a place at the foot of his bed for daisy one day while is fueling up his mustang with gasoline a carload of rude russians cruise in to the convenience store one of the russians iosef tarasov alfie allen of atonement admires ride and asks him how much he would sell it for its not for sale replies without a second thought when iosef mutters in russian that everything has a price rebuts him in russian that his mustang is not for sale later that evening after he has gone to bed alone awakes as daisy starts barking and scampers off the bed and downstairs no sooner has followed daisy to investigate the disturbance in his sleek ultramodern house than he is knocked down and violently beaten up the three thieves confiscate his car keys and iosef kills poor daisy later iosef and his accomplices careen into an automobile chop shop run by aureilo john leguizamo of carlitos way for new papers and a vin number areola refuses to accommodate them he goes so far as to punch iosef in the face iosefs father viggo tarasov michael nyqvist of london

empire before retired viggo witnessed kill three ruffians in a bar with nothing but a pencil unfortunately we dont see repeat this rather astonishing act nevertheless is a crack shot with any kind of gun and drives a car like a racer immediately viggo hires the next best hitman alive marcus william dafoe of the boondock saints but sets up the contract on a firstcomefirstsell basis for anybody like i said earlier all hell breaks loose and everybody relies on the same cleanup crew to mop up the blood bodies and broken glassnaturally is barely believable this is a slambang shootem up done with a straight face and a cast of familiar faces dodging bullets in new york city everybody wears body armor and packs extra pistols when shoots an adversary he puts at least three slugs in each adversary with a coup de grace to the head sure blood splashes from these wounds but it isnt gratuitous like saving private ryan stahelski stages everything as if he were directing a spaghetti western bodies spin topple and stagger here and there stahelski slips in a surprise or two because may be indestructible but the russian mobsters arent totally asinine isnt strictly about guys with guns actress adrianne palicki shows that gals can be just as lethal with firearms too british tough guy ian mcshane of deadwood fame makes a memorable appearance as the owner of an offlimits nightclub motel who doesnt cater to killers killing killers on his premises although it isnt wholly original and is often predictable qualifies as a sizzling saga with slimy villains and lots of kinetic bulletpiercing action,reality
i have to say given the hype i was quite disappointed in this effort i expected way more story and at least some intrigue instead the film is an hour and a half of keanu running around slickly shooting various different people in the head hes angry that they killed his his only chance at acceptance and peace after the death of his wife and goes around dispatching everyone who gets in his way with head shot after head shot thats it honest to god that is the entire film and its not even a spoiler because the trailer tells us as much theres no other plot and nothing to any supporting character whatsoever the kill action is again slick but nothing rises above cut video game type sequences at least it does make a viewer stop and ponder why all the action movies we grew up watching dont factor in close range gun shots to the head more often,reality
too bad i had to give this movie a 1 rating it really deserves a zero i cant believe at one time it had an 8 at least now its on its way down i enjoy action films but they should have some sense of reality and character development has neither gratuitous violence on 100 i lost count bad guys who are seemingly just waiting to be dispatched by john no attempt at creative engagement of the bad guys just show up at a particular location and start shooting shoot 20 or more bad guys at a nightclub on the dance floor while people keep dancing give me a break more like a video game than an engrossing entertaining movie i kept waiting for my countdown counter to reach zero which seemed to take forever an hour and 40 minutes totally wasted if youre over 15 skip it,reality
this is my first review of any movie ever i cannot believe i just wasted that time watching this garbage i gave it 1 out of mercy and an extra because keanu reeves doesnt say much bonus this is the 2014 version of cobra starring sylvester stallone i would like to go into detail but i dont want to have to recall the terrible scenes againon a positive note the trailer seemed decent save your time watch the trailer and dont watch the movie you may thank me somedayyou are welcome,reality
on one level a kind of cartoony action film for fans of kron a deeper level the films asks profound questions about valuable skills lost to society when competent people retireon an historical level this film may be an unintended tribute to director michael winner who died the year it was in productionthis was exactly and precisely the sort of film that winner specialized in back in the glory days would have starred charles bronson again sadly no longer with ushaters begone if jcvd and segal can keep churning out muck at a age when they should be in rocking chairs lets give good old kr a little rope  and then wait to see who he hangs with it,reality
is an interesting film that came and went before our eyes yet those who did decide to give it a chance seem to love it very much its certified fresh on rottentomatoes and has a 75 rating on imdb as of right now impressive for a film that is basically one shoot out after the nextafter the nextafter the nextan ex hitman comes out of retirement after hes attacked by three thugs in his home this attack leaves him beaten without a car and a dead which was given to him by his recently deceased wife big mistake once these guys tries to sell the muscle car to a garage that strips parts the owner seems to instantly recognize it the man asks whos car this is who cares the young spoiled brat replies i can tell you one thing we beat his ass to get it and his stupid too bam punched in the face the kid goes crying to his mob boss of a father who then calls up that mechanic did you punch my son in the face yes sir i did why he asked well sir because he stole john carand killed his oh crapthis sets up the film the classic revenge tale nothing really new here weve seen dozens of films where the retired killer has to come out of retirement to revenge the death of a loved one this time it happens to be a canine the is adorably cute and my wife was in tearstears i tell you when they killed the poor pup about one scene before it happened she says to me are they going to kill the terrified of the answer that i would not give her well yes they did she instantly wanted to kill everyone so i guess when a gets it you instantly want those responsible dead funny i feel the same way when people die on film no big deal but when an animal dies all hell breaks lose after that is out of the way suits up to take out those who have wronged him it just happens to be the son of his former boss so when the boss finds out he knows hes in trouble so now he has to get to before gets to them thus the body count piles up it piles up in a finely tuned operatic fashion as the action sequences are some of the best in the last few years uses his guns with precision shot to the chest then to the head its robotic one man against a dozen fair fightto say the action in is stylized in an understatement this is one of the best action films in years chad stahelski a stunt coordinator makes his directing debut here so he knows his way around a fight being responsible for such films as the expendables the wolverine tron legacy and many many more i like this new trend of giving people from different departments a chance at the directing chair see what they can bring to the table the man clearly knows his stuff so give him a script to shoot and see what he can achieve he nails it here one impressive sequence has going into a club with multiple levels and rooms and takes out the bad guys one by one first silently then when all hell breaks lose with calm and ease bottom line this is one fun filmreeves never impresses with his acting ability its kind of a running gag with people that he cannot act his way out of a paper bag one scene here has him actually showing some emotion which is when he reads the letter from his wife after receiving the the rest of the film is how bad ass can reeves look while taking out dozens of people the answer really bad ass familiar faces show up such as willem dafoe as another assassin adrianne palicki as a beautifulwellassassin michael nyqvist from the original girl with the dragon tattoo series plays the russian mobster whose son alfie allen aka theon greyjoy gets him into this mess as if we needed another reason to hate theon finally ian mcshane as a friendly face in a crowd of so few the world created in is interesting to me these assassins have gold coins that get them into these places that only the secret society of assassins can access there are hidden clubs hotel rooms etc how can all these assassins and hitmen be in a club and not want to shoot each other well there seem to be certain rules dont break them or there might be consequences those club scenes are really fun jonathan sela the dop bathes the film is icy blues and nice neon lighting for those club scenes giving it a heightened look and feel everything about the film feels smooth as ice just like the directing style reflects the lead character aggressive when it needs to be but calm and collected most of the time when i say aggressive boy do i mean aggressive acts like a man with nothing to lose no fear he will walk right into the lions den to get the job done is one of the biggest surprises of 2014 for me while some might call it a no brainer repetitive action film i call it high class action fun fun is the key word here watching dispose of those bodies was fun seeing this society of people who all know each other was fun seeing keanu reeves back in the limelight doing what he does best you called itfun,reality
like many people i rely on imdb ratings and reviews to make decisions about films i have heard little about when i came to look at i was interested due to its overall rating of 75 but became rather concerned about the negative reviews from other users i became convinced that the film had been wrongly rated and that the negative reviews were an honest description of faults many found with the film however there was such huge discrepancy between the comments being left that i decided to read the rotten tomatoes review  which gives the film an 83 and a very solid review so i decided id give the film a try and make my own decisions  man am i glad i didis a slick stylish action film which brings the protagonist out of retirement and returns him to the criminal world where he was once feared as an ultimate hit man everything about the film from keanu reeves acting to car chases and gunfights is slick and thoroughly enjoyable the script and storyline is relatively simple and you do need to read between the lines at points to understand fully we are launched into a criminal world that has rules and a safe hotel where people like can stay gain information get rid of bodies get patched up by a doctor and are safe to stay thanks to the owners rules that no hits are ever to be carried out on site the owner is played by ian mcshane and the hotel manager by lance reddick  both giving superb cameo performances which help create the criminal world shown to us in this filmthe direction photography and style of what is essentially a simple revenge film is fantastic and makes the film highly enjoyable yes there are a few niggles but the usual ones you find in action films  missing a target early on so that has reason to kill more people in his search for him also there appears to be the worst police force in the world operating in this city as they never turn up despite gang war breaking out on the streets and people walking around with assault rifles the only police officer we meet turns a blind eye to john actions so perhaps we are supposed to believe the other cops are doing the same other than that though i completely disagree with all the points being made in the negative reviews posted by other users  i thought the fight scenes were exciting and quite visceral as for the script  this was simple and minimalistic and at times perhaps you need to read between the lines a bits maybe the negative reviewers were unable to do so for me the dialogue was perfect fitted in with the style of the film and lines were delivered well by all the actorsoverall this is a really fun revenge story with slick action scenes and good acting from all involved if youre looking for a simple revenge story which is a lot of fun then i definitely recommend you watch dont rely on the negative reviews some have posted but make up your own opinion and like me i think you will find to be worthy of praise and seen as probably the best action film of 2014,reality
when i fist saw the trailer of this film i had mixed reviews i didnt really know what to think of it as the idea behind the whole film sounds childish and i thought the storyline will be very weak but boy this film topped my expectations the way keanu reeves own this character humble but really confident ready to have his revenge at all cost makes the movie worth every minute and as it goes on and on the plot gets clearer and clearer this is one other character i can compare to jason bourne after robert mccall from the equalizer great performance in terms of acting fighting choreography and visual effects as well i loved everything about this film its a must watch,reality
keanu reeves is back and better than ever in this smart revenge movie unlike most of the reviews and over analysis we all really need to remember the point of an action movie the point is the word action if it was anything else or more than exciting all the way through it would be drama or suspense is the ultimate stop to find fearless and badass reeves gives us an action hero that surpasses most typical a or b action films astounding gun play and choreography falls nothing short of amazing and fantastic great cinematography and directing this movie along with taken sets a standard for any other action movie in the future go see it if you love action and fun revenge films,reality
of course the plot is nothing new its your usual revenge story however the delivery of this welltrodden path is told in such a quirky interesting and stylish manner it makes all the differencefirst off the camera work and fights scene are superb please any director making bourne james bond or the awful inception keep the bloody camera on and at a distance this stupid jumping cutting every 2 nanoseconds with a camera 5 centimeters from the nose of the actor is awful it ruins any action moviewe know the story is clich so the director presents the story in a very chic and interesting way which doesnt leave you bored there is also this tongueincheek criminal world with its own rules and quirks which adds to the interesti notice from other reviews there is a lot of focus on the revenue story being boring and routine there are almost no original plots these days most stories are based around a simple plot of love or revenge this is no different but what elevates it above so many other actions films is the style pacing and brilliant fighting scenes it doesnt dwell on the obvious it treats the viewer with some intelligencethere is very little unnecessary obvious jointhedots dialog everything is keep lean fast and minimal it doesnt hide the inevitable story it embraces and celebrates itbefore someone accuses me of being someone with no film experience i am in my 40s and have seen way too many movies i find nearly everything predictable and dull this one was a very pleasant surprise in a sea of mediocrity,reality
in his directorial debut sort of its a collaborative effort chad stahelski shows his skills he had the experience for just this sort of action movie and delivered the goodsthe script contained just the right amount of background play to set in motion the taken rambo style you picked the wrong guy to fck with adventure is a retired legendary hit man whose love for a good woman had rescued him from the dark side that is until the dumb ass son of a russian mobster robbed his car and killed the only reminder of cherished wifeafter 47 ronin i was eager to see keanu in this type of adventure now admittedly the cast of this movie with the likes of michael nyqvist willem dafoe adrianne palicki john leguizamo and ian mcshane gives it panache if i may say sothe only lovable character was the puppy a gift from his late wife received the day of the funeral as another imdb reviewer said if someone killed my puppy under such circumstances id go boogeyman too but who has skills like there is much collateral damage in this movie and the bodycount is in the neighbourhood of 80 78 according to one source and 84 anotheron the downside i thought resilience to gunshot wounds and knife injuries one self inflicted but thats complicated to explain was a bit of a stretchsaw several good action movies in 2014 and this late october one was entertaining if of course you like the genre i like most all genreson a final note avoid hotels by the name of continental,reality
this film is my favourite film ive seen in a long while yes the script isnt up to much also the plot line has a few holes but a movie is something to be enjoyed and i certainly did with this movie keanu reeeves best performance in ages he doesnt say much which is always a bonus as he can spoil a film by talking and trying to actthe characters are a little false and they are about as deep as a puddle of wee but who cares by the end of the film i was emotionally involved in the film and was seriously upset by the prospect of not making it overall i cannot express in words how much i enjoyed this film no matter what people say,reality
i love beagles i love a movie where a cold blooded bad ass avenges the death of a beagle i love john leguizamo even though he was only in one scene there could seriously be a spin off tv series set at the continental hotel the most intriguing and provocative character in the movie the entire time i watched this film i kept thinking to myselfi love this hotel russian mobsters and gangsters and bathhouses tons of hand to hand and basic bad assery set in an underground world where everyone is on the same page and keeps the status quo maintained flawlessly filmed and stylized in comic book modus operandi a total freaking blast and just a good way to blow off steam i smell cult classic and keanuwhat a freaking phenomenal action star,reality
keanu reeves is back in form as   and how keanu must have been waiting for a long time to play a role like this both john wife and the she had gifted him get killed and he sets out to avenge their deaths the movie is approximately an hour and a half long and comprises of some insane action sequences coupled with some amazing background music and keanu justifies playing a role like this all the more because his name is synonymous with  the matrix trilogy and speed ever since the matrix movies released ive always wanted keanu to play meaningful actionoriented roles unfortunately he hadnt managed to bag such roles until he signed for this moviekeanus looks in this movie have been planned in accordance with the nature of his character and the trying times his character is shown to be going throughalso another plus point of this movie is that the villains look menacing in an outanout action thriller like this its imperative that the villains look their parts and each and every one of them have played their parts to perfection willem dafoe does a fantastic job as marcusso keanu reeves has been a part of a good movie after a long hiatus whch is why people should go to the nearest theater and watch this movie as soon as possible,reality
this is the perfect middleaged progression of the asswhipping genre weve still got it we can still kick booty the movie doesnt pretend to be anything it isnt and delivers everything it is supposed to graphically violent but hey its gangsters getting offed so the heart strings stay intact while the pulsepounding action ensues the fight scenes were well executed unique so the predictability didnt matter one does find oneself saying really get another car and i would have changed the explanation instead of it gave me hope which didnt make sense something about it being the last gift from beyond the grave of his beloved wife to remind him of her wishes for his future thus a personal reminder of walking away from dirt like ioseph which would have been a better segue for viggos speech the gas station scene could have made it a little clearer was tenuously hanging onto inexplicable aggressions after losing his wife prematurely later made clear when we discover the truth of his occupation gripping fingers white on the steering wheel it also needed some explanation why only had a beagle puppy for an alarm system unlikely for a former hit man former not ex ioseph might have explained when viggo is chastising him for riling the boogeyman that explains why his security system was so good we almost didnt get in one line then show disarming it before the big home invasion so many intriguing touches like the dinner reservations the gold coins the carlton and ian mcshane running it although i dont think he should have called john jonathan totally different name unless they spelled it jon great to see keanu reeves in a movie that he was perfect for and in totally believable in the roll like many attractive men his looks have evolved into distinguished and more awesome to watch on the big screen he has that star charisma that never fades and its too bad we dont see more of him almost no role was a throwaway john luguizamo perfect willem defoe spoton michael nyqvist riveting really well cast all of it although dean winters role seemed strangely superfluous and of course we wanted to get his car back maybe when the hotel manager slid car keys across the counter and said it was a gift keanu recognizes his mustang keys slides them back and says hang onto that for me ill take what i came in definitely buying this when it comes out on dvd,reality
keanu reeves shot to superstardom in speed and that was a stunning two decades ago five years after crashing a bus through la he reaffirmed his star status in the then groundbreaking scifi action flick the matrix since then the actor of mixed ancestry has dabbled in a number of highprofile projects and indie titles produced an acclaimed documentary and directed his very first feature but he has yet found a role that ranked alongside jack traven and neoall thanks to stunt coordinators and performers david leitch and chad stahelski founders of action outfit 87eleven reeves has finally found a character that redefined his flagging career forgive his almost soulless appearance in 47 ronin you want a badass keanu reeves action vehicle you have it in the script by the little known derek kolstad reeks of minimalism its purely a lazy action movie one that frankly never pushes beyond the boundary yet somehow it works under the hands of leitch and stahelski and the casting of our leading manwith hardly a lull reeves plays a mysterious exassassin a man so powerful at his craft that people jitters at the mere mention of his name however decides to retire after his wife fell sick and after the death of his beloved partner devoted his time to care for his pet  the last gift given by his late wife unfortunately the son of a russian mobster iosef alfie allen from game of thrones punctuates quiet life after he took a fancy to ford mustang isoef ambushed at his home in the middle of the night took his muscle car and gasp killed his the ruthless act trigger the anger back in and what follows is the ultimate revenge against those who are hired to stop him from killing iosef and the target himself the movie is structured predictably that you already knew whats coming to its credit is never pretentious it served to entertain and it accomplished its goal with much ease in the end leitch and stahelski are such oldtimers in the stunt field that most of the action seen in is both beautifully and brutally executed men are often stabbed kicked disabled and shot in the face and to the talented production designers the numerous action sequences actually took place in a number of different locations such as a disco club parking lot and hotel room just to give it a little variety the raw bloody gunplay reminisces one of early john woo movies and its definitely a visual feast cinematographer jonathan sela max payne a good day to die hard provides the movie with a chilling moody feel at the same time keeping his lenses glued to the ground forsaking the usage of crappy shaky camsjust when you thought kolstads storytelling is so uneventful he manages to throw in surprises after surprises besides the laugh outloud sardonic humour the world of thugs assassins in is much more than mere clichd tough russian mobsters a promising setup for more sequels to come killers stayed in a luxurious hotel and they trade using only gold coins a specialized crew is hired to clean up crime scenes and disposing the bodies there are rules to abide with and everyone in this world comes with a pricebesides reeves doing his tough guy routine and should i add he is damn good at it bridget moynahan i robot also has a small role as wife seen in a brief flashback montage swedish actor michael nyqvist ghost protocol plays the movies main villain iosefs mobster daddy and he plays it ubercool everyones favourite character actors willem dafoe and ian mcshane play a fellow assassin and a mysterious hotels owner respectivelywhen it comes to voting for a stylish action packed movie for 2014 easily wins hands down if you missed denzel washington hunting down russian thugs in the equalizer then dont miss keanu reeves hunting down russian thugs its just as crazy but with a in the latter i declared the winner who can resist a cute puppy with bambi eyes,reality
this was a good awful movie i have no idea how this movie has a stellar rating and hype it was the most clichd action shooter movie the plot follows the narrative of old first person video games the whole plot can be summarized in a single sentence bang bang kill kill you kill my i kill your family that is it movie is nothing but poorly choreographed gunfights a teenager can write a better plot all the elements in this movie are so clichd an over the top invincible hero who is able to kill hundreds of guys efficiently a female assassin whom he spares typical mafia boss antagonist a completely predictable plot this may amuse you if youre a 15 year old otherwise please avoid it,reality
absolutely remorseless purely unadulterated  downright violent from start to finish is possibly the most stylishly crafted feverishly paced seamlessly executed intensely entertaining  immensely satisfying action flick to come out from hollywood after a very long time which apart from marking a welcome return to action for keanu reeves also triumphs as one of the biggest cinematic surprises of the year not to mention the coolest by farvery refined in its visual presentation taking a noholdsbarred approach with its content  providing heavy doses of pulsepounding entertainment that many viewers will want to revisit again n again is amongst the most impressive looking motion pictures of the year that takes its simple premise to an unexpected high thanks to its kinetic direction breathtaking action neat cinematography slick editing  a magnificent lead performance from keanu reevesthe film tells the story of its titular character who used to be an ultimate assassin but retired to take care of his dying wife losing her to cancer he receives a posthumous gift from her in the form of a puppy with whom he eventually connects things are set in motion when few russian thugs invade his home to steal his car but also end up beating him  killing his and so the exhitman comes out of his retirement to unleash carnage on the gangsters who took everything away from himproduced  directed by the first time filmmakers in chad stahelski  david leitch who until now had worked in the film industry as stunt coordinators marks a stunning directional debut for both of them  is a spectacular start to their filmmaking careers and derek kolstads screenplay doesnt waste much time in setting up its premise or introducing its characters  gets right down on business from the start by telling just enough about to get the plot movingtechnically there is a lot to admire about as the film exhibits an otherworldly setting for a revenge thriller that makes minimal use of elements not relevant to the plot camerawork makes its mark in the closecombat sequences for it provides a clear view of the carnage  isnt ruined by excessive editing or shaky cam editing paces the story with vicious velocity while its cool soundtrack further enhances the experience by remaining in tone with the films eventscoming to the performances the film features a capable cast in keanu reeves willem dafoe michael nyqvist alfie allen ian mcshane john leguizamo  others amongst which both reeves  dafoe end up impressing the most with a character thats tailormade for his talent  combined with his magnetic screen presence reeves delivers a swashbuckling performance  easily steals the show dafoe follows him close  despite his short role manages to leave his markyet the best thing about remains its action sequences that are stupendously carried out with its debutant directors already wellversed in the field of action choreography  stunt work the two manage to add new freshness to the combat sequences by nicely blending its gunplay with grounded martial arts to singlehandedly elevate into the league of cinemas finest action entertainers to come out in recent yearson an overall scale is a smart sophisticated  incredibly wellpolished cinema that nicely balances its highoctane action  finely enacted drama to succeed as a potent kinetic  relentless entertainer helmed by two new directors who understand what great action is about boasting a script that knows where to draw the line  spearheaded by keanu reeves badass performance is an instant classic that comes as a must for every action film fanatic out therewelcome back mr reeves welcome back,reality
i went into nearly completely blind i am certain i did not see a single trailer for it i knew it had keanu reeves and i knew it was about a man out for vengeance when his is killed it sounded almost silly but i expected there would be more to it and there was actually there is a whole lot of back story here and a million different directions this could go in if they chose to franchise it its a dark twisted violent martial arts action film that was often brilliantly choreographed and reminded me of perhaps a luc besson film or john woo only goodim not a woo fan its not quite an 80s action throwback but more of a 90s action throwback fans of the matrix will rejoice in this return to that style of film for reeves the story is actually very good and you very quickly begin to understand just how dangerous is essentially you start the film knowing nothing about him but you quickly understand a little about his past and the world he ran in and how dangerous he is one of the best things about is the world the film makers bother to create behind the story going on you have a mysterious underground organization of hit men and women a club that is a safe zone and a network of killers that rub elbows together all of that collides into this blood bath and its insanely fun to watchi cant honestly say ive see keanu reeves in anything i was impressed with since constantine i feel like he often forgets what people love to see him in and that has always been action this returns him to full form and he doesnt miss a beat i dont know how much of his own stunts and fighting he does but he kicks some serious a and looks great doing it i would watch this film a second time just to catch some of the more intense moments alfie allen is fantastic as the whiny privileged son of a mobster who crosses you actually ache to watch allen get destroyed and hes perfectly irritating in all the right ways in order to make sure the story has a proper villain we have michael nyqvist as his father he definitely has an air of villainy to him and hes the perfect adversary to you can just feel the history between the two characters willem dafoe is fantastic in a small role as a fellow assassin we know that he and reeves also have history and we dont know what and we never really find out but we know there is a relationship there dean winters is the perfect number one henchman and his role is perfectly used and placed adrianne palicki is actually amazing as a seriously deranged female assassin she could stand to have a whole movie on her alone and honourable mentions to ian mcshane lance reddick and john leguizamo in cameo roles that are really terrific no matter how big or small a role in this film is i thought they did a great job at establishing this world exists in and the circles he once ran in and with i want more that is the best compliment i can givenow this is director chad stahelskis first directorial credit this usually means a film reeks of inexperience however if you look at the sheer number of films that stahelski has worked on in stunts and assistant directing and producing you will see that he has been building an incredible resume of experience and proves that he has a style that is near perfect this revenge type of martial arts film i cringed i nearly cried i cheered i veered i didnt want it to end its not a critically brilliant film but its nearly perfectly entertaining the story is a little predictable in the idea that a hitman leaves the business because he falls in love only to be drawn back in when something terrible happens thats not a new concept although his anger being triggered by the death of a puppy is a new angle action fans take note because if you havent seen you are missing out this is a return to greatness for reeves and i could easily watch this again and may even add it to my collection it holds nothing back and lives up to its r rated which is also unusual nowadays because of this film i anxiously await to see what stahelski does next 8510,reality
this movie was watchable but seriously an 8 again i find these ratings are given out of context meaning that its not being compared to other movies the plot is basically a hit man is wronged and kills everyone in the mob gang who wronged him thats basically it how many times can we watch keanu reeves kill someone with a gun the idea that 40 gunmen cant stop him is also ridiculous why didnt they post two snipers in that club who would shoot him as soon as he entered really no one other human no matter how many can hit this man with a gun it all gets super repetitive and ridiculous by the end it was just boring yes good acting good filming etc it gets all that and the world they created was ok the only reason it gets a 6 not a 4 or 5 really skip this one,reality
when disease takes the wife of former contract killer he can find no respite apart from a gifted to him by his wife so that he will have something to focus his love on to prevent him from slipping back into his former dark ways a chance encounter with a russian thug sees connection to this life severed and he sets out for vengeance  a path that will take him up against the most powerful criminal gang in the cityalthough it does start with a satisfyingly meaty emotional base this film is one long action sequence of impossible acts and violence with seemingly looking to get extra xp from headshots there is of course a limit to the appeal of this but it is hard not to enjoy the mindless dark heart of this whole film as it relentlessly drives forward with little thought of external logic instead selling itself hard and fast throughout mostly this approach works with minimal setup it is not long before the violence begins in earnest and it is solidly and stylishly done throughout with slick design and satisfying setpieces the style does help because with being pretty much the terminator it is not always easy to feel any tension from peril so instead we get the tension from the relentlessness and the speed of movementreeves is a good lead for this since it does essentially require him to be emotionless and enigmatic  both of which he can pull off he is surrounded by familiar faces all of whom feel like maybe they were wasted by being in the film for only short times each but all of which give the film a sense of quality  and everyone does produce something even if they only have one or two scenes also fun for fans of the wire to see the couple of faces showing up all told this is not the reinvention of action movies as some have said but it just a reminder of how they should be done well  enough emotional grit for us to care and then good solid relentless action the rest of the way it is nonsense as so much of this genre is but it is visceral tough dark and really quite fun,reality
fans of keanu reeves rejoice he actually cries in this movie yes the man is able to show some sort of halfad personality in this film that people just eat up you want a review heres a review this is one of the most pathetically cheesy hollywood films ever made and to top it off its all the more reasons for the average lowintellect american to absorb the watered down caricature version of new russia as a native russian speaker i couldnt even understand any of their fake senseless babbling that they call russian its all the tacky predictable bull hollywood junkies crave its all the fighting shooting fancy cars explosions and blood and minimal plot line that an antiintellectual could ever ask to see take everything typical and combine it all into one lame hollywood failure i cant believe i lasted 34th of this retarded movie and it miraculously won awards wow ,reality
wow i really loved this movie the action was well shot the acting was spot on for this kind of movie and the nonchalant humor was simply brilliant and pushed this movie beyond my expectations i might be over overpraising this film but in the last few years action films have been horrible this is mostly due to those terrible liam neeson disposable action movies on the other hand felt like an old school action film with a wry self awareness that worked without parodying action films while keanu reeves often gets labeled as a bad actor ive always enjoyed seeing him on screen i think this is because he has a natural warmth and likability that arguably transcends his talents they actually play on it in for example he kills a lot of people in this film and yet everyone still likes even the cops turn the other cheek because he is just so damn likable i think that also goes for the film as whole its the kind of film that we probably shouldnt like but we cant help ourselves i think this one might even be remembered as an action classic in a few years i look forward to seeing this again and again and it will probably become one of my favorite go to late night dvds,reality
this is a stylized action movie that the director describes as gunfu in the dvd extrasthe plot and story for this movie is very light and superficial and feels like it has been lifted from a comic book there are clichd russian gansters and is the assassin with seemingly unearthly killing skills i found the movie enjoyable but i can see why some reviewers hate it if you are after an interesting story this is not the movie for you if you like comic book movies and gunfu action sequences you will probably enjoy it,reality
i hate movies which include because somewhere along the line that is going to get killedi guess im a sensitive man but at the beginning of this movie when our hero receives a present of a little spaniel from his wife who had died of cancer this film took on heart but it was all short lived because the got killed by thugs who beat up our hero and then you hear the yelp and then you see the from its back lying dead by when he wakes up from his beatingthe character has heart he cries at his wifes grave side i lost my own wife to cancer in september last year 2014 so i could empathize with the characterall in all this was a very good movie with excellently rehearsed fight scenes very cleverly directed but getting passed the doggy being killed kind of spoiled it for me,reality
i was really inbetween 7 and 8 as a score for the movie to be honest this is a relative rating for me i have rated better movies with less but this movie in relation to others of the genre is simply awesome to attempt to break down the logic of the movie a bit the reasons why keanu goes after this pathetic excuse of a son are not logical any reasonable person would expect him to accept the mobsters offer and get the car back and a new well guess what if he had done what was reasonable we would not have a movie in the end what happens after that is actually against all logic and its what i love about the movie he goes into impossible situations just to survive and some more in my mind he could be a tarantino character this guy i assume that no one would complain then overall his character the situations and the discussions in the movie seem to me like reading a comic or graphic novel of some kind his face his way of moving everything generated still images of a comic book in my mind this is what i loved about the movie and this special flavor in the end made me love it it was watching a movie and reading a good graphic novel all in one the acting from the fathercrime lord is from my point of view exemplary for any type of movie and of course i loved the addition as the receptionist of the guy from fringe tv series i am really bad with names the ending is satisfactory for me although i would have liked more a a slower death for the son and b a quicker death for the mobster father since he gave him all this crap in the movie overall a nice way to spend your evening if you are not up for a really mindpuzzling movie keanu reeves was really good for the first time after quite some movies,reality
a basic straight forward bare bones plot makes way for what may be the greatest action flick in over a decade serves as a breath of fresh air for the action genre jam packed with slick and stylish gun play judo jiu jitsu highly quotable dialogue and of course the seemingly immortal keanu reeves himself now age 50 the cinematography is beautiful the soundtrack is killer the action scenes are allowed room to breathe and unfold in a way that is always satisfying and never cluttered or confusing as previously stated the story is bland yet no one cares the movie is just damn fun why should it need to be anything other than what it is,reality
when i first heard the movie title i was thinking this movie was going to be awful boy was i wrong is on of the best action films i seen in years it starts off very touching and you feel a lot of sympathy for mrthen he turns up the volume until the speakers pop keanu reeves is at his prime in this movie it makes me wonder where hes been so glad he came back in a movie like this one dont let people trick you into the thinking this is the keanu from the matrix cause its not this is the keanu reeves youve been craving to see this is one man you dont want to mess with and someone u want on your side hope to see more from him but i really think its going to be hard to put up another performance like this one great movie and it definitely belongs in your movie collection two thumbs way up,reality
is easily keanus best film since the original and only good film in the franchise matrix the action slowly builds along with the tension as seeks revenge for the murder of his and the theft of his beloved car great scene in the garage when the thieves turn up with stolen car and leguizamo realises whos car it is and what is coming next the bad guys get no sympathy as carnage ensues and reeves is great as the relentlessly cold killer this film is the taken sequel that has never happened nyqvist gets to play a heartless bad guy and mafioso style boss whos son is the primary goal of revenge i disagree with those who say there is no story to this film some of the same people liked speed which is and always has been simply awful and i think the characters are reasonably well thought out and the acting good for a film of this genre overall a very entertaining action thriller,reality
recently with the oscar fever i have been watching mostly drama or real life scenario type of movies i have been wanting to watch for a long while hence yesterday i decided ill give it a go i was in for a super duper action treat mind you the action is mindless crazy shooting he pulls a trigger people die but people will capture him and only talk to him so if you are ready for these kind of logical nonsense then this is the movie for you keanu reeves seems to have got it right he looks convincing as the superhuman superpowered supreme hitman the background score of the movie is the highlight classic stuff for action scenes anybody a fan of the 90s action movie and leave your brain in the locker and watch this movie youll enjoy it,reality
yes i love to death it is a nonstop action i am a huge keanu reeves fan i love his movies but from 2014 is one of my personal favorite action films of all time it is badass fast paced action revenge movie about a new kickass action hero one man army type directed was by chad stahelski and david leitch who both did well job done the story the action the gun blaze action is all in here explosions heavy automatic weapons who are used wellthe only thing i did not like are the characters not all but some of the characters i did not like in here and i did not care for one of the reasons is why i have enjoy the sequel much more it was more creative and passed than the original the was made for 20 million budget in 2014 and made 40 million in the us keanu reeves adrianne palicki john leguizamo willem dafoe and michael nyqvist rip did a good job playing their charactersa retired assassin seeks vengeance against a mobsters son and his cronies for stealing his car and killing his puppy a final gift from his deceased wifethis is a revenge film about retired professional lethal assassin who retired years ago with honor for his wife he made impossible job for russian gangster to get out his wife died by a disease after the funeral john received a present a beautiful puppy from his wife when sadistic young russian thugs senselessly attack and kill his puppy and the last hope of redemption john bury his puppy and armed him self like an one man army as schwarzenegger commando and goes after bad guys like a pure badass he is he kills all hitmans who try to take him out until he gets the mobster sonone of the best badass action films of all time since 2014 the same time come out the equalizer with denzel washington and that movie sucked i hated it it was major disappointment proved it was no major disappointment but it was major improvement or lack of actions today this movie was old school action with no shaky cam so creativity in which in the movie is seen the continental for members of the citys underworld it is frequented by many hitmen and notorious murderers who live by code and rules in this hotel if they break those rules they die on horrible way and they are revoked that is what i mean we see a world with assassins members who live in the continental hotelkeanu reeves become new kickass action hero on his own mission of vengeance i am a huge keanu reeves fan i love this movie to death i love keanus performance and also keanu does not want the movie become a spin off or series this movie should have three movies so that trilogy will end well i support keanu reeves so much from the matrix movies speed constantine street kings and both of the films i love those movies to deathadrianne palicki as ms perkins was great villain as lethal assassin who was hired by viggo tarasov to kill that is one of the reasons why i love this film to death the fight between ms perkins and is badass i love it i love ms perkins to death i love love love and admire adrianne palicki so muchjohn leguizamo had a little role in the movie but i like him and willem dafoe plays a lot of characters villains such a green goblin  norman osborn in spiderman and john geiger in speed 2 cruise control most memorable to me is sgt elias in platoon 1986 who plays a good guy and in this movie he plays marcus a retired assassin and a friend of who saves john lifei love the beautiful songs played in the movie killing strangers by marilyn manson feat tyler bates in my mind  m86 ft susie q think by kaleida who you talkin to man by ciscandra nostalghia it has beautiful songs in the movie i love the movie has tons of action  multiple explosions and tons of bullets fired the film wouldnt be an action movie without some action there is plenty of it you see a lot of car chases and cars flying over cliff stuntman is crazy driven a car in the movieis about entertaining action about a world of assassins who lives by the rules of the continental is all about the action and it goes above and beyond in every respect has the potential to be the next great action franchise this is my personal favorite action film i would defiantly put between the terminator and the rambo movies the original movie is a creative action revenge movie that goes beyond the limits i wish we would get action movies like this more i have this movie on bluray disc in my collection,reality
keanu reeves was a megahero i started lacking trust in the imdb rating,reality
i fell asleep watching this i seriously had no idea what was going on when i found out it is the same director as atomic blonde it all made sense i dont like films with no story breaking news my friends making things look blueishgreen hue doesnt make a movie cool,reality
the movie is 104 minutes long it features 119 people getting killed most of them in graphic detail complete with enhanced sound effectsfor those of you who do not live in their mothers basementthere is less than minimal plotalmost no character development just tons and tons of gore keanu reeves poses his way through every scene as if he is heavily medicatedthere is no range of emotions no nuance no sympathetic characters it is a sad comment about american society that this tripe passes for entertainment even with all this insane amount of violence it end s up being one of the most boring movies i can ever remember seeing,reality
mediocre action movieshortly after his wife is murdered a retired hitman played by keanu reeves is targeted by a russian crime gang after they steal his car and kill his he goes on a revengefueled killing spreestarted fairly well  good build up and backstory after a while however it loses any pretence of characterdevelopment plot development or intrigue and just becomes a simple action movie this is unfortunate as it had some potential in the crimedrama stakes even worse it is action of the perfectly choreographed first person shooter high body count explosionsforthesakeof explosions variety it got rather monotonous and predictable after a whileends up a tad boring and disappointing a bit more plot development and less mindless action and this could have been a good movie,reality
ill keep this short and simple this movie was enjoyable if you like runofthemill revenge action movieshowever if you enjoy movies in which you feel a sense of accomplishment when the bad guy gets his dues this movie is not the one for you in fact hollywood on the whole cant seem to get that right in any movie it must be the liberals that overwhelm that area you know the same ones who know nothing about guns try to ban guns yet profit off movies that use thembad guys torture good guys physically and mentally bad guys get swift painless deathsanother typical crap move by directorswriters is the let the bad guy go so it can come back to bite me later awful and predictable,reality
people might rave on how good action this movie shows to me its just pointless even if i swallow the fact that mr is doing impossible things during the entire film the story about an ex hitman that goes back in business for revenge is so thin that it could have been told in 10 minutes instead of two hours all the movie shows is a thousand ways how to kill someone nothing else basically although nicely filmed its a big pointless yawn in the end keanu reeves does his acting job much much better in the matrix and the action parts there are much more enjoyable waste your time on something with brains behind it this lacks it completely,reality
it was one of the most boring action movies that i have ever watchedthe movie does not have any solid storyline why on earth a movie without solid storyline go to production is beyond mealso the action scenes is not looking like a real action scene i am not going to spoil the movie for you but the idea that you go kill whole bunch of people because they beat you and killed your seems too far fetched i am not suggesting there is no one like that with that amount of rage and anger but to go on a rampage like what the actor was portraying is highly unlikely,reality
this movie is a disgrace to the action cinema world though the actors portray characters well the death of a small puppy is truly horrifying how dare this producer allow a puppy to get beaten i did not happen to see a no animals were harmed in the making of this movie caption and so i assume this director has allowed the death of a small animal as a prominent vegan activist i would like to sue this movie and everyone included i eat a plant based vegan diet and have for 12 years i only get a little hungry sometimes and get a small baconater meal at wendys but besides that i am completely vegan 47 days of the week i hate this movie basset hounds dont deserve this cruelty,reality
i dont know where to start everything about this movie is terrible acting iswellkeanu reeves plot is a string of clichs action is forced and repetitive dialog is straight out of saturday night life spoof screenplay must have been 2 pages long and went something like this  take some kill bill mix in payback and sprinkle in eastern promises and you have a movie except as the old lady in the nationwide commercial laments  this is not how it works  this is not how any of this works  the fact that so many people voted this movie above 7 is a testimony to how low the tastes have fallen this is the chicken mcnuggets of movie making terrible and oh the russian talk and translations for someone who speaks russian like me is just pure rubbish everyone associated with this project should be ashamed of themselves,reality
that basically was the primary thought echoing through my mind during the end credits seriously everybody has to be so damn tough everybody has to revenge bloody everything im talking about the bad guys here not to give anything away but they really set you up fully to expect and enjoy the revenge that has truly been earned by these foolssorry to go off like that but although necessary and ultimately entertaining it is still so bloody frustrating from a strictly intellectual point of view that these stubborn evil ssholes never ever know when to quit geez well clearly giving it a rating of 8 i really did like the film most entertaining very reminiscent of the minimalist clint eastwood man with no name films but brought up to datethe story is simple and with so many reviews there is no need to go into it more here but watching the film i got the strong impression almost like i was watching a video game and i mean that in a good way the action was so smooth and choreographed this is strictly revenge  action entertainment people and very good entertainment at that if you enjoy revenge tales but dont expect mamet or shakespeare here that is just not the point of this filmthats basically it i dont know why i am writing a review when there are nearly 500 already normally i dont but since i had such a friggn blast watching this i just wanted to weigh in as saying that it is lots of fun and very well done keanu is absolutely perfect for it despite your opinion of him if you like a good action  revenge thriller then you probably will really enjoy this its not overly deep or over the top violence wise it just does exactly what it is supposed to do and does it beautifully,reality
action hero has anew name and his name is this is a definite surprise movie for me i didnt expect it to be as good as it waskeanu has been out of the limelight for a while but what an epic come back in my eyes i cant help but think back to bill and ted days this is a far cry from those days the long and short of it is that seeks revenge for the killing of his loved ones not original in idea but still a good moviegreat action scenes lots of fighting gun battles twists and other stuff to make it what it isif you like action movies get it and watch it,reality
in todays day it is as hard to make a good action movie as it is to break box office records thrillers may be based on tried and tested formulate but that is the reason why to bring something new and refreshing becomes harder and harder in this genre is a tale of revenge a man with a violent past who is brought back to the life he left behind when he is brutally attacked and his is killed the plot works because it doesnt try anything new in fact it takes you back several decades to lee marvin in point blank keanu reevess character of is a throwback to lee marvin charles bronson and every other bad ass who doesnt bother to say much but shoots instead this in itself is refreshing just a simple action thriller with no overcomplicated storyline and ingenious twist this movie is quite different to the other great tale of revenge released at the same time the equalizer mainly because keanu reeves is a much different actor to denzel washington is for the lovers of hard action and no frills,reality
forget that garbage that came after t2  this is the real terminator 3  another fairy tale about another indestructible killing machine  yes the fantasy of every child or puppy who ever suffered at the hands of a bully acting did arnie need to act other than being arnie yup keanu has the chops no austrian accent but you cant have everything he mows down the baddies like they were dumb and dumber great photography great muscle cars and a nonstop path of destruction a deadly stare thatll be the last thing the meanies ever see is it realistic of course not its a dream a real bad dream if you fck with the bad mans puppy rated 1 by the spca,reality
this is one stunning film i mean the one that makes you watch it with cooling grace of fantastic acting settings fight scenes quick paced madness that is john the coolest hitman you will know but the kicker with this thrill ride is the way the frame matched perfectly with the acting and soundtrack this soundtrack is beautiful memorizing and enchanting absolutely loved the way it brought you deeper into someone we come to sympathize for for who he really is the paradox you discover along the way totally engaging you highly recommend this loud dark and intense film,reality
this was an unexpectedly good movie starring keanu reeves as john a hitmangangster that was out for five years and simply wanted peace unfortunate or happenstance he crossed paths with a nimrodspoiler free version is just see it lots of stunts and action and it is well choreographed really nice shooting scenes which is filmed really well and the movie is well paced nothing seems forced down the throat its the quintessential guy movieif you like 80s90s action flicks this is a must seei gave it 10 of 10very surprisingly and good action movie must see,reality
this movie was by far one of the best movies ive seen in 2014 keanu reeves did a good job with acting in the movie i personally think was better than the matrix reminded me of the equalizer it was a lot of action threw out the movie it was short and to the point so you didnt have to worry about a whole lot of talking screenplay is fluent storytelling fashion was on point is willing to do what he has to to get what he wantsis a violent dance of bullet and blood that reflects all the years of experience of its director as a stunt man and stunt coordinator the gun battles are whats really good but i give a 10 out of 10 its a pretty good movie and i recommend anyone to go see it,reality
i have always regarded keanu reeves a great actor but some of his choicesopportunities have been bizarre  mildly speaking fortunately puts reeves back on track again  he is the real filler in this movie there are a few short scenes without his presence and quite often he is the only personality visible on screen true one can find similarities with his character in eg matrix and a scanner darkly and the plot has several flaws and airyfairy moments but all this is presented in a stylish and witty manner with both multiple angles and endings reevesis a gloomy and firm man his deeds are certain and final yet and wiferelated scenes are nice and touching and the locality of hotel continental is unconventionalapart from reeves there are many other distinctive performances as well practically all who have verbal roles michael nyqvist as viggo tarasov is a due antagonist to reeves rather frequently there is no proper confrontation because the bad guy is more versatilefascinating than the good guy or vice versaall in all the movie in question is no tarantino but yet a good entertaining action with pleasant performances,reality
what a great year for action films it has been we had the raid 2 which in my opinion is one of the best action films ever made we also had lucy and the equalizer both decent action films american sniper one of the years greatest films i consider it more a drama than a action and in a month kingsman the secret service comes out which looks like it could become one of the all time action greats so because i have had such an anticipation to see a real shoot em up type action film which is why im looking so much forward to kingsman so naturally my anticipation has led me to having a hunger for a good shoot em up action film which is how i was led to which satisfied the heck out of my needswhen i first saw the trailers i knew it wasnt going to be anything real special but i still wanted to see it so now that i finally have i can really say my expectations were exceeded action wise however the story is very simple and weak and almost stupid to be honest i mean seriously the guy sets out on a righteous path of vengeance over a dont get me wrong i love it turns out to not be to stupid though but still you get my point so the weak story was expected but that of course isnt why i watched this film i watched to satisfy my hunger to action and in that department it really deliveredthere are several very notable shoot outs and two of them are extremely relentless if you ask me i can tolerate a weak story if it delivers action so dont expect a story but come hungry for action and you will leave full the performances arent bad either not oscar worthy of course but nothing bad so if you want some cool gun play and action scenes definitely check it out but otherwise you can skip it your choice hope this is helpful thanks for reading my review,reality
the movie is not bad it is a tipical action movielike rambo where a bad ass guy kills enemy individuals in combos of 15 but the plot is good i have read some reviews and they all said that it s a dumb movie because at the beginning of the movie the 3 criminals broke in his home and knocked him the trained hitman out even a trained killer can be knocked out if he is hit with a bat at the back of the head i mean does training get u a thicker shull or what over all i find the movie interesting with pretty good acting and a decent plot i hope you found my review useful  sorry about the grammar mistakes i made english is my second language and i advice u to watch it,reality
keanu reeves is back hell yeahis a movie about well a normal guy whose wife recently died and her dying gift to him was a theon the dk less ahole from game of thrones was being his usual dk self in this movie and decides to kill john and steal his sweet ass mustang little did he know that wasnt just some normal guy and we get our revenge action movie you dont kill someones and steal their ride you just dont while many people might find the plot stupid or something let me tell you there is a lot more to it than a simple revenge tale the movie knows what it is and executes it perfectly but underneath all that revenge there is some really cool world building going on there are these rules managements neutral zones etc which push from being just a simple brainless revenge movie i hope they make sequels to it as there is a lot of potential for this become an awesome franchise coming back to keanu reeves holy s he was awesome in this movie being a keanu reeves fan it is so great to see him finally get a role where he can shine again the dude kills it as he is cool he is sleek and he is a total bada hell he might give liam neeson and matt damon a run for their money p you appreciate him even more knowing that he did 90 of the stunts in this movie because of that the action scenes consisted of long takes instead of the usual quick cuts we see in hollywood movies and made the action so much better couple that with good cinematography slick and sleek directing and pumping soundtrack and you get yourself an awesome rare action movie another thing this movie did well was that even though is shown to be one of the best or the best in his work he is not invincible or immortal at the end he is a human many similar movies forget this point and make their heroes way too good that it takes you out of the experience i really really hope this movie does well enough on the box office that we get a sequel from the same team highly recommended if you are looking for an action movie or are a keanu reeves fan 8510,reality
i saw this movie with my son early last december im not a keanu reeves fanatic i just like very good movies and he starred in this on so my son recommended we see it and i agreed but i did not know what to expect i do know keanu has made the best movies of his career when he moved away from hollywood main production companies this film i think brought it all it is about a man not a good man a man with quite an evil past and has put that past behind him so now it is just him and his then it begins i mean really begins it opens into some of the best action scenes i have seen in years and they are not flash filler they really work this movie moves you from sorrow to anger to wanting revenge such a great movie i had to buy it for my personal collection so i recommend at least renting it there is graphic violence because of the nature and lifestyle career of the characters so no young people recommended,reality
the directorial debut of chad stahelski former stuntman of keanu reeves is everything a fan of the genre for a long time has been expecting with a beautiful choreographed violence with very well made clichs and presenting a small new world of empathic criminals creditors of dangerous deadly skills is the name that everyone should know called to be the best action film of 2014 is a violent dance of bullet and blood that reflects all the years of experience of its director as a stunt man and stunt coordinator each armed combat we have the opportunity to enjoy is wonderfully imagined well polished and sublimely executed by a reeves that finally is back and apparently with a name that could have the title of legend filling the 101 minutes of pleasant clichs derek kolstad delivers a script with a new and unique underworld made out of rules that must be obeyed and a moral code that can be broken if the price is right with a simple plot good humor and a keanu reeves back to his days of antihero chosen by chance is a possible franchise that should continue with its beautifully made clichs that should exaggerate their camera movements and that should fill with cameos every table of that little new world 810,reality
this movie doesnt take itself seriously and that is exactly how a viewer should approach it keanu reeves can act no matter what some people say i cant picture any other actor in this role thats how good he is my only complaint is there arent enough explosions the plot is silly but thats the point it almost seems as if quentin tarantino wrote and directed it one gets that tarantino vibe while watching its a perfect action movie with a few laughs thrown in between is one badass dude that you dont want to cross and he doesnt leave things unresolved eat popcorn shut down your brain and youll have a great time,reality
i just finished watching this moviei can only say that i tremendously enjoyed it from start to finish it is one of keanu reeves best performances since speed and the movie itself is exceptionally goodi repeat exceptionally goodif you liked taken 1 liam neeson then you will love this i would have to even say this is a notch better than taken 1 as it has a lot more action and the fight sequences are very well doneanyone that says this movie is bad or complains about the plot or acting etc needs a reality check action movies have never been known for their story lines and all the drama etc its an action flick so it wont win any big oscars for acting etc but it will give you a thrilling joyridei highly recommend this movie and congratulations to the film and crew on making this instant classic,reality
exciting on the edge of your seat enthralled entertainment throughout the action was very hard hitting and has you jumping with tension a very unexpected great film i sat down expecting another typical shoot em up film but i was very taken in with the first 10 minutes the cute beagle story line did help keanu reeves although quietly reserved plays a convincing fearful hitman assassin for those of you who love a good shoot em up thrill ride from start to finish this is the film for you for the action category i would say this is the best film ive seen this year still early i know but this will take some beating it even beats any action films from 2014 in my opinion i also thought that the soundtrack was excellent and worked very well with the action scenes it almost felt like i was playing a first person shoot em up with my headphones on the film style had a luc besson feel to it in particular kiss of the dragon and had a touch of taken chad stahelski david leitch is a new director to me however i will be keeping an eye on his next work 910 very impressed jkemp,reality
the whole movie is so condensed no nonsense you couldnt see the longwinded plot just intense action serious gunfight and head splattering shots painted in mosaic keanu reeves had definitely paid a large amount of time in training with the use of cqcclosed quarter combat and ipsc shooting with that much of training in his hand all the action scenes became so realistic it made you believe that keanu reeves was the retired killer always finish killing with headshot smallest movement to achieve the goal the discreet and precision of reminded me of the video game  metal gear solid if it would going to produce a movie edition keanu reeves should definitely earn a place in casting it was a good fastpaced and action movie,reality
follows keanu reeves a retired hit man whos wife pasted away he receives a as a final gift from her on his second day with the he encounters thugs who want his car he tells them no and wakes up later that night only to be beaten senseless his killed and his car stolen and he wants revengeeveryone knows that keanu reeves doesnt have the best acting range but when a roll is prefect for him he shines and this is exactly what happens in the film tiptoes the fine line between being ridiculous and over the top as much killing as keanu does is basically to get revenge for his which is borderline stupid but reeves really sells it totally investing in his character and motives another notable actor here is william defoe while i thought his character was underused he wasnt underwritten and that was a nice little thingthe world that this film creates is intriguing and brutal as reeves travels through the criminal underworld various phrases and items are used that are totally foreign even though this is set in new york city characters presumably know what they mean and dont bother explaining them to you this is for the best being in the dark on the little things that make the world what it is is gripping it makes the world feel like its been inhabited for a long time and that sets the film apart from the majority of action flicks as lush as the world is shoddy camera work struggles at bringing it to life on screen the focus seemed to be forgotten in a large number of shots some shots dont even seem to be focused the action scenes look great and are void of the annoying blur but in between these tense action sequences the camera work seems amateur at best maybe it was just the theater i was in i dont know another problem for the movie was its ending well id go as far as to say the entire 3rd act spoilers not much of a spoiler as we all knew reeves would have his revenge but after he takes his vengeance the movie limps on for at least another half hour attempting to tie up loose ends was a bad call here it feels like the film climax and then says oh crap we forgot about him and tries to deal with that and it goes through this 3 or 4 times this is silly to say with an hour forty minute run time but the last half hour just feel unnecessary and overlongoverall delivers on super cool action a surprising level of emotional and a world that feels real is a fine piece of cinema,reality
revenge driven films have always been a top notch example of action andor horror films consisting of a storyline where a main character undergoes a dramatic traumatic and yet sometimes violent ordeal against a person or a group of attackers that leave the victim left for dead and loss of a loved one only to have survived and is now driven for justice and set on taking down the attackers with vengeance is one of those films and not only has that formula but it does give it a fresh take with a wellwritten script polished performances and well staged action sequencesdirected by stunt coordinator chad stahelski alongside david leitch in their first directed feature film they both know how to handle an action flick in terms of direction pace realism and quality they indeed use the best out of the well written script from derek kolstad who ensures that not only is the action present and moving the story along but the character development and pace are taken seriously for the audience to follow and connect story goes that played by keanu reeves who is indeed back in top form not since constantine is a retired hitman who is grief of his recently deceased wife and is coping with the gift of a from her to help john with the pain and loneliness whist out for a drive in his 69 mustang he comes across losef played by alfie allen from tvs game of thrones and his mates who offer to buy his precious ride but john declines and sets off his way but soon after losef and co invade his home and brutally beat him kill his and steal his ride having survived john sets out on vengeance on losef but when he discovers his background history to his past employer michael nyqvist in bad guy form again the war between two sides erupts into revenge that only one will livethe action sequences as mentioned are in top polished presentation consisting of fast kinetic fist fights and shootouts the use of practical stunt work is in favor rather than use cgi for the impossible and the results from its director are clear from experience one of the best sequences of the film is the club house where john attempts to kill losef and his protectors by single handily taking them on onebyone the character of john in particular is ruthless and deadly throughout the film and reeves pulls this off with ease it looks like a mix of the latest james bond daniel craig a dash of jason bourne from the bourne films and bryan mills from taken all rolled into the one character but there is emotion with him as you see in the first half hour of his fall from peace and again it lacks with most revenge driven filmsthe villain is the opposite but the cunningness determination and will to stop john is indeed there and the magic of nyqvist brings this to the screen he was the main villain in mission impossible 4 but he is much used better in this film the supporting cast includes the talents of william dafoe ian mcshane john leguizamo adrianne palicki and dean winters to name a few and they all do give the film justiceis a surprising return to the revenge genre and it has indeed suppressed what the expendables 3 should have been not to say that it bad but in terms of story action character and presentation its indeed worth the ticket price to see it and i highly recommend it for action fans of taken faster and dead man down,reality
the movie was one kickass movie i recommend it to everyone spoiler alertthe special effects were off the chart still had to close my eyes for a fair amount of the head shots on top of that the wrestling maneuvers and the focused shots were a thing of beauty  excellent choreography damn it keanu you just keep getting better and better lololwatching the mustang fly was just beautiful  i pray he got to keep her  wow beautiful 69 the ss camero isnt my favorite by a long shot  clunky tanks but if you got to go out on manhunt maneuvers you might as well as have one of the toughest civilian tanks with you  especially if it had the positraction  the last car a gift from the hotel was a blank slate  both in its lack of detail and my knowledge of new cars fortunately i saw one on the way home and it ended up being a dodge challenger blew me away and it was a real crime to see it get pushed over the side of the dock the car was just a thing of beautythe plot was unassuming romantic and sentimental and perfectly in line with the main character  an assassin who bought his way out of a nightmare shitty world into of normalcy for the ultimate meaning of life  love if you spent most of your life with your emotions completely cut off what would you do to keep that emotional connection alive cut out the maggot promoters of that worthless life and regain the emotional connection that helps you live hell yeahin this case a gang of oldschool russian pigs not unlike some ive met in the past but thankfully rarely exists today since the story is a case of selfprotection and a commitment to family emotional ties it fit perfectly with our texan philosophy a woman would do well to have such a man as the character to protect the one gift she gave him  love the death of the longhaired vixen and the manhunt of the sniveling ruski was just icing on the cake bottomfeeders selfpromoters and stealers of lives  well enough saidget out there and see this movie you will love it   ,reality
i couldnt get past that it just made me hate the films makers also if america has let russian thugs such as these into the country something needs to change,reality
this movie is an insult i watched this pile of garbage till the end in agony and cringe hoping for some plot twist or something interesting but there was nothing the whole movie is about brick faced keanu reeves shooting 100200 thugs in the head because theon greyjoy has stolen his car and killed his avoid this trash at any cost,reality
yep this is a good action film kind of simple but good the action in this film is enough to keep action movie fans happy it didnt have long boring scenes that would have you sitting around waiting for some action to start it was perfectly done much like predator or the equalizer or better yet the matrix in fact while watching this film i was reminded of the matrix a time or two no mystery why the acting was done well too there were a few familiar faces from the small screenhbo as well all of the characters were convincing and believable john keanu reeves is an exhitman who is forced to come back to work to find the people who took everything from him like i said its simple but its good now it is violent but it is fun to watch and it will keep you interested,reality
i wish i had the cash and the opportunity to see this one when it was in the theater over the summer because this movie was just entertaining as hell i have no complaints about because it is one of those perfect summer blockbuster flashy action flicks keanu reeves is awesome as and leads a cast of very talented people to play interesting and fun characters in a story that is simple but extremely effective add in the exciting action and fight scenes and this movie was awesome from beginning to end and just oozes adrenaline its a crime if we dont see more and this film doesnt spawn sequels,reality
it has been a while i watched a film where the hero or antihero was not some kind of effeminate antiwhite politically correct dumb guyis fun because in it we can see the essence of the real white america menis a guy who is not afraid to go the utmost consequences for what he wantshe does things with his own hands and the only help he gets is based on honer and friendshipyes it is a revenge film and as unreal as the easter bunny as thousands have been made before but has spirit and is not watered down politically correct social commentary they even kill a chick in itit is a great white guy film,reality
i am not a big reeves fan but you do not have to be to enjoy this film unique fight scenes and a talented supporting cast made this film a treat this is a film to enjoy on the big screen music selection also made various scenes more enjoyable just a well groomed picture with a load energy and smart dialog you will not be disappointed i think one of the most enjoyable scenes was just a phone conservation between a mafia boss and one of his employees the boss asked his employee why he struck his son the employee responses because your son stold john car and killed his the silence and the the response of oh and the look on the mafia bosss face let you know the carnage that was about to take place,reality
being a long time fan of action movies i watched this based on the positive reviewsif you are not in your teens dont be fooled dont waste your time want a good keanu action movie go watch the matrix even if its your 100th viewing its still a lot better than thisi read in a lot of reviews that this is an action movie so you dont have to expect it to have a great story or some crazy plot twist i believe that this is exactly the point maybe you are right a great plot it is not necessary pacific rim was pretty enjoyable even with a really simplistic plot but what is necessary is internal coherence and this movie has many have noted has absolutely zero everyone seems to basing their actions on stupidity your enemy has killed like 40 or 50 of your men lets capture him and keep him alive someone came to kill you in the middle of the night her name is near yours in the ending credits so lets capture her and keep her alivebottom line is if you show a world of ruthless killers let them at least be ruthlessso if you are considering looking at this watch something else or play a video game you will find more fun and a better plotps i gave it 2 star only for the tattooed bartender i think im in love d,reality
this was worse than the worst schwarzenegger movie by some distance zero plot usual wooden keanu crap script and repetitive clumsy action scenes how sick of watching jw catch one guy in a clinch shoot another and then shoot the clinchee willem must have been out of work to film this rubbish not worth any more words just bad bad bad people,reality
others can go indepth if they feel the need but as it is the movie ticks all the right boxes for this sort of filmyes story if comic book80s style and its executed in full force no silly fast cuts or shadows hiding action you get a fast moving visceral action film no brains neededthe cast is great many stereotypes but all played well also nice to see keanu is still able to pull off some old moves and a few new ones got to say the gun fights and fist fights are some of the best i have seen since the raidif you want a real grittyover the topassassinrevengehigh body countr ratedwell shot and paced filmwell this is it give it a gooh and this is maybe the best acting from keanu reeves i have seen odd i know but there are more sombre moments and he nails it,reality
im a wee bit conflicted about this movie because i grew up with my dad being a huge fan of the dirty harry charles bronson genre of action films  typically the story would be innocent looking man loses wife or children or both to baddies innocent looking man turns out to be a bad ass and takes revenge on baddies kills everyone  the end now if you traded the wife for a car and the children for a car you would be spot onit did seem a bit silly that all of this was over a and i quote fking so much so that every time someone said fking i found it funnyall of that aside this movie is action packed almost from the start to the very end aspects of it were silly and unbelievable but thats in keeping with the nature of this genre of movie i mean mr is shot stabbed with a broken bottle punched and beaten and survives pretty much unharmed managing to get to a dr at the hitman hotel aka the continental  but when he purposely stabs himself at the end he almost kills himself in the processin spite of all of that i actually really enjoyed it even if it was a bit silly todays action movies almost seem to be far too constructed and effects ridden this is good old dirty beat em up action  simplistic it may be but thoroughly enjoyable still,reality
i am growing tired and saddened by the growing phony inflated reviews on imdb a medium with great potential that is losing all credibility as a useful evaluation tool 74 average  oh yea indeedthis was basically a plot less nonstop killing spree its a great movie to make pizza while watching  it demands no attention or brain activity whatsoever its your time waste it as you see besti suppose it might be fun to watch with a group of friends and try to count the closerange head shots vs the onthefly rapid machine gun clip changesi would also love to attend a club like the one in this charade where about 30 people are blowing each other to pieces at close range with highpowered machine guns but no one even stops dancing during the action,reality
the film begins with stumbling from a badlydamaged suv and falling to the ground clutching his bleeding gut with bloody fingertips he begins playing a video on his smartphone of he and his wife at the beach in much better timeswe then flash back to visiting his terminallyill wife at the hospital to say his farewell before telling the doctor to discontinue life supportafter the funeral receives an unexpected delivery a puppy along with a heartfelt note from his late wife hoping that he will embrace this as a companion to remind him of herhe goes for a drive with the puppy a beagle named daisy as his copilot he stops for gas whereupon a bmw full of russian mobsters pulls up one the son of the local russian mob boss played by game of thrones actor alfie allen he takes a special interest in classic ford mustang and takes offense to rebuking his desire to buy the caras you might expect the russians invade home they beat senseless and kill the puppy in front of him he cradles the dead puppy in his arms last and precious link to his beloved wife in the world ignites the fires of vengeance in which leads him to go on an allout rampage against the russians this hearkens back in my mind to will smiths character in i am legend where his loyal german shepherd samantha is about to turn but he strangles it to death before that can happen samantha represents wills characters daughter daisy represents departed wifefrom here keanu reeves kung fu skills garnered from the days of the matrix rise up and reveal the super assassin lying beneath this otherwise mildmannered widower keanu reeves plays the role as a very elegant methodical deadly killerits worth mentioning that the hotel visits the continental is an interesting and classy hangout for elements of the criminal underworld seeks a room at this hotel as his safe haven and as the proprietor states no business may be incurred on these premises without heavy penalties the end of the story shows the mob in shambles as severely injured finds his way into a veterinary clinic for supplies to staunch his wounds he hears a puppy cry out the clipboard attached to its kennel reveals its to be euthanized the next daythe final scenes show walking out a pit bull puppy on a leash accompanying him one of the best action flicks ive seen it has made its way into my top list of films,reality
the reason this review is like 5 years late is because my friend recently suggested we go see the the third instalment of the series as the first two are so epic i was like really he was like yeah oh my god you gotta see so now i have seen john ok the film starts off quite well immediately you sense a high standard in terms of production slick camera work innovative editing stunning lighting also the plot starts okay we are introduced to john seemingly normal decent guy living a normal life with his puppy mourning the loss of his recently deceased wife whilst minding his own business on a road trip a few russian thugs like the look of his car and try to buy it off him he rejects the offer and drives away russian thugs really want this car so they presumably follow him to his home they then confront poor john in the middle of the night beat the crap out of him and inexplicably kill his pet puppy in the process note that in this scene john comes across as quite vulnerable and practically defenceless against these thugs if the thugs had of wanted to kill him they really could have done instead they knock him out and leave with his car john is left broken and utterly distraught that his adored puppy has been taken from him he wants revenge and at this point we all want him to get revenge but how is he going to go about this man is no fighter he cant physically take these thugs on weve seen that all ready hes gonna have to devise a plan and hes gonna have to be brave this could be good my friend was right wrongit turns out that is a super killer assassin an invincible unstoppable killing machine they messed with the wrong guy it also turns out that the rest of this film is steaming pile of cow patqueue killing hundreds and hundreds of practically innocent men in pursuit of his revenge okay i think amongst it all he does get the three original thugs but you could miss it seeing as he kills so many and that is it thats all this film is yes its slick hence not giving it 1 star but it is shockingly immatureone last gripe equally as stupid as the fact that at the start of the film jw had his steven seagal mode switched off is how films think its only cool for heroes to kill men at one point in this dribble a female assassin is going all out to kill john as he has a two million  bounty on his head this woman a professional assassin and very dangerous will stop at nothing until john is dead it is likely that she has killed many before in a fight john over powers her and decides not to finish her off as she is a woman despite the fact that she is only going to come back and try and kill him again in contrast john kills many men that he really does not have too most not even posing a threat and had nothing to do with the killing of his puppy in fact this female assassin goes on to kill one of john friends but oh no he cant kill a woman thats not cool rightwow not a big shock but i wont be watching the sequel or the third instalment my friend and many others seem to lap up this garbage,reality
is the directorial debut of film maker chad stahelski and features a triumphant return for keanu reeves as the plot is a simple revenge story but by no means generic is a retired hitman who misses his wife one day he receives a as a gift but all goes downhill when a russian gang steal his car and kill his it turns then into a cat and mouse chase so as described the film isnt exactly super complex or emotionally driven though it does give us enough to sympathize with the main character and give us also enough to be invested but it is obvious from the very start that film doesnt try to be so it instead gives you well choreographed action sequencessurprisingly though is a compelling character to get behind thanks to a tight script and a passionate performance by keanu reeves the film could have benefited had the musical score been added adding more subtlety and nuance for example when he receives the and reads the letter the scene could have been more powerful without the voice over and the music now lets talk about the action this has to be one of the best directed action set pieces in the genre the camera work is very graceful and stylistic allowing us to witness the entire action scenes knowing when to cut and when to give us the full picture its something thats not common in modern action films and for that the action is glorious the key to this is because the camera is focused there is no stupid shaky camera or unnecessary cut edits it just lets the scenes naturally flow the cinematography is also brilliant and visually gorgeous giving a scene of hostile and loneliness as well as a violent dead environment it is easily the best aspect of the film and the reason why is such a good movie overall the film is fantastic and i would recommend it to any action movie fan,reality
its an awesome movie and i really liked it but one thing i that didnt made sense to me was that who takes so hard revenge for a car and a other than that i say that go and watch the movie movie starts like this the movies setup is almost comical in its simplicity reeves plays the hero of the title a legendarily immortal almost keyser szelike hitman who retired from the profession five years earlier when he fell in love but his wife has just passed away and some hot headed russian gangster game of thrones alfie allen has foolishly interrupted his grieving by stealing his 1969 ford mustang beating the snot out of him and killing his and you just dont mess with a mans is back in business decked out in a natty black threepiece suit and a scruffy beard is a classic man of few words hes clint eastwood minus the cheroot and the spaghetti id be surprised if he speaks more than a dozen lines in the film but when he opens his mouth you can be damn sure he means what he says his is the language of highcaliber bursts of lead and acrobatic fistsoffury beatdowns,reality
if its one thing action movies can teach us its that you dont mess with people who have nothing left to lose hinges on the simple premise of a retired hitman who plows through the russian mafia and leaves a milelong body trail all because they killed his puppy and stole his ride somebody has to pay as silly this may sound the film plays it all with a straight face and it works because there is a good amount of heart to the setup in the opening scenes we see that this is more than the story of a man his car and his its the story of a loss and betrayal once the appropriate pathos is established rises as the tough and skilled action hero we can root for it doesnt take long for the buttkicking to commence but once it does its denselypacked fastpaced relentlesslybrutal and very wellexecuted whether shooting punching stabbing or running bad guys over it is quite a rush to watch descend into the criminal underworld and find paybackas exciting and stylish as the film is what really keeps it from falling into mediocrity is the title character the film successfully evokes sympathy for  the man who lost his wife before losing everything else  and it provides a solid reasoning for why we should care about whether or not succeeds as the film goes on journey takes him through a bizarre criminal world with its own set of rules codes and even currency it turns out that its a world is already familiar with and he has a history with most of the minor characters that pop up thus the film unearths stark themes of how the past present and future are entwinedthis film is wellshot with greatlooking photography and editing it is especially refreshing that the action scenes are solid and steady with no fastcutting or camera shake i also think the color schemes and nighttime cityscapes lend the film a dark and grimy type of neonoir appeal acting is fine for what it is you may not think much of keanu reeves but this film is proof that the man can act his portrayal of is quite spoton and he can kick a lot of butt very impressively writing is not the best but it gets the job done this production has pretty goodlooking sets props and costumes music choices and the music score feature really heavy beats and hard rock cues and i found it awesome that waymuch like a bittersweet life is a dark crime movie with lots of action but also a lot of emotional backing behind its characters its a simple story thats told well and features plenty of satisfying setpieces recommended for at least one viewing45 entertainment very good  story good  film good,reality
reviewed by dare devil kid ddkrating 385 starsis a rousing action thriller of the sort rarely encountered in theaters these days the once popular genre which was headlined by the likes of stallone and schwarzenegger during its heyday has been a dying breed during the past two decades occasionally a movie like the raid redemption or its bigger better sequel the raid 2 berandal comes along to satisfy fans with a penchant for rrated violence but the growing desire for pg 13 action and the emergence of computer generated imaging has rendered oldschool brutality obsolete then along comes unlikely candidate keanu reeves to ignite the flame once again for those who crave noholds barred action this may be among the best the genre has to offeron paper the film is generic as generic gets john keanu reeves wife dies of an unnamed disease bridget moynahan plays the role such as it is and her final act on this world is to arrange for a beagle puppy to be sent to him this is a beautiful lifesaving act and it lasts for two days until a vile boorish russian named iosef alfie allen wants to buy beautiful muscle car and isnt selling so iosef and his thug buddies break into home steal his car beat him bloody and in a moment of pique kill the and it is this which he later describes as the theft of the last hope he had in the whole world that pushes him into a blood rage you see is a retired assassin and iosef is the son of viggo tarasov michael nyqvist the russian mobster who used to be employer and those are all the ingredients we need in a film about revenge a cool action hero and alloutwar against the russian mafiathere isnt much of a plot but thats often the case with revenge based tales movies of this sort arent about narrative depth theyre about taking a hero through an increasingly difficult series of bad guys until he comes facetoface with the big boss john greatest strength is its relentless momentum the film doesnt have a lot of down time it offers occasional breaks including some amusing scenes that take place in a hotel where guests arent allowed to talk business breaking that rule it turns out can have serious consequences for the most part however knows what it is and is unapologetic about it this is a kickbutt action film with no pretensions of being anything else there is a short dialogue about karma and god but its neither deep nor longreeves is in many ways a perfect choice for the lead when the movie begins is in a deep funk following the death of his wife his emotions have been shut down and remain thus for most of the film as he goes about his work reeves has never displayed much range his screen presence has always been his strongest asset and its in abundant evidence here is more of a force of nature than a fully realized character reeves has sufficient backstory to make him sympathetic but thankfully his past is murky in fact presents the best platform to showcase reeves enigmatic screen presence  there are vividly choreographed fights a suave black suit for the hero and no greater moral purchase on our rooting interest than that hes keanu reeves and the bad guys killed his dogthe film was codirected by former stuntmencoordinators chad stahelski and david leitch dga rules mandate that stahelski be given sole official credit they show a good understanding of how to frame a fight and never resort to the kind of rapidfire cutting that reduces an action scene into visual confetti the six or seven big action scenes feature a sleek chic gusto and the shootouts are brutal and shot in longish takes rather than chopping them into short frames the few oneonone fights are well choreographed and are neither overtly short nor do they drag on forever theres a fantastic car chase scene too and fortunately it doesnt look derivative from erstwhile action films and is constricted within the right time frame leitch and stahelski may not be on the short list to direct the next jane austen adaptation but they know their stuff when it comes to action films and thats all that mattersis the kind of ferocious bmovie fun some of us cant get enough of reeves always a nimble action presence delivers the goods and then some chad stahelski  keanus former stunt double  and david leitch  brad pitts former stunt double  direct with a flair for movement and framing that slams you right into the fights stabbings and shootouts from home invasion to a hotel for assassins the stage is set for all hell to break loose and that it does moral nourishment is not on the menu but some memorable oneliners are juicy supporting performances from michael nyqvist and alfie allen and terrific cameos from willem dafoe john leguizamo and ian mcshane are ample compensation in the acting department the kick of is not to be denied its as close to a pure adrenaline rush as youre likely to find at the moment what else does an action movie need action movies are about movement and pursues that goal with remorseless vervethe film is also edly funny with a dry wit and upended expectations not only about the character himself but the underground world that sucks hims back in is a carnivorous thriller that wonderfully displays the immeasurable depth of one mans thirst for retribution stylish thrilling and giddily kinetic serves as a satisfying return to action for keanu reeves and what looks like could be the first of an immensely entertaining franchise,reality
keanus back in sublime formafter a couple of flopskeanu bounces back strongly and redeems himself with john the story is pretty simplewhich is totally revealed in the trailerbut the execution and stylization in particular is top notchthe action is totally great and the club scene reminds one of collateral starring tom cruiseall of the cast was greatbut michael nyqvist in particular was totally cool with his ohall in all a great filma highly recommended one for all action fansalso the whole backdrop and the storyline focusing around the hotel continental was amazingwillem dafoe nearly dominates every single movie he is inwith his presencealfie allen gets to play the negative character really wellalso we have cameos from john leguziamo and pro wrestler kevin nashadrienne pallicki was great as perkinsalso there was an element of humor added to the filmone particularly great scene was when books a dinner reservation for 12 or when the police officer comes to his house,reality
most films have been really disappointing for me lately ive maybe come across 3 or 4 good ones in the last few yearsthe films of late have just been missing something dont know how to exactly put it this film has it i thought to myselfoh great another shoot em up revenge type movie and it is that but its all in how the movie is made keanu reeves does a very good job and was a good choice to play the character of there is lots of originality to be found in the movie and that is what gives it the ump this is one of those movies that i can watch over and over again without ever getting bored at all go see it in the theaters and you will not be disappointed trust me this is one of those that is best when seen on the big screen in big sound,reality
is easily the best action film since skyfall i might even like this more than skyfall actually this is better than any of the expendables films even expendables 2 is a badass revenge flick that knows what it is and goes allout with it this film doesnt try to be something it isnt or be overly complicated to try to appease a certain audience this film is really what the film machete shouldve been machete was advertised as an awesome revenge film that brought back classic action films but it really wasnt it tried to be deep and relevant with constant preaching about the border and it really detracted from what the film initially was supposed to be and it was very boring and quite disappointing this film knows what it is and it is really refreshing keanu reeves brings his agame as does all the side cast the action is great and wellchoreographed the villain is badass and humorous at the same timethe story is simple and straight forward is a former hitman but has been out of the game for five years the film starts with his wife sadly dying and there is a funeral then he finds a on his doorstep which was his wifes final gift to him shortly after all that these mobsters start screwing with him one of them is the son of the main villain viggo michael nyqvist who john once worked for eventually the beat him up and kill his which was a huge mistake john then snaps and goes on a killing spree to get these guys backthe character is definitely a badass you dont want to screw with he doesnt talk much and he doesnt need to he lets his actions speak for him and hes merciless he doesnt screw around at all he reminds be a lot of liam neeson in taken this film has a very similar feel to taken for example i like how its basically verses everybody for the most part dafoe helps him out a bit but its mainly john by himself wasting an army of mobsters just like it was liam neeson by himself wipingout a ton of bad guys with no mercy or hesitation there is no pointless loveinterest goofy sidekick or stupid comic relief characters put it its just by himself which is how it should be however i like this film more than taken for a couple reasons that ill get towhats particularly cool about is just the amount of buildup and praise he gets by everyone in the film including the main villain what i like is that all the characters in this film seem to know each other particularly john himself everyone in this film respects andor fears him which makes all the more badass this shows that keanu reeves is great if given the right role many people trash him but i never found him a bad actoranother thing that makes this film awesome is its side characters william dafoe has a smaller role as johns old friend and fellow hitman dafoe is always awesome in any role hes in you can put him in a lame goblin costume straight from the set of power rangers and hell come out awesome the rest of the cast is equally memorable the side characters dont get much time but they make the most of what little they have to do and all of them have presencethe villain viggo is also quite strong i like that him hand know each other have worked together before and that viggo has a respect for john and is even quite scared of him the way he describes john in the beginning and his constant uneasiness when he finds out hes back i find quite funny and awesome at the same time he couldve just been a nothing villain that was basically just a punching bag for but he has some pretty badass moments and has a presence to him this is the reason i like this film more than taken in taken the side characters werent very strong and neither were the villains but that is not the case herethe action is great as i said earlier the fights are wellchoreographed and there is hardly any shakycam its rrated so they go allout and it gets bloody the film looks great and has an atmosphere to it the length is just right for the film this is if it was any longer it wouldve felt paddedout as some action film of late haveoverall is a new modern action classic it is definitely worth checkingout if youre into action films,reality
is a triumphant return to action cinema for keanu reeves i wont say any more than this or mention the other films in his career but i saw it this morning and had a great time reeves is brilliant in this film which is about an infamous retired hitman oneman killing machine who plunges back into the underworld in the pursuit of revenge if youve seen the trailer the story is as simple as it appears a pretext is to give keanu the opportunity to be entertainingashell as a gunwielding bonecrunching badass luckily the magic works and a cheesy tongueincheek actioner becomes a breathless explosion of russianhit men and mobsters yes russians are back on the menu why is this entertaining because its keanu and hes back no offense to arnold but we all know whos cooler the movie is superficial adrenalinefueled fun and has the style and skill to keep you involved in the mayhem personally i thought that there was just the right amount of everything it doesnt avoid cheesiness but it doesnt matter when youre here to have fun id like to make the point that the russians portrayed in this film are purely fictional representations of mafiamembers and i hold a deep respect for the dignity and integrity of the true russian people,reality
i walked out of the theater feeling great i felt like it was worth the money and time in fact it is the best movie of 2014 for me personally i had wished for characters in the past to be more full of human emotions and act out on those emotions because that is what makes me connect to a character i want to despise villains and i got to do that i wanted to sit through the whole movie without checking the time on my led lit watch i did this is a complete movie and doesnt leave much to ponder about the what ifs the story rolls quite quickly which is great because sometimes i wish i had a remote control to press forward when i watch some movies all characters are great the plot is great the script is amazing the cinematography oh my oh my also the soundtrack is actually perfect all reviews are subjective however if you think you are a little like me then this movie will leave you entertained great flickkeanu reeves must make more movies like this onejohn,reality
if you are looking for a genuine action flick this is the onetheres a line in the movie where keanu says people keep asking if im back yeah im thinking im back well the same goes for keanu for surewhen there is an excellent script thank you derek kolstad and 2 great directors thank you chad stahelski  david leitch you can count on him to deliverand for someone who had the honor meeting him in person i can tell you he is the most downtoearthnicest guy and pretty smartthank you for reading my reviewnir,reality
keanu reeves is a superhitman who has retired but is forced back for one more job etc etc etc it sounds familiar because it is exactly like the other countless clich action movies you have ever seenthere is exactly nothing original in this movie he is the best hitman ever retires then his wife dies and some russian gangster kills his so now he has to avenge the killing an entire army of gangsters and eventually the boss along the way he gets the help of an old friend in the business who is killed by the boss blah blah blahreeves does his usual thing where he acts exactly the same as in every other reevesmovie seriously this guy has no range at allthe boss is the most incompetent gangsterboss in history has an obnoxious spoiled son who screws everything up etc boring done a million times every clich in the book is used to create a generic dime a dozen action movieonly worth it if youre new here 310,reality
let me start by saying this movie is not for everyone it has a lot of violence and the story is very thinso why do i love it do you say i grew up with the over the top movies of the 80s like commandorambo and so on i loved those when i was young if i watch them now i cant make it further then 10 minutes but took me back to those timesin recent years a lot of directors tried to make a movie like this and failed simply because they took themselves too seriously just is what it is a very violent movie without any pretense to being more the direction is great the production is great the acting is good it takes me back to the movies of my youthof course this is isnt the best movie ever made michael nyqvist shouldnt be in a hollywood production in my opinion and what i dont like of the modern movies is the very obvious cgi wounds and blood it is just not good and very distractingbut i give this movie a solid 8 i really enjoyed it dont expect too much just relax and watch it,reality
its keanu reeves greatest movie ever i cant believe how many people keanu killed in this movie maybe 80 or more i lost count and over a yes keanu as the antichrist the most evil out of the evil a destroying hells angel a veritable force of nature never have i enjoyed cheering on the bad guy so much and its also how he did it sometimes shooting the 80 or so bad guys each two or three times in the head and chest had a lot of ammunition i have not seen this much raw explosive action in a long time felt like an amped up version of the arnold schwarzenegger action movies like commando or raw deal but even more so this has to be the most nastiest nihilistic existentialist insane outrageous ironic comedic repellent and vicious action movie ever made guns guns or more guns it might make you throw up and unbelievably it might also make you laugh theres also some great acting in this movie by the way from people like willem dafoe and ian mcshanethis also has to be the most anti russian movie america has ever made russians left and right are being killed by the bushel full so go see now if youve got the stomach for it and treat your pets with kindness or will hear about it finally what would do to batman,reality

stunt man done a lot of stunt work movies actor assistant director and stahelski and leitchs approach to action scenes drew upon their admiration for japanese animation including martial arts movies  fight choreographers and gun martial artstechniques combat staff from hong kong action cinema was additionally influential in the development of the piece as well as prominently paying homage to works such as john woos the killer awesome directors they know whats action really is then other directors around from today i wanna see them doing more movies like this they great directors with great

lets be blunt film snobs along with many regular moviegoing fans think that keanu reeves acting is to put it mildly a bit wooden for those who thought he was a mediocre actor at best should see its proof reeves has drastically improved as an actori read a professional review in which the film critic still lambasted reeves robotic demeanor that is absolute nonsense i was so intrigued when i saw the trailer for this movie immediately it struck me that keavu reeves seemed to absolutely own this role but that was just short outtakes could he really be that good in the whole movieeasy answer yesis a revenge thriller hes emotionally wounded from the untimely death of his wife from some undisclosed illness the son of a russian crime boss makes the tragic mistake of attacking and killing his we have no idea up to this point that is legendary as a killer ruthless and skilled everyone fears himno apology is sufficient for what was done to him so he embarks on a mission to kill the crime boss son as always happens in movies of this genre is always outnumbered by ten to one and yet he kills everyone in his path to revenge and keeps moving forwardalthough at the end there was some dopiness to the plot keanu reeves was stellar he was focused not wooden he was dynamic not roboticweve seen a younger keanu reeves do comedy he had some great successes we saw him in dracula and wish we hadnt weve seen him in nearmisses like a walk in the clouds that failed in no way due to him he was excellent but in cheap sappy plot points that tried to bring an emotional closurenow we see him clearly back in the game i would love to see keanu reeves do something risky now maybe take a chance on a comedy its clear he is up to it his reputation as an actor should greatly improve after this rock solid performance,reality
great action great stuntsgeniounly loved this film from start to finish really dont understand some of the hate its getting from some users on here 7310 rating overall so therefore bad ratings are irrelevant well recommended if you enjoy a revenge driven film with loads of head shots and fightinghes been off the scene for a while making b movies but this one is just amazing keanu reeves is certainly back brilliantcant wait for a sequel,reality
seen a lot of bad movies of keanu reeves but this movie totally rocks i was seriously taken back by how good this movie was with him starring as the main character playing his part in the best way possible looks like hes on a good start reviving himself from those b rated movies keanu still has the spark to make action movies and this one doesnt disappoint one bit good martial arts and loads of gun fire makes this action pack movie a thrill ride not to forget the story line of the movie is not bad could have been better but theres a lot of other things that make up for it hope his next movie is as entertaining as this one,reality
wow i laughed hollered and was so thrilled within the first 20 minutes of this film then i wanted more and i wanted to spend more time in this world and the many stories that could go on in it what a blast of a movie gun and violence galore i think ive seen some really interesting firsts done in this film about time it wont win an oscar but you get what you get in this type of movie keanu was kick ass and the running time was just righti dont understand why people would bash this film what were they expecting its action fast paced and well choreographed im not a real big car fan but the cars and what they did in this film were very impressive ive become more surprised all the time that movies like this dont get the attention or box office yet hunger games divergent or friday the 13th part 20 continue to make moneyits violent exciting action your not going to get lawrence of arabia if you want a good old action flick there are far worst things you can watch then this8 out of 10,reality
quickie reviewkeanu reeves is a highly skilled exhitman who receives a puppy from his dying wife to help him grieve things only get worse when a spoiled son of a crime boss steals johns car and murders his puppy now he must return to the criminal world he had left years ago to avenge all that he has lost you have heard and seen this type of plot countless times there are no surprises here you will predict everything but is it fun oh yes it is keanu owns his role and is a complete badass so despite the unoriginality of the plot is filled with some of the most original gunfights ive seen in a long time overall this movie is an entertaining popcorn action flick that is well worth your timefull reviewi think most would agree that keanu reeves is no thespian when it comes to his acting talents so even though he has been in some terrible movies lately i still find to be a likable actor i just want him to return to his glory days of being neo and seemed like the perfect opportunity for him to do that so i was more than i excited to see itlets be real here this movie could have come off very cheesy judging by its premise however keanu through his action persona sold me on this seemingly odd world and character as being real and actually quite cool you can see reeves wholeheartedly dedicating himself to his role that you cant help but cheer him on for every brain splattering headshot strange thing to cheer i know but youll know what i mean most importantly this is an action film that actually shows the action from what i can remember there was not a single shaky cam every gun fight is brilliantly shot pun intended beginning to end i also loved how precise the movements were would always land a headshot and if he cant then he would shoot another part of the body to get an aim at the head just plain awesomenessis not without its problems as i mentioned before the plot is largely unoriginal so whenever there are no fights the movie is not as engaging also i was quite underwhelmed by the climatic end the rest of the movie had a great build in tension but the finale felt rushed and left more to be desired one of the positives of is the rich criminal underworld it is filled with colorful characters and has very interesting ways in which it functions there is a sense of mutual respect amongst the people in that world i just wish we got to explore more of that world because i found it to be so intriguing and unique i am sure they will if there ever is a sequel which i do think this movie deservesin the end i thoroughly enjoyed my time watching yes it has some flaws but i was able look past them to appreciate it for what it is one word to sum up the movie would be personality because even if it is working with tired story and character concepts does it with style and funcheck out more on my movie review blog the stub collector httpthestubcollectorwordpresscom,reality
the marketing posters should have read101 diabolical moronic minutesa barrage of appalling preposterous nonsensea total embarrassment to the art of filmmakingan absolute abomination  the likes of which can never be equalleda complete and utter disgrace to humanityill make this as concise as possible because i dont want to give this film any more time than i already havethis film is completely one dimensional devoid of script and therefore has absolutely no character depth nuance beauty interest or message and thus we are left with a deluge of meaningless nonstop violence in the name of revengeapart from the sequel to this film which incredibly plumbs to at least equally low depths probably keanus worst outing  and he has had a few bad onesit was no surprise to me that the director is not a director at all but actually a fight choreographer because that is pretty much all this film contains  and in my opinion neither well choreographed nor wellshot fighting scenes at thatin a nutshell it watches like a video game on automatic play and as the poster should have said a complete and utter disgrace to humanity though no doubt revered by the braindead of the 21st century gaming generation,reality
i find nothing stylish about gratuitous violence start to finish and rotten tomatoes gives it an 85 what is the world coming to seriously and so much for the crisp gunfu during one scene i saw a flash from his gun but only heard a click and no bang hahaproves even the editors got bored watching this pointless crap,reality
i grew up watching movies with alpha males doing what alpha males do whether it was the 60s with john wayne lee marvin sean connery and steve mcqueen the 70s with clint eastwood charles bronson roger moore gene hackman and burt reynolds or the 80s with chuck norris sylvester stalone steven segal arnold scwarzeneggar bruce willis mel gibson and van damn something happened in the 90s with regards to the action genre and keanu reeves was the only actor from that time forward who ever seemed to keep the tradition going i liked speed the matrix better and best of all reeves like all the names i mentioned gets guff for not being a serious actor my retortwho cares while hold overs from early years like willis segal gibson van damn and stalone continued making descent action flicks after the 90s reeves is the only actor i can think who basically came on the scene in the 90s who stayed true to his roots and is single handily keeping this genre alive is a dark film that reminds me of blade runner dark city and from hell with regards to production only the lens filter used in this movie was so dark it almost becomes distracting this is not the only recent film i can think of that has this problem aside from this one technical problem the movie was perfect while not as gritty as able ferreras fear city or as comic book as the payback from the 90s it seems to meet in the middle of these two films somewhere the action scenes are some of the best ever put to film the soundtrack animates the movie as much as the fight sequences and it has absolutely zero political correctness factor to it which is so refreshing i liked this movie a lot long love the man of action,reality
john a good action movie is a rare thing these days stallone arnie and all the heroes of old have become well just that old instead we have watered down action stars who rely on shaky cam to hide their lack of ability keanu reeves however has always been a strong performer within this genre a star whos action credentials go under the radar despite being in some of the best of all time the matrix speed point break and johnny mnemonic no wait forget the last one that was rubbish so when a little movie by the name of turned up on our cinemas door step this was a nice surprise for action fans watching a geriatric steven seagal nearly putting his back out to get our action fix was becoming a little strained or watching jean claude and dolph mumble through rehashes of movies theyd done before universal soldier 14 anyone is rather refreshing this is a simple movie nasty men steal nice mans ford mustang and kill his puppy turns out nice man is an ex super assassin and his wife has just died time to get not so nice talk about picking on the wrong guy the fella from game of thrones the one who gets his wedding tackle cut off alfie allen is to blame for doing wrong his crime boss father points out in one of the films many great scenes is the man you send to kill the boogeyman and you just killed his absolutely brilliant the way in which the myth of is created is truly fascinating a story about a bar room and a pencil is wonderfully realised on screen helping give the titular character an air of invincibility i think this film works so well because we care for john and understand what hes going through we feel his pain hes lost his wife hes lost the very thing that guides him a love that rescued and steered him away from his violent past keanu reeves gives a stellar performance here we feel the emotion ooze out of the screen we see him descend back into his old ways all he wants to do is grieve and the bad guys take that from him watching the scene with the dying puppy is one that will pull at the heart strings and fuel a violent anger in you one you probably didnt know you had has some interesting depth too despite being a simple film in terms of formula the assassins world in which john is from is one of code and honour there are rules a world that is stylised on screen and one that could be expanded on when a sequel inevitably arrives but what is an action movie without good action something that jw delivers big time every punch kick and exploding head is delivered with a level of professionalism that just isnt seen very often in this genre anymore as i mentioned before directors usually now rely on shaky cam or obscure camera angles to hide the fact that the lead actor just isnt up to it here we have wide angles where we can see the action played out to full potential a visual feast for the action movie aficionado not over done or overly repetitive keanu reeves is very good at his craft particularly when his craft requires him to kick ass on screen people have criticised his acting ability but for me he is one of the best when it comes to action he does most of the stunt work himself sure there are probably better martial artists out there or guys with bigger muscles but reeves is a more all round package along with some colourful cinematography and ear popping sound this is what we want from an action movie i for one look forward to seeing him return but please dont harm anymore i dont think i could take it,reality
disclaimer i love this movie its basically the best one ever made im not usually this positive when it comes to evaluating film but i believe that this particular one deserves all the acclaim and morethe thing that stands out most has to be the action sequences they are unlike most found in modern cinema with long uninterrupted takes and beautiful choreography that really lend themselves to the realistic bonecrunching feel of the film although the complexity of plotting left something to be desired the filmmakers more than made up for it by building a rich creative historyladen world around their charactersthe action the superb action in this movie can be directly attributed to the codirectors and their star both directors have been performing and coordinating bigbudget film stunts for years chad stahelski even doubled for keanu reeves in several films reevess stunt background and dedication to learning his characters gunplay and martial arts styles helped bring his scenes to life in a way that would not be possible with other performers because of the crews skills in the art of choreography less cuts were needed during fight scenes which afforded them a more immersive feelthe music i have never been one to get too worked up or bogged down by the soundtrack of any given movie here however i found myself enthralled in its effectiveness the gentle tune in my mind by m86 and susie q really stood out by paradoxically fitting perfectly into the hot tub club scene on the other end marilyn mansons killing strangers provided a jolting assault of the rock variety to wake me back up for the next action sequencethe supporting players numerous interesting characters populate this original world the performances that stand out the most come courtesy of john leguizamo and lance reddick their introductions pulled me right into their specific areas of the criminal underworld without feeling too overbearing though neither muggs the screen for more than ten minutes their impacts are felt immediately and leave a lasting impressionthe continental as wellexecuted as is i dont think it gets nearly enough credit for its creativity the best use of this aspect can be seen inside the hitman hotel the continental this establishment primarily hosts assassins and other underworld types to be waited on by a staff providing worldclass service to its patrons unlike any other most importantly the hotel pulled me in leaving me wanting to know more about the history of this world to which we had just been introducedthe plot my biggest gripe with the movie has to be that the plot wears quite thin at times having scanned countless other reviews before writing my own i know that this is not an unpopular opinion its really just a classic tale of revenge where the protagonist pursues the antagonist until somebody gives in the reason does not suffer for its overly simplistic plot is that it stimulates the viewer in other ways like a goodoldfashioned sense of humor it never takes itself too seriouslyi cant image that theyll come anywhere near matching the magic of with its sequel but im excited for chapter 2 all the same as long as they expand upon the interesting underground lore presented in the first movie while preserving the high quality action scenes i have no doubt that chapter 2 will satisfy my need for more john ,reality
there are actually quite a handful reasons why may have become a failure the two directors have never made a film before and almost exclusively worked in the stunt department so far the writer is not exactly experienced either lead actor keanu reeves usually scores more through boyish charm than through realistic portrayal of gritty badass characters and the genre of crime action thrillers rarely delivers in terms of real significance still it became a very good film the main reason for that is probably that it does not attempt to be anything of great cinematic value does not try to teach groundbreaking stories on moral loyalty or betrayal instead derek kolstads script goes for a gutsy revenge thriller that is not even hurt by its occasional predictabilityi was very pleased with reeves performance here he is a man in his 50s now and i guess with age came a certain masculinity that works very well in this film here willem dafoe is fun as always adrianne palicki nicely plays a coldblooded femme fatale lance redick is a lot of fun with his professional take on being a guest in his hotel alfie allen is the real antagonist in his fame but his characters age and and inexperience really cost him that role instead his characters father develops into the main enemy to even if both apparently still have a lot of respect for the other and nyqvists character really only has to pay for his offsprings sins and seems to understand that he wants to protect his son even if he opposes this idea people who complain that such a way of revenge may be way too much for a dead and stolen car have not understand a thing about the main character here he is a testosteronefilled hit man who has not acted rationally for years and will not do so either if somebody destroys the only link left between him and his beloved wife thats why it is not an unrealistic film i also liked that they did not choose to include a new love interest for the main character as it would have been really contradictory in terms of him mourning for his wife they can do that in the sequel perhaps choosing the path of an assassin to avoid a 99 male cast was the right way to gothere are a couple moments that did not seem in a way that id have expected from usually these when he shows mercy for his greatest enemies also the scene in the end yes he does respect tarasov sr but after killing dafoes character is it really appropriate that he threw his gun away i am not sure about that i guess id have preferred an ending like the final boss battle from taken and the scene at the end oh well this is maybe one of the few areas when the film attempts to be something more than it should with the emotional significance that felt really only included for the sake of it but there really isnt anything wrong with these 100 minutes i enjoyed the watch a lot and this is even more impressive as action films can rarely stay memorable to me highly recommended an extremely positive surprise how well it worked against all odds i very much hope the second one will be equally strong,reality
with such good reviews for this nonsense it only shows the dumbification of movie audiences nowadays no need for plot no need for characters no need for a story lets just make a crazy revenge for a stolen car and dead where it begins with the protagonist randomly runs into the antagonist at a gas station from there just have the protagonist shoot out at an army of people who attack him one by one when the antagonist finally catches the protagonist they have to have a conversation before leaving the protagonist to be killed by two guys who try to kill him with a bag over his head and of course after the protagonist gets out of that situation theres more shooting where one guy kills dozens of other guys who attack only one or two at a time and of course ends with the last two fist fighting in the rain really a construction site with rain running out of ammo and finishing it with a fist fight if thats not a throwupinyour mouth clich i dont know what is its a stylish nonsense with wall to wall clichs and oh so predictable it was like watching someone play a visually good video game where the player selected super easy mode just for the shoot out fun what frustrated me the most is that it got so many good reviews is this what film audiences are made of nowadays really film is doomed if this is what the viewers will lure hollywood to manufacture to satisfy the dumb audience who dont care for plot character storyline etc just lots of shooting and youre happy sad,reality

i am a big fan of keanu reeves have been for three decades i dont care about critics of his acting ability or style his style is unique and thats what separates him from other actors over the years he has been put in a certain mold the mold of the quiet weird guy neo or klaatu from the day the earth stood still that type think of tom ludlow from street kings that would be as close to as you can get as far as comparisons but is much more badass he is a retired hitman who has found love for the first time the description on imdb describes what happens so this stuff is not a spoiler he loses his wife and you can tell that it was devastating after her funeral he receives a pet carrier at his door and signs for it it is a puppy cute as hell it is a gift from his wife a last gift in order for him to grieve with someone and not alone you can tell he falls in love with the between that and the fact that it was a gift from his dead wife it makes the that much more important when a mob bosses son alfie allen and his crew decide they want 69 mustang sweet car indeed they break in and catch him off guard he is retired they beat him senseless and then kill the bad move they should have killed but they dont know who is but his father does viggo the russian mob boss and former employer of he then has to explain to his disappointment of a son that he just killed the of the man that is not the boogeyman but he is the guy you call to kill the boogeyman from there things go from bad to worse for all involved a lot of death a lot of blood gunfire hand to hand fighting car chases explosions and slimy hitmen and women out for a bounty there is also a hotel that is specifically designed for the shady world that and other hitmen live in pretty cool keanu is at his best in this movie not just physically but emotionally yes his character is quiet just like you would expect from keanu but once he gets going he is one scary dude cold as ice great acting by all involved and great story just a wonderful movie all around i dont care how many movies they make in this genre as long as they all stand up to john ,reality

before i start i feel i have to state that is more than just another popcorn movie its stunning choreography seamless switchingup of fighting styles and without a doubt its cast are impeccable reminiscent of other revenge thrillers such as taken and the man from nowhere enthrals the audience with its visuals while keeping you connected with its personal performances keanu reeves was born to play the part of the nice quiet guy with a big dark secret if youre looking for a movie you need to watch twice to fully grasp its countless layers and subplots go watch memento or donnie darko if youre looking for a movie you want to watch twice because you have to show your buddy what a bada keanu reeves is then look no further is as manly as a steak dinner washed down with a 6pack of pbr i thoroughly enjoyed this film and cannot wait for 2,reality
a movie that i watched this past friday and as i said its the better equalizer keanu reeves really kills it in his role as and it is actually perfect how his character is made he is like the headshot king but because of retirement he is just rusty enough where he has a chance of dying like superman vs ironman still effective but can die with enough force the lead up to his character is amazing and the mobsters describing him make sound like dirty harry and jason bourne in one an amazing movie quick yet badass kills and im not saying any to spoil the movie but just general amazement throughout im just sad that this film will probably get forgotten so people tell your friends that is an 85if you guys want more in depth reviews please be sure to check me out quinn c with the james bond emblem on youtube i do daily videos reviewing films of old and new and also give very in depth analysis of the james bond films so if you enjoyed andor appreciated this review please be sure to check me out at quinn c on youtube with the james bond emblem thanks,reality
reeves is back to his point break speed matrix actionbest a violent visceral fastpaced high killrate film with a vintage slick and eminently cool feel to it reeves owns the screen and reveals a physicality which belies his age he throws himself around and is believable as the suave professional mechanic antiherothe story  ill admit  is a little farfetched if you take it too seriously the bad guys are a little hammy and onedimensional but reeves brings a grace and gravitas to the role of which shows off just how good he is the martial arts are unusual original and superbly choreographed and like jackie chan uses anything to hand and is more fragile and realistic than most action antiheroes he is breakable and you believe he might just not make it cute puppy scenes cuter puppy and keanu scenes  is there anything better than a scene with a handsome man and a gorgeous puppy the brutal scenes with the  daisy  will upset some but bear with the film its quietness and lack of complex dialogue works well with reeves and the story there is a calm about him which is a juxtaposition to what he does for a living is capable of and this is depicted rather well with the unusual punkyrock soundtrackwatch it probably a favourite for boys everywhere martial arts fans keanu fans and definitely ladies that like guys with guns and an easy power that makes your knees wobble it is a stunningly shot film an old school feel slick and dark and totally entertaining,reality
with it finally getting a uk release i finally got a chance to see the much hyped and my goodness did this film deliver the premise of this film sees an ex hit man who has lost everything going after the men who took it all away from him now i have never been a huge keannu reeves fan but i gotta say he fits this role perfectly he was a badass who dished out allot of headshots on villains but also you connected with his character because you believed in what he was doing and in his motivations the villain is the bad guy from mission impossible ghost protocol and he wasnt really that memorable in that film but he is fantastic in this film he is a multi layered villain that provides a good adversary for and you buy that he could do some of the terrible things that he does in the film willem dafoe is in the film and even though his role isnt that large he is great in it and makes you care about his character as well as adrianne pallicki is one of my favourite actresses to watch at the moment and she was great in this film she was deadly sexy and evil which made her an awesome character in this film the only negative was the bad guys son was really annoying and yes i get that because he is meant to be but it felt over the top if you had described the story to somebody before seeing this film they would tell you that it couldnt work but it just does in this film the premise is so simple that it works and you really want to succeed in his mission the script is surprisingly really good and it actually had more humour then i expected which is surprising because the trailer made it seem like complete darkness the style of this film is phenomenal i have never seen a person hit more headshots in a film then and the action scenes are great and a reminder of what good action films can be also what is great is the world building in this film with unique ideas given to this film that i think they can really build on in future films which i hope there is overall is fantastic and is one of the best action films i have ever seen,reality
finally what seems like 30 movies ive seen with keanu hes impressed meis anything but original and yetits thoroughly entertaining and just my type of bad guyrevenge flick not since 1999s payback have i been this pleased its one of those movies i just finished and want to see all over againthrough and through 90 of this has been done before but since keanu finally stood up and acted and since it takes no prisoners with its brutality and shameless acts of gun violence its one for the books john the stereotypical badass retiree whos pulled back in on a whim and hell everyone better watch their back reminding me a lot of both payback and eastern promises not to mention every single one lastjobbeforeorafterretirement plot seems to separate itself with a keanu you finally root forliterally theres not much to say but to enjoy the enormously action packed ride of john his past his presence and how many bullets it takes to provide vengeance its a pity this didnt make more at the boxoffice i could see this on repeat and not get bored  final thoughts make your life complete with a doublepunchdouble feature of this and payback not the directors sht take of payback just the original theatrical release both are similar and will be having you root for the bad guy,reality
keanu reeves is absolutely solid as is everyone else the action scenes are among the best ive ever seen stylised but realistic the character is insanely good and insanely tough but not in an effortless way that makes it seem more realthe grittiness of the action scenes also adds to themchoreography is brilliant cinematography is beautiful these action scenes have a clear flow ie dont degenerate into a collection of fast moving extreme closeups the storytelling may be simple but extremely well done in a visual way all exposition scenes are visual and most contain little or no dialogue so i liked this one,reality
havent seen a nice action movie of keanu reeves since the matrix i enjoyed every minute of itsure the plot seems a lot like a classic case of ex super ultra assassin being a one man army but it is well structured and never leaves you bored the atmosphere is good and gives the feeling of a city that is governed by a crime syndicate acting is quite good compared to other recent action movies i saw lately i hope keanu reeves continues to star in more good movies because he was quite unseen during the last decade or so with very few exceptions at first i was sceptical about the rating i saw but after watching the movie i think it deserves it,reality
after his role as director and actor in man of taichi and actor in 47 ronin which both are pretty bad keanu reeves are back to his greatest zone which is action movie i can still remember picture of him as neo in the matrixthe thing that makes standout from others action movie is  it know itself really well it know that this movie will be an action shoot everything and keanu reeves as a badass characters  so it dont try to be other things like insert too much drama story and this make fun and entertaining to watch because it give the audience what they really wantkeanu reeves himself is also really badass in this movie  i think this role is perfect for him i cant think any others actor to play this role other than him  its like this script and this role just wrote for him and him only  so i have to say after watched this movie keanu reeves is back guys hes official back to badass now also another actor that i personally really like in this movie is michael nyqvist as a main villain after i saw him in abduction and mission impossible  ghost protocol i have to say that this is by far his best performance as a main villain  he added so much to the characters making it interesting and fun to watchtheres also a lot of supporting cast and some are really cool like adrianne palicki  williem dafoe or even ian mcshane which is really cool and added so much more worth of your ticket priceoverall is a really fun action movie  it doesnt bring a great script or great story telling but it give us just what we want from action movie and dont try to be other things things  if youre a fan of action movie or keanu reeves just go and watch it you will not be disappointed ,reality
 slaughtering a line from the superior princess bride its a shame that keanu reeves is supposed to be one of the nicest guys to work with in hollywood because this film is a mess we should stop asking hollywood to come up with original ideas because when they do this is the result 101 minutes of cliched action that checks all of the boxes  retired hitman coming out of retirement a boy and his the perfect wife who is conveniently dead stolen cars russian mobsters a spoiled son who doesnt have half the restraint and judgment of dad precisely because dad spoiled him and lots of blood we should stop criticizing the millennials so much because all weve bequeathed to them is 100k of student debt each for four year degrees that dont get them jobs and films like this kudos to the effects team because they did good work they are the only reason this film gets even four stars,reality

based off of critical and audience receptions alike i hoped that would be the saving grace that the action genre needs in this day and age i hoped that this would be the needle in the haystack of the newest additions to the expendables die hard and transformers franchises i was expecting intense fastpaced choreography an intimidating villain relatable motive and stakes that actually felt like they held some weight to them by the end of the film my disappointment was immeasurable and my day was ruinedtheres very little about this film that impressed me at all keanu did a fine job but i was expecting a bit more considering everyone regards him as a god now the choreography was almost impressive but i found that it was insanely slow unexciting and pales in comparison to something like the raid i was never bored the was cutepart of what makes some of my favorite action films so special is that the audience is always on the edge of their seat because at any moment any of the onscreen characters could succumb to the lingering tension thats constantly in the air and actually diestakes are one of the most essential aspects in an action film yet this one lacks any because of the lack of tension the action scenes suffer immensely not only are we constantly told that is invincible and cant be stopped but were shown this as well we never see a hint of injury to him until the end of the second act and even then it feels completely unnatural and forcedhas nexttonothing going for it in its story which consists of three important plotpoints the villain his wife and his former buddy marcus ill go down the line and see how much each doesnt workthe villain is a hilarious clich that never feels intimidating in the slightest from the moment we see our antagonist we pretty much know exactly how the plots going to play out all the way to the unsatisfying finalehis wifes role had lots of potential to be an impactful and emotional beat in the film to be a reminder of why john is doing what hes doing but she feels less like an organic character and purely like words on a script to get the story going where it needs to go to give the audience a grip of how much she means to john we are given exactly one montage and one video shown on a cellphonehis friend marcus has both problems mentioned above not only is his story extremely predictable but you could hardly call him a character you really couldnt care less whether he were to live or die he is given a couple moments to shine in what is supposed to be tense but comes off extremely goofy and laughablei might look like a goof nitpicking the story in an action movie but when the action scenes dont work for me at all what more am i left withthere are a couple technical complaints such as ugly cinematography and bland music choices but nothing nearly as bad as everything else aforementionedi wanted to love this i really didwhens the last time weve had a great action trilogy i want it so bad but this disappointing entry makes me a lot less excited to watch the sequels,reality
as far as the action sequences go its on a par with the ridiculous comic strip hystrionics of everly although the acting is just a tiny bit better than that disaster john clearly has an invisible force field around him so that the entire film is just like watching somebody else playing a shootemup computer gamei sincerely hope that is the worst track that marilyn manson have ever recorded it is crass both musically and lyrically going a long way towards lowering the tone of what was a dodgy film to start with,reality
the screenplay obviously consisted of only the outline of a violent video game that they decided to put on film before making the game the game would be bad enough but this this you cant even play to get gag immersed this you just sit there and let it hit you over the head over  over  over  over  only good things in this1 spotting the gratuitous peter luger sign2 thinking hey thats the lt from the wire i forget is he the one who was once a backup singer for joan armatrading hmm no that was the other guy the detective joan armatrading cool which song was that hhmmm oh yeah maybe love  affection joan armatrading cool,reality
retired from being an assassin because he falls in love ahhhh  however he is forced back into the underworld by the son of a mafia boss who kills his dogthis son apparently not knowing who is despite everyone recognising him including a dumbstruck cop who turns up at johns house after hes shot an endless stream of baddies in the facethe one thing i liked in the movie is the hotelclub that seems to be an escape where baddies can go and the only rule seems to be that no business ie killing can occur on the premises cue the inevitable killing spree on said premisestheres really nothing else to this film it is laughable with so many plot holes but i cant stop watching a film once ive started so i ploughed through now im going to have to watch two sequels for closureif you like mundane gunfights and people being thrown over shoulders then shot in the headthis film is for you,reality
every now and then its nice to watch a movie like this revenge film is unapologetically brutal and it gives us a protagonist that is singleminded in purpose and extraordinarily good at what he does its a simple and satisfying action flick i could see going toetotoe with many of the classic action stars we already know and love and i welcome him with open arms and a concealed side arm,reality
i knew i wanted to see this movie one day but after hearing so many recommendations knowing it was a surprise box office hit and obviously it spawned an equally successful sequel i could not resist it basically keanu reeves has lost his wife helen bridget moynahan following her terminal illness to cope with her death he receives a beagle puppy named daisy as per her instructions john bonds with the they spend the day driving in his vintage 1969 ford mustang mach 1 at a gas station he encounters a trio of russian gangsters their leader iosef tarasov game of thrones alfie allen insists on buying his car john refuses to sell it the mobsters follow john home that night knock him unconscious steal his car and kill daisy iosef takes the mustang to a chop shop run by aurelio john leguizamo he recognises the car upon learning that he stole it from he punches iosef and throws him out john visits aurelio who tells him iosef is the son of viggo tarasov the girl with the dragon tattoos michael nyqvist the head of the russian crime syndicate in new york city viggo finding out about iosefs actions beats and berates him he tells him was his best assassin nicknamed baba yaga or the boogeyman when john wanted to retire and marry viggo gave him an impossible task implied to involve multiple assassinations john succeeded establishing the tarasov syndicate viggo calls john to stop him seeking revenge he silently refuses so viggo sends a twelveman squad to kill him but john kills them and has the bodies professionally removed by charlie commandos david patrick kelly and his team viggo is unsurprised and puts a 2 million bounty on johns head personally offering a contract to johns mentor marcus willem dafoe meanwhile john stays at the continental hotel which caters exclusively to the criminal underworld and permits no business on its premises john learns from the continentals owner winston ian mcshane that iosef is being protected at viggos nightclub the red circle john kills his way to iosef but henchman kirill daniel bernhardt ambushes john allowing iosef to escape john tends to his injuries at the continental there assassin and his former acquaintance ms perkins adrianne palicki sneaks into his room to kill him but marcus alerted him he subdues perkins and forces her to reveal where viggos front is she knocks perkins unconscious and leaves her with fellow assassin harry clarke peters for punishment but she breaks free and kills him little russia church serves as viggos front john travels there destroys the hoard of money and blackmail material viggo and his team arrive john ambushes them but is subdued and captured viggo taunts john for thinking he could leave his old life behind before john can be killed marcus intervenes again john frees himself kills kirill and confronts viggo at gunpoint he reveals iosefs location john travels to iosefs safe house and kills him while perkins tells viggo that john and marcus have been in contact viggo has marcus tortured at his home before he is executed viggo calls john to report this and plans to have perkins ambush him but perkins is called to see winston she is executed fro breaking the continentals rules winston calls john to inform him that viggo plans to escape by helicopter john races to the harbour killing the remaining henchmen john and viggo engage in a fistfight on the dock john disarms viggo pulling out a knife then kills him in the end john is wounded he stops at a waterfront animal clinic to treat his wound and he takes a pit bull puppy who was supposed to be euthanized john and the walk home on the boardwalk where he had his last date with helen also starring dean winters as avi omer barnea as gregori and toby leonard moore as victor reeves proves a fantastic choice as the former hitman that will not be messed with it is a simple revenge plot as a man seeks retribution for those who stole his car and killed his but the fastpaced editing escalating body count and overthetop death and fight sequences are highly skillful and well choreographed the violence adds to the entertainment it feels like something fresh a fantastic action thriller very good,reality
go see this film dont miss it aside from keanus brilliant performance in this film i also need to mention michael nyqvist and willem dafoe this is an enthralling and gripping thrill ride of a movie that builds to such a crescendo that you wont even know whats hit you when it finally does its slick witty and powerful theres a message hidden in all the action and drama this movie delivers a message that will likely stay with you long after the movie is over keanu hasnt been better than this since the matrix here you see keanu really deliver on all levels michael nyqvist is masterful and brings everything he needs to and then some in his portrayal of viggo tarasov i dont think viggo could have been played any better seriously and willem dafoe really knocks it out of the park as marcus honorable mention to alfie allen in his portrayal of iosef tarasov as he really did great work in his performance here the riveting feeling of the film is has all we often hope for in a film like this and were reminded again that is what we ideally crave i do say go see this in imax i think its work the extra to do so,reality
an exhitman comes out of retirement to track down the gangsters that took everything from him is a new action movie starring keanu reeves directed by david leitch and chad stahelski since a little while im a huge fan of keanu reeves and i watched many of his interviews he really seems to be a very cool and down to earth gentleman ive heard and read many positive things about its one of the best action movie of the year and possibly keanu reeves best performance since a long time it doesnt arcane back to the 80s action movies actually its an excellent 2014 action movie no nostalgia required firstly this film blew my mind and keanu reeves gives a lot of himself which is such a great thing to see he is the perfect actor for the lead role everything he does is cool driving fighting shooting and even speaking all those things in general are what an action hero has to do in a good action movie he is bad ass but also as hes retired for a certain time it makes him rusty enough to produce an interesting and tensional movie plus is a slick looking movie with fantastic action scenes and most importantly and surprisingly great dialogue scenes as well the main villain of the movie starring michael nyqvist mission impossible  ghost protocol and millennium is absolutely terrific russians seems to always be the bad guys in fact all the acting on this film is really good i think its actually keanu reeves best film since the matrix mainly because this film requires a lot of an actor its fantastic to see him properly doing the action scenes he knows how to sell action but im not only talking about physical work he also has some very emotional scenes which involved a lot of anger and despair he does a very great job with all of them the screenplay is good its not only a revenge killing movie there been a lot of action world creation you learn a lot about these underworld war criminal i completely understand why the hero goes on this bloody path i have a if anyone hurts my for any reason ill do on them plus the club scene is the best scene of the whole movie it reminds me of a club scene in collateral which is crazy good action however the only flaw i could see in this film is the end as my mum would say the end seems a little bit forced up and a little bit put together really fast thats it finally also sets up ideas of sequel not being forced like in the maze runner you are able to see the characters evolution and the potential for a franchise along the movie john the nicest guy ever just dont screw with him overall has incredible shoot out sequences its anonstop action movie that actually has a clever script a really awesome hero a great villain a few great villains actually it does everything an action movie is supposed to do it understands what its doing and does it extremely well go see this film,reality
when the story begins john keanu reeves has just lost his wife after her death hes a bit lost but tries to rebuild his life one day hes getting gas and a young russianamerican punk notices classic carand tries to buy it off him but isnt interested and declines soon the punk arrives at home with some goons where they surprise himbeating him senseless destroying his stuff killing his and stealing his car this is when you then learn that is a superassassinand the punk chose the wrong guy to attack the jerks father is a bigtime russian mobsterand its a contest to see who will winthe mobster and his gang or on his own considering there are so far two more films it pretty much seems certain who will win this battleto say is a violent film is a gross undestatement once the dies its pretty much a bloodbath from then onwith dispatching countless goons very realistically on his way to ultimate revenge and he doesnt just kill a fewhe makes sure to kill them by double and tripletapping his prey blood and mayhem make this a lousy film to show your kids mother or father oreilly when he comes over for a visitso aside from being a bloodbath is it any good yes its an excellent allaction filmbutit is hard to watch and is essentially a giant gorefest in many ways its like the sonny chiba street fighter filmsthat violent and that dedicated to making sure all the victims are indeed dead mindless violencealbeit well choreographed violence not really my sort of filmperhaps it will be yours,reality
in an age of comic book movies and seemingly endless reboots along comes an original film with an aging keanu reeves as a retired superassassin brought back in to world he tried to leave for the best of action film reasons revengewhat sets this film apart are the incredible fight scenes that are wideshot uninterrupted gun play extraordinaire theres nothing else in hollywood that comes close to this kind of combat choreography this is closerange brutally effective tier one operatorlevel stuff you can tell reeves dedicated himself to this role with vigor and the results are spectacularthe story is lean and slightly cliche as are the onenote russian villains but when the gun play and stunts are is this good who cares i could never buy keanu reeves in the role of a bad ass the matrix but his his performance in is very satisfying and really sells the idea that this guy could kill everyone in the room with a pencil if need beif you love action do yourself a favor and watch this film thank me later,reality
its an action movie its not meant to broadcast oscar performances keanu fits perfectly into the role of this movie and actually trains really hard and impressively if you watch the videos of the actors preparing for the movie performs and pulls it off its a simple plot yet offers insight into the world is in and the action defines it really just take it as it is a fun revenge action filmone of my favorites nit picking and complaining just means this isnt the movie for you,reality
keanu returns in full force after many bad movies he returned to what hes good at taking a simple movie and working with a director who understands action the thing i love the most is the long takes compared to quick cuts in the taken movies during fight scenes,reality
smart edgy quirky and action packed revenge film highlighted by a stellar lead performance by keanu reeves,reality
almost no plot whatsoever but this man knows how to make an action movie appealing to the audience even me who doesnt like these types of movies,reality
action action and more action from beginning to end this movie was go go go and it dove into the secret assassin world which i thought was so cool keanu is at his best,reality
this isnt just a revenge movie it goes much deeper than a man going on a killing spree to avenge the death of a puppy and stealing a mans car lives by a code very similar to the bushido or a medieval knight this movie is about honour and keeping your word no matter what the consequences may be its also about honouring the memory of those who have departed its almost like a fantasy world that exists beneath the normal world where the criminals work with their own currency their own kingdoms and laws in this universe the criminal underworld live by a very strict code of rules that if you break them you will die this movie is about the consequences for ones own actions and how they end up affecting the people around us,reality
the movie has no plot but instead a lot of fighting scenes and in my opinion excessive violence,reality
i really wish i watched this film earlier some people didnt know about until fortnite and i am guilty of this but when the 3 trailer came out i finally decided to watch and the movie quickly became my top 3 favorite movies of that year i love the story and the character keanu reeves was amazing as as also marcus played by william dafoe was awesome as the sniper shooter he was assigned to kill but he decided to help him instead and they made an awesome duo i really wish we got a scene of both of them fighting and killing all the thugs it was such a shame that they killed him off and i loved the final fight between him and viggo the instensity of that scene was severe i also expected john to give losef amd brutal death but he didnt and that was pretty cool about his character thats all i have to say top 3 of 2014,reality
very good if you dont understand russianmany goofs for people speaking russianother than that its a solid movie,reality
is a great action movie with an amazing cinematography what an opening scene what a stylish character what a motivation it is pretty simple but attractive they thought every scene very well tempo is incredible fighting choreographies are intense keanu reeves is so cool this is the example for how this kind of movies must be,reality
for an action movie it was so quiet sure there was music and some talking but mostly the fighting and everything was so quiet i liked it but im not used to fighting scenes being built that waythere was very little explanation for the story or the background or any character we are just put into this world without any explanation what is happening or who anyone is however it is pretty easy to understand the chain and who is with or against johnit was a good action movie with a lot of good actorsalso michael nyqvist is a great actor but his swedish accent is so prominent here if you want to sound like a swede speaking english that is who you should sound likei liked that keanu did his own fight scenes made it feel more badass that he puts in so much time for the fightingone thing there were so many times they could have shot him but instead of a clean shot they did the bond villain thing over and over also can shoot several people while running and tumbling over things but not a whiny manchild in a towel thats the difficult one,reality
its dumb fun good dumb fun most of the issues with this movie are drowned out with the amazing action sequences and the fast exhibilirating pace it has some creative use of color and good cinematography but what holds it down for me is only a few cliches over exposition and under developed characters it could be more creative with a movie like this you can do anything that fits the excitement but some things are very basic like the exposition some times it does a great job at the show dont tell rule then right after has the characters talking about john back story instead of just showing us like i would prefer either way it is entertaining and thats all it really needs to be,reality
its really good its a bit like the crow in away he only kills bad people you dont have to feel badactually goes out of his way by not killing certain former colleaguesexcellent use of music and great to see ian mcshaneexcellent performance all aroundits easily the best film in the franchise,reality
way over the topy even when framed as pure escapist fiction theres too many unlikely scenarios were expected to believethe main character somehow survives all those bullets and dozens of bad guy clonesi avoided this 2014 movie until now 2019 and now i know why i didnt bother before i knew it would be one of those movies where implausible action is ramped up to 11the one thing ill give it is the photography very cinematic style you keep watching to see what happens but its unsatisfying garbage like a mediocre video game i prefer more realism even in braindead action revenge movieswriters need to learn that piling up the body count doesnt add value think of stuff to put in between the bodies hitting the floor,reality
admittedly it feels dragged on for the first few scenes but quickly and effectively proves itself to be an outstanding action drama,reality
ill keep it simple and shorthimself is a skilled assassin however a major reason why he is soo legendary is because of how lame and stupid the bad guys are technically should have died roughly four times in the movie but because the enemy were stupid or for the convenience of he livesaside from that the action is not bad keanu did great and the whole continental concept is interesting if youre looking for a more fleshed out movie with character development sensible action and a more realistic execution then this isnt the movie,reality
was presented in an extraordinary way a new iconic and unique character in the film genre that i like most about the action the action scenes are absolutely amazing as is the history and development of each character i scored less for the level of action scenes but as is the best trilogy of action movies ive ever seen since rambo or 80s and 90s classics if not always because there has been a noticeable improvement in every technical aspect of the films and the way in which the bad guys are killed the second film remains the best of all also for the harmony of the audiovideo editing,reality
was a really positive surprise for me in 2014 i dont know why i didnt write a review back then but i want to correct my mistakemay not exactly be a master piece in the story department but the simple premise of the revenge story after the bad guys do something horrible to the main character just works perfectly finethe background of the character becomes quite clear very quickly and you dont really need to know much more is a very focused character and if you get on his bad side you will know that youve made a mistakeis very powerful but he also isnt invincible so it is interesting to follow him along while issues more and more dinner reservations and overall it ends for me in a pretty satisfying way,reality
bit of prep work ahead of seeing 3 herekeanu reeves a retired hitman is forced back into that life when hes beaten his car is stolen and his is killed by iosef alfie allen the son of a russia crime boss michael nyqvist so begins act of supreme revenge as he uses his very specific skill set to track down and kill all of the crime syndicateseeing it again i was surprised at how much time gave to establishing the character and world before unleashing him its probably 25 minutes or so before the action really starts which is helpful as those 25 minutes are really the building blocks that the three films have been based on it does go some way to establishing the world of too with glimpses of the continental and establishing the rules of the universe that will become more important in the sequelsacting is not good as you might imagine though reeves has somehow found a way to legitimise his one note deadpan style for the story is a basic revenge thriller but thats not really why were here we are here for glorious visceral expertly choreographed violence that has proved a stark contrast to the cgi heavy or edited within an inch of their lives action films that have been prevalent in the last few years though its only a return really to how films used to be made particularly in the hong kong style the fact its been away for a while does make it feel like is special and unique,reality
stylish thrilling and giddily kinetic serves as a satisfying return to action for keanu reeves  and what looks like it could be the first of a franchise,reality
my favorite movie pattern is men slaughter mob for daughterwifeparentscat or dog,reality

there is a lot of action but in general the movie feels empty with no meaning at all,reality
revenge movie with lots of dead bodies because a was killed  even bronson or eastwood cant beat that story indeed was and is a pleasure now 3 on screen to watch  great action and keanu reeves is finally back at the top,reality
less shaky cam but still smooth and beautyserves as a satisfying return to action for keanu reevesis a lean mean revenger to go with its icecold protagonist,reality
what a story unique man so different that others movies i really like it the story from the dog,reality
there is more than a neat and rich gentlemanly dressing up in chad stahelskis than i could handle making it almost impossible for me to avoid another viewing tn,reality
is a movie that requires little brain power or sustained effort of attention the first installment provides a great amount of action with strong fighting sequals and believable but optimistic flowkeanu brings a good amount of intensity which keeps you engage in his revengeful pursuesi really enjoyed the character build early in the movie which allowed the audience to empathize with johns at times sadistic motivesgreat cast strong enough acting and enough one liners to remind you of a fully intentioned action blockbusteri thought the screening of view points gave different levels of perception and really made you reminisce about the matrix dayssolid movie perfect for a hangover and leaves me motivated to follow up with the sequals,reality
no oscars not even one sure its pretty violent but if you merge hacksaw ridge and saving private ryan best picture nominees you can probably get the same amount of violence maybe and keanu reeves has one helluva performance from his amazing action seems he probably did himself and his russian dialogue that makes no sense without context and maybe a little less with also i didnt know willem defoe was in the movie before a watched it if he had more words to say that couldve been oscar worthy ooh and that ending and then the next ending after that top notchthat doesnt count as spoilers and if it does why havent you watched the movie,reality
as the only keanu reeves movie that ive ever seen im glad it was as good as this one when it comes to action movies many fall flat the exceptions being kingsman and james bond the one man vs the world is a great plot and is executed wonderfully the backstory of john is mysterious and is revealed throughout the film hes a wonderful retired guy and it is super entertaining to see his relationship with others the antagonists are more like drones run by a leader as opposed to people a great part of this movie is the cinematography especially how it works in tandem with the choreography of the fight scenes even outside of these amazing fight scenes the cinematography does not falter and is complemented by the beautiful lighting used in the slower dramatic scenes look out for the subtitles too they are sharp and dynamic,reality
the plot for is so simple that when i first told a friend about the film he scoffed saying who needs to see a movie about a guy getting revenge for his i honestly wouldve agreed with my friend but received amazing reviews when it came out and i ended up seeing it opening weekend and i was absolutely blown away yes the film has a rather simplistic plot but the world that it crafts is so much deeper than what you see onscreen and that world is further elaborated on in chapter 2 the side characters all have interesting backstories and murky relations with our titular character the settings all have specific rules the twist and turns of the plot are exciting and beyond all that the action is spectacular the cinematography is great and the sequel is just as good,reality
i watched this movie until the very end waiting to see something realisticbut nothing came i gave 610 because it was entertaining thats itone guy shootin so many bad guys in his own house only days after he got beat up in that same housenot even using a bullit proof vest or something like thatjames bond gets away with that and the ateam did something like that toobut i expected a bit more,reality
after watching the film i would say that i enjoyed it a lot i enjoyed the well choreographed and well edited fight scenes which help showcase john proficiency with guns and fighting this movies fight scenes differ from majority of the action sequences i have watched in different movies in both the editing and sound used during those scenes the movie also does a great job the set making as the movie creates different scenes which match the vibe of each scene such as in the nightclubs hotels etcafter watching the movie i would say that defies my expectations as an action film as the movie not only focuses on the amazing action scenes and showing john proficiency but it also effectively builds the story around and the world that he lives in as in the movie they also have different rules such as no killing on continental grounds and the presence of a hotel or place for assassins to stay and they even have their own currency which after watching many action movies i did not come to expect an action movie to spend time where they introduce and show that and the world he lives in is complex and big,reality
is a well made movie with good acting visual effects and sound design although the concept of its plot is a bit stupid it was able to expound on it and make it less shallow by giving it more background and motive one of the best aspects is its acting the movies action scenes were well made and the actors chosen to fit these roles performed well in these scenes this combined with well done visual effects and sound design kept the audience on the edge of their seats but despite this the concept the plot is based of is quite shallow though the writers gave it more background and motive in an attempt to expound on the concept their efforts are unable to fully mask its flaws in the plotfor me this movie was able to differentiate itself from most of the other action films that i have watched what made the movie stick out for me was its ability to take a generally predictable plot formula and expound on it although storyline is not the movies strongest points thee films writers were able to mask the concept and change the sequence formula to make it less predictable and more interesting,reality
im already almost 4 years late to the party and im surely not going to hate on this movie because by now people probably know what to expect prior to watching itive given it 5 because come on its keanu other than this the story is typical you will predict the ending after 10 minutesits straight up rambo up in here guns blazing shooting everyone on sight i read somewhere the body count was 84 this is a lot of people to kill in about 2 hoursim going to watch chapter 2 anyway be careful not to piss off or break into his house he once killed 3 armed men with a pencil,reality
tells a story of an exhitman whose wife recently passed away due to a heart condition after a group of thugs break into his house kill his and steal his car john goes on a bloody path of revenge and does whatever is necessary to find the people that caused him so much pain this movie is an exhilarating watch from beginning to end keanu reeves gives an amazing performance his best since the matrix he does a lot of amazing stunts and whips ass like there is no tomorrow the story is simple yet intriguing and never drags the villain is a little weak but thats a minor nitpickis relentless and definitely deserves your attention 910,reality
is a revenge drama which offers little along the lines of a story and and an excess of action the story which starts off as interesting loses your attention almost as instantly a retired hitman or so they call him singlehandedly outmanoeuvres a flock of gangsters including their bossperformances keanu reeves as the titular character carries the burden of almost everything that happens in the rather short run of 101 minutes of the movie alfie allen hey there reek adrianne palicki and ian mcshane are decent in portraying their characters michael nyqvist shines as the baddie bossoverall verdict is another one of those stereotypical action movies the only difference being that there is way too much action and gravitydefying stunts stuffed into it while a section of the audience might enjoy this actionpacked flick id rather like to watch a movie that is equal on both frontsthe story and the action,reality
is an excellent action entertainer however its not only that  it is also very dark intense  violent in an enjoyable way and its action coordination is sharp and engaging keanu reeves will always be remembered as the iconic  similar to sylvester stallones iconic characters of rocky and rambo and arnorlds iconic terminator rolethe basic story revolves around a former hitman named reeves who is also known as the boogeyman when the son of a sophisticated gangster steals his car and kills his the only remaining connection to recently deceased wife john gets back to his killer mode to take revenge keanu reeves is simply outstanding menacing and totally convincing as the dangerous hitman his devilishlyheroic style in this movie has set a new benchmark for the future aspiring action heroesthe action sequences are well planned and perfectly executed by keanu reeves each action sequence is a feast for lovers of this genre the direction is effective  a dark and intense atmosphere has elevated the deadly nature of the criminal world shown in the movie in conclusion it is one of the best intense action thriller movies ever made,reality
2014i thought the weak point of this movie would be keanu reeves since hes not the best actor in town but instead it was the monotony of the killing on and on all at the same pace with hardly a breakim not complaining about violence herethats what this kind of revenge movie is all about reeves plays a guy who used to be a trained assassin one of the best and he has to come out of retirement youll see why in the first ten minutes and he is now after some of the people he once worked for so they are formidable foes and cruelbut thats about it the process of getting even takes up the rest of the movie and there are the necessary clubs and warehouses the muscle car antics and the flipping and diving while shooting your guns with perfect accuracy mostly there is just shooting and fighting and fighting and shooting so how to make a movie that has this oneliner idea work with psychology cleverness surprise and even failure sometimes you wont see any of that here you also wont see humor by luck the preview for my showing in a theater was die hard and what a reminder of a terrific action movie where one guy has to kill a whole slew of enemies but there its funny there are constant twists and turns and you actually care about the herothats another problem here you care about mr because he was wronged at the start but hes not a sympathetic person you just dont really worry about him i suppose you know he wont die right away so you are on his side more or less but not with much investment in a weird way some of the villains were more compelling than the main bad guy is a terrific michael nyqvist who is always really good and willem dafoe plays a terrific small key parti might have left a movie this straight forward if it werent for one thingits photographed well the camera light and generally the editing are all elegant and almost pretty in a good way the sets are filmed in a logical way that moves you through the spaces through the eye of the camera with confidence and dark beauty good stuff and it had my eyes gluednow give the thing something more and glue the rest of me,reality
my head seriously hurts after watching this i dont know if this is the editors first attempt or if they just hired some schmo off the street but i have no idea what just happened to the last 14213 of my life this is sloppy at best and i went into it expecting to see a good action flick an entertaining ride as advised by people whom i would trust for a movie recommendationfor the first 37 minutes i thought there was something wrong with the movie im serious i thought they had spliced the reels incorrectly then i realized that it was just the way it was theres no build up no story just gratuitous violence with no real back story or explanation you get a few lines spat at you in between gunfire or head shots but theres no serious explanation as to whats going on i am sincerely let down and dont know what else to say this movie bugged me enough to come on here and write a review wow i cant see straight this is not worth your time trust me,reality
i went into the film not expecting anything ground breaking i was just expecting a standard action flick but what i got was an hour an a half of no holds barred action and killing the storyline really wasnt the best it was a but hey i dont normally watch a lot of action films but im glad i watched this some of it was laughable and indeed i did laugh countless times just at the sheer amount of badass kills and fights the headshots are shockingly great it plays out kind of like a video game theres crazy kills and boss battlestake the film for what it is it was a good watch imo best action film ive seen in a long time there was no time to be bored 810,reality
was an explosive action packed thrill ride highly entertaining for the majority of the runtime thanks to the heart pounding music breath taking stunts and keanu reeves himself the cinematography used in this film is extraordinary especially during the night club scene where i have never witnessed keanu reeves kick that much ass since the matrix there were stirring hand to hand combat scenes and verbal responses to the death scenes as i sat in my chair feeling the adrenaline throbbing in my insides as for the performances the acting was satisfying enough for an action flick except for willem dafoe he was excellent but cmon hes always excellent the action sequences were handled very nicely every shot was sharp and precise unlike recent action films that use shaky cam techniques where you cant even identify whose fighting who which makes this a very refreshing action film and highly satisfying for any one who wants neo back on the big screen i would highly recommend this film for any action lovers or any keanu reeves fan and willem dafoe hands down best 2014 action flick and a successful resurrection for kenaus career,reality

firstly i love action kung fu gun fu car chases swordfighting sieges and battles wholesale destruction of cities and planets  bring it and it doesnt have to be artsy brainy historically accurate or close to the source material it just has to keep me entertained from start to finish in the entire running time of there was only about twenty seconds of anything resembling entertainment keanu shoots up a fake orthodox church in one scene at another point dafoe is trying to unscrew his silencer and has to lick his fingers because its hot that i thought was the best scene in the filmthe rest is an unimaginative humorless slog through clichs and tropes that got worn out almost two decades ago a bunch of high priced assassins dressed like professional card and yoyo illusionists from vegas the assassins are supposed to abide by a thing  its like rules or a code orwhats that word oh yeah  creed flashy cars going really fast making sharp turns and getting smashed up whatever happened to car explosions cheapskates sleazysuited eurotrash gangsters from some unspecified eastern european country are these guys supposed to be russian or something because they were terrible at it a trashy throbbing nightclub where they party at yep all there  presented like were supposed to know all about this kind of stuff but still be all excited and into it like its the first time weve seen it the worst of both worlds the dialogue is c grade at best but without the charm of overthetop oneliners and hammy acting terrible pacing we barely made it halfway through the film before we decided to start watching this like trump watches movies  aka fast forwarding to all the gun battles and car chasesand youd think with nothing else going for it they would have just made the violence the centerpiece of the film when the eventual outcome is the same bad guys get killed you can at least get creative with how that happens shoot em up and hardcore henry tried very hard to be innovative in that regard and it paid off but in this film literally 90 of the people die from a shot to the head maybe theres some halfhearted gun fu and an occasional goon gets his from a stab wound or a broken neck a goon or two gets tossed through a big window but otherwise its just headshots  or rather the director  must have played a lot of fps games online in his formative years and it shows i would honestly have rather watched two hours of someone doing that instead of wasting my time on this filmbottom line avoid at all costs makes the guy who directed jack reacher look like orson wells anyone who rates this highly is either a paid shill or simply a philistine who knows nothing about films  not even mindless action at the time of writing this is rated above 7 with over 300000 votesso take reviews and ratings with a huge grain of salt if you dont already a sad wasted opportunity to cast nick cage as and maybe salvage a star or two,reality
greetings from lithuania2014 is a very cool action flick it has keanu reeves in a badass role playing an unstoppable hitman who goes on a vengeance road after his is  well i wont spoil it this flick is very well constructed  great action scenes lots of blood but not gore simple but strong central character and a lot of bad guys to shoot at had probably more headshots in this movie than i got in a call of duty  thats how you make sure that bad guys are dead for goodoverall is a very enjoyable action flick it has over the top central hero very simple but cool story great action scenes do not take it to seriously and if you enjoy action movies is not to be missed,reality
is a mob hit man who left that life after falling in love with a woman 5 years later his wife dies and to make sure hes not alone she arranges for a to be brought to him after her death a few days after he receives his new companion a group of men wanting to steal his car break in and beat him up and kill his when he recovers he sets to get the ones who killed his he learns that the leader is the son of his former employer and the man wanting to protect his son tries to take care of but once a killer always a killer theres still life in the old yetis one of those strange films that comes out of nowhere and smacks you right in the face its an unexpected gem of a movie the makers of the movie know that reeves cant act hence the limited dialogue he has but also know that he can carry a film like this so the endless set pieces look brilliant tooand for reeves its a win win situation he hasnt been in a decent big release film for some time now and here he proves he still has it screen presence that is not acting chopsplus its one of those films that just doesnt try too hard to be anything other than it is a revenge thriller plain and simple what is clever is that its not just the is peeved about its the fact that this was the last thing his wife gave him and for the signified ease of the grieving process and her legacy would sort of continue every time he looked in the puppys eyesif your a huge lover be prepared to be upset thats all im saying on that matter but rest assured the punishment fits the crime over and over and over againits a very slick affair the action is effortlessly cool and the nightclub scene is one of the highlights of the whole movieat timesthe movie reminded me of wanted especially when it was set in the strange hotel for hit men and then other times it reminded me of crank because of its bizarre characters and bonkers narrativeif you are a fan of reeves heres the movie youve been waiting for side that awful rave in zion for others its a visual feast all style over substance with some great support from the likes of mcshane dafoe and even alfie allenits most excellent and never once bogus,reality
ultimately doesnt really amount to much in terms of substance but the film clearly knows that the filmmakers are very aware and they play it up to its maximum potential reeves actually makes for a solid action lead here and the film does good with its incredible style by allowing a lot of quiet intensity to play out before the big action scenes the film is incredibly stylized so i could see that being a problem for many but to me completely reminiscent of drive and everything that arthouse action can do i dont know how the film will hold up in the future but as of now im in sort of love i highly recommend this aesthetically very pleasing and also a lot of fun,reality
reeves grezzy hair thats all i could think about when watching this empty predictable laughable waste of 35 popcorndrinks and admission x2 reeves attempt at action fighting was iffy as he hesitated on nearly all of the shots i cannot get the scene with the nj cop at his door after complaints after loud noises were heard coming from home out of my head the cop just acknowledges the dead bodies on the floor and just walk off hardly shows a bruise after some horrific punches thrown his way wast of money and waist of time thats two hours ill never get backkanue reeves in is a poor attempt to get some jason bourne money next,reality
in the 90s and early 2000s any action movie with keanu reeves was a mustsee movie for all in the past eight years or so keanu reeves practically went off the map and no one knew if he was still acting anymore then he suddenly decides to pick up where he left off and return to action everyones been asking me if im back yeah im thinking im back with the plot of somewhat laughably mimicking the career of keanu reeves we cannot help but enjoy the thrilling ride of seeing a solid action filmi do not usually give the plot of the film but i feel it is appropriate for this one a once great hit man comes out of retirement from his peaceful quiet life to track down the men who took everything he had showing he has not lost his touch at what he does with the exception of trying to enact revenge on people who wrecked his life that plot sounds a lot like keanu reevess career that is why i thought he was perfect for the role and why the role was perfect for him i would have given this movie a higher rating if it was not for the fact that i have seen this type of movie many times before in fact reminded me a lot of a movie i saw a month ago called the equalizer which has an extreme number of similarities with if it was the first time i ever saw a movie with this plot it would be one of my favorite films sadly it is not the case and i never was really surprised with the direction the movie wentenough about that time to get on to why i still liked the movie the main reason the movie is very enjoyable is because it accomplished what it wanted as solid action film it did not try to do more or get overly complicated in its own plot leaving the audience lost it was clearcut and direct what many films are not successful achieving there is no one is better to achieve it than keanu reeves i am not sure if the script was written with keanu reeves in mind or if it was just cast perfectly whatever the case may be the intimidating quiet resourceful guy pretty much describes keanu reeves bread and butter role the rest of the cast did their job accordingly but keanu reeves definitely shines in his return to action films if you are in a theater where they are showing both and the equalizer flip a coin and you will enjoy both of them equally still i recommend you see at some point while it is still in theaters for more of my reviews go to my website at reviewsbywestcom,reality
gritty stylish and fast paced action film with very overused revengeback from retirement plot but you dont even notice the paper thin plot because of the strong characters and well directed action scenes there were not a single dull moment in this hour and half long film it was very good that writerdirector didnt waste much time on the characters back story we got to see the glimpse of his life and that was all the viewer needed the mystery behind only grows when we see the first reactions of some other characters when they learn that he has been attacked it wasnt only john character that actually evolved without much development every talking scene we learned to know the players more and more but just enough to keep them mysterious and keep us still interested its something that is missing in most of the newer action films real powerful acting work it was real pleasure to see keanu back at his top form and kudos to the screenwriter who managed to write russian dialog that actually sounded little bit like russian not just some pointless gibberish and of course the actors who managed to speak it understandably,reality
so after his and wife die and after his car is stolen john keanu reeves gets angry comes out of retirement and spends the whole movie killing mobsters with action music in the backgroundthis movie was nonstop action almost literallyit was a great movie and lots of big name actors would did a tremendous job best action film probably in the last 5 yearsnot the best movie all round but for pure action this takes top grades probably my favourite keanu movie even better than the matrix this movie has a few twists but it is very predictable which doesnt matter because its how he gets from start to finish that is worth the ride not the story,reality
is my kind of action movie its simple strait to the point and builds a truly unique crime world while not taking itself too seriously its just fun keanu reeves plays a quiet man who has given up his career of an assassin to care for his dying wife the film opens up with her funeral and wake what disease did she die from it never says but it doesnt matter what does matter is that is hurting from his loss and we can clearly see this as a last gift before her death his wife gets him a puppy to help deal with the grief the movie does a terrific job of building a believable love for the in a short period of time after showing interest in john car young gangsters break in to johns house beat him up kill the and steal his car big mistake after this the movie never stops it is walltowall action and it is good the performances are solid all around willem defoe is great as john old friend marcus and michael nyqvist is particularly entertaining as the leader of the crime world but it is keanu reeves we come to see this man has not lost his edge from what ive gathered from other peoples opinions you either love keanu or hate him i like him they dont give him too much dialogue here but thats a good thing keanu plays a hardened killer very well and his actions speak far louder then words apparently he did 90 of his own stunts for this film and for the amount of stunts here thats damn impressive i liked that the film builds up how much of a badass is by telling us how much he is feared in the crime world they call him the boogeyman for pete sakelets talk about the setting the filmmakers have done an excellent job of building a crime world that is colorful with stylish neon lights but dark and seedy all at the same time i particularly like how everyone involved in this world pays with gold coins it was a cool touch to let the audience know who is inside and who isnt my gripes i felt the ending to be a little lack luster after such a terrific ride but i guess it left me wanting more also some of the lines seem a bit out of place in a cheesy way but all in all this is a great action film with a star that was in desperate need of a win keanu defiantly won with this one,reality
this movie truly feel like returning back in time but with todays technology and style it had a mix of commando for the one man army setup but without the one liners and corny style keanu reevesdefinitely succeed at being both a badass character but somebody that you truly feel fori was reading other reviews and one point that stand out also to me is even tough the movie is fast to start there aint too much build up you still care a lot for that man when the is kill despite the short time he spent with it i still felt his pain and grief the guy had nothing left beside a and a car and they took it from himso yeah this movie is just pure old school greatness like you dont see many these days there is even a small role for bloodsports daniel bernhardt which was also in the matrix reloaded and there first fight is extremely satisfyingthe movie include lots of gunfights a fair amount of hand to hand combat some car chases scene and pretty much everything you expect from an action movie its really a great time,reality
enter the world of mob hit men was the greatest the russian mob ever had as a hired asset dubbed not as the boogeyman but as the one they call to kill the boogeyman john then retires after finding a girl and marrying recently losing his wife to an illness john receives her final gift a he named daisy so that he can continue on loving something one day iosef the russia mobs crown prince who dont know the mobs history attacked john killing daisy and taking johns 69 boss mustang after john previously denied his offer to buy the car the russian mob kingpin viggo iosefs father tried to negotiate with john only for john to hang up the phone on him john easily snuff out the hit men victor sends at him viggo hires marcus johns old friend to kill john meanwhile john goes to stay at the continental hotel which is actually a neutral place where hit men dont kill each other he meets old acquaintances there perkins and winston who informs him of iosefs location john storms the place killing many henchmen but iosef slips away when john returns to the continental marcus has a clean shot opportunity at him but he shoots a warning shot as perkins storms into the room john neutralizes her extracts some info and leaves her to another hotel guest john goes and burns viggos money stash but then he gets caught as viggo leaves john for his two henchmen to kill marcus snipes one of them and john takes care of the other he then storms at viggo but he lets viggo live after he tells him iosefs location john storms the place and quickly kills iosef viggo doesnt stand still and has perkins kill marcus for not killing john when he had the chance the continentals management goes to marcuss place and execute perkins for breaking the continentals rule they also inform john of viggos location john storms the place impeding viggos run john and viggo have a final fight where john intentionally lets himself get stabbed by viggo only to lock his arm retake the knife and jam it to viggos neck john then gets another from a shelterokay i admit the story feels like a lame choice for a movie for me personally it even gets to feel like a guilty pleasure theres no real invention at the story a hard boiled killer going out his retirement to exact revenge theres really nothing new added to this movie its even so very predictable in how the story unravels itself all the elements of a classic ninetyminute revenge action movie is there the cause the conflict the hunt and the target escaping once or twice before the final showdownyet i find that this movie really knows what other elements to maximize to compensate for the mediocre story it nicely grasp the dramatization of the revenge cause as a sad story but also simultaneously as funny i really like the screenplay and dialog emphasize this on the way aurelio explains his story and viggos reaction early on the dialog on that part is a superb piece that cracked my laugh but then it gets back to serious as we see john stroking the dead daisys headthe action is also a strong point in this movie possibly even its strongest point unlike typical action movies this movie doesnt offer realistic tactical firefights as the most of the shootings happen in up and close point blank range theres also less of beautifully choreographed martial arts trade of moves as the fights quickly turn into ground grappling moves which is the most realistic choice to go in the real world instead at times the character presents us with quite a combination of gun shooting and fighting making him look like hes doing a hard and stylish action of gun dancethe acting is just a decent overall work for me keanu reeves did great in portraying the calm hit man exacting his revenge michael nyqvist did quite well in portraying a balance of all the aspects of viggos character the ruthlessness and also the cowardice having willem dafoe and john leguizamo also did the movie a great favor although i think that they deserve even more significant parts2014 really deserves an 8 out of 10 score for me a recommendation is definitely a yes although without any unique thing to offer in the story department this movie can sure make up for it at the action side and making the early irony something fun to watch,reality
four and a half stars out of fiveshootemup action flick starring keanu reeves as an exhitman who comes out of retirement to avenge his dead it was directed by first time feature filmmakers david leitch and chad stahelski former stuntmen and fight coordinators and written by derek kolstad the film also stars michael nyqvist alfie allen dean winters adrianne palicki ian mcshane john leguizamo and willem dafoe its a pretty cool and stylized action flick thats also a great comeback for keanu reevesreeves plays a former hitman who retired when his wife helen bridget moynahan became deathly ill with cancer as hes grieving he receives a posthumous gift from her in the form of a puppy named daisy its explained through a letter from helen that she wanted john to have the to help him cope with her passing john quickly becomes attached to daisy so when russian gang members break into his house and kill the as well as steal his 69 mustang john decides to come out of retirement to get revenge nyqvist plays the father of one of the gang members as well as johns former employeris about as much of a badass action hero character as ive seen in a film and reeves is great in the role i think reeves has gotten much better as an actor overtime probably especially because his career took a pretty big downward turn recently its great to see him back in action and cooler than ever i think filmmakers will do a lot more with this character as well hes already a part of the video game payday 2 and a film franchise seems very likely the movie is also a great showcase for leitch and stahelski as directors and i cant wait to see more from them too if youre an action fan you definitely dont want to miss this onewatch our movie review show movie talk at youtuben3ywdecculw,reality
this is a great action movie people are saying the script is sub par but tell me a true action movie that has a stellar script the lack of dialog goes along with a lack of back story is the boogeyman and no one knows a lot of information about the boogeyman the lack of back story which hopefully may come out in a sequellets your mind run a little wild mr was tasked to commit an impossible assassination to get out of the assassins lifestyle you never learn what or how they were completed but you learn is an indomitable man and completes his task with a force of sheer will if you want a move thick on dialog and low on action rent the notebookpeople complain he never misses but 90 of the time he shoots someone in the head they are laying on the ground or holding a wounded limb i think this is acceptable he is a seasoned hit man but i know from experience that accuracy with a firearm is a tarnishable skill if he had not fired a gun in five years he would have a little bit of a relearning curveoverall a great movie that i will own and will take its place beside the first matrix movie,reality
ok im biased im big on keanu no homo but jking aside is the movie that proves reeves is still in the game ironically the titular character is doing just what its titular leading actor is supposedly doing coming back and staying current you only have to watch the movie 15 minutes to catch the tongue in cheek remarks thrown out ad nauseam to thiskeanu is all over this movie i dont know how he manages to stay inshape after 50 its clearly himself doing most of the stunt work he might just have the fountain of youth shoved somewhere in his body he is the one after all its still good ol stone face keanu not as hammy as keanu from constantine or as cold as keanu from dtess but somewhere in between the guy is all about subtlety and jest he is forward without being forward i like itwillem ucking dafoe is there any role this cat cannot play seriously you had me at dafoe i think dafoe is competing with freeman and jackson for most utilized supporting actor in hollywood hes never a main always some bamf supporting cast member and as always hes just too good not to love even in fault in our stars he was a lovable crass cynic but in this movie hes one of the characters who you just know is a true badass keanu always picks characters who are loners yet somehow attracts the guardian angel types or people who just want him to win this time around dafoe is guardian angelalfie allen and michael nyqvist are the true breakout actors in this film allen as we all know from game of thrones is easy to hate but hard to love he plays this role much as he does in got by being the prick mob bosss spoiled brat son who has a penchant for not thinking two seconds ahead and the mob boss nyqvist is probably the best representation of a smarmy yet sophisticated russian don since well hes probably the first really well adapted russian mob boss weve ever seen jack reacher went up against the russians and i know theres some in person of interest but nyqvists viggo tarasov has the swagger brains and even compassion to stay fresh and noteworthy well after the films ended hes even got this breadth about him a foreboding barrel chested strength that you dont see a lot of these days good casting choice both actors played their respective wells true to formid like to say more about other actorscharacters in the movie but it would honestly contain spoilers you dont have to even watch the trailer to find out that this is a straight shoot em up true to the core the freaking dies how much you wanna bet others will tooread other reviews if you want to find out about plots subplots and pacing stays fresh and thrilling the entire way through the stunt works amazing the acting is slightly campy yet engaging the premise is simple and the movies a blast,reality
this is a welcome surprise who would have thought keanu could play such a cool character with that much conviction he does a perfect job here displaying the right attitude and making sure every shot hits its target its all very simple hes a grieving widower and one arrogant and spoiled jerk comes and messes with him by doing so is forced out of retirement because someone has decided to ruin his late wifes legacyit might look like a silly vendetta to a few but this is the type of film where theres not much need for emotional speeches and long flashbacks its pretty much understood this man is capable of delivering the goods while working but he appreciated what an alternate lifestyle offered and regrets losing it spending a few years in retirement hasnt dulled his skills as he hunts his prey we see his exchanges with a few of the people in his previous world and its obvious that he occupied a special place there he commands respect and is well likedrespected he knows how to follow the rules express his gratitude to those who help him and ironically he is well a good guy in the middle of this netherworldafter the breakin in house it becomes clear he wont stop until he gets what he wants in a perfectly cast part we enjoy every step he takes seeking retribution yes theres plenty of violence but its ok to see the good guy get even hes not immortal or invulnerable he gets pretty beat up a couple of times but courtesy of a clever script he manages to pull through with the help of a couple of friends and a very interesting deal near the endit appears all is properly resolved by the end buy we can only hope theres more of this quiet hero in the future this has been a good year for this type of characters and im surprised audiences have not quite responded theyre the ones missing on the some of the best thrillers of the year just go in dont think too much and enjoy,reality
look i go to the movies a lot i usually go a few times a month and i usually go by myself we all have our own ways of relaxing and going to the flicks is mine ive seen them all most more than once the way i look at it is you have to see the bad ones to appreciated the good ones ive not only walked out of the theater many times disappointed but heck ive walked in many times expecting to be disappointed i honestly bought my ticket expecting it to be a at best so so flick i cant tell you how refreshing it was to be wrong look i wont lie the story is about as basic as they come but this movie makes it work the action is as about as crisp as ive ever seen the constant action the music the well chosen actors along with reeves ever less is more presence grabs you nicely and keeps you entertained look dont waste your time if your looking for academy worthy material but if your looking for a solid action flick that will keep you entertained for a few hours this movie is definitely for you,reality
i think every movie needs to be graded on a scale of its potential910 for what this movie is it could hardly be better of course you shouldnt expect some deep thought provoking movie this is action its like an action movie from the 80s or 90s  done better than any of themsome things are done so amazing that i think are likely attributed to david leitch andor chad stahelski perhaps its their stunt background thats really made them understand how these fights should look and how people actually handle injury and gunshots thats severely lacking in most movies there is no people taking a shot to the chest flying back 50 feet and croaking there are not people standing around taking their turns on nope people are double taped everyone is finished off with a shot to the heart or chest is taking on multiple people at a time with them attacking him like youd expect this may offend some but id say this movie makes even legendary movies like ip man look bad yet at the same time seems completely human as he should there is this perfect balance of him just appearing to be the really good assassin that he is without seeming to have super powersthe only reason its not a 1010 are a few shortcomings michael nyqvists acting falls short on occasion in my opinion and yes keanus acting in this moving is actually really fantastic i find it a little odd that isnt more often looking back over his shoulder to make sure there isnt something therebut the choreography gets more right than just about any movie ive seen the skiptoend opening scene that so many movies do now days is also here sometimes those are good but in this case it was really pointless the exposition goes by great and they really should have gotten right to that and skipped that,reality
this may be the most outrageous over the top rip off of taken yet but the problem here is is not trying to save his daughter wife or even himself he runs on pure revengethe entire movie is formatted around his beloved wife dying of cancer but the cause of all his rage is that his 1969 mustang is stolen not a boss 429 as iosef says and his puppy that his dead wife sent him from the grave is killed by russian mob thugswhats odd is that this amazing assassin and martial arts expert who is warned by his barks just walks into a home invasion and is knocked out by three knuckleheadsthe rest of the movie is massacre after massacre of what seems like 1000 henchmen in scene after scene of choreographed bloodshedclich after clich some weird subplot about a hotel a girl who can beat up guys twice her size and the funniest part no police anywhere except for one who comes to his house sees dead bodies knows who john is but does nothing does an investigation no news reports or anything suggesting there has been 100 people killed in a weeks timeoh and you cant pump your own gas in nj as seen when john meets iosef in the beginning,reality
has a lot in common with the equalizer 2013 both feature a former highly skilled assassin who has retired to live in quiet solitude but who is compelled to use his deadly skills again when a russian mobster commits a despicable act of violence denzel washington is generally considered the better actor and brings a sense of gravitas to his role however keanu reeves brings more a sense of melancholy and reluctance to his role which was sadly lacking in te washington looks bigger stronger and more physically imposing but never displays any particular skill at martial arts the fights in te are shot in semidarkness and edited with a lot of quick cuts so washingtons character never seems truly credible as the tough fighter he is supposed to be in contrast the fight scenes in jw are masterfully choreographed one can not only see but follow the action reeves comes across as a much more credible action hero skilled with guns knives and his bare hands the russian mobsters are much more menacing evil and capable in te than in jw where they are adequate but less memorable these gangsters are threedimensional characters with flaws foibles and idiosyncrasies that make them more realistic and even a little likable they also have conflicting agendas whereas the gangsters in te are more narrowly focused and unwavering jw also has a much better production design the color palate costumes and cinematography blow te away neither film is perfect jw starts off a bit slowly attempting to bolster motivations that dont need bolstering but once it begins maintains a steady action pace between the two jw is much more enjoyable and reeves is a better action hero than washington jw doesnt have quite the panache or complexity of django unchained rock n rolla smokin aces or the underrated lucky number slevin but its a solid effort by all involved,reality
i thought this was going to be just another movie where the main character has to kill all the bad guys to get to the main bad guy while i was right about this i did enjoy it a whole lot more than i originally thoughtthe start of the movie is a bit fast you get to know everything you need too but without much details the acting is okay but when the action starts you dont care about this anymore most of the action scenes are really cool and some of the gun fighting scenes are just awesome for a hollywood movie its actually quite realistic you can see keanus training for the matrix is still in his muscles the main plot is not that special but some side plots are really nice humor was a big part of the movie much to my surprise the entire room was laughing quite a few timesfor a oneguykillsallthebadguys movie this was really good and thats why im rating it 710,reality
first of all if you dont like violent revenge driven crime dramas this movie is not for you so dont post about it if you are like 80 of the rest of the world you are going to love this movie slick editing and direction make it beautiful to watch incredible choreography make it fun and keanu makes it reali wont go into detail on what the movie is about the tag lines and numerous reviews will do that for you bottom line this movie is fun to watch exciting exhilarating and just darn awesome if you liked these other movies you will most likely like john equalizer gladiator man on fire law abiding citizen they have similar themes of revenge and justice,reality
this movie is full of cool action scenes and the fight scenes are well choreographed but thats about all the nice things i can say about it the story line is so thin and plain dude has his murdered and goes on a killing spree i understand that this was all he had left of his relationship but cmon this ex assassin should have a little more control the movie goes on forever for something so simple theres shorter movies about killing sprees where the protagonist has their whole family killed call me crazy but i dont think this movie deserves high praise at all,reality
star rating  saturday night  friday night  friday morning  sunday night  monday morning after the tragic death of his wife keanu reeves is given a as a parting gift from her in order that he wont return to his former life of violence and mayhem however a run in with gangsters son iosef alfie allen results in his home being invaded and his pet being brutally murdered this sets the fire raging in johns heart again and before long he returns to the streets to enact brutal revenge however iosefs father is viggo michael nvquist a russian mob boss and his former employerits remarkable that while far better actors have descended into a dvd bargain bin hellhole from which there seems no return keanu reeves would still appear to have the star power to headline a hollywood action film he could be comfortably settled into that world quite nicely now but here he is in this fairly well received action film quite hard to fathom why really when what we have is a fairly standard join the dots piece of work with unexciting action scenes that are too sped up and hyper kinetic to make any impactwhile reeves broods and does the action hero typeset that hes so suited to singer lily allens brother alfie appears as the despicable young villain and the likes of willem dafoe and john leguizamo are drafted in as support its appeal seemingly lies in its simplicity with what seems to be a deliberately straightforward uncomplicated plot that takes you from a to b pretty easily it does this pretty competently but rather than be an admirably simple bit of fun its just a piecemeal ineffective affair that washes over you like rain ,reality
although i will never forgive keanu reeves for ruining coppolas dracula with a legendary terrible performance he is not an inherently bad actor like a wellhoned tool  keanu is fine if put in the right place if misplaced say as a 19th century upperclass englishman he is disastrous here keanu is ideally cast as titular assassin the part exploits his wiry physicality and doesnt stretch his limited range requiring him to project deadly efficiency as he slaughters russian mobsters who killed his the latter may sound stupid but its actually the smartest decision in the movie as it places the story firmly in comic book territory which fits the hyperstylized violence seen here the script also features a few clever touches like golden coins used as currency for special services in the criminal underworld such as corpse disposal or a hotel known as a truce zone for killers again an appropriate comic book feeldirector stahelski uses his experience as stunt coordinator to craft energetic setpieces peaking in attack to an underground pool there is a great moment when the camera pans laterally showing the silhouette of a mobster shot against a blue panel then follows another thug until takes him down all while the music throbs in the backgroundthe cast also includes willem dafoe ian mcshane adrianne palicki and michael nyqvist the latter steals the movie with a combination of sharp malevolence and detached sense of humor like when he recalls killing three men with a pencil then walks next to one of his henchmen and casually mimics a stab at his throatas far as revengepower fantasies go this one at least is competently made6510,reality
retired hitman check actor who has lost his way with the public after a successful franchise check fun entertaining and utterly badass double check dont let the trailers fool you into thinking this is in the vein of the bad slew of action films we have had recently with actors like arnie sly stallone and liam neeson trying to get back on form actually succeeds in being everything it wants to be and everything its audience wants and keanu reeves kicks serious ass as the title character word of advice do not mess with john the plot follows john after the tragic death of his wife who leaves him a puppy as a last gift to help him cope with the loss and to make sure he isnt alone when russian mobsters try to buy his vintage car and he refuses they get mad and decide to kill his this sets john off on a revenge rampage and brings him out of retirement to take out everyone who took everything from him as a lover this was hard to watch but seeing keanu reeves mow down rows of mobsters will never get old this film could have easily been like other action films today with a mediocre plot stretched over 2 hours expecting to be loved it knows what it is from the get go and after a slightly slow opening we are given a treat for action fans and a real guys film not that women cant also enjoy this aside from keanu reeves willem defoe is in this film recently it feels like willem defoe is still being used to throw in to minor roles in films for the sake of it but for him it works so props for that we recently saw him in both the fault in our stars and the grand budapest hotel but in both films whilst he could have been played by almost anyone he was significant and great like he was in at first he almost felt like jason statham in furious 7 popping up when he was needed to be a threat to the main character which isnt such a bad thing but he becomes more than this which was cool to seebut the show is very much keanu reeves own and he knows this the dialogue was delivered well from him and whereas he was a badass in the matrix in this film he was a million notches above neo every action scene felt like a video game in the best way the nightclub scene was particularly pulse pounding and made me feel right in the moment it is guaranteed that any scene featuring and a room full of bad guys is going to be beautifully stylised and absolutely absurd i can see this being a nice small franchise which could work way better than something like taken and it would be cool to see johns backstory unravelled in the end i enjoyed this movie a hell of a lot and for any fan of action movies this is a must see keanu has never been better just never mess with his life if he is anything like then i feel sorry for anyone that attempts it,reality
never wrote a review before but felt to on this for a specific reason keanu reevesi swear everything i see him in while most of the movies i enjoy his characters in them i usually dontthey all seem to come from the same type of moldall rather coldish in some aspect dryish stale not saying hes a bad actor he just seems to always be the same person in everythingmaybe its just me this is why up until this movie my favorite character of his was always ted in the bill  ted movies cause he is so different from the other characters hes played firstly this is one heck of an action movie i kept finding myself sad whenever i thought it was just about to end just to have another action packed scene come in instead and be joyous againlol the soundtrack is epic for me anywaysim a musician with a similar style so it really stood out for mereeves character thoughreminded me a little somewhat of him in constantineonly in that in both hes a bit hardcold goodbad guy but in a totally different way in each of themi dont know if its just his unshaven badass look in this movie or his acting but i didnt feel like oh this is just keanu reeves again and more like this is meaning the character itself stood out so much more if that makes sense may sound silly to some i also love the way how hes so precise in his movements when going after people i so wish i had gotten to see this in the theater sure there may not be a whole lot to the story its simple and whatnot but for the person going into this wanting pure action such this is perfect i heard a lot of bad reviews stating oh this has been done over and over its old nothing new seen it before blah blah blah buttake 3 movies all very high grossingdances with wolves the last samurai and avatarall 3 have a similar premise which is mostly why haters of avatar disliked itsaid it was too much like dances with wolvesi kinda thought the last samurai fit that premise too but love that movie nevertheless and unless i just havent heard it or something ive never heard people dis the last samurai like thatmeaning i think people went into avatar expecting something like even more complex bigger different in whatever way they were hoping fori think the same happens here with john even though it has a good rating all the bad things i hear about it are almost all the same,reality
10 april 2015 film of choice at the plaza dorchester tonight  if you are not a fan of gratuitous violence blood and gorestop now this film is not for you however if you are a fan of the actionthriller genre with all of the above included the i thoroughly recommend this film keanu reeves has definitely matured this film although a little wandering at the beginning was gripping stuff reeves plays a professional hitman who fell in love and retired when everything is taken away from him he looks for revenge and with his reputation definitely preceding him he systematically exacts revenge from those who must pay this was set in new york a city beautifully shot from above at night looking straight down world is one with rules of its own and you just accept this story without wondering why the good citizens of new york are not getting their knickers in a twist about the bodies and car wrecks piling up elegantly written these people simply do not exist and the story continues on regardless it wasnt until the credits came up at the end that i realised that the film was produced in part by eva longoria of desperate housewives fame not everybodys cup of tea but id definitely raise another earl grey,reality
another woefully misunderstood film ive seen many reviews attacking this film what did you expect from a keanu reeves driven action film a robert de niro acted oscar worthy film get the heck out of here you can not judge all films based on the same factors it is the equivalent of comparing say godfather part ii and a nightmare on elm street both incredible films in their genre but holding them up against the academy standards a nightmare on elm street would be instantly brushed aside which is something that really irks me i bet i could drive the academy driven critics insane to say birdman was a 10010 if i were to hold it to the same standards as a nightmare on elm street because that rating would be perfectly acceptable in comparison it is just highly unfair to compare films that are so different in their target audience and the aim of the filmthe film was directed by chad stahleski and david leitch who are widely known for their stunt work or at least they should be known for it their collective filmography includes the likes of the matrix the crow swat and van helsing so to say they are well versed in the world of stunts and action is an understatement so the choice to have them direct the widely coveted script by derek kolstad makes perfect sense at its core a revenge film that is brutal and doesnt mess around at all hard to believe that this is the directorial debut of both stahleski and leitch their work comes across as truly experienced directors within the given genre after this film i can see them going very far in the action world easy to see why they were given a 2 and are being touted for an upcoming dccu filmthe film starts out with losing his wife to some sort of illness details never given to the audience not needed at all he inherits a beagle puppy from his late to help cope with her passing he quickly falls in love with the pup spending all his time with her and his 69 mustang the mustang which catches the eye of a young member of the russian mafia who tries to persuade him to sell the car iosef alfie allen not accepting of decision to completely shoot down any sale decides to take the car iosef and his gang break into the house to rob the car beat to within an inch of his life and more disturbing of all kill his these events reactive into his previous life he left behind as a mafia hitman so now is set to destroy any members that get in his way of an organisation of which he was once an employeethis is the film that came bring reeves back from some of his recent performances which i highly recommend you stay away from the likes of henrys crime 47 ronin and generation um come to mind however this time around keanu gave a solid performance as the films titular character keanu done everything right to portray which emotions he needed plus his background in martial arts really blended well with the directors choice to use gunfu which if you are not familiar with once you watch this you will understand perfectly the phrasing it was not just reeves who gave a great performance other performances shone too from the likes of michael nyqvist lance reddick paul mcshane and the ever enjoyable adrianne palicki it was a genius idea to give reeves less to say and allow him to use his actions instead of words what is the old idiom actions speak louder than words its like that was made for mr himselfthe film does not mess around it gets straight to the point storywise and characterwise were straight into the action within the first 1520 minutes which may feel like it will have adverse effects on the pacing of the film which at the time was a bit of a worry of mine also safe to say my reservations were unwarranted the film ran at a wonderful pace with moving quickly onto his next henchman to take on in brutally beautiful manors each time resulting in a truly wonderful 100 minutes to behold for any actionthrillermartial arts fan of any ageoverall the film was a spectacle in its given genres edge of the seat action for 101 minutes be it from reeves kicking ass or him getting his ass kicked there is one thing i absolutely loved about this film which was the directors choice to have once he beat a villain was to put onetwo rounds into their hearthead to make sure they were dead seems like something every hitman should do it just really stood out in this film for me this film was an incredible watch full of action and a decent story which slightly predictable heck what action film isnt i really couldnt recommend this film any higher to fans of the genre or reeves if youre a fan of neither i think this will change your view on either one,reality
keanu reeves has not offered the cinematic world much since the matrix trilogy can reignite his impact walking into the cinema has had a positive buzz but is it enough to get people to the theatres the appeal is seeing keanu back in his wheel house films with short bits of dialogue subtle humour and a multitude of action not since point break has reeves had a role that looked so right for him overall rating 3 stars cinematic value 375 stars family value 15 starsfortune favours the brave english translation of john tattoodo not mess with a mans is basic knowledge in film class 101 from old yeller to turner  hooch the serves as the catalyst for some of the key events in film history is no different last gift from his recently deceased wife is a puppy named daisy she serves as a connection to his wife and as comfort during his grief through a chance encounter with the russian mafia he is robbed and without spoiling too much of the story they mess with the which unleashes a tale of revenge and a horrific day at the office for the men who robbed call it arrogance or naivety these thieves robbed the wrong guy only recently retired from being a hitman was not just any assassin but the bogeyman feared by the mere mention of his name the thieves cause the emotional tipping point for him to unleash his revenge on the dark criminal underworld the story takes on a hunt for the men who took away his opportunity to grieve and through the process his past is revealed and the audience is introduced to the hitmans hidden world his target through most of the film is iosef tarasov played by alfie allen game of thrones who seems to have perfected the pathetic elder son role in television and on the big screen the unsympathetic character of iosef seems to warrant the inevitable vigilante justice from his introductory scene as with most revenge films the believability of survival of the main character goes beyond comprehension but it is an undeniable guilty pleasure to experience keanu reeves matrix is the champion for the average man he never comes off as too smart or fit but is at his best with little dialogue and multiple points of action this film happens fast and is over before you can consider the sheer lunacy of the concept the debutant directorial team of david leitch and chad stahelski give reeves the perfect storyline to capitalise on his strengths like all of the action in this film they seem to understand that the best lines come quick subtle and hit their mark is a simple story of revenge shot against a dark criminal landscape but moves beyond the clich do not misunderstand this film is exceptionally violent but the actions of reeves are projected thorough the film with a force that is fuelled by well drawn supporting characters michael nyqvist ian mcshane and willem dafoe manage well orchestrated dialogue and fill in the necessary back story to quicken the pace of the film they allow reeves to be the action lead and he is only required to deliver memorable one liners the quick linguistic delivery adds the needed levity for the audience to catch their breath the film deserves its rating due to violence and language but it does open the door to many conversation points wrestles with the love and loss of his wife opening a door into the raw emotion that occurs in the life of a spouse that grieves the loneliness love and anger spins together into a mix that is not healthy in this film but warrants consideration and discussion should people be given allowance during a time of trauma of the magnitude the other significant plot point that should be considered is the code when the movie moves to the continental hotel things get interesting this is a world where hit men and women go for a place of neutrality winston ian mcshane is the owner and stresses the code that underpins this violent world only those within the system seem to know the code and understand the penalties for breaking it but the bigger question is who is the one who determines the code and how should justice be enacted is merely another revenge film but even the simplest of stories can open the door for the bigger questions of life and could even fuel conversation for those who regularly attend these films leaving the cinema this is a simple but well made film cinematic simplicity is a fine line the creators of the film have to determine what to add or take away for the effectiveness of a film sometimes it works and sometimes it does not but with it works this was the right film to capitalise on keanu reeves strengths and was a fresh telling of a well worn story line if you remember anything dont mess with the dogreel dialogue what are the bigger questions to consider from this film 1 is revenge the answer to injustice psalm 37 2729 romans 121721 2 what is biblical justice psalm 79 romans 356 3 who determines right and wrong john 31921 matthew 2818please study the rating before going to see this

first off the setting is cool the main idea sounds great and choosing keanu reeves for the main role was a perfect matchbut i can only agree with the 110 review of shudmeilas13 from november 2014 titled this movie is a bad joke plus theres unfortunately many more plotholes than he mentionsevery negative point he lists is very true besides his first one with the russian accent i didnt really care about that one there was barely a scene where i did not shake my head and shrug because the writing was just so illogicali can take a movie wheres a lot of shooting and action i love that but if the plot has so many holes that you wouldnt even need guns to shoot some that is the worst sign hope the 2nd one is better i like keanu reeves and the setting and i really want to be good and not a badly written mess,reality
makes a chuck norris movie look like shakespeare tragedy everyone everywhere knows except for the son of a russian mobster who is apparently oblivious to all things dont mess with a mans beagle,reality
this was unwatchable since the killing scene lol so he is a professional but let few idiots to get inside his house and kill his and take his car but then he goes and kills everybody hahahahthis was the dumbest movie i have ever seen with such a great actorit was a pure waste of time at the end it was soo bad i had to skip the part where he had to kill the boss why would i continue watching this garbage i already knew he will kill the boss and all blah blah blahthe director really wanter rain and go it but he really wanted the 2 guys wounded to be wasted and look at each other like any big action and he got it but he had to find a way to injure and could not find a way so john guy himself so he can be down on the ground with the boss looking at each other this was the funniest moment everi did not watch the entire fight i skip to that part and was curious how john got hurt by that old boss so i had to watch that joke again so yeaa ok john hurt himselflol i really hopped to be my new 3 part favorite movie but i will never watch the other 2 partssorry this is a plain dumb movieahahah what was thissome kind of new comedy lol,reality
first of all this is a pure action movie so obviously its gonna be unrealistic actor have to survive rt first review for the retards who saw the movie and rated 11movie is about an ex hitman obvio retired so in the movie like the character says he is rusty and thus when the fellas breakin to his house he got hit the first hit was on the back of his head someone please explain to these fools some anatomy2those whove worked with him know him he is not einstein or god that everyone in the world know him in mafia world the kid is new unless he likes learning history books he wouldnt know3he didnt miss the hit on kid dude the hit was on the glass but accurate then he had a hostage etc he is using a short range weapon consider movement and distance to target too dude buy some new specs or brain4he didnt kill female assassin cause ait was continental grounds bhe wanted info5i will agree after vigo gets him he couldve done betterdude he wont just kill john vigo will torture him the bag scene wasnt much of a torture that i will agree the bounty was before he burnt his vault to the ground buddynow do i have to really point out who have brain cellsnow for those who didnt see yetthe movie is well scripted as any action movie can be the mag rounds even safety switches there are a few holes obvio but is rare compared to other of the same genre  you know sometimes he forgets that he was hit by a car etc the delay of parkins death the pillow shot a few like that you do understand by now youre trying to find holes as if it was based on a true story d d that shows how good this movie isits worth watching buds and please use your brains too the sequel is good too,reality
heres the story a local moronic tough guy and his cohorts break into a guys house and steal his car and kill his puppy the guy gathers up all of his weapons and goes out to public venues and slaughters people for revenge how often have we heard this story of course in real life the venues are shopping malls schools or clubs and the perpetrator is usually portrayed as a troubled loner in this movie is a hero who killed a bunch of bad guys with precise placement of bullets of course in real life the bullets are sprayed helterskelter by a sideways held gun and often kill innocent bystanders or children the fact that bullets when they miss the intended target dont dissipate into thin air seems to be lost to many people there are innocent people slaughtered daily due to perceived social slights and minor insults resolved with gun violence and this movie glorifies widespread killing obviously i found this movie disturbing i can see a movie like this and be disturbed by the message but others maybe of marginal mental capacities ingest the message as righteous behavior a recent local road rage incident was in the news where a high school graduate was shot in the head over lane merging jockeying and this movie promoting vigilante gun violence was praised by critics what the hell is wrong with this country,reality
all too often nowadays action movie means a convoluted unrealistic mess full of spectacular stunts and unbelievable cgi that are exactly that very hard to believe more often than not i pass this revenge heagainst everybody film is an exception and what a wonderful welcome one it isis the kind of action movie i love one in which you find yourself nodding in agreement enjoying fantastic cinematic violence rooting for the hero knowing he should prevail but not sure whether he will survive or not appreciating the journey and thoroughly enjoying the ride until the climaxthe plot is not groundbreaking stuff it can be summed up in but a few words and yet simple works well in this case there are no stupid plot twists no maddening plot holes no illogical actions the characters are believable their motivations clear enough its all quite easy to understand and enjoythat is not to take way from the work the writers and directors did in this movie they built a rich realistic universe one in which the viewers can easily get immersed the action is tight the filming very welldone capturing every hit stabbing bullet in precise fashion its gritty and stylish without going overboard performances are mostly pretty good tooin the end this is a pretty good action movie it may lack a bit of emotional depth when compared to genre classics but in this day and age a throwback film like this is a true blessing while you wont be left thinking for days about this one is a very fun film to watch  great action scenes sound performances a wellcrafted believable straightforward movie that gives action fans exactly what they hope for nothing too groundbreaking an effective enjoyable action movie but one lacking a couple of elements to be a truly great one,reality
is a groundbreaking film in the action genrekeanu reeves star of such noted actioners as bill  teds excellent adventure somethings gotta give and even cowgirls get the blues plays the titular character is a retired hitman whose wife has recently died he is given a puppy as a condolence and quickly bonds with the who becomes a frequent passenger in 1969 mustang tragedy strikes however when a group of thugs break into house and kill the after robbing him of his beloved ford when i say tragedy strikes i mean it strikes the thugs isnt merely a hitman hes a welltrained one after hooking up with some old and new allies from the underworld sets out to avenge the death of his but he quickly finds that the leader of the gang which attacked him is the spoiled son of a russian mob boss upon hearing this decides his quest for vengeance will be too risky and the film ends as he settles down into a quiet life with a new kittenactually just kidding embarks on a mad hunt for his killer in his effort to exact revenge for the killing of his he fells at least a hundred enemies in combat in a crackling showdown wordlessly shoots the unarmed kid before walking away wordlessly figuring the apple doesnt fall far from the tree pursues the old man and brilliantly fools the gangster into stabbing him being that the old man is a hardened russian gangster he freezes up after stabbing giving reeves a chance to turn the tables after killing a dozen of his henchmen he gets another and everyone is happyis a groundbreaking film in that it eschews the niceties of most modern films like plot and character like a race car stripped of amenities it jumps straight into the action and never lets up the scene in which shoots a mob henchman in the head was a standout the scene in which shoots a mob henchman in the chest was also notably exciting the scene in which shoots three mob henchmen in the head chest and groin was particularly riproaring one advantage of is that its action sequences are kept simple and sweet films with complex action tend to be boring because they are rather hard to follow dialogue is also wisely kept to a minimum a wellendowed young female assassin is also a clever choice who also thankfully speaks as little as possiblewatching i was reminded of a much inferior older film called die hard works for the same reasons die hard doesnt most of die hard revolved around bruce willis crawling through air ducts complaining about his wife and discussing westerns over the radio with an overweight police officer when the action mercifully does occur its often burdened by confusing stunts and unnecessary editing die hard is widely regarded as a failure due to its reliance on dialogue and contrived overlyemotional characters i saw the film recently on lifetime with my mother she was crying when willis had to drag his feet through broken glass i on the other hand thought it was the most satisfying moment in the entire film willis character and possibly the actor himself for signing on to this crap deserved a little bloodletting after spending so much of the movie weeping and failing to kill significant numbers of terrorists on the other hand would have dispatched the effeminate european terrorists by slapping them and chasing them away he also would have cheated on his annoying wife with a wellendowed young female assassiner secretary hopefully well be able to see this in the sequel which was just released recently,reality
for people who just heard or seen the photos of keanu reeves from this movie and thought yeah this maybe is a good flick and then reading about it about being the most underrated movie of the year and so on yeah i was one of those and it was kinda a letdown actually i dont think i hyped it too much but it just seemed like a good action movie and the letdown is hands down the story but not bad writing its more how they presented it in the movie strange way on how they did it and it is very clear they just tried to jam it in as fast as they could so they could do brainless action all the way keanu reeves acting  theres nothing wrong with it i loved that part but everything else with the movie was just a snore i mean this thing that have been way overplayed about showed the end first and then go back to the beginning dont you just hate that it was cool the first time but now you see it all the time in tv shows and movies and even video games and yes i think i am not alone when i say just stop just stop this movie is enjoyable yes but the beginning was so slow i almost turned it off and said to myself oh well another movie that didnt lived up to what i expected sigh good things with the movie  keanu reeves willem dafoe  the fighting scenes with gunsthe bad the storythe focus on brainless hollywood action instead of a good storystupid bad guys obviously stupid even more stupid than an old arnold moviethe slow startthe reason for this movie and the last one reason for this movie its painfully obvious this movie was made to do a brainless action movie because that is what it became when they just tossed away the story for action sure it is very done well the gun scenes but i want some real story and some story i can think about after seeing this but nope frankly i dont even know why anyone would think about this movie more than 3 seconds afterwards and thinking that was dumb huh,reality
i read a todd solondz quote once yeah weird way to start a review for but stick with me folks where he was talking about his movie happiness and how its actually quite simple to gain sympathy from an audience and he talked about how the writer can just give a character cancer and everyone will feel sorry for that person and if you make someone a victim and heshes not right off the bat the villain or something then theres identification right away at the start of this movie we dont know who this man exactly is or what he does or how he can afford such a good house and car but we do know that he has just lost his wife to some sickness and that she left him as a parting gift a so that he could move on with his life and not any old or some mangy thing from the vet but the cutest goddamn puppy that you could ever lay your eyes on needless to say things look good until happens to stop at a gas station a russian shead talks some crap good ol reek from game of thrones alfie allen who is another good shead here then that night the mobsters come to his house trash it beat him up and worst of all kill the dogthe writers go for a premise thats fairly easy and borderline lazy of course we want to see get the payback on these guys  even as they were once his former employers and ironically in order to really retire he had to pull a number that set up the russian mobsters empire in cozy terms  because they killed the prettywittyy as the dude would say in big lebowski this aggression will not stand what ensues from here is a whole lot of violence and carnage peppered with a whole lot of good character actors and awesome people  willem dafoe ian mcshane dean winters adrienne palikci lance reddick remember him from the wire and oz  and thats about it in that way its admirable as a kind of meatnpotatoes flick for the guys and maybe some girls out there too watch keanu reeves kill a lot of people but there are two things that i didnt expect out of what is basically a gigantic action killfest that is a timewaster 1 the fight and stunt choreography and how the director and cameraman and editor get it all together works with some tight and efficient work while also being complex at the same time you can tell where everyone is in relation to one another whether its keanu and a dozen guys on a club floor or just him and palicki getting dirty not that dirty the fighting kind in a hotel room or three cars in a high speed chase its not chaotic but it is intense work and i got more drawn in to it than i expectedthe 2 is that theres a whole lot of good background to this world that is in what i mean is that it almost resembles something out of a comic book for adults in a good way its like theres this whole set up functionality for someone like to work in to the point of almost or simply being satirical i had a big laugh at one moment when a cop just one comes to place after he guns down a whole bunch of guys at night they know each other apparently and he sees a dead guy on the floor behind him and he just gives him a have a good night and walks away then the cleaning crew comes what do they do when theyre not cleaning up or maybe theres always work to be done as far as disposing of bodies in this new york and then theres the hotel that stays at while he looks for josef and its run like a hotel for the criminal element as if they are always expecting guys with guns to be in their midst and only as that maybe they keep it down a littlethis is a heightened reality as opposed to something fully realistic but this added to my pleasure watching the movie i wanted to see a whole movie set in this world that mcshanes character seems to run  like some old filmnoir he sits in a jazz club lit very prettily this is a colorful movie for big chunks  and that reddick is the concierge i suppose the problem though is that underneath all of this style and potential for a much grander experience its still a shallow action movie in a way it may work for this kind of material that its simply you stole my car you killed my and my wife for an audience coming to this maybe too much ambiguity would muddy the waters but i wish the filmmakers who are clever enough to put in the touches of a much larger environment for these criminals dafoe has a good if predictable role also as a hitman by the way had gone a little furtheras it stands i liked it though by a certain point  like say in the last twenty minutes  it starts to get into overkill territory i was still into it for the action and would recommend it simply on those terms but if youre looking for something challenging as far as engagingchallenging and audiences sympathies you wont get it this is all about reeves punching kicking slamming knifing blasting crashing shooting choking and doing everything under the sun and while hes not neo here he might as well be,reality

synopsis retired hit man forces himself out of retirement to track down and kill gangsters that took away something of unique sentimentality from himoverview i really went into this film with low expectations and thought it would be a schlock inducing mess of mind numbing action and boring dialogue with no emotional draw to the story it was in a sense but it was more than that and feel like at first i was taking it to seriously firstly this movie is a lot of fun bar the first ten minutes of the film its a great nonstop action film that delivers on what it can i thought that concept at first was boring because at least every three months we see some michael bay bt or just some generic thriller movie we have no interest in seeing however there was a lot of buzz surrounding this so i thought i gave it a shoti think the reason the movie works so well is because the action set pieces are so well done some of the best ive personally seen in a long time theyre grounded in reality and dont need special effects or loud noises to keep the film flowing just well executed stunt choreography ii think this is mostly down to the directors david leitch and chad stahelski  whove been a stunt coordinators for a majority of their careers 300 v for vendetta the matrix you take two stunt coordinators who have worked on very stylized movies throughout their time you get that influence rubbing off that leads me to my next point even the direction in the slower dialogue heavy scenes is great the great lighting down to the strange subtitles gives it a gritty comic book feelperformances i feel like their wasnt really stand outs in the movie everybody did a solid job if i was to choose michael nyqvist as the head antagonist viggo tarasov would take the cake it felt like every scene was in the movie was at its best willem dafoe as hitman marcus deserves a mention specifically the characters final scene with tarasov of course keanu reeves did a solid job as the lead however i do feel you could replace him with any actor and they could have done the job all the same but it is nice to see defoe and reeves reappearing in a more audience driven blockbuster movienoteworthy moments the action scenes were incredibly well done however i do feel one sequence was done so well its the one that got me completely engaged with the film the nightclub scene was just great from every perspective the direction was topnotch with the four levels of the nightclub all having different lighting tones and the non stop fight choreography blistering through each set it was performed ideally from both alfie allen and keanu reeves as well as all of the stunt cast it didnt go over the top and some signature kill moves were highlighted in john fight style which gave it a sense of authenticity rather than the protagonist turns up and fights people he has a style and the most effective ways to kill people ad he repeats them several times it doesnt try to make every death scene spectacular but it packs more of a punch i do feel like you could pick any set piece in the movie and say it was your favourite and i could totally understand why they all are completely different from a claustrophobic home invasion to a nonstop action maze in a nightclub to a loud and brash gun fight outside a church to a car orientated shootout at fishing docks to an up close and personal one on one fight very dynamic and every scene is different and entertainingfinal verdict this movie is nothing like any liam neeson cash grab nonsense thats in the cinema right now its a great 100minute movie that celebrates whats fun about action movies its grounded in a noncgi world filled with somewhat cheesy lines and brilliantly choreographed set pieces its self aware it knows that its not trying to be a wellwritten oscarnominated script its entertaining with good performances directed really well and the stunt choreography is some of the best thats been in a movie for a long timeif you want to enjoy a movie that you dont need to concentrate when watching but it isnt mind numbingly terrible this is it,reality
wow i was excited to see keanu returning to the modern action genre and as he does not disappoint keanu steps out from his usual monotonic delivery and on several occasions in the film he is given the opportunity to showcase his acting abilities which for much of his career have lay dormantthere is more to than just a standard revenge flick there is a depth of character and a subtleness in the cinematography that is often missing from such genre films the action is interlaced regularly with moments of levity tension and even sadness is not your typical shoot em up action flick yes it has a gratuitously high body count and some of the takedowns are brutal in their efficiency and ruthlessness yet underneath all the blood and corpses there is a vast undercurrent of emotion and symbolism just waiting to be discovered i highly recommend this movie 45 out of 5 stars,reality
the key to truly appreciating lies in knowing what youre getting yourself into when you go to see this movie i was quite impressed by the group that attended the same screening as i did  everywhere i turned i could hear the same variation of oh its a movie about a guy whose gets killed and then he goes to take revenge by killing a lot of people sounds ludicrous i know thats kind of the whole point thoughis not a storydriven movie it is however a fun and funny actiondriven cinematic ride i knew exactly what kind of film i was going to see and i got that and so much more is a badass who also happens to have an impeccable sense of style does not really say much part of what makes him such a badass but knows quite a few ways to get rid of the people he decides to get rid ofguns snipers knives things that go boom fancy cars a storm of violence interspersed with a few intentional laughter inducing moments its a movie that does not take itself seriously and does not expect its audience to either it just gives you pure unadulterated entertainment impressive supportive cast  it took me a while to recognize michael nyqvist a swedish actor in a role of a russian mobster the parts of the dialogue that are in russian are translated in an almost cartoonishly stylized manner that makes those scenes resemble a comic book more than a movie i was half expecting to see text bubbles appearingits a phenomenal bmovie that introduces an interesting view of the criminal underworld  juxtaposing classy and crude unwritten rules in a manner of honor among criminals id say it is a testosterone in overdrive type of movie but one that i believe will appeal to women as well if for no other reason than because is so incredibly cool i know im grateful that i got to see it on a big screen  i think its the only way to truly immerse yourself in and appreciate all the long uninterrupted film takes that will make you hold your breathneed i even mention that id be thrilled beyond belief if there ends up being a sequel ,reality
first off in keanus personal life he has suffered quite horrific tragedy with his ex girlf and sister dying so i felt that watching his wife in this circumstance dying would be quite horrible for him to go through it is an interesting choice to say the least as surely you would want to act out the opposite to real life maybe it was cathartic secondly this is an action movie with sprinklings of black humour throughout little real life moments where it comes up for air and then swiftly ducks it head back down into the crime world i really appreciated that the whole did he really just get away with that kind of moment the storyline isnt award winning or the russian accents spot on but as an action movie how many of them have you felt the accents werent right or the storyline wasnt so cripplingly in depth i can think of many whose entire story plot could be written in a paragraph enjoy it for what it is and stop looking for a super elite snobby arthouse film that isnt there it is an action movie i like the premise that the powerful crime people have access to a world with their own currency that separates them from the civilians why couldnt that be a possibility the hotel and club scene in the basement reminded me of constantine a bitsometimes you need a bit of simplicity in your life and a direct approach to things and this film has you rooting for the goodbad guy john and that means some emotional investment which works for me,reality
in a period when the hollywood studios stuff scripts with elements to appeal to every viewer demographic this grindhouse style action picture keeps the focus on gunfights and car chases however there is a style and intelligence present in this script that elevate the experience way above the norm for the genrei was reminded of jack reacher 2012 payback 1999 and get carter 1971 all r rated movies unfortunately for the 15 year old boys who would absolutely love them its irritating to me that the commercial need for the pg13 rating has steered action films toward the comic book adaptations where death on screen is generally avoided although the film takes place in a heightened fantasy version of new york it maintains a quite realistic style of fighting and action choreography most of the fights are settled by someone getting shot and killedthere are a lot of angry onestar reviews on imdb these are from people who dont like the genre and were expecting something characterdriven the professional reviewers rated the picture on how well it achieves what it set out to do and it was quite wellreviewed indeed by those professionalsthe release didnt have a huge push behind it and it was a soso performer at the domestic box office but i think the essential enjoyability and quality here will translate into strong results as a rental it did manage to edge out expendables 3 a massively dumb effort to appeal to the same audience and one that was crippled by its efforts to achieve a pg13 and a broader appeal its good to see keanu reeves here in a project that is a perfect fit for his screen presence,reality
the film is lean mean effective and satisfying if you are in the mood and itching for a brainless revenge tale and over the top action will scratch that itch granted as it was mentioned by others there are plot holes and sequences that defies logic and common sense but a movie is a movie it is like a fantasy that plays out on a big screen ask yourself does any of your fantasies stand against the trial of logic i guess not so lets move on was lethal and ruthless professional hit man and he was known for that but he got out and he got comfortable thats why in the beginning of the movie he was a little slow and rusty that was not a plot hole or scripting error but as he step back into the dark world of the past he started remembering and picking up the pace hes becoming the legendary again right on the screen and you feel that and that is damn satisfying keanu reeves is his woodiness and dead eye stare adds to overall feel of a killing machine that he was different from the roles he played before hes more mature more weathered the sign of aging and roughness of his appearance now made him perfect for and his usual arrogance and stubbornness just made more bad ass and fearless hes perfectly dressed for cocktail party but he kills like a rabid on drugs hes effective and merciless he cuts right to the point and no bullshit he rarely talks when he does open his mouth nothing fancy or philosophical comes out he wants revenge and he makes sure that he gets it i dont know about you but i dig that its like a breath of fresh air no more melodramatic moral dilemma when all you had was taken away from you you want to be no freaking question askedthis film has the style of noir and carnage of manga it is not big on logic but it is what it is a no bullshit and no brainer revenge tale you want to mess with me okay lets see if i kill you all how you are going to mess with me now,reality
is and old fashioned revenge movie much like the equalizer is actually but a lot more ed pun intended i think i dont have to explain how these revenge movies work they the character and the audience need a reason to takewant revenge on the bad guys and then you can brace yourself for the violent killing spree that leads up to the main prize what keanu lacks in sympathetic warm charisma like denzel he more than makes up in coolness and style is just badass the fights are excellently choreographed uses the central axis relock system in combination with martial arts moves and the gunfights are fast and furious the overall design of the sets and costumes is very slick and stylish and the soundtrack also features some cool tunes although the script wasnt written with reeves in mind it does feel like it fits like a glove wasnt a great box office success but i bet this will grow into a cult hit on dvd and blu ray do check it out,reality
lack of logical and gangster regency made the 2014 all boring for the action lovershas made it all washed up reminded the old days of scarface the first person shooting style movies are getting popular in the trend of hollywood but scarcity of strong and ideological substance had made all those trying almost ridiculed has the ability to meet the hunger of the action lovers created in 2014 reeves seemed so perfect in this character that he made us constrained to think about his perfectness in the character screenplay is fluent storytelling fashion will enchant you limited span of story has made this film nonetheless better keanu reeves could be a giant action legend in the post arnold and willis era and i think this film will be your exhalation for not getting such types of deadly action stunts from the a thrilling journey of one and a half hour of course,reality
being a fan of keanu reeves and this has to be his best movie in yearsthe choreography was on point and the whole movie was full of nonstop packed action the whole cast added so much passion to the film and it was simply amazingthe final gift from the wife as amazing and sad but heartwarmingi simply loved it and have been raving about it since i left the movie theateri will add this movie to my bluray collectioni look forward to his next film,reality

first off i made an imdb account just to review this movie because i loved it so much and wanted to spread the word this is really one of the best action movies in quite sometime you must realize this movie isnt meant to be realistic and is meant solely for entertainment incorporates everything you could possibly want in an action flick with a great soundtrack great filming techniques and just outstanding action i really think this is keanu reeves greatest movie all the plot holes others are talking about arent plot holes at all they are just part of an amazing action flick that is meant to take people to a different reality which has is why people go to the movies in the first place i could not stop thinking about this movie for days after i saw it sorry for not being the greatest reviewer and writer but you will not be disappointed if you go see this movie this is a pure fiction movie so go in with an open mind and with no intentions of finding every little thing that may not make sense in the real world,reality
keanu gotta love him but the movie is very poor good effects editing fighting etc but the story and overall premise to the movie is just so poor predicted everything that happened in the movie the story has been told a million times and the outcome is the exact samethe only good thing about this movie is the small role that william dafoe plays nice to see youre getting back in the game keanu keep up with the martial arts stuff but please the plot is important too so disappointed especially considering the rating sigh,reality
keanu reeves is backwhat an unexpected surprise i saw this film expecting your average action flick lots of shooting lots of stunts the works which delivers on what i didnt expect was the beautiful way in which this film was made every shot from the first to the last is beautifully color graded and designed the performances were outstanding from keanu reeves playing the humbled hero to alfie allen being very theonish game of thronesyes the movie is a little bit cheesy with its rambo first blood incentives but its a lot of fun a treat on the eyes and has in depth qualities both with story and cinematography that are rare in action movies these daysif you like a good action movie with a little bit more is for you,reality
the one has been stylishly resurrected from depth of obscurity its a crucial requirement for hit men to have a mediocre first name and quirky last name as seen with bond or bourne by this standard has secured himself in pantheon of action heroes his tale follows the known formula of one assassin returning to his old life but what makes stands out is how vibrant and exciting the movie portrays him from the nuance visual and audio everything looks like enhanced virtual reality or a very polished video gamekeanu reeves despite having impressive resume might not be the most dynamic actor he doesnt transform himself in every role like say tom cruise however with good direction and material both are present in this movie he will perform amazingly this is one of reeves best roles aside from his in matrix and speed he brings the air of confidence along with hidden yet excessive violence reeves display a good emotion as the character and he also moves with certainty like a hitman would there is expert use of close quarter combat technique with multitude of fire arms and knowledge of martial arts for the foundation of the character although it is heavily brimmed with action elements is also equipped with a bit of emotional baggage from ancient time the loss of loved one is an acceptable motive for incoming rampagethe movie is exhibited with flair its use of color is simply impressive every set piece is done with meticulous vivid visual the camera angle makes it as though the world of is seen in different light almost in the setting of enhanced modern noir each action is choreographed meticulously and its a paramount aspect to make him believable as a lethal force one of the best things about the action is how the fast pace can be captured with precision oftentimes movie employs shaky camera or highly uncoordinated editing this movie manages to display action with clear focus and crisp movements even at more crowded setting it never relents or overload the viewer with too much visual informationsoundtracks help a lot with solemn tone and faster techno rhythm its probably one of the best soundtracks of this year rivaling hans zimmermans from the amazing spiderman 2 there are not many action movies with this high of production value it certainly packs enough fiery punch to leave a scorch mark for sequel i wont be surprised if theres even a video game of it with no bond hunt or bourne in sight this may be the time for john ,reality
this movie stars keanu reeves and was directed by 2 stunt men decadeslong collaborators of keanu who worked his action scenes in speed point break and the matrix trilogy this alone is a good indication of the violence in this movie set almost entirely at night in an otherworldly new york city an asphalt jungle exclusively inhabited by violent criminals whose coexistence derives from a delicate balance of honor code and savage ruthlessness is a sleek homage to sergio leones old west in a world of lawlessness and violence breaking the code is the only transgressionwith his trademark blank stare and sparse words keanu reeves steps into a persona straight out of a sergio leone western an unstoppable force of nature roused out of nowhere whose sole purpose is comeuppance is a retired legendary hitman in quiet agony over the recent passing of his beloved wife his only recourse is daisy an adorable puppy left by his wife to give his solitary existence some purpose a charged encounter with iosef a braggart russian mafioso eyeing 1969 mustang love the nod to mcqueen results in a home invasion that ends with badly beaten mustang gone and daisy dead anytime a baddie kills a in a movie you know a world of pain beckons this is where the fun starts iosef had no idea of john murderous past and his disrespectful excursion into john quiet world in a time of mourning has his father viggo clearly worried in one scene viggo scolds iosef he once killed 3 men with a pencil and completed the most impossible missions but gave it all up for the woman he loved thus effectively mythologizing john badassery for the viewer even before he threw his first punch from here checks in at the continental an exclusive hotel for assassins and criminals peace is preserved only by a strict code that prohibits doing business in its premises half friends and halfenemies welcome him back but he says hes just visiting once the action gets going only the body count is left unsettled as dispatches of everyone with his john wooish gunfu leaving a bloodbath in his wake jack traven thomas anderson keanu reeves is awesome again,reality
my wife and i saw both the equalizer and back to back in fact we watched the equalizer two nights in a row if you like action movies though see firstthe martial arts in are much better choreographed and john is not the teflon man in the equalizer he shows his vulnerability by getting in trouble and pays dearly for ithowever there is a considerable amount of humour included with the violence in and enough new ideas such as the use of gold coins to keep the movie fresh throughoutthis is a good deal excellent action fun no shakycam and acting even though keanu is still deadpan this movie is a keeper,reality
when was the last time you saw a good old fashioned action film im talking about the type of ballsout carnage that existed much before the likes of michael bays dependency on fauxpas image generation packed with style energy and blistering momentum is not just a frame by frame restoration of oldschool mayhem its unrelenting audacity kicks the growing trend for watered down action in the groin if it is action you want action you get  no holds barred and thoroughly gratifyinghelming the film is david leitich as producer and chad stahelski as first time director both expert fight chorographers and stunt doubles from over two decades of action thrillers the latter was also responsible for those genre defining action scenes in the matrix trilogy besides standing in as keanu reeves stunt double in other films speaking of which reeves hasnt been in anything memorable since the aforementioned trilogy but returns to form as the titular mob assassin whose very mention irks jittery nerves from new york city cops to the russian mafia and everyone in between mourning the untimely loss of his wife is brought out of retirement after crossing paths with his former mob employers not only do they steal his 1969 mustang they also kill his adorable puppy  a posthumous gift from his wife to ease her passing now what do they say about taunting a man with a short fuse and nothing to lose with an arsenal of firearms at his disposal unleashes a bullet barrage and wont stop until mob boss viggo tarasov michael nyqvist and his overindulged son iosef alfie allen join the ascending body countalthough lacking a meaty story derek kolstads script might seem like yet another revenge film that glorifies characters with a particular set of skills needless to say characters with this skillset are on the rise and just recently we saw denzel washington open a can of whoopass in the equalizer where differs is in its unapologetic approach as a violent revenge film with no room for dramatic twists and turns this is also what makes the film fun to watch because all you have to do is take in the thickening layers of brutality following each wave of fluidly filmed fight sceneswith intense shootouts a hefty dollop of which are gritty head shots and close quarter brute force the action rarely slows if it does its during moments of straightfaced humour and kolstads strategic placement of supporting characters willem dafoe and adrianne palicki play fellow assassins one aids while the other is contracted to kill him in the neutral zone is ian mcshane who plays the owner of an upscale hotel that serves as a safe house for all assassins its a clever touch that says a little more about their profession and the unwritten code of ethics that goes with it as an only perceivable downside there isnt much emotion from anyone except daisy the illfated then again its a snug fit for reeves and the payoff is watching him live up to reputation of a stone cold killing machine one scene even has viggo reciting a verse that fables as the bogyman himself im thinking more along the lines of keyser sze in the flesh ed indeed,reality
i happen to watch in the imax and i loved it being a part of the movie at first seems to be an outdated action movie but then while watching it it seems to be a never seen before action thriller without going much into the story line i would like to emphasize on the movies fresh lookevery rule that was used or created for a gangster or retired gangster movie especially carlitos way has been renewed in this movie the story line is simple on the paper but when it comes to writing screenplay for this movie every old run must be broken and be redefined and then the execution must have a lot of improvisationsbe it the entry of the protagonist relationship with his murdered wife and the the ending everything is shown less than what we have already seen enough in previous films the main focus has been put on the action part and everything else is shown as implicit part of actionthe cause of the revenge is totally funny at times but has a fresh and serious look on the other sidewithout keanu the movie would not even be justified his screen presence makes the movie more than watchable the screenplay and direction are brilliant the music is loud at times but suits the theme of the moviei would give 9 out of 10,reality
this movie is worth seeing the action is excellent and on going it has humour elements like the first boondock saints which i would say is the closest relatable movie to this one keanu played keanu no real dialogue short choreographed fight scenes and lots of close ups i can get over keanu because the pure foolishness of the entire movie is what the expendables should have been a collection of great actors and keanu in a fun happy shootem up movieit was refreshing that people with guns decided to use guns no silly fighting smacking each other with guns if there was a chance to shoot someone it pretty much happenedgo see this movie enjoy it forgive the casting director,reality
i was initially really worried about going to see this movie the trailer looked like the type of movie i would immediately be turned off of despite loving action movies all i can say now is wow i had fun in this movie like edge of my seat shooting at the screen with my fingers fun if the hearting thumping adrenaline pumping electronicametal soundtrack doesnt get you in the mood for mayhem then you can just delight in the now 50 yr old keanu reeves ascending to the highest level of action star seriously the movie is just him running around 2 hours shooting people in the face now a lot of people will be turned off by the sound of that but thats basically all a revenge movie is the plot synopsis is literally just russians mess with a retired hitman and he has to kill them all dont hate it indulge in the gratuitous action eat popcorn to your hearts content or until it leads to heart disease i aint afraid of no john imilar to the equalizer a few weeks back john strength as an action movie is that it excels in all things visual and technical this movie is sleek sexy and downright fun the visuals are perfect for a high energy high octane shootemup and are complemented by a score that gets you pumped up for violence on screen reeves is supported by tremendous actors like michael nyqvist willem dafoe ian mcshane and lance reddick even the mayhem guy makes an appearance they all embrace that the fact that its just an action movie and the strength of the film is that it doesnt try and pander to the audience with some god awful message about morality or overcomplicate the storyvisually i thought there were some pretty fun elements like the way the russian subtitles were presented and that all the stunts and special effects are meticulously crafted and choreographed it looks and feels like a movie should where everyone knows the main character is a force to be reckoned with seriously just head shots everything expect lots of violence and expect to be entertained thats all you can truly hope for in a good action flick and yet adds that little extra bit of humor and style that set the standard for the genre in years to come read this and other reviews on the driveinzeppelin website,reality
yesterday i saw the first matine showing of like i anticipated judging by reviews it was well worth my time however what i didnt anticipate was how ordinary the story was weve seen this type of story many times where the hero has an excuse to kill a lot of peoplewhat separates from other films of this type is its style i dont remember seeing people get shot in the head and then blood splatter in such a way many times this happened and its very effective but more than anything its keanu reeves focus that makes this movie specialmany times ill watch a film and look to see the actor acting or just going through the motions for a paycheck the last indiana jones adventure comes to mind but throughout every frame of keanu reeves is 100 focused on the character in the fight scenes many of them i never saw a stunt man that was keanu potent violent and effectivefor me the movie could have used a little more exposition ie a little more bridget moynahan and a little more of his bonding with the there probably was in the original cut but im sure some hotshot exec said cut all that stuff out they just wanna see keanu kick ass but dont get me wrong this film is a must see for stylized action sequences and particularly keanu reeves performance the latter is really something to see,reality
this film has to be one of the most manipulative films to date while gangsters did kill his puppy and take his car it gives him no right to go after and kill them he thinks revenge is justice and besides he kills people for money how are we supposed to care for this disgusting person the whole film is him getting revenge its boring and uninspired the fight choreography here is decent predictable and repetitive at times but it works it certainly doesnt scream best assassin in the world but its better than most modern action films the cinematography is slick and cheap but does give the world an ominous and gloomy atmosphere the music is as expected generic club music probably produced by some amateur artists its technically competent but its still an awful film regardless110,reality

keanu reeves existence was almost an apparition or ilk in his acting career since the phenomenal matrix series despite delivering some authentic roles in remarkable blockbusters the guy neo as we know disappeared along with the matrix a decade ago possibly into the depths of a matrix itself his chief contribution from the asylum was frequent mediocre roles that didnt do justice to his potentials and a load of tedious secondrate movies that we didnt see come and go and yes except one or two keanu is a good actor a typecast action hero he could have done a lot better choose some notable characters or somebody could have saved this poor chap by giving him a role that he truly deserved and finally it took director duos david leitch and chad stahelski to become the saviors keanu is saved or in more apt words keanu is back this is his best movie released since a long time ignore the aforesaid statements considering his movies of the past decade the sad keanu meme was totally legitimateis a edly entertaining 100 minutes of exhilarating marathon killing spree show that will make your butt go flabbergasted with comparatively less elaborated plot and forthright twists it doesnt have an impressive story arc to brag about but a straightforward account of a retired hitman seeking vengeance for the killing of his beloved and boy does he seek that out with style and elegance it also features an awesome soundtrackthe quirk about the movie is its action and in its execution and the fight sequences are likely to be one of the alltime best in films keanu reeves literally invokes the phantom of some dead martial art legend to make your limbs uncomfortable doing nothing he is said to have undergone four months of learning judo and some nutcracker techniques developing special closequarter combat style and ed skills and does it reflect throughout the movie is mostly about the remarkable style of action its approach toward the assassins and their cult offers some rather exciting insights into how do they pull off the jobs and how things work in their terms and conditions im not a big fan of action movies the one reason i discount most of those movies is due to their unconvincing and improbable outlook of a superhuman hero to whom logic and physics doesnt apply on the other hand boasts not about the impossible and implausible abilities a man on vengeance is capable of fostering the character is portrayed as a highly skilled assassin someone who was in the business for a long enough time to master his moves there is no fancy action movie clich like bullet repelling body instant recovery flying off of buildings or the insane jumps the crispy combat style and background music pumps some impressive energy into the action is one of the best action flicks i had seen there isnt a solid story or a clash of brains but if you are fan of action movies or looking to watch something for fun and get pumped up then there isnt a better entertaining action flick released in the recent years than john ,reality
finally a krs movie worth watching a nice flat pop corn movie zero brain needed sheer subculture even the easy recalls to mythology are uber sheer subculture lots of funthe action is great and i will summarize the quality of some actions by saying a movie where guns dont shoot 2000 rounds before the clip is empty the weapons guy did a great job indeed and geeks like me normally count the shots of a berettaand of course the apparently unique motive of the dead is a bit silly to start spreading dead people around the city that is the trick used since lethal weapon the scene where he cries alone and looks like hes going to take is own life to give some humanity to the character to start a war for nothing is dumb to start it over a dead is even worse lets say this guy had some anger management issues within himself and they gave him a reason to vent it outi have read some of the reviews and i am sorry some people had expectations and are now disappointed i had no expectations at all before watching the movie the scary part was the thought of kr acting yet his expressionless face is absolutely perfect for the part 100the rest of the cast starting with nyqvist is absolutely greati havent seen retarded movies like this in a while the only one that can compare is hitmanwhy dont i give a 10 because he stole a you dont destroy an army of russky mobsters and then do that next time what steal candy bars in a 711 that is the only weak spot in the whole movieso get xxl pop corns a huge soda and enjoy ,reality
is about an exhitman who is retried but after saying no to some gangsters selling his car to them the gangsters take everything from johnhis car and his he got from his dead wife but the gangster were from his past so now hes out for revenge first off was one of the best action movie ive seen in a long time every action scene was shot so amazing the action was top notch also keanu reeves does an amazing job playing this role they keeping teasing throughout the movieif hes back and yes keanu reeves is back another thing i loved about was that the bad guys werent being played by some random actors they were being played by good actors like willem defoe and michael nyqvist adrianne palicki and alfie allen did a great job also overall was an amazing action movie with great a story and better action a must watch for action fans and fans of keanu reeves,reality
this action adventure presents a simple straightforward violence and revenge movie that does not offer any refreshing idea but some creatively designed small elements in the gangsterism world and its political cultures however might surprise the audiences is definitely portraying keanu reeves rather than the other way round who used to be expressionless or impassive cool and less talking and perhaps his personality and life experience might be the two important factors that make him suits perfectly in this character full with sorrow miserable and anger more than three quarters of the film are filled with stylish scores adrenalinrush and thrilling action art sequences captured in great angles and cinematography but the emotional builtup and the relationship with the cute puppy in the beginning seems to be too short pushing the film towards a slight monotonous ending,reality

i expected from the imdb score to at least be in for a fun viewing a bit of hardcore action keanu pulling off some tongueincheek deadpan or at the very least some mindless fun neither was to be found though it was plenty rich in clichs so tired they were almost comatosethe gunplay and stunts were at times decent but i couldnt help feeling that the movie should have picked a clearer path either downplay the violence and highlight the lossretribution or go all in and make it nice and grisly like the much overlooked the raid which by the way managed to combine bothplus michael nyqkvist is pouring himself gleefully into the mold of peter stormare and all other heavily typecasted villains who cant learn convincing accents pathetic,reality

leitch and stahelski make a wonderful team directing and producing what is overall a passably fun action film the two have done stunts in many many films and their understanding of good action choreography really comes to light in the numerous fights are fast frenetic and creative reeves is certainly at the best hes been in a while but dont expect to be blown away the catatonic nature that has held him since the mid 00s seems to be fading away just reference this and 47 ronin 2013 and the fantastic reeves directed man of tai chi 2013the rest of the cast seems to be having fun especially dafoe who cameos as an aging hitman nyqvist is the other standout in the bunch delightfully adding dark comedy to his bits rambling about the dangerous there is no doubt that this is reeves show but everyone else doesnt seem to be just phoning it in the set design and the cinematography are absolutely fantastic action scenes are held in intricately detailed environments most notably a neonwashed nightclub scene that will really dazzle your eyes the color palates are suitably washed with sudden bursts of color such as in the aforementioned night club where everything productionwise comes together correctly the writing seems to be what holds this down from being an action classic it is at times witty and engaging yes but its mainly a mishmash of tired clichs to string you along its gorgeous set pieces the revenge story is one of the oldest in cinema hybridizing it with the you killed my now youll pay trope was clever but ultimately not enough to stand out in the end is a fun flick worth watching with a group of friends dont expect much cerebrally but be sure to keep a sharp eye for the rich detail put into every frame of this well crafted action film,reality
the career of keanu reeves seemed to have taken a nosedive after the success of the matrix films we would be hard put to name even one film after that last year he directed a martial arts film called man of tai chi where he played antagonist to a less than charismatic leading man that did not fly too high except perhaps for some hardcore action fans for this year though the buzz for this film was simply too high to ignore the plot is ripped off the plots of many other oldfashioned action films especially those from the 1980s is a retired hit man he is still very depressed about his wifes death one day a group of thugs break into johns house and destroy his wifes one most precious gift to him john finds out the perpetrator iosef is the crazy spoiled son of his old boss viggo john then goes on a deadly revenge rampage until no one is left aliveyes there is not much about that script to be excited about however for their first directorial effort david leitch and chad stahelski the stunt coordinators for keanu reeves in matrix make a spectacular debut their action sequences were fastclipped very exciting and relentlessly brutal be it gunplay knifeplay or martial arts keanu reeves made a perfect action heroa lot of this films success also comes because of reeves excellence in dramatic acting okay so there only few of those moments we will remember fondly his devotion to his wife which reeves was able to project very well without words he was sincerely in those touching scenes,reality
if youve seen shoot em up youll know exactly what this movie should have been that was a relentless riproaring and most importantly humorous jaunt from beginning to end mr smith was an accidental hero pitted against impossible odds and he out gunned them with a lot of bullets flair and sometimes even with just a carrot that was mr smith mr is an exgangster with a chip on his shoulder hes a man who kills people not with carrots but with a pencil he is no hero hes just the boogeyman out for revenge and he doesnt care who gets hurt mr smith saved a baby and bought down an evil congressman and a ed corporation mr kills 150 people without remorse because a punk killed his he doesnt rescue anyone except himself and ironically although its doubtful the film makers realized it after having spent the whole movie avenging the loss of his he steals somebody elses this was doubtless a directors attempt to assign some meaning to the end of what was really a pointless storysorry keanu going to have to give this one the thumbs down a story really does matter,reality

if ever there is a real movement to curb the excess of violence in films this should be the standard to show as an examplethere is enough shooting and other forms of violence all over the place including dance halls the church on the street you name itthe story in itself gets lost with all the violence that takes place everyone is screaming and running around while the guns are absolutely blazingwhen a killers wife dies keanu reeves the grief stricken widower is soon robbed of his car and his beloved put to death by the son of a fellow gangster as a result all hell breaks loose and nothing is sparedthis is nothing more than an overly violent film showing what killers do each other when the other is affected,reality
in the wake of matrix reaves is still the one bad ass feared by all falls in love and retires just to come back to action to avenge the death of a  this may be the only creative idea in the whole movie the rest is just brainless shooting our all powerful hero doesnt have any specific strategy for his revenge just shooting a lot with a range of different weapons the cast is full with known faces but given the script did not cost much in terms of imagination we could have had at least one fatlipped bigboobed barelyclothed character to make things a bit more fun and the end well not that surprising given the fact that put all the killing in motion my advice avoid this at all cost if you miss reaves kicking ass go see matrix i again,reality

saw it only after checking the imdbscore and that i regret one of the worst movies ive seen for a long time i didnt really expect much from keanu reeves to familiar with his minimalistic vocabulary but after the matrix you really hope for another sudden flash of geniality dont you this wasnt one of themstoryline sucks straight forward from initial offense until final revenge could have ended several times before that but that would have made the movie 25 minutes instead of 100 which perhaps wouldnt be that bad some details are also completely lacking all sense of logic which is terribly annoying but convenient for mr action without any variation what so ever running and shooting at everyone with a red or cerise shirt under his jacket being lucky that even when theres 20 opponents all of them wait for one another to try his luck killing mr that makes it one clean kill after the other some exploding cars a small fire but otherwise just gunshots from close distance hundreds of themfor the first 20 minutes i nearly thought it could be a decent action movie a heartbroken man that doesnt seem so heartbroken more chronically depressed he stays in that mode the rest of the film and theres actually nothing cool about mr no style or surprising skills just walking around shooting at everything hardly speakingmusic terrible and annoying rap metal or whatever that doesnt fit at all end unbelievably uncool and unrealistic the ending climaxrevenge is also totally without excitement or goalfeeling just passes bypunchline dont waste your time on this movie see something else even grab a movie you just saw that you liked my girlfriend was actually getting rather depressed and annoyed after half the movie and stayed in that mode for the rest of it apart from a few laughs out of frustration from how unrealistic or uncool some scenes actually where she didnt even mention how it ended but immediately left the sofa and started brushing her teeth in anger now three days later shes forgiven me for dragging the movie into our home as i promised her it would leave us with the trash bag and that she could choose the next 10 movies well see together thats pretty much all you need to know,reality
i was hoping for a brilliant revenge movie with memorable scenes and wonderful well rounded characters instead i got the short end of the this movie was a perfect waste of precious time the plot went nowhere and the logic was totally missing i heard that the producers of the matrix were involved and hoped that the same darkness and depth would smolder in this movie but it just went on and on as if the viewer knew more than it revealed the writers seemed to be in a video game state of mind as they went through the sequences i waited to see the hook or revelation in the middle of this where nothing was done by mistake instead it seems everything was random and coincidental which makes no sense the bad guys just happen to encounter a well know retired assassin i wish they would have a do over and have some depth and storyline added to this visual flop i had rented a b movie as the opening act of my date night with my lovely wife and had this movie as the main feature presentation the roles should have been reversed this was an excuse to waste time and bullets,reality
if you like from bruce lee movies to kill bill taken die hard or whatever has to do with freaking action this is for you no crazy screenplay it is at least childish but in a comic book way that is always welcome no crazy cinematography kinda like animation from time to time which ive really liked no deep meaning and stuff but action all the way revenge that leads to bullets blood bodies and cult dialogs that you want to listen to all the actors are doing their job and keanu reeves is back on his neo form better than the most ive seen in its genre especially the last few years youre gonna enjoy this one,reality

when you see youre thinking this is another revenge film and this can only end in one way so whatever way youre thinking its going to end thats the way its going to end is about a man a retired hitman who lost his wife before having a puppy in his possession because it is the last gift she gives him but when everything is taken away from him hes out for blood and yeah its personal it was good to see keanu reeves back and actually making you believe his character was a hitman once in his life it wasnt much speaking it was all about the fight scenes it became nonstop and didnt slow down its definitely a step up from 47 ronin in a way this film will remind you of the equalizer but the equalizer was a lot better it was still a good film for reeves and hopefully well see him again like this if you need a film for this weekend something to have you on the edge of your seat and just enjoying an adrenaline rush go see john ,reality

httpmarksmoviemindblogspotcomjohnreviewhtml this movie delivers everything the preview claims it will deliver and once again keanu reeves has picked the perfect movie for his acting abilities the dialogue is limited and there are some good oneliners throughout but most of it is action the only criticism i can make that i noted in my preview is that some of the gun fights are a little unrealistic has been out of the scene for 5 years now and makes some comments throughout the movie that he is rusty when he shows up at places with some battle wounds yet when it comes to the gun fights his aim is dead on perfect while his opponents couldnt hit water if they fell off the titanic in the middle of the oceanwhen viggo is telling his son about he tells the story of a russian folklore character called the boogeyman his son laughs at the idea of being that man and viggo tells him that is worse hes the one you send in to kill the boogeyman there are two important lessons about being first as i mentioned before referring to the posters for the movie dont set him off and these unapologetic punks do just that the second lesson is dont burn your bridges in sprite of what was and what he did he made some powerful allies and lived by a certain code that helped him many times throughout the movie its this code that is more powerful than money that kept alive and helped him to exact his revengei predicted 35 stars and im going to keep that rating the preview perfectly sets you up for precisely what the movie is like liam neeson in taken or sylvester stallone in get carter reeves is the perfect actor to portray and is believable and enjoyable in the role it is extremely violent and graphic but it is also fun and humorous at times my friend nick feels this is one that should definitely be purchased for a home collection im not sure id go that far but i do think it was worth the price of admission in the theatre and one i would readily watch again when it is available for rent so what movie will be on my mind next we shall see,reality
the start of this movie was a promising one stylish shots and images nice art direction fine storytelling to providing a decent background for the main character while at the same time introducing some cool players and great actors like willem dafoe and michael nyqvist in just a few images we feel for and we really want to know how hes going to live the rest of his live and then the shooting begins and continues and continues and continues until every logic or possibility to feel any empathy at all has vanished completely the movie has turned itself into a brainless shooting game with no story whatsoever no plausible motives not one character that we can relate to and hardly any reason for the cinema loving public to want to make it till the end of the story,reality
honestly i saw the movie as cliched as any plot was overused and predictable but then again its an action movie action sequence was okay some good stunts and choreography it felt real in some scenes for me this kind of movies dont stick theres almost no original scenes in the entire movie not a single unique whatever that would make anyone remember it say a year or two from now characters were not as solid as they were needed to be and of course they didnt need to be solid at all it didnt strike me as a noir movie as it didnt have the right equation of one overall its a nobrainer fun for a night with the boys i guess oh and yes keanu reeves doesnt age,reality
after stubbornly waiting for almost one hour to get any small indication that this nonsense would change into something that would justify the rating it enjoys i gave up in frustration that it spoiled an evening like nothing else i dont know if its worth saying anything at all or if anything could be really said that the plot is of an immense stupidity  or that this john does not succeed to transmit any vibe that you feel no emotion at all  that the shooting and fighting scenes are the worst of their kind  the scene where he fights with a female killer is like between two high school kids in the bedroom  what could be said when the son of the mafia boss and his entire crew dont have a clue of this who happened to work for them until a couple of years ago  there could be a ton of negative comments written about this movie but already the time lost with viewing a good part of it produced a lot of frustration i hope you who read this review would be spared of such and look somewhere else,reality
generally im very cautious about watching action movies because of their predictability and the youknowtheendbeforeitevenended syndrome and for sure didnt deceive in that aspect this is one of the reasons why i would generally pick films that would be the least predictable as possible since anyways this is inevitablewhile to me the overall story actually made some sense even though you could actually tell what the ending would look like halfway through the general feeling that you get at the end when youve watched everything and been left to your own self and where mr is as invincible as it gets killing people without ever getting touched  i mean certain scenes really do not make no sense whatsoever especially the one with the car where there are like 10 dudes shooting with automatic weapons and mr would be gliding around gracefully without taking a single bullet i mean this was really pushed way too far in terms of trying to have the spectator believe in this guys supernatural abilities as a simple human being or whatever they were trying to dothis movie reminded me a lot of walker texas ranger which was also a complete joke of a seriesi know this is a movie and that it doesnt necessarily need to represent reality but this invincibility thing knowing that wasnt initially introduced as some sort of superhuman really doesnt make any sense theres a huge gap between mr being a simple human and invincibility that the movie crossed which is hardly justifiable from a rational standpoint,reality
ok so its a revenge movie and who hasnt seen one of thosebut i am almost tempted to rewatch this movie and count just how many people are killed by the main protagonist keanu reeves surely there comes a point when there is so much killing you realise the makers of the film had no other ideaswhich backs my summary headline when it comes to easing down on the violence america seems to have run out of ideasso why three stars1 even when keanu reeves is basically playing keanu reeves hes still worth a vote that said this film is way beneath him2 a good soundtrack3 slick cinematographyfor its genre its ok and if youre watching for the action youll be pleased but 30 less dead bodies and a little more story would have made this something special,reality
revenge action films are some of the easiest and most enthralling subgenres in the action genre you have a character that loses something important whether it be a loved one or something else and they go on a rampage against those people that took everything its a simple yet very sympathetic plot line that when done right they can deliver on the action is a shining example of less is more where the plot is simple but the execution is done so well it overcomes those shortcomingsgood the main draw is keanu reeves who really does deliver a great performance as the titular character reeves is a silent force of nature who really brings a lot of sympathy during his period of loss and when he lets loose on the bad guys it is glorious the movie is directed by a couple of well known stuntmen and it shows with some great choreography in the fight scenes and smooth camerawork with no shaky camera which is refreshing to seebad the ending is very anticlimactic which hurt the movie a bit considering the energy on display beforehandoverall it is just a welldone revenge action film done and simple and it is a lot of fun,reality
when i had first heard of i didnt think much of it just thought it was another forgettable movie that will join the bargain bin in a few months but after viewing the trailer and hearing some of the reviews i thought i should check it out and see whether the reviews and hype was genuine i will say as a fan of action films this provided some solid adrenaline and nonstop action now in order to have such glorious and justifiable violence in a film the main character needs to have motivation and something really bad happen to them what would make a man more angry than having his prized car stolen and a given to him by his dead wife killed by ruthless gangsters enter and let the hell fire begin as he mows them down in a glorious rain of bullets and explosions if theres an action film this year you can mention in the same breath as the raid 2 it is sorry expendables 3 it is definitely one of the more stylish fun and original action movies ive seen in a while and reminded me of such classics as equilibrium or the hyperviolent hong kong films like hard boiled or the killer asides from the action it has a solid supporting cast and i know keanu may not be the best actor but he has certainly improved from the old days and does a great job in this movie willem dafoe is great as always and adrianne palicki also does great in her role the directors did a great job staging and shooting the scenes and providing a solid environment for it to take place in overall a solid and fun action packed film that will surely satisfy your blood lust for some hard r action this is definitely one of the best of 2014 up there with the equalizer and the raid 2 this movie rightfully so will stand as an action classic of this time 810,reality
in his first bona fide hit for quite some time keanu reeves is an assassin on a warpath after russian crims kill his puppy and steal his car if that sounds a touch silly thats because it is but this movie wholeheartedly embraces its bonkers premise and revels in presenting a genre film with tongue firmly in cheek screenwriter derek kolstad builds a semifantastical world where hit men and hitwomen of course have their own underworld currency a special hotel sanctuary with doctors on site and a nightclub where hired killers can unwind and obviously a guild who ensures the assassin moral code is upheld this endearing self awareness ensures is amusingly engaging between the numerous action sequences which are surprisingly of an extremely high calibre a blend of the economic gunfu from equilibrium and the close quarters krav maga made popular in the bourne trilogy the expertly choreographed fight scenes tacked on finale excluded are frenetic exhilarating and joyously violent reeves is clearly having a blast playing the revenge driven yet coolasacucumber protagonist whilst the rest of the cast  including willem dafoe adrianne palicki michael nyqvist and alfie theon greyjoy from got allen  do what they can with shared screen time palickis arrogant hired gun shining brightest a bgrade flick wrapped in agrade style is exceptionally enjoyable,reality

if you walk into this movie expecting to see the next oscar winner for best picture you will be sadly disappointed is a great movie but it was geared towards providing entertainment value and not too heavy on trying to garner academy votes simply put this is the greatest action film of the year that is a lot to say when you had snowpiercer captain america the winter soldier edge of tomorrow and the raid 2berandal all hitting the big screen before what makes this film rather unique is not the storyline there isnt much substance to the plot kills well over 100 plus different people in this movie that is not a spoiler by any means but nobody expected keanu reeves to be cast as a retired assassin who must fuel his yearnings for vengeance with a fresh body count the only other actor that could of played the title part for this movie is chow yunfat i viewed this movie in imax and you can most certainly tell the film was not formatted for imax viewing in any way shape or form yet it just felt good to see conduct his own symphony of death on a bigger screen the bottom line is that if you like john woo actionstyle movies and enjoy a pretty high body count this is the movie for you if you are looking for a movie to take a first date out on or treat the kids to this weekend you may want to reconsider sorry for not being very descriptive i believe its best to let you watch the relaunch of keanu reeves film career with this deadly masterpiece on your own accord you wont be disappointed,reality
i stated more than once over here that though i dont like comparing movies sometimes a comparison is unavoidable this is doubly so for first is the almost automatic comparison with the equalizer another retired professional killer forced out of retirement into an all out collision with the russian mob boy are they once again the popular bad guys in town well despite some obvious casting advantages the earlier release has over mainly as far as the leading role is concerned the final result is working in favor of its plot is much more believable than the equalizers its fight scenes are way more real look less like a choreographed ballet and more like a fight to the death in which both sides are drawing bloodthe second comparison i feel that i must make goes a bit further back all the way to eastwoods masterpiece unforgiven another man with a bad past coming back to avenge a seemingly minor crime this time not hired but much more driven and there a few other similar plot twists which i cant discuss without adding a spoiler once again we have a film debating the nature of evil and when is evil not really evil and doesnt do too badly in this comparison as well i must refer to keanu reeves shortcomings as an actor his range is well known as limited but he usually has a flare for choosing the right roles for his abilities he does exceptionally well here despite some early wooden moments at the very beginning of the film the rest of the cast is superlative apart from michael nyqvist whos delivery in english leaves a lot to be desired yes the language should sound foreign in his mouth but the emotions should still be there and they often felt forced too me the rest is very well done the pace the cinematography all were right on the spot for the film a proof that action flicks can be thoughtful and emotionally true,reality
in writer derek kolstad and director chad stahelski have finally found a use for keanu reeves placeholder this is a relatively watchable actionrevenge picture with a title character that could have as easily been portrayed by a cereal box as an actor the good news is reeves makes a great cereal box he doesnt have to speak and barely has to act the mood and style of the picture are well accomplished and the plot is straight linear widower retired hit man is out for revenge on the russian mob punk who stole his car and killed his since reeves is at his best when he is not speaking there is plenty of time for him to slaughter a boatload of russian mobsters in pursuit of said revenge and the actions scenes are well executed pun intendedthe film is enhanced by some well placed characters well crafted by fine actors ian mchshane willem dafoe john leguizamo and dean winters all turn in well drawn interesting and amusing characters whenever there is a break in the action bridget moynihan plays flashback wife in a kind of gratuitous cameo not much to do for her though what little she has to work with is done wellthere is already talk of becoming a franchisethe producers might do well to take a cue from the bond films and rotate the role of the title character there are plenty of actors out there who can actually actin the meantime this debut is damn good fun,reality

i think porn movies have more logically structured plot than this and better acting keanu reeves is playing keanu reeves the other guys seem to be either slacking on the scene or a zombielike walking around waste materialthe only thing that seems nice is the scenery composition and camera work but you get so bored after the first halfhour that the only thing that keeps you going is the thought could it get any dumber and it does  the cheesy ending definitely puts a comma until next sequel good thing we were watching this at a friends house otherwise there would be ptsd symptoms of money well wasted i think movies like this with high imdb rating encourage piracy,reality
ex hitman comes out of retirement and sets out for revenge on those who have taken all that he had left  a rather basic plot this doesnt stop from being a stylish action packed moviethe action scenes are top notch and are fitted together with an excellent soundtrack the character is an intimidating expert killer who throughout the film evokes emotion without compromising the seriousness and sharpness of his personalityif you are looking for an hour or so of pure entertainment then this is a film worth investing in it will make you want to rewatch it purely because it is a good time if however you are searching for a deep psychological masterpiece i suggest look elsewhere 810,reality
i am ashamed that i didnt see this in theaters because this is one of the best action movies of this decadeyou can really tell that this film was made by people that understand the action genre from 20 minutes in to the ending of the movie it is almost non stop action kianu reeves is incredible in this film i would even go as far to say its his best performance ever given when the film gets emotional reeves is absolutely believable and you feel the hurt his character is going throughone of the things this film did that made it great is how realistic it is actually runs out of bullets throughout the movie which is something you dont see a lot in action films they also build up the characters really well they make you absolutely hate the antagonists and make seem like an unstoppable machine which he ismy only complaints with the film is at times it does seem really clichd the hand to hand fight sequences were also lacking a little bit but other than that is definitely worth watching and i cant wait for the sequel,reality
even though hollywood gets badly ostracized by the masses including me there comes a time when every now and then it brings a surprisingly great film and clearly personifies that hollywood doesnt always turn in moneywasting films combines great solid action with awesome visuals subtle humour and provides something quite refreshing to the traditional action film when first seeing this film i did have my doubts about it because of the formulaic stereotypes it has in this genre but it didnt really bother me at all because i was enthralled by the visuals and then i looked at who the scriptwriter is and i sighed because it was written by derek koldstad whos been writing convoluted script for straight to dvd vehicles for dolph lundgren and finally i checked in to see who directed it was by chad stahelski a former stuntman who had some assistance from another stuntman davis leitch whatever it was they did it worked and i give my hats off to them for their efforts to bring something new to the table from the opening scenes the clichs come right to us without any denial keanu reeves stars as an exhitman trying to get away from it all like weve seen before his wife helen bridget moynahan who has helped him break free from his old ways is now dying of a lingering progressive disease in return she has left him an adorable little puppy so that he can remain the better man hes become but then evil remorseless gangsters steal his car and kills his puppy like it was all in a days work what was dumb about these gangsters is they refused to do background checks as to which assassin they are dealing with for the animal sensitive viewer the scene was not entirely graphic but it will make you hate the bad guys even more like whats expected of a film like this what makes matters worse is that the car is a 1969 mustang so therefore revenge is not optional here it must be done bar noneeven though hes been called down by the critics but keanu reeves stars here and here he has succeeded in shutting up all those who have condemned him in the past he was amazing here and may have exceeded his performances in the matrix series to me it feels like a new awakening for keanu at 51 and is now making those who maligned him to eat crow what could i say 50 is the new 40 and he never looked betterwhat really blew my mind about are the action scenes which are truly mesmerizing the way they executed on screen was original being that it was subtle and not as campy or cartoon like the choreography was spot on and the fight scenes looked and felt authentic and convincingly deadly the brutality and violence truly will get your heart pumping and itll hurt just thinking about itthe fight scenes offer up new elements and inventive in its delivery but the cinematography is something about which cant be neglected the colours of grey and brown offer a retro feeling reminiscent to the 1950s noir films with a modern twist to it set in new york city as a picturesque fantasy landscape your grandparents in the 1950s may have imagined what the big apple would look like today which even includes a ritzy hotel like the continental which is a facility for refuge a social club and a relaxing centre for those who commit felonies that better then what we expected for underworld crime bosses who hang out in dilapidated apartments where theyre gambling their fortunes with their beer mugs and ashtrays therefore a place like the continental looks like a better hangout spot for these guys it has a bit of a sin city thing going for it only more grounded and more real with a sequel coming out ill surely be the first at my ticket stand has truly resurrected the action genre its brutal violent and and no holds barred a gritty rrated film thats not afraid to deliver or offend it may have clichs but once you seen the movie youll forget all about the clichs,reality
2014  out of 4after the death of his beloved wife former hitman keanu reeves comes out of retirement when a russian mobsters son breaks into his home steals his car and kills his which was a gift from his deceased wife soon the mobster michael nyqvist puts a contract out on life knowing that hes coming for revengeisnt a film that is going to be studied in film schools and its certainly not going to be for those seeking high art or meaning in their movies no is a terrific throwback to the crazy martial art flicks from the 70s i couldnt help but watch this film and think of someone like sunny chiba in the street fighter series this film here is of course a lot more friendly to todays times as it contains nonstop bloody violence as it appears just loves head shotsthe film works so well for a couple of reasons with the first being that this character really fits reeves style by now we shouldnt expect too much for reeves often times he sleepwalks through his roles with that laid back approach of his but that quiet nature actually works extremely well for this character that certain coldness reeves brings to the film works tremendously well as you cant help but root for him and cheer each time one of the bad guys fall nyqvist is also very good in his role as the russian mobster and he too makes you believe his character willem dafoe is also fun in his supporting rolethe film manages to have some nice style and especially during the action sequences theres no question that this here is one of the most violent action pictures in recent years with the action scenes containing a great amount of attention to detail but theyre played out so well that it almost seems like youre watching a video game most of the gunshots and there are hundreds are in the bloody to extremely bloody range but the film is just so much fun that even those who dont normally like that type of stuff should be able to still have fun certainly isnt the work of orson welles but its not trying to be its goal was to be a bad ass action film and it succeeds at that,reality
now i saw this movie couple of months ago and finally decided to review it going in i thought this was going to be another average forgetful onetime film just like most modern movies are but boy was i wrong this movie restored my hope in action movies and broke the monotony that film industry has become for the last 3  4 years i havent watched a recent movie more than one time for the last three years at least i watched 3 times on the other hand which really says something the thing is that now days movies have become business they have become overabundant and unmemorable as soon as the movie is released hype dies away and the movie is forgotten but finally did something different that reminded of good old times of early 2000s this movie will be remembered like collateral and other modern classics the action is perfect not to mention the thing i loved the most is that the world created the underworldsyndicate of is just so intriguing and interesting makes you want more and it definitely made me want a sequel or a prequel keanu reeves did an amazing job depicting the character the background characters in this movie were also very well written in my opinion and i just love the fact about how revered is in the movie the soundtrack is also really good the movie itself may not be a masterpiece of the decade but it is a great action flick with a lot of work and thought put into it its a hope for the movie industry 910 because this really made me happy and filled me with hope i rather watch 20 minutes of than watch another typical marvel or a superhero brainwashing thank you for restoring my hope in movies,reality
keanu reeves reprises his role as a suave and chillingly cold human annihilator in this flick the movie has been directed by chad stahelski  a stunt coordinator and stuntman having contributed his talent and professional services in movies like the matrix  van helsing point break die hard 40  rambo a burma etc in view of the above it is abundantly clear and painfully obvious that features impressive action scenes well oiled stunts and fairly violent imagery as is the case with with most keanu reeves filcks the movie has a dark and an almost grimy feel to it the story however is fairly straightforward much unlike the matrix which i consider to be a huge relief since unintelligible plots are overrated  it is a revenge saga and employs some very typical elements to accommodate a lavish quantum of bullets and blood the soundtrack is impressive and adds zing to the pace of the movie  talking about pace the movie is not very slow but some sequences seem stretched  which is really surprising given the short run time of the movie barely 100 minutes but the action is well directed and hence we can overlook this blemishit is an entertaining action movie devoid of any psychological complexity or grey areas if you are a reeves fan do watch it for he has done a good job in this movie as well the tags i would would like to see in this movie are colddarksuavereevesof course,reality
id like to spend this review addressing the complaints people have put up1 gets knocked out by a bunch of thugs even though hes an unbelievable badasshe has been retired for 4 years in the same house preoccupied by his new after being waken up from sleep in the absolute dark whatever level of skill you have thats absolutely acceptable in fact it wouldve not made sense if he actually was able to stop them  then maybe those giving negative reviews wouldve pointed out how that was absurd he even admits after being questioned by the guy at the club saying he was rusty and throughout the film we see mentions of him getting back to form getting back to his previous life2 goes after them just for a ok aside from the fact that a lover can get pretty attached to a especially at the stage of the still being a helpless puppy and aside from the fact that the act of killing that puppy to shut him the up is pretty freaken disgusting aside from the fact that even addresses it in the film saying that this was the last gift from his late wife and it made him feel like he wasnt alone in the world aside from all that we are talking about a freaken crazy badass mafia hitmanassassin do you really think you can walk up to a guy like that kill his and expect him to just leave it alone do you see the context here i mean for gods sake 3 never misses a shot but when it comes to killing that son he misses 5 shots in a rowwould you give that a rest yeah its a stretch but the movie wouldve ended right there and honestly i think i was too busy with the awesome action incredible music and sleek style of everything things like that can easily be forgiven4 how has the kid of viggo not heard of when seemingly everybody has heard of did you see the kid he doesnt seem like the guy who likes to think too much of anything and given the way his father distanced himself from him along with the fact that the kid looks pretty young so 4 years before he wouldve not been completely aware of the exact business going on with his father as well as how there is a whole world of people in this it seems fair5 bad acting the only scene i really noticed the acting dropped was at the very end with the admittedly cheesy no more bullets is that the only thing youre referring to if so then bloody hell theres a whole 90 minutes to the film most of which was action so why are you even mentioning the acting as if this was some romantic drama where the acting is the main aspect of the film6 bad dialogue yeah this i just dont get there were some pretty nice dialogue sections and so much of the film was worldbuilding i mean how often do you see this in a film done at this level 7 action was just a ripoff of other films yeah shooting a gun is totally a ripoff sure lets go with that8 lack of character development i severely have to disagree on that through the great worldbuilding we see these characters coming in and they all fit very nicely in this universe that with that alone you get the needed characterization furthermore on himself through his interaction with other characters his past his amazing skill you get plenty of characterization and thinking about it what scene would you have taken out of the film to replace with character development cuz anything added to the film and it wouldve felt longer than it needed to be9 not much of a story herethis movie does hit a lot of clichs in and there isnt some big moral lesson to take home or commentary on the life of gangsters and mobsters but really who was walking into this expecting a great story and for those who did this isnt that kind of film where the story takes primary presence in the film in my mind there are action films that are meant for awesome stylistic action and there are those that are meant to tell a great story told through some thrilling action here and there very rarely do you hit two birds with one stone in these kinds of films and the films that try that end up not being able to balance the two and ultimately fail storywise so its a good thing that this film didnt try for too much of a story because that wouldve detracted from what the film was actually good at and really the story made up for itself with the worldbuilding10 how so ever can i trust imdb again oh my really really this is the film that made you distrust imdb ratings really,reality
does exactly what it sets out to do it entertains those of us who appreciate actionpacked films the storyline is simple the cinematography is close to perfection and the soundtrack matches seamlessly is a man of few words and keanu reeves plays him so well that we get a thorough understanding of his character even though he remains silent for a majority of his scenes to those who insist on complaining about the gratuitous violence in this movie is about a hit man out for revenge i cant imagine that the mafias boogeyman would go about getting revenge by calling the cops or hiring a lawyer to sue the gang that took everything he loved from him to those who are complaining about the lack of realism isnt based in reality people as badass as him dont exist in the real world nor does a secret society of assassins so complaining that the movie should have explained the inner workings of the continental is absurd for those of us who were actually paying attention instead of pointing out all the flaws in the film we dont need the inner workings of the continental or its members explained to us because the premise was so glaringly obvious to those who think that a legend like john should have been able to fend off the attack at the start of the film i will admit that does get his ass kicked at the start of the film and yes maybe a legend such as himself should have been able to defend himself but youre all missing some very important points he had no idea that the attack was coming he was sleeping a minute before the attack and he had been retired for more than 5 years i doubt he was expecting an ambush when he was simply getting up to get his puppy some food expecting that his guard would still be up 5 years after he had retired would be unrealistic not to mention there wouldnt have been a movie at all if he had killed all the bad guys within the first 10 minutes of the film the fact that he comes out of retirement to avenge the death of his puppy shows us exactly why hes so feared to those who think that the mob bosss viggo son losef should have known who was had been retired for 5 years which means that losef would have still been a teen when helped his father which also means that they parted on good terms so there was no reason for viggo to fear john until losef crossed him part of retirement likely included allowing him to keep a low profile having him outed at every turn would have ruined any chance he had at a normal life and if john is the legend they all say he is i doubt any of his old acquaintances wanted to be known as the person who prevented him from achieving happiness need i remind you that he came out of retirement to avenge his puppy finally to those who think its unrealistic to expect that assassins can be loyal to each other you missed the whole purpose of the continental clearly in the fictional world that is assassins live by a particular code that includes not killing your friends which explains why marcus was willing to protect john unlike ms perkins john and marcus live by the code and respect each other enough not to let money get in the way of their friendship or the rules this point is illustrated clearly when ms perkins fate is sealed after she breaks the rules,reality
the theft of his car and the killing of his provide the motivation for an orgy of shootings and beatings theres even a fight scene with a hitwoman so that misogynists can get their jollies keanu reeves obviously has bills  or alimony  to pay which could explain his appearance in this schlock did jason statham and nicholas cage turn it down willem dafoe presumably also in need of a boost to his pension has an inexplicable supporting role and ian mcshane makes an appearance so brief it cant have paid much more than extra workthe film is shot with pace and style but the mayhem is endless pointless mindless i normally avoid movies as bad as this i should have avoided john ,reality
i will start by saying i havent really been a fan of many strictly action films that have come out in the last 5  7 years until now is a mostly well paced action film with many really awesome and intense action sequences that actually really surprised me this film i feel just revived the action genre well for me it did it was so fun to watch while at the same time getting increasingly more interesting the more twists the film took one thing i also loved was that once the action begins it doesnt really take many breaks it just keeps going with fight after fight and not one bit of action felt forced it all made sense in terms of the plot lets talk about the plot at first this movie seems like your average action film about someone who gets something taken from him and seeks revenge but that quickly unfolds to reveal more and more secrets about who is and who the people he is hunting are the movie felt like to me a perfect mix between taken and hostel making for a surprisingly awesome action film in terms of the performances i felt that everyone in this film portrayed their characters really well in a way that felt pretty believable but the most importantly this felt like a real comeback to the action genre for keanu reeves he was incredible in this movie right from the beginning you are really backing his character and are cheering him on right to the end i believe he can really take over from liam neeson and be the new face of badass action if only this film got the attention it deserved the only issue i felt stood out was that the third act of the film although was still very entertaining and intense felt a little more rushed than the rest of the film but other than that this film was a very pleasant surprise and restored my faith in the action genre i love the world they set up in this film and cant wait for the sequel or any other films they decide to set within this world  81,reality

every so often two movies are released the same calendar year with a similar storyala dantes peak and volcano both released in 1997 deep impact and armageddon in 1998 the illusionist and the prestige in 2006 olympus has fallen and white house down in 2013 or we can go all the way back to 1984 with breakin and beat street i mention this because part way through this movie i couldnt help but realize how eerily similar it is to the equalizerthe equalizer starring denzel washington was about a retired highly skilled agent that was living alone because he had lost his wife he was drawn out of retirement by the russian mafia because of their iniquitiesstarring keanu reeves is about a retired highly skilled assassin that lives alone because he lost his wife he has also been drawn out of retirement by russians because of their iniquities thats where the similarities end even though is a good movie i give the nod to the equalizer over it for a few reasons 1 denzel over keanu reeves still has all of the range of a cardboard cutout2 the story every vengeancevigilante film requires an impetus for the revengevigilantism sometimes we the viewer dont really care what that reason is we just want to see some professional butt whipping even if that is the case thats not to say that some causes are not better than others the cause in was good just how it came about was very elementary3 the head scratching moments has three moments that leave you scratching your head with a puzzled look on your face they are fairly obvious as they are right out of the movie clich manual it doesnt cripple the movie but it makes you wonder in this day and age with a hundred years of movies to refer to why drum up the same old good guy and bad guy clichsthose are my only beefs they arent enough to ruin the movie well they might ruin it for some once the action kicks into gear its a real treat is masterful with a gun its like he took martial arts classes with guns instead of giving you a wellplaced punch or kick he uses bullets and there was something they did well in this movie which id never seen in a movie before this one had to often and quite obviously change magazines in his weapons made it very apparent that his guns do not have magazines with unlimited rounds and that you very well may have to replace a magazine at a very inconvenient time that was refreshing,reality
ok this is my first review so please if you actually read this have some patience with my movie critic abilities or lack there of i thought this movie deserved at least a 7 as had some very good action scenes what do people expect from an action movie the motive that drove was basic however powerful enough to drive a person to kill the villain lady in this is just gorgeous and the villain russian son is very detestable critics that dont like this movie will not like any action movie go back to your romantic comedy section now it had been a while since i watched a keanu movie but dude keanu was awesome in this i hope there is at least a second part to this one,reality
how can i describe the movie in comparison to other action films average at best more mediocre than average this movie starts of very strong with a plot that seems like it is about to elevate this movie into something more than just another action flick it almost looks like it will delve into that rarely seen realm of an action flick with a decent story then it gets about halfway through and becomes so very predictable and rather boring i rarely use the word boring even describing average to mediocre action films but that is exactly what happens to this movie about halfway through how can a movie full of action be boring is something the people who made this film should ponder i cannot really blame the cast as they all were pretty good in their roles the story was just straight booty after the halfway point this is a prime example of a movie that should have ended like 40 minutes prior to when it did when the main character achieved his goal is when it should have ended but the just had to add on another 40 60 minutes of movie which just made everything up to that point seem like a wasted effort shame on the writers directors financiers and all the behind the scenes magic that made this movie for not realizing this movie was headed into the absurd realm sooner you would be better suited spending your cash on almost any other movie at the box office this weekend if you insist on seeing this film the saddest part of this is that keanu reeves and all the cast actually did some pretty good acting in this film not his usual phoning it in anybody who says this movie is more than a below average action movie is not somebody who has seen the movie or a person with poor film taste,reality
this film is brilliant none stop action from start to finish keanu reeves is back here proving that he has all it takes to compete with the best action film stars like jason statham and liam neesonthe movie has a simple revenge plot that is executed to perfection your typical retired hitman forced back into action after a russian mob kill his dogthe action scenes are out of this world very well choreographed action sequences that resembles something out of a video game think call of duty the choreography of the scenes and the way handles a gun during gun fights are superb and very unique keanu deserves lots of credit for his talent in action scenes and delivering some of the stunts him self his acting has improved yes we all know hes not award winning actor but he still delivers a lot in terms of charisma and character that he brings to the screen this is definitely one of my favorite keanu reeves films and my best action film of the year i strongly recommend this film to all action fans keanu fans and any movie fans looking for some solid entertainment i plan to go watch this a second time in the theaters,reality
i think we all agree that the less keanu reeves has to say the better is the perfect film and role since his former hitman seeking revenge does all his talking with his guns there really isnt much to the film this is just a straight up rrated ultraviolent shoot em up with some great action sequences i love how the characters run out of bullets and have to reload during a fight stuff like that make the film funny at times amid all the head shots and blood keanu is very good when it comes to action scenes and this is his best action movie since the first matrix very cool very calm and very deadly the perfect exhitman to root for,reality
is the latest action flick about an exhitman who retires and is brought back into the action to get revenge on the russian mob when a few jerks kill his dogas far as generic action movies go this one is pretty good it had a generic story good action and russians for the like third time this year it stars keanu reeves who does a pretty good job actually everyone else is good but keanu is the bestthe tone is pretty generic and visually dark the pace is goodthe music is pretty good too best action score of the war so farso one of the things i really liked was the action keanu doesnt completely overpower his enemies like denzel but at the same time hes a complete boss who gets the cod award for most headshots except when he needs to shoot then in the stomach to save time so he can shoot them in the headits rated r for violence and it has some moderate language with it its not too bad and a lot of it is in subtitles thoughso is pretty good its a solid action movie and its awesome i will say its worth seeing i liked camp xray a little bit more so i have to give a strong 7510,reality
before i decided to give this movie a go i was doubtful if reeves could entertain me for almost two hours certainly did not like his last string of movies i decided to give and more keanu reeves a try i was pleasantly surprised though director chad stahelski sure knows his action flick clichs the film doesnt fall for the trap of one dimensional characters and tries original takes on standard action movie situations well done furthermore the movie is also saved by a carefully chosen cast and great supporting roles small but humble roles played by former the wire actors lance reddick clarke peters and willem dafoe for once as a good guy makes sense michael nyqvist does a great performance as sympathetic but evil bad guy boss viggo tarasov and alfie allen singer lilly allens brother and well known for his role as theon greyjoy is the guy you love to hate ioseph tarasovthis stylish cool movie is a perfect fit for keanu reeves whos style of acting works best in movies where he doesnt have to show too much emotions didnt even notice his californian bill  ted accent this time around that ruined some movies for me in which he played much ado about nothing for example a surfer dude playing in a shakespeare play,reality
the review while in ways this wouldnt be surprising if this film went straight to dvd i was very glad it got a theatrical release while i did not check this out in imax i was very glad i saw it and may even see it again a simple non convoluted plot with simple characters simple motives characters you root for characters you despise john keanu is an emotionally burdened man in which you can sense the heaviness of his burdens in his eyes yet thats as much as he will let you in as the rest of his angst is transformed into pre meditated vengeance extracted upon the culprits who have done him harm they should have finished the job as the debt they started quickly becomes more than they or the whole organization can afford is a lethal precise assassin and while it doesnt necessarily look like he is having fun while doing it it certainly is fun to watch,reality
my goodness this is a good action film and why are people over reviewing this action film and all action films for that matter i truly doubt this was movie was made with hopes of an oscar it was however made to please the action senses all action films are purely for the entertainment and thrill to watch people and crap get blown up sooooooo please enjoy this film this is a good watch has a good subject so get your big popcorn your favorite big soda and your sweets and just enjoy it keanu reeves has matured and am digging his most recent films man of tai chi and 47 ronin are good entertaining films,reality
it is truly a color by the number action movie and in the end a rembrandt is paintedthose who are so highbrow cant let go that the movies complete lack of any intricate pretentious plottwist is actually a thing of beauty i was so overjoyed that it rests in the action sequences the lovable hero played gloriously by kreeves as a the somber stoic badgood guy and continuing our disdain for russians see cold war no it is simply a revenge action movie and the scenes are totally badarse the insights to this crazy underworld of hiredkillers is original insightful and adds depth to an otherwise go get em kinda moviespoiler alert  theres a scene so sad the beginning that it makes you want to cry and adds fire to your furious revenge nestled in your heart,reality
is another fastpaced and graphic revenge movie with some entertaining action and black humour a fitting soundtrack and the usual stereotypical characters from the russian mafia when it comes to gripping revenge flicks you should rather watch south korean movies like the intense the man from nowhere which is twice as good as this film i saw the devil which is probably one of the most brutal movies ever made the emotionally heartbreaking blood island as well as the philosophical trilogy around sympathy for mister vengeance oldboy and lady vengeance if you are looking for some originality depth and character development is only a hollow entertainment for genre fans if i wasnt a fan of this kind of movies my rating would be much lower than it isthe story is simple was a hitman working for the organized crime in new york city he retired from his job and started a new life when he met the love of his life roughly four years later loses his wife to cancer he receives a posthumous gift from her in form of a puppy with a letter from his wife saying that she is gone and that should cope with her demise by loving the coincidentally he encounters the son of his old boss who doesnt know him the young russian mafioso wants to purchase john vintage 69 mustang but the grieving man refuses a few hours later the russian mafioso breaks into john house without any problems as there seems to be no alarm system at all with a few friends the young criminal kills john beloved puppy steals his car and is bright enough to take off his hood to show his face so surely knows who he is the victim survives and goes on to kill around eighty criminals in the next ninety minutes of the movie of course killing the naive culprit is not enough he also kills his partners colleagues bodyguards his old boss and a few guys in a church in the end everybody but is dead and he goes to the next veterinary hospital walks off with a new and goes home as if nothing ever happenedthis story is so bad that it could have been written by a twelveyear old first of all there are too many coincidences concerning the encounter with the russian criminals who want to steel john car in the entire movie everybody is talking about john incredible reputation and everybody knows him wherever he goes but the son of the most influent criminal is the only one who has never heard of him its not credible that a smart hitman doesnt have any alarm system to protect his home one can understand that the killing of the puppy his wife gave to him really hurts but taking this event to justify eighty or more murders is not credible at all in the entire movie there is no police or anything despite all the shootings in downtown new york city all of john enemies are extremely stupid unexperienced and wooden even thirty men in one building cant manage to fight him i could go on for hours as this movie is filled with so many coincidences plot holes and unrealistic scenes that its amusing if you tell me know that the story doesnt matter in a revenge action movie just watch any of the movies mentioned in the introduction that prove that even the grisliest revenge thriller can have some depth even the raid franchise is more realistic and has better plots rather feels like a simplistic egoshooter for video game consoles than an actual movie i must though admit that the last splinter cell games had better story lines than this filmanother thing that feels out of place is the fact that fiftyyear old keanu reeves is playing the unbeatable hitman the fighting scenes are somewhat wooden but he still manages to fight off his enemies because their acting is even slower on the other side keanu reeves also has a certain charisma to fit this role fiftynine year old willem dafoe as veteran hitman who has to kill is also a questionable choice in my opinion still he is a respectable actor and has charisma the most annoying thing is the fact that the evil guys are russians again but that they are portrayed by actors from all around the world like england sweden and even switzerland  except russia one can feel that these are wannabe hollywood russians and not real russiansyou may now ask yourself why i still gave a favourable rating to this flick its actually simple this movie never gets boring the action scenes are sometimes wooden but most of them are just shootings so it doesnt really matter these scenes are well directed and include no annoying shaky cameras or overloaded special effects the settings of the movie are well chosen and vary from dirty chop shops over elegant bath houses to orthodox churches there are a few memorable lines in this film as in many other action movies some graphic content is related to some dark and dry humour which made the whole thing easier to digest i actually liked this combination of contradictory extremes and had to laugh quite a few times during the movie the soundtrack of the movie is also enjoyable and fitting for genre fans there are enough entertaining and wellexecuted elements to enjoy this movie despite its obvious flawsif you are looking for some fastpaced and superficial entertainment to switch your brains off you will like if you are actually looking for a good movie that has more to offer than stylish violence go for the movies mentioned in the introduction,reality
this movie was so annoyingly dull dialogues are so boring keanu reevess fights are so bad that it hurts after watching the movie i had to check who director and writter are well why wasnt i surprised director chad stahelski came from a kickboxing background he entered the film field as a stunt performer i believe thats why movie was nominated for best stunts and unfairly won best action movie award you remember how fake the the fight scenes in iron fist series were well keanu reeves is even worse writer derek kolstads iq is below average dry and stupid dialogues ruined the whole movie towards the end of the movie keanu reeves kills dozens of gangster and survives but at the beginning of movie 3 gangsters came in his house in the night and beat the st out of him kills his puppy and still his car can you believe that why would the son of mafia boss take all the risk for an old mustang from 1969 couldnt he afford to buy one this movie is probably the most overrated action movie it doesnt deserve more then 5,reality
is some super assassin who left the biz and got married his wife dies of cancer he runs into some russian punks we decide to beat him up steal his car and kill his john decides hes going to get revenge and spends the next 90 minutes killing everyone in his path the action is decent but weve seen it in jason stathams movies already so nothing terribly new herethe film hints at some secret underground society of assassins but totally drops the ball by failing to flesh any of this out ahh what could have beennot the worst movie ive seen but its still pretty weak,reality
i honestly read some of these bad views thinking some people were on lots of drugs when they wrote them because this is one of the best actions in a long time i actually made an account just to tell everyone not to listen to the bad reviews for a second if you like beast mode dude kills all the bad guys action movies then you will love this movie i give it a 10 out of 10 because for what it is its damn near flawless very violent and brutal action scenes and keanu is an absolute beast in this i read one review saying this was a comedy and just to clarify that there is almost zero humor in the movie keanu is calm and just professional as can be almost the whole movie minus the accent he almost reminded me of jean reno in the professional overall if your a fan of action watch this movie with confidence and some of the people on here shouldnt watch a movie from a genre they dont like and then talk about how bad the movie was obviously if you hate scifi or fantasy movies and you go see lord of the rings your not gonna like it but to anyone with an open mind even slightly loves it its the same thing with if your some little girl who likes movies like legally blonde dont watch good movies and tell people they suck,reality
all of us know how great keanu reeves was acting the matrix with cool keanu with a touch of soft came back the great combination of action and drama make this movie incredible likable between business friendship eye on eye situation let you stay the whole 141 minutes on the screen till the end you will not miss a part of a story looks like a video game i love to watch it sound track its like sucker punch sound track great story and picture dont miss to watch it it is a movie for men and women who like action coolness and bad boys who watch the movie driver or only gods forgive will love this movie,reality
drivein fare for the weakminded utter rubbish i used to to think keanu was an actor,reality
his fights have always looked like he was dancing like choreograph his shooting was the best thing on the show which gave him a star part 3 was the best because halle and her her fighting seemed more realistic them belgium malinois was great also 20 stars to halle and the the rest was awful,reality
 the sophisticated style and exclusive hidden world is used well and reeves suits the lead role but the action scenes are repetitive and uninspired and overall the film doesnt really engage,reality
action packed and starstudded butdoes a killed puppy and stolen car justify all the carnage,reality
dont go any critics reviews this is damn amazing movie i have watched it more than 5 times,reality
yesit was a bad jokedont waste your time please,reality
not since the transporter had i seen an action movie containing all the clichs of the genre but while the transporter laughs at them the action scenes are both fun and great and each new clich introduced only serves to reinforce the joke transports you to this state of mind where youre already guessing whats going to happen afterwards but you are hoping that it really really does not mixed with a fascination at realizing that yes it actually happens i cannot understand how it can anything like the scores it has the script is terribly bad action scenes are mostly ok but inconsistencies in the story and bad lines ruin them,reality
wow its rare to see an action film with an amazing story until now the writing was sheer perfection  this is as real as it gets sure its still way out there as far as realism goes but has done to action films as bruce lee did to martial arts films this is one of the best actiondrama films of all time add to this little gem an amazing story that puts you right there in front of all the tension incredible directing cinematography choreography editing sound and perfectly cast keanu reeves was legendary for the matrix he is now legendary for a perfect 1010 from me,reality
the premise is kind of silly but the dramatic opening and the masterfully choreographed action make it an entertaining movie to watch once btw baba yaga is far removed from the boogeyman and if the creators actually bothered to research their material theyd be embarrassed to name their kickass protagonist after an old witch lady,reality

in theory shouldnt work its taken with keanu reeves its the lets create a middleaged action hero with unrivaled skills whose first name starts with j formula and yet director chad stahelski and writer derek kolstad take the very best of that formula and elevate it into art  undoubtedly one of the best americanmade pure action movies of the 21st centurykeanu reeves fits so effortlessly into this story as a former hitman who has just lost his wife to an illness after having a random encounter with the son of a crime lord he once worked for the young man decides to target and attacks him in his home more significantly he commits one particular crime that pushes over the emotional brink and back into the criminally underbelly from which he thought hed walked away forever the emotional plot device that launches this story out of canon might seem a little cheap but it works powerfully well in a way kolstad knows that we know the retired hero steps back into the ring trope so well that he manipulates it to his advantage we get behind our new antihero in a heartbeat the cherry on that sundae comes in a one word line of dialogue from crime lord vigo tarasov michael nyqvist when learns just who his son alfie allen has messed with ohthe body of the film is rrated bloody mayhem that combines martial arts with a shoot em up style which results in a surprisingly satisfying combination punctuated by a plethora of kill shots to the head a phrase i never thought id use in a movie review the sound effects and spraying blood dust echo video game sequences in fact theres a scene in which assaults a safe house thats cut with a guy in the safe house playing a firstperson shooter game its a nice wellexecuted and majorly selfaware juxtapositionstahelski also brings a graphic novel aesthetic to the film theres a lot of careful shot composition and a dark color palette with different colored hues the way he stitches together two scenes  one of vigo lecturing his son about his terrible mistake and the other of going into his basement to dig up the weapons hes buried  has a distinct comic book vibereeves has the perfect amount of quiet determined menace to bring the part to life but also drew some impressive talent in other venerated actors between nyqvist willem dafoe john leguizamo and ian mcshane they lend so much legitimacy to the criminal fantasy world of the hotelif all that werent enough the script does circle around some ideas about whether a person can change as much forward thrust as the opening scenes give this film kolstad doesnt settle with it it digs a little deeper into what really motivated john to get back in the business and proposes it might have been inevitableis a successful combination of style and storytelling and it really elevates the very basic genrelevel appeal of this type of action movie its unusual for a movie to be one of the last ones to the party this party being all the films about middleaged assassins seeking revenge and be the one to make the biggest impression thats the sign of a great action moviesteven cthanks for reading visit movie muse reviews for more,reality
plot an exhitman comes out of retirement to track down the gangsters that took everything from himthis film has grown on me overtime i at first didnt like it but i realized that it was because when i went to see it at a free screening i was seated up close to the screen not letting me enjoy the experience throughout since then in order to get ready for the sequel i re watched this and was generally surprised this film has a feel of an old school 8090s action flick using wide shots instead of shaky cam for the action and i love it every action scene works to its advantage and showed how capable these directors are keanu reeves is in my opinion an underrated actor that should get more respect and im glad that he got a lot of praise for this film cause he deserves it i dont want to shortchange the rest of the cast because they are also really good including ian mcshane john leguizamo alfie allen michael nyquist adrianne palicki willem dafoe and etc palicki and nyquist are the biggest surprises to me especially since i wasnt a big fan of either of them but they both surprised me in the endin conclusion is of the best revenge films that ive seen in a while this film and its sequel should be lessons to producers of hollywood in how to make an action film and how they should make them from now on,reality
i had several friends tell me this was a great movie so i went into it with above average expectations sadly i was disappointed i enjoy movies where the main characters are bigger than life but this was just one big disappointment for me there was no brains to the movie the main characters mode of operation didnt have the slightest hint of realism the fight scenes were well choreographed but highly improbable and quite clich if you want action movies with a brain i highly recommend the professional leon bourne identity or the usual suspects if you want an action movie with a better story and more entertainment watch the boondock saints if youre just looking for a highly stylized action movie here is some basic entertainment for you,reality
i could talk for a long time about weak writing onedimensional characters and stupid and boring action scenes but these are the things that simply make this movie bad what makes it truly ridiculous however is its portrayal of russians and russian mafiadont get me wrong i dont mind russians portrayed as bad guys its just one of many action movie clichs that i easily accept the ridiculous part is this movie actually tries to focus on russians while knowing nothing about themfirst lets take who is supposed to be a badass hitman the mafia calls him baba yaga this fact alone is so hilarious it would send a russian roll on the floor laughing because it sounds about as good as calling a badass hitman the ed witch of the east baga yaga is a folk character mostly known through fairy tales shes an old witch who is portrayed as wise scary and occasionally villainous but quite often helpful and shes mostly known from fairytales where shes practically never a big villain baba isnt really a part of the name it simply means old hag thats right a badass hitman called old hag and a female name i assume at some point there was an idea to find a word similar to boogeyman and use it as a nickname for john there indeed is a slavic boogeyman called babay which they perhaps confused with baba yaga boy how many laughs this confusion producednaturally not a single character in the movie can speak russian at all plus almost nobody has a real russian name i understand that americans tend to struggle very hard with russian surnames but first names there are no russians named iosef let alone viggo the mafia boss looks about as realistic as boris in snatch but boris was purposefully overthetop while is presented to us like a serious movieand theres the hilarious scene in club sauna where russian mafia guys actually sing kalinkamalinka its about as stupid as american criminals getting reading dr seuss aloud together in real life theres a whole genre of criminal songs called blatnyak and in many ways it fulfills the same function as some types of rap its songs sung by criminals or people pretending to be them for criminals and about criminals this is something that russian mafia could actually sing not goddamn russian 19th century songs that were common on soviet tvand i could accept all that even though its crazy to see this silliness in 2014 if not for one thing somehow this movie pretends that it actually is about russians russians are everywhere they talk about their thoughts customs motivations et cetera et cetera while none of this has anything to do with real russians this reminds me of a historical museum scene in the movie called idiocracy in which future people got so stupid they think that charlie chaplin fought with nazis and dinosaurs that shot lasers thats how far this movie is from reality and for the life of me i simply cant understand why the authors of this movie tried to talk about things that they literally know nothing about,reality

quintessentially keanu he radiates a zenlike calm which makes him simultaneously elusive and irresistible especially in the face of great mayhem theres still a boyish quality to his face but it belies the wisdom of his years hes smarter than he looks but hes in no great hurry to go out of his way to prove it to youat least not on screen he just  is a character like is right in reeves wheelhouse because it allows him to be coolly almost mythically confident yet deliver an amusing deadpan oneliner with detached precision this is when traces of the playful characters of his youthted theodore

capacity also in the mix is willem dafoe as an expert sniper who may or may not be on side once the premise is established in the script from derek kolstad its scene after scene of taking out entire rooms full of people who are foolish enough to stand in his way this is not exactly a complicated genre from a narrative perspective but directors chad stahelski and david leitchwho work as a filmmaking team although leitch technically takes producing creditare both veteran stuntman who clearly know what theyre doing when it comes to this kind of balletic action stahelski got his break 20 years ago when he served as a stunt double following brandon lees deadly accident while shooting the crow and went on to perform as reeves stunt double in the matrix trilogy leitchs work includes doubling for brad pitt in fight club and mr and mrs smith and matt damon in the bourne ultimatum all those years of experience and exposure give their film a level of confidence you dont ordinarily see in firsttime directors theyre smart enough to let the intricate choreography speak for itself they let the fight scenes play out without relying on a lot of nauseating shakycam or cuisinart edits which sadly have become the aesthetic standard of late but beyond the exquisite brutality they put on display theyve also got an eye for artistry with cinematographer jonathan sela helping convey an ominous sense of underworld suspense early scenes are so crisply desaturated they look black and white from the cloudy rainy skies over wifes funeral to his headtotoe wardrobe to his sleek slategray mustang as begins to reimmerse himself in the criminal world hed escaped other scenes pop in their vibrancythe deep green of a secret membersonly cocktail bar or the rich red of a russian bad guys shirt under an impeccably tailored suit while the body count grows numbing and repetitive actually is more compelling in the aesthetically heightened specifically detailed world it depicts its the new york city of the here and now but his fellow assassins and other sundry nefarious sorts occupy their own parallel version of it with its own peculiar rules which almost seem quaint they have their own currency gold coins reminiscent of pirates doubloons which can be used for goods and services or just as thanks for a favor and they frequent an upscale downtown hotel and bar called the continental lance reddick from the wire is the unflappably polite manager a sort of safe zone where protocol dictates that peace prevails and where killing is cause for dismissal the courtliness of it all

keanu reeves isnt the guy that seems suited for your usual revenge flick but he works fairy well for theres an inherent detachment to reeves for a good portion of the film but hes also got that quiet brooding that roils beneath the surfaceprobably the best thing about this movie are the action scenes which arent cut to shreds theyre wellstaged and have a nice fluid brutality to them simple but effectivewhat was also really nice was the clearly defined underworld with its coded language currency ad protocols it harked back to payback and the mobascorporateculture also had modern dress and domestic appointments probably due to his departed wife but hes using an old touchtone phone and getting around in circa 79s cars little touches that add characterits great news that theyre planning a sequel theyve already built the world and im in for more,reality
keanu reaves is back and this movie its a movie exactly for keanu reaves dont expect to see an amazing story or a great photography this is an action movie quite interested and one or two points above the usual action movies its sad then its funny then its thrill and lots of action from the beginning to the end the fights are very well conceived we all know keanu reaves skills on martial arts and the acting is quite good on almost all the participants is a retired contract killer passing for a moment of griving the problem is that a group of russians didnt let him griving on his own and give him a path back to his formal livefinally we know who killed the boogie man and this create a lot of reactions during the movie which is very funnyyou wont be disappointed with this movie,reality
is a simple action story with elements that weve all seen before and nothing about it is groundbreaking or particularly intriguing in terms of the story or performances so if you cannot value an action film for its set pieces choreography and stunt work then this film isnt for you for action fans i would definitely recommend it the camera work is still yet dynamic and allows us to see a great view of the action while not obscuring anything that happens all of the action scenes are quick to the point brutal and have consequences for all characters involved isnt presented as invincible just highly skilled and lucky his character has been out of the assassination game for over 5 years and that makes keanu reeves playing the part a bit more of an easier pill to swallow although i might want to bite my own tongue here because for a man nearing 50 he carried out every scene to the letter and in my opinion was more tough and convincing than he ever was in any of the matrix films here i saw influence from another great 00s action flick the man from nowhere which if you havent seen but enjoyed this i would highly recommend has a lot of style the locations are spectacular i often found myself asking where did they find this place gorgeous victorian and old school architecture to high tech modernized homes you really feel that youve covered a lot of ground watching this another element of the style is the world it takes place in its a very stylized slick graphic novel type alternate reality where coded language an honor code amongst assassins and even secret resources and hotels for them is all the norm the film doesnt treat any of this as strange and takes you along into this bizarre world revealing more and more at a time while including things such as running out of ammo multiple times to keep it refreshingly grounded again in terms of writing story or acting this isnt a critics dream i saw this with a friend on a lazy saturday morning after having some waffle house i feel that is exactly how this movie is meant to be enjoyed as an added note as a martial artist myself i appreciated the use of judo and jiujitsu on film most movie fight scenes are 90 striking based and are afraid to show ground and grapple work good on them for not being shy of it gets a 7 out of 10 for slick well choreographed action and a quirky dark humour sheen complete with a high body count,reality
this is a sly swift and stylish action movie that is actually a decent popcorn flick sure the plot isnt anything grand but that isnt the core of this movie a movie such as this needs a spark and how to go about it from there on it isnt as adrenaline filled entertainment like the raid or has a super well blended and enticing story mixed with action like the raid 2 but itst still a pretty cool movie and seeing keanu reeves kicking ass and taking names is just the bonus like i said the plot doesnt have anything that really stands out but the stylish cinematography choreography with enough cool action elements make this one worth at least one watch especially if you like action movies however i could see why some audiences would not like this movie and why some people just wouldnt you could really tell the directors got their ideas from past action movies anime and video games max payne 3 really came to mind while watching this7510,reality
the movie was a great surprise a through back to dirty harry amazing movie,reality
just want to start by saying as far as the franchise is concerned its been so great to see keanu reeves once again finding a sizable niche in the film industry that he can truly call his own not since the matrix trilogy has he really been a notable character truly worth getting behindis set in a modern day new jerseynew york setting with keanu playing the role of a retired veteran from a dangerous and unforgiving underworld of assassins who managed to get out of the so called industry and managed to find love on the outside so onto the plot that reverberates for what is currently three films and soon to be fourafter his wife tragically passes away from a terminal illness receives one final parting gift from her a beagle puppy named daisy the following night after his wifes funeral a group of russian thugs break into johns home in the early hours of the morning and viciously assault him in an attempt to steal his beloved 60s era mustang killing his poor innocent in the process the thugs make away with the car after the attack but they dont realize they have badly angered what is seemingly the most vengeful hitman on the planet one of the mobsters happens to be the son of a former associate of johns who ends up at war with it becomes 100 personal and john sets out on a merciless revenge attack against the scumbags who took away his last elements of peacethis attack on john dignity sets the stage for one of the most action packed franchises in modern history and gives birth to the gunjitsu action genre the development of the story not just rests with john himself but with the entire assassin industry we get introduced to a hotel known as the continental which is a safe house for the assassin industry members can seemingly go there and find respite and solitude and thats johns way of easing himself back into the dark underworld he left behindtheres not much else i wish to say in fear of spoiling too much ive probably spoilt too much already and i really hope i havent but for anyone who hasnt seen it yet alfie allen and willem dafoe are a couple of notable actors you can look forward to alongside keanu who is absolutely amazing in this role the hard work and preperation he did for these movies was parallel to noneis a classic revenge tail of good vs evil and the two sequels are amazing in their own right if youre a fan of fast paced action scenes and a plotline that you dont need to put too much thought into check these movies out theyre terrific,reality
the first instalment of the trilogie has a pure but refined plot one that many have tried to reproduce but none have yet to even come close to the visual master piece that is its plot though can seem comical has very much the opposite effect on the storytelling from then onward with true character developement around every corner even though i am not the most educated on the topic i found that every scene was beautifully executed within its composition no i believe that this masterpiece is not deserving of being put in the action movie genre for it is way more than that in every possible way if you feel interested in watching this movie rest assured that your time and effort shall be rewarded asmuch as mine have been watching this,reality
ill be honest if someone were to kill my id probably go insane but is able to take this concept of loss and make it into an amazing action movie all about revenge the villains are these cold blooded killers and you hope john gets his revenge the action in this movie is probably some of the best action i have seen in the last decade besides the fast and furious and it is the start for what i think is one of hollywoods best action achievements,reality
as an indian audience we think why hollywood doesnt offer over the top action movies and this one proves us wrong a really over the top action movie enjoyed almost every bit of it the adrenaline kept pumping as the movie progressed loved how the director managed to convey the emotions so seamlessly a f bad movie  please fill the dots  it was a positive response the main character is kinda like the superhero that we all wanna see in a hollywood movie even though at certain points i lost my concentration the majority of the movie didnt loose my attention some action scenes was no blink challenge if at all u blinked you loose all the actionthe direction was on point i definitely have to praise the guy in bringing about emotions in such an intense action packed film and also in that restricted durationthe cast well only one guy needs to be appreciated and you know who that isthe story well there isnt much of a story that might be a negative of the movie the premise of super shortoverall its a good movie,reality
insanely action packed love the whole series of movies,reality
has just the right balance of action writing direction and acting keanu reeves is almost perfecta franchise in the making like the equaliser and jack reacher but with an edge of class and an element of marvel almosti think this movie sets a standard that should be attempted by all forthcoming action of course they will not but we can hope,reality
very surprised when i went through the reviews and saw that half was of them were 1010 and the other half were 110after watching this movie ive gotta say it has got some amazing stunts and keanu reeves plays his role as very good but the story went a little too easyyea his wife dies and then the she gave him and hes going to get his sweet sweet revenge i just think this is a pretty simple story but it doesnt matter that much too the movie because the stunts and acting pulls the rest of the weight a pretty good movie worth to be seen i give it a strong 710,reality
amazing action sequences make this a mustwatch for any fan of stylish and fast paced action flicks the great photography is paired with stylish camera work that really shows the director has immense experience and love for the craft keanu reeves shines as well with a role that might finally typecast himthe biggest downside is the plot or the lack thereof and the weak dialogue and character motivation really take you out of the proceedings of the otherwise tight 101 minute flick,reality
lots of people recommended me this film and i am definitely glad i saw it i am in awe of the action and the story every scene feels so important and interesting maybe not in the first 10 minutes but thats probably just me all the fights are so creative and stylized keanu reeves also does a sensational job in playing also if you are a fan of a revenge action movie i would definitely recommend this,reality
really good movie recommended watching this at 9 pm for the atmosphere 910 great movie,reality
so beautiful kinetic revenge stories always attract people the really meant everything to him so he decided to take everything from them,reality
was that the boogeymanhes not the boogeyman hes the guy you send to kill the boogeymanwas really depressed with the death of his wife furthermore he lost his which she gave him as a member of his family so he got very angry and his terrible revenge begun then the revenge tragedy didnt contain the mind game he just chased the target and bushed everyone who interrupted him up i was so excited it on even such a simple setting i like an extreme person like himi like the colour scheme like neon and particularly the awesome music it was so cool but i was suspicious about the endingi found how stupid conceited people are and why they will go to ruin the flog in the well knows nothing of the great ocean,reality
great action movie i wonder if 2 and 3 i good too,reality
of all the movie ive ever seen contains the best action scenes the scenario is simple but clear it is not the main feature of this movie but it hasnt been oversimplified the only thing ive found incoherent is how little damaged is even when hit by some heavy weight  but maybe its just his talent that allows him to keep avoiding fracturesalso the ambiance is really dark and there are a lot of mysteries about johns life before the time in the movie all of that makes a very impressive character ,reality
excellent film keanu reeves plays a little role rarely seen i liked it very much,reality
this movie was a blast to watch love the creativity with the storyline the continental code the back story everything thank you for the imagination and fun creativity in this movie we have come a long ways from rambo hahahahaha lol,reality
well i havent seen anything like this keanu is perfect for this role you can see great gun fu actionand martial arts what can i say  but i can say if you watch this movie you will enjoy the beat action movie in your life  happy watching,reality
perfects the genre of action movie by distilling it down to a tight simpleyetdramatic story and expert fight choreography set to an entrancing soundtrack and shot in long takes it succeeds by sticking tightly to these basic principles,reality
im all for a revenge badass movie i like my hero flicks where one guy takes on the world i also like keanu reeves most people find it easy to bash his acting and thats fine but i like the guy because i like who he is offscreen hes easy for me to root for onscreeni was a huge fan of how the movie started confronts the mobsters at the gas station and theres tension but he handles it like a pro and then of course we are shown the other side of as he transforms into the hitman hellbent on revenge all of this was exciting and had me dialed inmaybe im putting too much focus on one scene but i cant seem to shake it here is a guy described as a hitman so deadly he takes out three men with a pencil here is a guy who wipes out 12 men in matrixlike fashion when they invade his home here is a guy who kills approximately 3050 people during the movie on his quest to kill one man the son of a mobster he is relentless coldblooded and unwavering on this mission a true assassin nothing will stop him from completing his goal of murdering the man who killed his and in effect killed his last remaining tie to his beloved deceased wifeso what does do after mowing down said bodies finally confronting his ultimate target he points the gun at him and doesnt shoot thats what he does whatfor about 15 hours im taught and shown this is the worlds most ruthless hitman and he doesnt shoot the one guy he wants dead okayhe hesitates absolutely nothing about his character even hints at hesitation to this point in the movie kills a guy hes pinned to the floor and then of course raises his gun to kill the son and now its a chase scene from point blank kill to lets continue this movie for another 30 minutesunfortunately that is my overall take from the film you can build a character well and then completely defy what the character is all about just to finish out the movie for whatever reason in a different more prolonged manner,reality
the only word that keeps coming back to mind when reviewing this movie is exhilarating the fun factor this amazing action film has is probably the highest of any movie this year i could not stop myself from having a blastfirst and foremost being also the first thing you notice is selfconscious of what it is and doesnt for not even one second take itself more seriously than it should fortunately this doesnt shut out the place for character connection and empathy people often think the two of these things exclude themselves but that is not what i think and this movie is proof of it it has such a genuine sense of fun and humor so much so that you are often laughing with not at the movie at the preposterousness of everything and at the same time feeling genuine tension for the characters youre rooting for i know it sounds ridiculous but every single kill by feels exciting and liberating it was incredible how much i was rooting for him to this contributes some stunning fastandfurious level action scenes that benefit amazingly by the practicality involved hats off to the director and the special effects guys for staging such a flawless string of adrenalinepumping scenes in particular to the director for the highly energetically stylish direction that never feels as a gimmick or out of place yet instead makes everything all the more enjoyable furthermore this is one of the few movies in which sound actually stood out and contributed in making the film a great success keanu reeves is perfect for the role and brings to the screen so much charisma i could not help but root for the guy he is surrounded by a great cast too that has very fun moments on their own if all of this wasnt enough has some great original ideas and plays with them in the best way possibledespite having a blast in the theater and wanting to maybe see this movie again in a year or so it isnt original stylish or innovative enough to say weve seen this plot before but not quite done this way yes it has its brilliance but it is kind of cheesy even if in a good way and predictable it doesnt rank up to a higher standard of action movie because of its straightforwardness it does have some stakes but all in all there isnt really an overwhelming set piece or twist that makes it highly remarkableobviously that is not what its aiming for and because of that i could recommend this movie to anybody just go and have the best action entertainment fun in the theater,reality
the intention of the movie is clearly action and nothing else dont expect a story line or any real character development but i got bored after about 40mins if youve seen a good action movie before then theres nothing new here,reality
engaging action packed good movie would have scored it higher but the sound editing was horrible i spent the whole movie with remote in hand increasing the volume at speaking scenes then instant action and music blasted my paint off the walls im watching 2 next i really hope the sound is even,reality
pretty good film but i think overall its a tad overrated  it has style quite a lot of violence and an ok script  but it feels like we have seen this before but in a different style and just keanu reeves in the lead this time again its good in style and keanu is pretty good in this but the story is a little overblown and the pace of the movie lacks that boost of momentum,reality
it is hard to believe when this came out it was pretty much a flop and now i consider it a modern day action movie classic the action is so good and realistic love the whole concept and them fleshing out the whole crime underworld plus just in the movie the whole legendary status of is awesome plus you want to see get back at all the russians for his love this movie to pieces,reality
just saw this for the first time in anticipation of watching the second and wellreceived third installments enjoyed this action thriller much more than i thought i would not too much schmaltz and appropriately timely humorous lines boosted it was it over the top of course it was which is the whole point of seeing it 75 stars,reality
had alot of action in it which made for good watch also love the ending havent had too many good action movies that have caught my attention and this one definitely caught my attention but im also a big keanu reeves fan,reality
the show starts pretty slowly it took 1520 minutes to meet our first action scene in an action movie however after 15 minutes this show is full of memorable sentences and happenings it totally worth its 75 starsi gave 8 because of ,reality
never thought killing someone would be so elegant graceful is the embodiment of a dance rehearsal,reality
synopsisa group of thugs beat up and rob keanu reeves for fun they chose the wrong guy to mess withreviewlets face it keanu reeves has had it hard from the crowd over the years with many mistaking his sometimes relatively expressionless face for a lack commitment towards the roles hes given but this didnt bother me going into ive always been a fan of reevess more subtle approaches to drama so much so that im considering going out of my way to catching every movie hes ever starred ingetting to the point this movie sees a return to form for a genre which has been bedevilled by undue retreads of the same tropeshow well the main attraction is the highly wellpolished sequences of stylised martialartstype action theyre so ambitious that they take you back to the matrix no cumbersome set stunts are to be found its all thoroughly coolthe central premise is an interesting one in that it seems to be futuristic but not in an sf way the setting is a makebelieve era in which assassins have become a commonplace part of society this is most ironically illustrated when a police officer sees that has just killed a man in cold blood in response the officer merely says quite casually youworkin again johnanother thing to note is the generosity in common with the more recent mission impossible  fallout more than you expect is delivered albeit not quite as spectacularly as in the latter there are three lengthy sequences featuring oodles of handtohand gunplay or both in response to one a character delivers the most hilariously emphatic priceless you can imaginethose would be enough to give a solid experience all on their own but then comes the second half of the closing act which earnestly informs you that action is back on the gourmet menuthere are two minor flaws mind one concerns the scene where the thugs beat up and rob how did that happen is denoted at various points in the run time as the boogeyman of the assassin world a character who questions the title receives the response well he wasnt technically the boogeyman he was the guy you sent to kill the boogeymansoknowing that is such a formidable force of nature how did the thugs manage to overpower him in the first placethe other flaw concerns the central premise as already discussed its a very bizarre setup but that alone isnt the issue rather i wanted to know more i wanted to be more richly filled in on how the assassins semiculture worked nothing that the sequel wont be able to fixverdict 45an absolute blast from start to finish very wellpolished hardhitting action sequences combined with a memorable performance from reeves and surprisingly effective deadpan humour make this a beacon of hope in a very oversaturated genre,reality
as you can see by my rating and the titel i definitely love this movie and watched it several times now despite the plot being very simple if you watch the trailer you already know whats going on the action in this movie is phenomenal the worldbuilding is also very interesting and it makes you want to see more keanu did put in a lot of work and it shows overall i can say that for people who like action movies andor keanu reeves i mean who doesnt this is definitely a mustsee,reality
keanu and his amazing action ride the perfect story and the whole world simple fast and still the best action movie 100  1010,reality
great movie with some really beastly scenes the action and fight scenes were intense and awesome artistically done with a very real feel to them and you can clearly see exactly whats happening in the fight very well directed with great music that was perfectly fitting a very different musical score with hard rock and synth vibe 3 viewingsspoilersand i really liked the world they created of underground assassins it was so cool,reality
1 is a good debut for a fantastic series while certainly lacking in the panache of its two successors does what it needs to mindless gun toting madness to be enjoyable if a little routine,reality
if you watched this movie and was intrigued by the story then i am confused at best it felt like they were trying to make something that people would treat like a cult film maybe they succeeded as the movie is talked about alot on the internet i didnt get it though,reality
this what made keanu reeves come back from a tombstone piledriver lets all hope the franchise doesnt end up like dirty harry or die hard everybody says the first one is the best i say third and first i dont know its just me they are trying to paint as a grim reaper everything dies around him and he wears all black i know in this movie he wears a leather jacket but he wears all black but white shirt here and there just my theory,reality
it lacked a lot of character development of the other characters but the action is very satisfying,reality
this franchise is so fun and so stupid at the same time i cant wait for more sequels,reality
i dont know what to say about this movie becoz i love it and keanu reeves as has done a fantastic job to deliver great performance the main issues i have with the movie is its story that has nothing to offer but quiet entertainingthe story is about a retired well known hitman whose is killed by some russian gangsters and he takes the revenge of it becoz that was gifted by his wife to coop up with lonliness after she passed on so he takes the revengethe one thing i like the most about the film is its style and action sequences that looks brtual  intense and realistic involving mostly gun fights the fighting choreography is done very well becoz it is not very chopoy like in other films it is shown in a continuous toneoverall a great popcorn movie to watch for timepass in a free time,reality
simply the start of something amazing is what i always wanted since i watched the matrix its insane action with a simple story,reality
the action shots for are some of the best in cinema with a groundbreaking feeling on parallel to the release of another keanu focused movie the matrix action and fight sequences feel natural and steady none of that shaky cam fake actionthe movie doesnt add any unnecessary padding that doesnt feel necessary to the story however this sometimes plays to its detriment when we see characters come and go that try to show complexity without the time to properly develop them and make us caremy biggest criticism would be in the antagonists character which seems to flip about halfway through the movie for no apparent reason and feels wildly inconsistent in his behaviour and decision makingthis movie reeked of comic book adaptation and its no surprise that a comic book series has been put into motion after the films release it plays off the comic book balance of just enough origin story to grasp the protagonists motives but not too much as to ruin the mystery or close off possible story archs in future titles,reality
is easily the best action film since skyfall i might even like this more than skyfall actually this is better than any of the expendables films even expendables 2 is a badass revenge flick that knows what it is and goes allout with it this film doesnt try to be something it isnt or be overly complicated to try to appease a certain audience this film is really what the film machete shouldve been machete was advertised as an awesome revenge film that brought back classic action films but it really wasnt it tried to be deep and relevant with constant preaching about the border and it really detracted from what the film initially was supposed to be and it was very boring and quite disappointing this film knows what it is and it is really refreshing keanu reeves brings his agame as does all the side cast the action is great and wellchoreographed the villain is badass and humorous at the same timethe character is definitely a badass you dont want to screw with he doesnt talk much and he doesnt need to he lets his actions speak for him and hes merciless he doesnt screw around at all he reminds be a lot of liam neeson in taken this film has a very similar feel to taken for example i like how its basically verses everybody for the most part dafoe helps him out a bit but its mainly john by himself wasting an army of mobsters just like it was liam neeson by himself wipingout a ton of bad guys with no mercy or hesitation there is no pointless loveinterest goofy sidekick or stupid comic relief characters put it its just by himself which is how it should be however i like this film more than taken for a couple reasons that ill get towhats particularly cool about is just the amount of buildup and praise he gets by everyone in the film including the main villain what i like is that all the characters in this film seem to know each other particularly john himself everyone in this film respects andor fears him which makes all the more badass this shows that keanu reeves is great if given the right role many people trash him but i never found him a bad actoranother thing that makes this film awesome is its side characters william dafoe has a smaller role as johns old friend and fellow hitman dafoe is always awesome in any role hes in you can put him in a lame goblin costume straight from the set of power rangers and hell come out awesome the rest of the cast is equally memorable the side characters dont get much time but they make the most of what little they have to do and all of them have presencethe villain viggo is okay i like that him and know each other have worked together before and that viggo has a respect for john and is even quite scared of him the way he describes john in the beginning and his constant uneasiness when he finds out hes back i find quite funny and awesome at the same time he couldve just been a nothing villain that was basically just a punching bag for but he has some pretty badass moments and has a presence to him this is the reason i like this film more than taken in taken the side characters werent very strong and neither were the villains but that is not the case herethe action is great as i said earlier the fights are wellchoreographed and there is hardly any shakycam its rrated so they go allout and it gets bloody the film looks great and has an atmosphere to it the length is just right for the film this is if it was any longer it wouldve felt paddedout as some action film of late haveoverall is a new modern action classic it is definitely worth checkingout if youre into action films,reality
one thing can make you love a pointless movie its the soundtrack,reality
what i likedi liked the stylish color grading and the stylish fantasy of the assassins secret society where assassins are smartly dressed pay for services with standardized gold coins and are shown respect by so many people the music was also quite appropriate for the feel of each scenewhat i didnt likethe plot was simpler than i hoped some plot hooks were set up in the middle of the movie but many of them were resolved in an anticlimactic straightforward way also the fight scenes were too often unintelligible  just rapidfire movements and gunshots meant to show how badass is rather than making me understand the situation and wonder how john will get out of it finally i didnt understand john motivation for his final fight or the reference to a code that was mentioned around that time or why a certain female character agreed to something near the end,reality
great movie filled in with some good action scenes and an intriguing story right from the start of the movie what i liked about this movie is that the action scenes were not long and overdramatic which fit perfectly with the mood and theme of the movie i recommend anyone to watch this movie you wont be disappointed unless your the type of person who likes to watch overdramatic action movies lol,reality
i love how he avenge the puppys death by mobsters who killed him and than he saved another puppy from the animal shelter when he was woundedkeanu was a great choice for this role he plays a hitman with ease but there is always a little spark which he puts into his acting which makes him stand out from the crowdfor an action movie i really like this one my rating 810,reality
so basically goes on an insane killing spree because theon greyjoy stole his car and killed his what follows is a bloody mess with the infamous killing almost everyone except for the random few he spares for some reason of course they end up dead anywayhowever the action is quite entertaining cool cars guns knives explosions blood and cool music if you dont want to think while watching a film give this one a chance,reality
is a movie that has all of the action trademarks that actions fans desire and then some there isnt anything that we havent seen before and its another film that has borrowed heavily from the bourne franchise action sequences shown in quickcuts and fast movements to give the audience the feel of a tense frenetic pacehowever movies like this that truly work have a decent story and their characters are intelligent as well as efficient jason bourne for instance is methodical and hes always five steps ahead of everyone else leon from the professional isnt a smart man generally but hes cold merciless and efficient when he kills as any true killer would be robert mccall also demonstrates tremendous intelligencethere are too many inconsistencies in this film is supposed to be according to his friends and enemies alike the coldest most efficient killing machine around and yet there are too many instances where we quickly begin to doubt the veracity of that claim oh he can kill no doubt but hes not very good at predicting and anticipating whats coming he lacks the intelligence of the abovementioned characters the characterization is inconsistent and filled with too many contradictionssomeone like would never let a female assassin who was trying to kill him live he would have put her down he also would never have been lying on his bed making himself a targethere also is a man who can hit moving targets as easy as pie even effectively shooting them while driving a car and yet hes unable to shoot a running target in a nightclubgetting off about five or six shotsall of them missingalso has a guardian angel who saves him from certain death a couple of times which also lends itself to proving that isnt as bright as he would beif youre going to be a good writer you have to stick to the plot points and abilities of your character contrived plot points show a weakness in your storytelling you have to use your brain to come up with a plausible reason why target was able to elude him this one fails miserablykeanu reeves still cant act his way out of a paper bag he can only deliver lines one way and it just doesnt work most of the time with this character hes most effective when he isnt saying anything when he does talk his lines are said in a way to make them almost laughablestill the movie isnt a complete failure the supporting cast does enough to help keep the film from drowning in its own inconsistenciesas a number of reviewers have stated if you just want mindless action works pretty well if you want action with substance and characters who are more believable then youre better off watching movies with the abovementioned charactersgiven that most viewers today dont care for anything with a good story or characterizations i can see why this film was such a hit,reality
looking through other reviews its apparent that people either love or hate this moviei can see both sides and personally thought the movie was rather poor but it did have some things to appreciate about itlets break it downon a scale of oneten starsstoryscriptplot one star really the story was just a conduit to carry all the action sequences if you came to watch a film that has any plot or something to stimulate the mind or emotionslook elsewherecasting acting four stars nothing absolutely awful but no remarkable performances just overall a flat lifeless story and script that left little room for acting to have any impact or power actors again function as huminod forms for the action sequences to operate incinematography set lighting ten starsheres were the film really avoids being a total flop in my opinion the cinematography was excellent in every way much creative use of color motifs and dramatic lightingvery interesting use of specific color hues in key scenes that coincide with the tone of the story fantastic luxurious sets great chic wardrobe selections almost like the matrix meets wall street the climactic fight sequence in the rain was a visual masterpiecesoundtrack one star heres one part of the movie that really cheapend any artistic value it had going for it the music was just so hokey it felt like it was obnoxiously loud and overbearing intentionally in attempt to leverage the excitement the movie was lackingjust banal and tastelessaction coreography six stars okay so this movie calls its action gun fu the coreography and action was just ok yes it used longer sequences without changing shots and had some very intricate coreographybut there was never any suspense built up or context to support all the action which makes it feel less intenseit all came off as an extended dance routine with lots of headshotsthe fancy gunwork and martial arts would carry greater weight if undergirded by some moticum of a story line or performed by a character that you actually cared aboutwithout the subcontext the movie ends up subjecting the audience to watching an extended sparring match hollow visualsconclusionsimagine the final fight sequence from the first matrix where trinity and neo shoot up the security gate in the lobby while rescuing morpheusnow take that scene and try to make that one scene stretch for a feature length moviewhat you get is john it did have the sense of a comic book in film format the framing choices the lighting selections and the goofy coloredstylized subtitles all were direct stylistic transplant from comic book styleim sure 15 year old boys would love this movie it almost feels like it was made by some 15 year old boys with their daddys budgetin short is a beatifully filmed extended fight coreography performed by humanoid forms with some obnoxious music pumping too loudlyis all about the visual aesthetics to that extent it excellsyou may love it you may hate iti dont regret watching it but wouldnt recommend it as a great film to watch,reality
keanu reeves will always be known for the matrix and this movie reunites him with his stunt double from those films who takes a shot in the directors chair the film basically has 2 directors and one is scheduled to direct deadpool 2 so theres that and since both come from a background of doing stunts from dozens of your favorite action movies this film gets boiled down to its essence they arent going to try wowing you with a special plot no theyre going to deliver highoctane action and really its quite successful keanu did some major training for the highly choreographed scenes and performs most of his own stunts and the result pays off expect a high body count and expect many of them to have some really cool kill shots this film knows its goal is to entertain with cool quick action and thats exactly what it does i will say however one of the best and worst parts comes from the beginning the film honestly almost takes an up approach of giving the audience all the exposition it needs in a small time without much dialogue at all and i love that but italong with just a few action momentsgets heavyhanded like at one point keanu is grabbing all his guns and gearing up and the movie blares a rocking song about guns and killing and it feels a bit too obvious i wasnt going to talk about the plot because well who cares for this film but it leads to my other critique the film gets a nice supporting role from willem dafoe and gives way too little screen time to john leguizamo but the plot gets going after a mob bosss son steals from and leaves him for dead this son iosef is annoyingly stereotypical hes brash arrogant and above all else completely inept he fits the bill of all the stereotypes and it just makes you wonder how long it will take john keanu reeves to hunt him down its been awhile since an action film has had this much style to it it overcomes typical shortcomings by thoroughly delivering in wellexecuted action scenesyou can find this review and dozens of others at gillipediamoviereviewsblogspotcom,reality
critics and audiences around the world raved about what did i think uhm still deciding the film starts off with so many hollywood cliches the flashbacks to tell the back story the rainy weather funeral with black umbrellas yes keanu reeves was perfectly cast as yes the action scenes are nonstop and brutal yes the stunts were awesome yet i still didnt enjoy the film the film has a bodycount of note youd think its a john woo film this is just way too violent for my liking with way too much unnecessary killings sure was out for revenge but this is a very extreme vengeance film i realize he did not go on a killing spree because they took his car and from him the reason for his revenge goes much deeper than that i get it but stilldoes this justify killing over a hundred people although it is never mentioned in the film it is obvious is an exhitman and therefore probably does not have a conscience but i cant help but feel this character goes completely beyond revenge on the contrary it becomes coldblooded murder instead also i understand was one of the best hitman but is it possible that he can outwit and dodge so many hitmen in the club if this is the case this organisation seriously need new hitmenthe film also features the no gun ending fight scene seriously hollywood this is so cliched and annoying if viggo michael nyqvist the crime boss wanted john dead why didnt he just shoot him why would a man in his sixties opt for a fist fight with someone as highly trained as instead of just shooting him this scene was not credible at all is it a film id watch again nope i must mention i absolutely loved the soundtrack,reality
had this been a vehicle for a more established actor an older actor as had been initially intended i imagine it would have been assigned to someone like willis or stallone and become yet another forgettable effort lost in the twilight of their careers its not that theres anything wrong with either bruce or sly its just that theyve made an unfortunate number of mediocre films in recent years in an effort to keep themselves relevant willis recent death wish folly is an example of a film that shouldnt have been made and yet he seems all too eager to make this ripoff of an altogether superior bronson film indeed hollywood in general has developed an industry of unintelligent one dimensional action films most of which are lack lustre remakes and  through the miracle of marketing  have made them disproportionately successful the golden era which produced dirty harry rambo first blood andterminators 1 and 2 appeared a distant memory in the wake of the cranks average expendables sequels and the never ending stream of the fast and the furious films all hope seemed lost for a decent action film which had both entertaining action sequences and some measure of intelligence applied in its creationenter john the film weighs an apparently simplistic revenge plot against a counter balance of ironic black humour stylish cinematography exceptional fight choreography and a star who approaches the eopnymous charcater as though he were performing in a serious dramatic role keanu reeves class adds credibilty an sympathy to a character that wuld have appeared predictable and dull had some action hasbeen been cast he invokes the quiet underplayed menace of bronson in his best roles while also injecting a wry sense of locaonic witoverall i diodnt expect to enjoy this move as much as i did previously ive found reeves earlier catalogue to be a litle trying but since the matrix he appears to have evolved into an altogether different class of actor he brings the method intensity of a younger de niro to roles which other actors would consider throwaway action stereotypes and would only play them as such reeves is both terrifying in his capability for violent retribution and also tragic in his isolation and grief something which surely cannot be said for bruce willis paul kersey rip off so if anyone is on the fence sit down and hit play on netflix uk i cant vouch for other regions i was expecting as ive said numerous times a dull and overhyped revenge flick what i watched might just be a modern masterpiece in this genre both in its narrative simplicity and artistic approach and i find it hard to faultwatch it,reality
is a great action film the kind of which are rarely made today it is r rated but not frenzied like most action films you know who is killing who and more importantly why this no holds barred action film is an example in execution keanu reeves is at home in an action film and once again proves that he can do stunts as good as any actor out there even though he is well in his 50s theres not much to write about because there isnt much of a narrative but boy is it totally worth it just go watch john ,reality
not only does 2014 feature fantastic action thats tightly choreographed and cleanly shot it also has a tight story that doesnt rely too heavily on exposition and manages to create a unique world that feels tangible a lot of people talk about it as if the action excuses the story as if it is a guilty pleasure or only good because of its aboveaverage  phenomenal id say  fight sequences but thats actually not the case here this isnt simply about a man who kills some people because they kill his no it is much deeper than that with a tangible connection to the characters and solid reasoning behind everything they do and just because the story is simple doesnt make it any less compelling or wellcrafted the film is truly fun somewhat selfaware but also serious enough to be properly impactful and wholly engaging youll be smiling throughout at both the breathless action and the effortless craftsmanship of narrative keanu reaves and michael nyqvist are both fantastic in the piece two sides of the same coin and the way that the latter is used to build this ominous legend around the former is almost genius the flick also offers glimpses into an interesting and fully formed world but never lets that detract from its beating heart either i truly believe this is a near masterpiece a marvel of modern cinema that distils its story to its most basic of elements and is all the more effective because of it one of my favourite action films of all time 910,reality
254this is a very good friday night flick youre home from work and its time to watch a movie you dont want it to make you think you just want good acting lighting direction and cinematics and no expenses on the plot for that kind of night this is a spectacular choicefirst off its not at all that the plot is halfbaked there was no waste of paper writing this script in the plot comes in a halfportion it is very simple and straightforward in an intriguing way an oppressed exassassin is coping with the shame of his pastactions and the recent death of his wife the last thing his wife gives him is a puppy when the foolish son of his old crimeboss breaks into his house kills the puppy and takes off in mustangwell i think im backon another note the actors really fit into their roles keanu reeves who is a veteran in stylized action subgenre really rocks in much the same fashion he did neo in the matrix 1999 this time though he takes on a much more cold themaninblack type persona a man of few words the action sequences are quick flashy and all produce the same end result it can get a tad monotonous after a while but in the end it conveys as a character more it shows that a broken man who has everything taken from him will have the most incentive to get to what he wants alfie allen although his character is never able to be presented in a likable preforms his immature young adult criminal another very sublime detail that you might not pick up on is that the mob is very talky profane and excersises little patience yet is a thinker is a character you can truly root for in his conquest to avenge his anguishcinematography proves another segway to the movies stunning fluidity toward the beginning sela exaggerates very dark shades of black and airy shades of white giving the movie a very docile and harmless feel as the plot unravels you see the development of heavy greys kick in and as the action sequences commence neon and black become the dominant themes it makes for a very tidy feature with slick fight sequencesanother item not usually found in this particular genre a good balance of everything from an editing standpoint right down to the acting i was pleasantly suprised that had the delivery that its predecessors seldom did,reality
its not so much i hate action movies but the action movies of this decade all seemed pretty holierthanthou where both the protagonist and antagonist are absolutely horrible peopleinstitutions but the protagonist tries to act like theyre so much better than the antagonist and poor them because the antagonist tried to get revenge on them for something started by the protagonist and results in my being bored to tearsthis one is how action movies used to be before they went to shit in 20032004 timeits your typical someone getting revenge on someone action movie it doesnt make to be some holierthanthou morally superior character hes knock for being a hitman so good he once killed 3 men in a bar with a pen and someone you need to fear so when iosef steals his car and kills his doll his dad is freaking out do you know whose car you stole and whose you killed knowing that for sure is going to come kill iosef out of revenge and like any halfdecent father he wants to protect his son so offers a high prize to other hitmen to kill before he kills iosef and then the hour of gunshots go offi was going to rate this movie a 7 because if i were to gauge my entertainment on a scale of 110 it wouldve been a 7 but i raised it to an 8 because this is one 5 action movies from this decade that didnt bore me to tears and 3 of the other 4 that didnt bore me to tears were from foreign films,reality
ive always known and liked reeves but this character really made him something more while the storyline isnt all that original its certainly done in a enjoyable way the action is top notch top 3 best action movies ive seen each character is played very well by each actor interesting setting and back story if you want something that is a straight up action yet offers a little more this is it,reality
holy crap keanu reeves is a boss i always thought of him as an okay actor mostly because of the way he delivers lines but here it really works the story is simple but effective and you understand john motivations the action and stunts are amazing theyre some of the best fight scenes ive ever seen on screen and the best part is that you can see the action no quick cuts or shaky cam nonsense the action is clear and brutal best action scene in the whole movie is the night club scene this is an action movie lovers wet dream only nitpick i have with this is that the end fight scene is a little standard and clichd but its a small gripe the movie is still amazing its a must see and is one of the best action movies of the 2010s,reality
an action film staring keanu reeves playing a character named john better than what everyone thought it would bethe action is incredible and its very obvious how much training keanu was doing in order to show the amount of skill that this character shows and is implied to have even the supporting actors have went through some level of training in order to portray their characters skill level in their professionone criticism id have is that ms perkin seems a little dumb having the balls to break the established hotel rule of no business being conducted in the hotel and it is shown that they hold up on that punishment so even if she did manage to finish off how was she thinking of getting away with that another thing is that he personally hires marcus to assassinate john a character who is shown right in the beginning to have a friendly conversation with john implying they know each other and are probably friends did he really expect him not to go against viggos orders and even help the man he was best not to even tell marcus perhaps even try to keep him in the dark about the whole thingdespite that is still quite a lot of fun to watch and if you like realistic choreographed action then youre gonna love this movie and its sequel,reality
lots of gunfire lots of whirling car rides lots of violence lots of bloodand lots of fun one should shudder at the thought of all of the frequent bodies flying across the screen but here it amounts to a roller coaster ride of vengeance and retribution keanu reeves handles this kind of chore easily although one of these days he should have the chance to show his skillful acting range damn he has played hamlet other shakespearean works and sturdy drama and comedy nonetheless zooms along with the speed of bullets flooding the screen and the direction and editing and cinematography are all of the highest order,reality
keanu reeves cant act to save his life but that doesnt mean hes not fun to watch and showcases exactly why we love watching him similar to arnold schwarzenegger during the 80s and 90s keanu reeves has screen presence and his monotonous acting style fits a singular purpose his talent isnt in delivering poetic dialogue but rather to display simple visceral emotion and the physicality that comes with it in his role as a killer committed to vengeance suits his style perfectlythe movie itself is straightforward with plenty of action you dont need to try to hard to suspend belief but just enjoy the ride so enjoy it,reality
this movie provides excellent action there is always thrill and some background is given about his wife he is a extremely gentle man and we only find out his capabilities after a while i enjoyed this movie but i am not exactly the biggest action fan and therefore i could be a little biased,reality
keanu reeves makes a very welcomed return to the spotlight in this amazing action film backed up with a bunch of great actors were introduced to a very interesting hitman type of underworld and a what feels like a throwback to the 80s style of action films minus all the unnecessarily large explosions and awkwardly placed sex scenes some very impressive action scenes decent comedy a good plot fitting soundtrack and a very appreciated backstory made for a great ride beyond that its hard to find negative things about this film the only bad thing i can really say is the villains felt very generic and boring very forgettable bottom line this is a film id highly recommend,reality
movie reviewis an excellent no nonsense action thriller film with visually stunning stylish theme solid gripping performance by keanu reeves and emotional character depth the tone and vibe of the movie is dark and intense with very interesting character moments keanu reeves has delivered one of his best and top notch performance in the filmthe direction and the directing style of the film is great the film is great in regards to its simple story plot and the well executed action sequence the film is little bit slow in dramatic sequences in the end all over is one hell of an entertaining and amazing film and a much better action filmplease note that this review represent only my professional point of view and my personal honest opinion about the film and does not represent others thank you,reality
is one of the best action movies of the decade he surprised me a lot keanu reeves who was a little lost in the movies came back with everything in this great action movie the script is well clich several things that repeat of other films but this is not a bad movie its directed by david leitch and chad stahelski and they both know how to direct action scenes which are the best things in the film the film is violent and john which is a very cool character the rest of the cast is competent michael nyqvist alfie allen adrianne palick willem dafoe and etc all do their role well is a great film even with problems in the script and many weak dialogues the action scenes are excellent and make it one of the best films of the decade note 84,reality
is a very decent action movie starring keano reeves as who is a highly skilled assassin he receives a in the mail which is a bit strange i mean the just gets delivered to him by mail from his dead wife straight after her funeral some russianamerican guy called iosef tarasov played by theon greyjoy out of game of thrones decided he likes car and steals it then kills the dogthen the sht hits the fan to start off this movie has a very simple plot with no interesting twists or turns in it at all the main focus of this movie is to show killing lots of people with no real mercy shown this is purely a revenge movie in the simplest form while the plot is simple this does not make it a bad movie at all reeves plays an action hero really well when the character does not have a huge amount of depth to him the other characters as well are pretty basic and can be boiled down to simple motives for each of them wants vengeance for his which was special to him because it was given to him by his dead wife iosef tarasov is wants to be a gangster because his farther is a gangster and so takes what he wants because he thinks thats what gangsters do to get respect iosefs farther viggo wants to stay alive and make lots of money like mob bosses always want to do and his son keeps fuing it up i loved the bit where viggo just found out his son stole john car and killed his just that moment of you dont understand who you messed with was very entertaining i also really enjoyed all of the scenes with the hotel receptionist in as he was so matter of fact when would turn up to the hotel which is sort of like a safe house for hit men and criminals in the film all bloody and wounded from killing gangsters he did not bat an eye and would just asked if he needed assistanceokay so the action scenes were very well done whoever choreographed the fight scene in the club and house knew what he was doing for sure while there were lots of talking that did not really progress the plot the action scenes made up for this easily the camera work was good as i did not see any of that wobbly camera thing you see in all bad action movies nothing worse than an action scene where you cant see the action because of excessive camera movement the drone shots of the new york skyline were interesting to see at night as wellthe film is well edited and the pacing is very fast as you would expect from an action film does not get bogged down with overexplaining plot point that dont need explaining the soundtrack was okay in the same way elevator music is okay it does not bother anyone and you do not notice it too much just generic action movie score nothing to get excited over this film is worth checking out for the action scenes which are competent and simple plot points make it an easy watch the reason for the rating was that this film is just thatsimple now there is nothing wrong with simple but i like my movies to have a little bit more substance and complexity look at die hard and you will see what i mean this film had no hans grubber at all but it was entertaining and that is really the least we can all ask from movies,reality
is a great movie with great action sadly the lack of context and lack of soundtrack in the beginning makes it a little bit boring and doesnt give the viewer the feeling it intents to and the ending felt a little bit rushed johns revenge on viggo and his son wasnt epic something that a lot of people expected but from every other aspect the movie was great and since it was the 1st chapter these things are forgivable,reality
keanu reeves is a very under rated action star as this movie clearly shows ok he isnt the bet actor in the world and has a very limited range of emotion but for this movie he was perfectthe story is a good one and yes it has holes in the plot but you dont watch this kind of movie as if it is a work of artkeanu sure can carry off the action and is very convincing there are inconsistencies in his ability and it does stretch credibility that he can take severe beatings that then have no affect or even markings on him but this is more of a cartoonish action movie than one you watch for realism i did think it was overly violent in places and dont watch this is bad language offends you because there are places where it gets over usedover all it is a good action movie that those who like this stuff will love,reality
is great low cost action film which which strong fights sense thorough out the film which keanu reeves best films since the matrix i think the story it little bit lacking but this not driving by the the stories narrative the start of the film which starts showing him at the his lowest point with the wife pasting always which his wife gave him a to keep her companies when the group people which what his car they decided to steel it from which previous life turn out to be exhitman comes out of retirement to track down the gangsters that took away everything form him the action sense great change the action fight sense back to simple form which thew cut not like the other film such as film like taken and marvel films which too much cut between each simple fight sense it best action pack in 2014,reality
i really liked this film and was really not expecting to whenever keanu reeves dons a beard he turns into this believable bad ass that is fun to watch while i dont think the character of had really any amazing handtohand fighting skills his real skill was the point blank range shot no hesitation just one after another killed by his skill for doing this it was quite brutal ill be honest but nonetheless very effective theon greyjoy was unrecognizable at first as the snotty son who thought he could get away with killing i loved the whole hotelsafehouse aspect of the story that was pretty cool i havent seen the sequel yet but ive been told its better than the first one so im looking forward to seeing it soonoverall i would recommend this movie to action lovers for sure and maybe those who are looking for a good action movie because there hasnt been a good one in quite a while it seems,reality
this is a good watch if you are into some mindless action it really justifies keanus acting potential in style with the matrix movies the movie has a decent plot although easy to figure out some lovable characters especially willems however as a swede i simply cannot get over the fact that even though michael does a decent job with the acting his accent destroys the credibility of his role the dialect and accent is so obviously from a scandinavian country and not near how russians speak having learned the english language later in life i cannot comment on the actual russian dialect itself but the english is way off its too bad really he shouldve gotten help with a language coach to hit off that accent its easy for us swedes to learn english however when done this poorly it just becomes a botherall in all 710 fruit loops,reality
was perfect it built a world so quickly and i was invested almost immediately with john it was shot perfectly every action scene was a blast to watch and i could tell what was going on at all times all of the acting was spot on not a bad performance from any of the actors the soundtrack was good but there was not much music during fighting which i liked a lot it helped me focus on the action more overall i felt like this movie was perfect it delivered on so many levels and now i just want more everything about it i loved and i hope we see some more of in the future also there were some characters i really was curious about willem dafoes left me just wanting more and not less that is the sign of a truly great film,reality

ok many are attempting to show this as the return of keanu reeves im sorry to say this is not true keanu reeves never went anywhere and if you want to see a recent film with him that you would enjoy a lot more watch man of tai chi this film is weak story wise as well as direction it seems the director has watched many michael mann movies but still failed on many levels it seems there were russians involved in the film but were incapable of finding proper russian actors this film is a average 45 stars out of 10 im just annoyed that it was all hypefluff but no substance this is pissing me off looking at the imdb reviews it seems there is a campaign to make this film look better then it actually isthe storyline is full of holes is the man they call when you want to get rid of the bogeyman i mean that is how much of a bad ass he is assassinsmafia donsetc are supposedly afraid due to his amazing killing skills so when 3 incompetent masked russian gangsters break into his house kill his puppy and beat the crap out of him wait for it to nicksteal his car you wonder what sort of super hitman is this who doesnt even have a decent alarm system or the capabilities to defend himself later on in the same house 10 well armed supposedly less incompetent gangsters break into his house again and he kills them all without too much hassle so what gives you are either a badass or a pussy not sure what the story writers were thinking off there are other scenesbath house where he could have easily killed off the guy who nicked his car and the film would have finished within the first hour but for some reason misses this guy but everyone else in the bathhouse is deadanyway if you have to watch this do it with very low expectations you might enjoy it then this is one of keanus weaker movies i would rate the bill  teds adventures above this one,reality
punisher meets the expendablesif you were engaged by the dialog in the expendables and liked its character development then this might be the right movie for you its a classic revenge movie like punisher or any steven seagal movie of your choiceit is a classic revenge movie with nonstop action where most of the effort went into the action scenes not surprisingly both directors have been stunt coordinators since the beginning of the 90s and this is their first time directing a moviecheck out this movie if youre looking to switch off your mind for a couple of hours and dont mind repeating action scenes,reality
you have to watch this film knowing that its makers wanted to pay homage to manga old style samurai movies and directors like john woo everything is ordered like something in a japanese film there is a code for everything a way to do things that has to be followed that is why when the action starts and there are some obvious shortcuts to everything people dont take them i am pretty sure somewhere there is a japanese samurai script or manga that they adapted and the original characters did everything with swordsthe choreography is decent with keanu doing a combination of matrix and equilibrium moves that finally are not all in slow motion the basic plot is that his character gets angry and starts killing people and then the film ends if you dont appreciate the style then the film will be wasted on youthat being said i have to say that i think the film was not that good it was not bad but there were opportunities missed to make it truly unique and memorable as such one enjoys the actions scenes then forgets the movie one of these opportunities was to use the amazing cast they had forget that bridget moynahan had only a few scenes in some flashbacks and that sexy adrianne palicki was completely underexposed but actors the like of willem dafoe and john leguizamo should have been the bread and butter of the film instead they were relegated to minimal supporting rolesunexpectedly for the film but totally expected of the actor the best action scenes where those involving daniel bernhardt who moved with the same grace and precision that he had when he did all those martial arts films in his youth he was so good that it just showed he could have kicked keanus behind any time he wanted toanother opportunity was a detailing of glory days instead we are treated with a monologue vaguely explaining how awesome and efficient was when he was a contract killer really he wasnt that way in the film keanu played his usual silent brooding self but at least in one scene the one where he shouts at viggo to give him the son he shows the potential that was lost in writing his characterbottom line a rather average action flick feeling more like a video game than a samurai movie instead of minutes and minutes of nameless minions being killed a strong contouring of the characters at least of the main ones would have been a lot more effective like many others i am sure i was attracted to see the movie by the cast which was unfortunately underutilized,reality
i gave this movie 3 stars for keany reeves acting shootingfighting scenes and camera work other than that dont they have some russian expats in hollywood i know there is large russian community in la why them hollywood managers wont hire at least one russian to sort out all dialogs it really looks hilarious when russian mob boss mumbles something incomprehensible to his idiot son and than switches to perfect english in the middle of a phrase there were a lot more examples but ill stop here english is not my 1st language but i can tell you russian dialogs in this movie are freakin hilarious it is sad that otherwise good movie was screwed up by inept and ignorant hollywood bosses the scrips is kind of weak too but it was said enough about it here so ill save your time overall enjoyed it watching in a gym while running on elliptic machine perhaps thats what this film is good for but i wouldnt pay for this thanks to torrent sites,reality
is one of the best action movies to come out this year and possibly one of the best of this entire decade now dont go into it expecting a best picture nominee but go into it expecting keanu reeves to kick some serious ass and you wont be disappointed is it predictable in parts yes is there some cheesy dialogue yes does that hurt the movie not at all its exciting exhilarating stylish incredibly violent and deserves to be seen multiple times in the theater i cannot recommend this movie enough also if you dont have a that might change quickly after seeing this movie,reality
another day another review in the case of theres a really short version dont botherkeanu reeves is a recently bereaved man whose wife helen bridget moynahan kindly inexplicably managed to replace herself with a perfectly timed puppy so that john wont be lonely he also owns a car shortly after burying his wife john takes his and fills up his car at the gas station where he attracts the attention of thug iosef tarasov alfie allen recently seen in plastic iosef wants the car john doesnt want to sell it iosef resolves the issue that night by rearranging johns face killing the and stealing the car needless to say john is a little narked and phones up iosefs dad viggo michael nyqvist to complain the thing is is a retired hitman and allround killing machinecould have been resolved painlessly in five minutes your son killed my and now i want to kill him if you dont let me ill kill everybody you employ everybody you know and every inanimate object you own okay hell be home in half an hour come on overno such luckit starts slowly stutters and plummets thereafteris the type of film that gives credibility to the opinion that keanu reeves stinks on the big screen it isnt right sometimes it isnt fair but in this instance it is fairly accurate in reality reeves is the second best thing after the in this tedious hamfisted mess that attempts to be a thriller but i suspect there is more to it than that he isnt awful he just doesnt appear to be trying he gives every impression of gritting his teeth and taking the money before he wanders back into the safe obscurity of the horizon he looks bored and i suspect hes fulfilling a favour and hoping he escapes in tactis the directorial debut of both chad stahelski stunt coordinator and reeves double on constantine the matrix films the replacements point break and an uncredited david leitch who happened to be a stuntman on constantine and matrix revolutions either this is one hell of a favour or keanu reeves lost big time on the betweenthescenes poker marathonsas we found with the interview and this is the end having two directors doesnt mean the film is going to be twice as good is proof again that if one director cant make it work a second director only serves to shoulder the blame stahelski and leitch have hired a goon to write this mess and have then proceeded to direct it in the same manner ie in block capitals and armed with wax crayonsscattered throughout are subtitles that float across the screen no bad thing with random words picked out in block capitals to give the impression of the speakers shouting random words whenever they feel like it very bad thing indeed im just going to gloss over the needlessly capitalized words sprinkled through themthe performances in are frequently painfully wooden and from a cast that also either owed favours willem dafoe or were cheap the rest it plods lines are repeated and the costume design clearly consisted of shopping everyone is wearing brand new clothes contains some fine action sequences in which keanu reeves swings a variety of weapons with maximum effect but when there is complete reliance on blood spatter and gunfire and a complete oversight when it comes to script direction performance logic and reason no matter how good your star is your film is in serious troubleto refer to my original statement there is a slightly longer short version dont waste your time money or breath watching thinking or talking about john for more reviews from the squiss subscribe to my blog and like the facebook page,reality
these people giving it less than 4 stars have no idea what makes an action film this was a near flawless action film with original sequences a great cast powerful scenes and a trip back to a noir theme an underground culture of economy and honor among killers that seemed to die out in the action films of the 80s the closest to this was maybe ronin from 1998 the camera work was phenomenal and dialog above passable when you have a movie audience sobbing and cheering you have a good emotional grasp of the material this film achieved art i really appreciated the wide open plot continuation possibility but sometimes great films are just left to stand alone,reality
maybe it was just me but i felt it was the same old movie with the recycled plots about a trained assassin who used to work for the agency enjoying retirement until someone makes him mad and he comes out of retirement this movie had no plot and the action was mindless just killing everyone maybe there should have been a better reason for the revenge i enjoyed the scenes with daisy however was sad at how that ended up i like keanu reeves  willem defoe which was the reason why i went to see it if you enjoy violent shoot em up blood  guts movies then this movie is for you there were some scenes that took place at the hotel with mr interaction with a few gentlemen that made me chuckle but all in all i didnt enjoy it,reality
for all of the movies ive seen since my last imdb review most of which have been good to great i have no idea why im bothering to review this movie other than to say that it was really bad in nearly every way the movie was corporate box office crap of the worst kind nothing more than famous actors playing typecast roles reciting reused dialog rehashed drama and fight scenes that were better and more interesting in other films totally unoriginal the only character that gave me any pleasure was the dogof course i know stupid people here give it 10 stars because to them a movie is either 1 star bad or 10 stars fckin awesome but ill give it one extra star only for the dog,reality
when you watch a lot of action films you get to the point where you can write the plot if youre a really good writer you can write interesting genre pieces if you are a hack tired tales come out  bob the explumbers chance at reforming his life is challenged when a crazed irs section chief kidnaps bobs wife and kids officer walker gets his shot at the case to end all cases when kermit the alien invades the small town of wyoming mi to impregnate all the prostitutesthis is the curse of the story of keanu reeves stars as an exsuper hitman who pursues a vendetta against his former boss son for killing dogthe line is a running joke that falls flat each time its spoken people cant believe that would do all the killing he does in the movie over a im not certain if the filmmakers want us to laugh over it too its not a well constructed statement like snake plisken i thought you were dead nor is it ironic enough but they keep putting it out therethats the film in a nutshell its a weak story highlighted with subpar craftsmanshipfor action the film takes the ak47 route a lot of people get shotin the head which makes for great blood origami murals by the way if all these people die in these types of films how do we have massive overcrowding on the planet there are six mass killing scenes one at residence one in a dance club one in a church two in abandoned buildings and the finalthere is not much to distinguish one from the other most of that has to do with the script from derek kolstad but chad stahelskis direction wasnt any better in the scene at the church there is a secret stash its a scene that begs for suspense tension and thrills there are none there is some shooting some primping and some fbombs in a scene that many writers and directors would do their best to show off their talents they do the minimum to advance the plotkeanu reeves is a mystery before the matrix he displayed an ease with slipping into the parts that came his way now he cant seem to flesh them out fully for the big screen there was no empathy established for john character and there is no moment where reeves connects with the audience as he once could do with the drop of a whoa maybe he has to go through the bottom barrels to rediscover his talent i hope he gets it back soon,reality
is most likely the most realistic fast paced bloody and insane action movie ever made despite some scenes taking you out of the moment was a good surprise with a fantastic pay off it feels so original and fresh that you instantly get into all the fast actions sequences and the story unlike most in its genre is quite great and easy to followwhilst isnt quite perfect it adds all the ingredients for it to be the best action movie ever made it almost pulls off the impossible but a few touch ups here and there would have made this film one for the ages,reality
now youre truly getting on my the boldest and ballsiest shoot them up film discharged in years with a straightforward reason an implicit mythology thus numerous severe headshot kills that you need to ponder whether john whole preparing has been spent mastering call of duty this film conveys more than only 101 minutes of extraordinary activity it gives the makings of a welcome crisp establishment numerous will view it as something of an arrival to shape for keanu reeves and it is reasonable to consider it such however simply because  critically  he isnt obliged to really act that far out of his customary range of familiarity as a previous hitman lamenting his wifes passing is a man who is sincerely cut off and after that when russian hooligans break into his home to take his sweet ride thrashing him in the process and slaughtering the puppy that his wife purchased for him from past the grave returns back to his old methods for being a stonecool executioner in any case we win on the grounds that reeves is obliged to do small emoting other than the odd cry at an opportune time indeed its telling that the couple of minutes where eyebrows get raised are the point at which the film is by all accounts considering itself excessively important and these generally happen when gets truly irate and reeves winds up wrath snarling like bales batman attempting to make himself really inhale fire more to the point however executives chad stahelski and david leitch the last setting off uncredited because of a dga question know how to arrange marvelous activity setpieces which joyfully make up around 80 of the film with over 20 years of motion picture trick work under each of their profession belts stahelski and leitch plainly know how to make the best of their projectile ridden beats conveying smooth quick paced scenes of all around made executioner confusion the majority of this makes for a consummately serviceable requital thriller a death wish return to a type that feels decades old in any case just to go that additional mile is raised to date with a key component required for any film to be effective in this day and age it feels like a comicbook adjustment as the film advances it is set up that not just does have a close superpowered level of capability in terms of executing individuals however there is a whole system of hit men and hitwomen who keep a set up code of honor arrangement in a unique money and even have their own place of refuge  an inn oversaw by the unshakable lance reddick who caters for his visitors requirements with balance and selfcontrol its not until you achieve past the films midpoint that you understand this is yet another motion picture that has made its own universe to investigate an increased reality with heaps of potential for future spinoffs all of which may make you feign exacerbation all things considered who needs another establishment with another verse to be wrung dry its difficult to gripe however when is such a smaller punchy film without an ounce of fat on it in this first motion picture of a mooted set of three theres no space for over saturation of the idea or for cushioning out with hybrid references and referrals its only a short sharp projectile driven bulldozer of a motion picture that snaps necks and smothers brains whats more if that isnt sufficient for you go rewatch the lake house or something,reality
the scenes that are seen in the trailer pale in comparison with what this movie has to offer actionwisekeanu reeves is once again proving that he can still be a total bad ass while also showing grief anger sorrow and love in the same movie basically the movie is about an ex hitman who gets crossed by the son of an old russian business partner and the story of said hitman getting back whats been taken from himwe have a good performance delivery by michael nyqvist who even if being predictable at times manages to get on everybodys nerves with his proverbs including keanus character nonetheless the antagonism is pretty well built in my opinion dont expect too much drama the story line is very simple and blunt yet expect plenty of hurting and headshots,reality
one never tends to expect much from a movie staring keanu reeves why im not sure i think he does just fine and im usually entertained but thats just me this movie is well if you abhor violence this movie is not for you i dont like violence for no reason but the violence in this movie is the reason for the movie its fast its justified bear with me and its amazingothers have given plot summaries but it seems almost required so former hit man goes for revenge on the scumbag gangsters who wronged him and as it happens he has a connection with them ok thats over withnot since shoot em up has a movie been solely about the violence and not since shoot em up has it been done so well even the faint of heart could enjoy this movie and trust me i know people who cringe at violence in movies my wife is the prime example and yet you get lost in the action its nonstop the few breaks between fights and shootings are seemingly filler but necessary filleri had heard great things but once i watched it today i was very impressed how do you root for a bad guy well when hes killing worse guys how can you not root for him and yeah he kills a lot of themalso displays a certain charm not a 007 type of charm but an all business charm he will never mess with you if youre not a part of his business is that ethics sure why not hes not flamboyant hes not over the top hes all business yet very civil very refined and decentunless you are his businessi was far more impressed than i expected and i did expect to be impressed if you dont like violence dont see this if you dont mind violence so long as it has a purpose and moves the story youll love this if you love violence seek help and soon youre potentially dangerous,reality
slick stupid senseless action entertainment stars keanu reeves in the title role is a former assassin whose wife helen bridget moynahan in a thankless role dies from an unspecified disease the lonely and distraught receives a final present from her one night a beagle puppy named daisy soon russian creeps led by the infantile iosef alfie allen break into his home steal his car and beat daisy to death now has nothing left to live for but revenge and he goes after the russian mob  his old employers  with a ferocious tenacitythis viewer felt about as bad as he could for mr given that the characters  all of them really  are thinly written while it provides some visceral joy watching this force of nature unleash his fury on a nonstop parade of thoroughly expendable action movie villains theres not that much humanity the guy wades through henchmen so quickly that he turns into the kind of superhero too often seen in this genre fortunately he does take some lumps before this is over and at one point it looks as if it might be curtains for himthere is a ton of violence and a ton of digital splatter although not very much that would be likely to seriously gross out some viewers the pacing is definitely of a very deliberate variety until the story  such as it is  begins to take off while all of this is mildly amusing doesnt really do anything that we havent seen before in scores of actionrevenge sagaskeanu is once again a figure in minimalist acting in his one attempt to truly emote he does his best but hes still not that convincing ian mcshane and john leguizamo are thoroughly wasted in cameo roles willem dafoe gets a little more to do swedish star michael nyqvist offers some fun as the mob boss allen is such a weasel that he cant die soon enough adrianne palicki like nyqvist is entertaining enough as a persistent would be hit woman other familiar faces include lance reddick dean winters daniel bernhardt randall duk kim clarke peters kevin nash and the always welcome if much too briefly seen david patrick kelly as the leader of a team that cleans up peoples messesis an agreeable enough but also forgettable way to kill 102 minutessix out of 10,reality
when chad the director and eva longoria the producer got together to make this movie the result looks like a 1000 dollar youtubechannel video the script is very bad the filming is terrible i cannot believe the imdb score really is above 7 without foul play at hand stay away and never spend money on this filmthis actionmovie is mindnumbing with so many flaws throughout that you are happy to have numb mind so the idiotic moments feels less painful i would be surprised if not most actors in this movie is a tad embarrassed to have this in their filmographyi give this 3 out of 10 but you can add 1 score per year below 16 that you are when viewing this,reality
2014 is the actionthriller directed by chad stahelski about the aforementioned retired hit man played by keanu reeves returning back to the underbelly after a bunch of wellconnected punks decide to mess with the wrong guy on the wrong day steal his car and do something else unmentionable whoa keanu vengeful returns usually end ugly with blood spilling all over the place is no different with revenge as the cornerstone the directors andor lionsgate knows you want an action franchise film so theres a crap tonne of action that seems to seamlessly end and begin with gusto cool subtitles colorful unique and enhanced the viewing experience without ruining the momentum of the fight scenes everything is shallow who is besides a mourning expert super assassin with a quench for vengeance but more importantly why is ryan oreilly dean winters from the superb tv show oz even doing there i still dont know shallow pfft who cares its better this way you see badguys and assassins like to hang together in their own bars and hotels away from the general population when goes back into the assassin world leaving the real one behind this separation of the two worlds permits us to be entirely immersed in john murderous mission better to avoid pesky thoughts of the potential for innocent bystanders,reality
i went to see this movie expecting it to be just another dumb plot less action movie starring keanu reeves boy was i wronghardly has any storyline any character development needless background or misplaced drama not too much eye candy or any kind of unnecessary love story or super hot blond love interest what offers is action action and more action and considering all that you have every right to call this movie just another dumb plotless action movie starring keanu reeves but despite all that  this movie was an hour and a half of pure entertainment the low expectation you have when you walk in the theater to see are immediately justified you get a brainless action movie with no special effects whatsoever except for the gallons of blood a lot of guns and shoot outs  and an unrealistic fear of one single dude also the badass soundtrack that really adds a specific feeling to this movie was not too long or too short  it was the perfect length for what its supposed to be if youre expecting to see the best motion picture of the year well this movie is not for you but if youre looking for an hour and a half of amusement and fun go see this movie you will absolutely adore every second of it,reality
where to start im so baffled the title says it all im hoping that this movie is based on a comic book character because the events that took place in the movie are so ludicrous and clichd that realism flies right out of the window about after 15 minute mark its starts with a basic plot for this type of movie some rough boy has lost his wife and hes trying to live a normal life after awhile some random bad guys appear to the scene out of thin air for no reason these bad guys want to steal our heros ancient ford which is constantly being glorified throughout the film and they end up taking it and killing the poor guys in the process up to this point i really was on keanus side for all things considered then the movie really starts going crazy so you dont need your brains anymore of course the guy now starts seeking revenge for them taking his beloved ford and killing his puppy he owned about 24 hours soon we get to see that keanu is some kind of retired super invincible contract killer that can take masses of bad guys out with a snap of his finger the movies story is basically about a man who wants to revenge to those evil foreign well of course bastards who killed his puppy thats it im not kiddingokay this movie could be cool and very entertaining action flick because of loads of goodgreat actors like willem dafoe and the guy from game of thrones who gets the torture treatment cinematography is great lots of gun fights and kung fu fights and whatnot but the plot is so damn juvenile and videogamish that i 30something just couldnt take it ill give an example 20 or so fully armed and trained killers arrive at keanus house in the middle of the night he kills them all with little effort like in steven seagal movies taking only scratch to his head you need to have superpowers to survive that situation in another scene keanu enters bad guys nightclub which is full of trained and armed guards waiting him to arrive that doesnt stop him waltzing trough the building and pretty much dodging all the punches and bullets aimed at him only one cool guy with a scar of course manages to put even a little fight against our hero that was the best moment because i really was rooting for the bad guys this time senseless slaughtering goes on and on while bodycount keeps growing there was actually a scene where they showed a van full of wrapped up bodies our hero was able to kill at this first level of his cool rock music plays loud at the background while keanu keeps slicing and dicing the bad guys like some marvel superhero i would be ok if this was superman or batman but it isnt all this coolness is added with very visible product placements from apple and ford mainly which almost made me puke the plot is like straight from some videogame like splinter cell or metal gear solid i think even they have better story than this one this basic revenge type of movie plot is just so overdone already and surely adds nothing new to the genre should i say the movie lacks soul i managed to watch it one hour and that was it i like action movies but this was just too over the top for me thank you i could predict pretty much everything that was going to happen on screenif you like videogame style violence and steven seagal style high bodycount action with a script thats lacking any intelligence or realism this movie is definitely for you,reality
ive never understood why people summarize movies in their reviews bores me to tearsanyway i loved this keanu does a good job and hes believably deadly thought the man of the match went to michael nyqvist though  without his solid performance it could have been drivelwasnt sure about the way the russian language was subtitled but hey trying new things can lead to interesting innovationi dont really know what else to say  it was just really cool aesthetically speaking think 300 meets heat and it doesnt give a fudge what you think of it,reality
it seems a lot of people that have written a bad review of this movie were expecting a completely different dramatic movie if you do like action flicks with great fight scenes a believable plot and a believable story line then give this a go honestly its bourne identity fight scenes with cod shooting a little comic book feel thats mixed with some great cinematography and a whole lot of killing the movie is straight bad ass no over developed characters taking time away from mayhem no stupid happy love story and no sub plots or other bull crap keanu is great in this role dafoe is awesome leguizamo is short and to the point and dean winters is great as well this isnt citizen kane thank god its an action movie plain and simple guns death ass kicking,reality
overall i would rate this movie 9 out of 10 pros  acting specially reeves fight sequences pace of the movie new moves on display cons story linestory line of the movie is the only goof up because its all about personal revenge but still the team has done an excellent job great work i have always been a fan of keanu reeves the slickness of keanu reeves performance as the titular character and the sheer brilliance in its action sequences is something special it takes as much time setting up elaborate action sequences as it does the world with which it all takes place in,reality
hey everybodyyes i like this film liked the story the action the effects but there is boo to people working with russian language translations before you let a movie with foreign languages reach the audience make sure that the translations are correct i can say i speak on a advanced level english russian and those are not my native tongues and i also know the lullaby and not just one  the translation is way too incorrect there is no boogeyman mentioned in the text but wolf the text differs but the translation of the first line isbayubayu fall asleep dont lay sleep on the edge will come grey wolf and will grab you by the flank he will grab you by the flank and will pull you in the green woods and will pull you in the woods under the willow bush do not come to us wolf dont wake up our mashayou can find a song using the title baju bajushki baju ,reality
sickeningly violent involving long sequences of keanu reeves shooting people in the face character sympathy is attempted by smashing the skull of his pet and placing it in front of his unconscious face as a wake up vision of lovelinessit is a sad indictment of the attitude of hollywood producers these days that they pander to the most base instincts of its audience subliminally nurturing violent streaks in disaffected youth focus is placed on the heavy artillery and preparation for a killing spreeyou couldnt find a better mainstream film to feed to disturbed teenagers on the cusp of walking into a school and shooting dead their fellow studentsoh and the music will give you a headache,reality
willem dafoe is bad at aiming so my guess is that this is some old stuntfriend of keanus who now directs his first full length feature and keanu has simply agreed to help out because the directing is silly the script is bad the dialogue is laughable at best the plot is weak keanu is as whoa as always the other actors are ludicrous the characters are not believable the hardrock guitars in every fight is clich and for me as a swede it is fun to see mikael nyquist in a film but my guess is that he only got cast because his english pronunciation is so cheesy if you want to see an awesome movie without a plot solely based on constant fighting and violence that feels go watch the raid instead this is quite possibly the worst film i have ever seen and the first time i give anything zero stars not even a soundtrack featuring marilyn mansons weakest song to date saves this,reality
i was lucky enough to download and not pay a ticket to watch just another completely pointless and unrealistic movie about a guy seeking revenge the plot is so dull land predictable that you just dontr care how he is going to avenge his death  he just will and survive it without being hit by any bullet and having killed two armies of angry russians the movie sucks dont watch it,reality
i honestly like so many others wanted to see keanus frown turn upside down but like in 47 ronin keanu disappoints in a story rehashed a million times over and seeks only to tarnish further a reputation soaked in the odour of boxoffice poisonthis is basically a revenge flick for the common moviegoer the common moviegoer nowadays being a 12 yo snapback wearing nike sporting thug amazed by the explosions upon screen rather than immersing storytelling being a fan of the revenge genre i long to see a movie that can strike conflicting emotions in me alas this is not one of themkeanu again plays the blank emotionless face that we shall forever recognise as keanu and not the character he is supposed to be playing the supporting cast is poor as is the storytelling and camerawork in general there is no saving grace to be found here but ive awarded it two stars extra for decent production valuesin the end i was glad to leave the theatre which it was shown as were others as suggested by their sighs of disappointment if you came to watch keanu watch but if you came to be immersed in a world that tenders your soul youd be better off sticking to something else,reality
this is what is wrong with societypointless shooting movies with little or no storylinejust continuous shooting very violent and very little diologue its like a watching a video gamethis is the kind of film that encourages violence for no reasonawful,reality
watched on blue ray wast expecting much from this moviefirst 20 minutes i thought i was right but man after that the movie doest even bores you for a single minutehighly brutalmerciless non stop action throughout the moviekeanu reeves was excellent for this rolethis movie is what a max payne movie should beyeah i know the story isnt going to win any awards but the action packed scenes were excellentsure some may argue that the story could have been better but it was perfect to put the movie from one action scene to anotherthe music is totally a blasti regret now that i havent watched this in theatre and i also do wish they make a sequel with a better storylinehighly recommended for action movie fans,reality
if animal cruelty bothers you do not watch this movie i had a hard time enjoying the latter 75 of it because i was so furious on top of that the movie was just overall pretty cheesy the way the subtitles are done is corny if youre looking for a movie with one man killing probably more people than youve seen in any other movie youll get that but not really a good story the very end was awful too i thought we got this as a free rental and id say that price tag is about what it was worth had we paid for this movie i would have been pretty unhappy,reality
so i was a bit skeptical when i loaded up this movie as although i like keanu reeves he does not have much depth in his acting skills in particular he has a hard time to properly express emotions and that is one of the flaws in this movie as well as there are some situations where he should have shown genuine rage but he does quite a poor job in doing thathowever he does ok as a former hitman in this equalizer type of movie and for once it is not over a girl well not directly anyway but rather about a and a car that does sound a bit weird but seeing as keanu is supposed to play a cold blooded hitman who killed people for the smallest slight it does feel believable that he goes on a rampage over it specially when you learn what that meant to himbut as keanus lack of acting skills are apparent it is more than enough made up by the mobster boss michael nyqvist he has really intense duologues with both his son played by game of thrones star alfie allen who also plays his role really well and later on a dialogue with keanu reeves which was well played as wellother than that there are some stupid hollywood moments such as the ending and the token strongwoman character another hitman in this case who does not add much to the movie and exaggerated action scenes as well as the bad guy being too stupid to finish things off when he could but overall i enjoyed this movie it has a good mix of action intensity and with some drama thrown in and a really nice supporting role played by the excellent willem dafoe and small but equally excellent efforts by john leguizamo and lance reddickwarmly recommended but dont take it too seriously,reality
the best thing about are the action sequences because after a while they resemble a modern ballet piece otherwise the plot is worthy of a comic book or a first person video gameso the main character goes after russian mob because some of their less intelligent members stole his car and shot his yes this is his motivation to turn the rest of the movie into a gore fest well also encounter an underworld of hired assassins that not only have code of conduct and well established hideouts but also their own currency resembling a gold coin its net worth remains ambiguous since for one coin you might enter a club but also dispose of a body by a professional servicethe biggest question mark i had about is what made keanu reeves play in this movie was it the fading fame his agents talking him into it or complementary fitness lessons that came with the rolefunny enough roughly at the same time with release a similar trashy movie came out with an underfighting the russian mafia namely the equalizer with denzel washington,reality
i thoroughly enjoyed this film great amount of action acting is good and keanu flexing his martial arts moves that he clearly learnt for the matrix the only thing i was confused about was how he went after the russians for just killing his and stealing his car but he explains that when with viggo the amount of strong actors in there is good i was pleased the array of actors they picked it is in no way a comedy but there was a couple of moments where i laughed out loudi loved it if youre not particularly picky with your action movies then this is for youif all youre going to do is pick at every like plot hole and there are a couple then i would suggest avoiding,reality
action scenes are suitably well done its just a shame the plot is full of holes and plain terrible the script has only a few notable lines and the acting is on a whole sub parthrow in a few jokes put a wittier spin on it and this would have been a much better watch if you want to enjoy the film read the following and then skip everything but the half hour of keanu action scene headshotshe really loved that apparentlypersonally i feel there are a lot better revenge flicks countless numbers of them,reality
this movie is not a deep film with a lot of twists and strong characters but thats okay because it doesnt try to be either this is just a fun movie to watch its cool in every sense of the word the use of the camera is very slick and the texting gives it a cartoonish feel to it with suits the plotkeanu reeves plays this hardcore hitman who goes on a wild rampage thru the russian mafia after the kid of the boss kills reeves so not the most original plot but as a action movie its good nobody likes a killer so you are really on keanus side and also he has some amazing shooting and fighting skills that are fun to watch you will not get smarter watching this movie but you will have fun,reality

a horrible film to watch with ridiculous actionthis movie made me believe that the number of movies without script is getting bigger and bigger each yearliterally below average script plus below par story line and pathetic acting i watched it because it was one of the most awaited films of keanu reeves but after watching it i am literally regretting that why did i waste 100 minutes of my life i am amazed how did it get a rating of 75 on imdb anyways if you want to waste 100 minutes of your life then it is highly recommended to watch this movieps btw thanks to this is the first review i have ever written in my entire life,reality
not too long ago maybe a month i had no idea what this movie was i hadnt seen a trailer or anything then all of a sudden i saw a lot of stuff advertising it and i heard a lot of people say it was good after hearing that i was anticipating a fun movie that lets your mind go free for two hours and nothing more i was wrong though it was a lot more this movie was not only fun but it was an actual good movie they did a great job coming up with this world and how everyone in this world interacts with each other everyone knows each other and their are rules also they filmed the action like a normal human being not shaking all over the place the acting was really good and the story for why he was doing all of this was made perfect sense it made it different from most other action movies there was a part of the movie that took place in a club and looked amazing it was one of the best scenes of the year my only problems with it are that the beginning goes on a little longer than i wished and the very last scene seems a little forced other than that this movie is great it is keanu reeves best performance in a long time maybe ever you should definitely go see it,reality
i would have given 0 if i could totally garbage,reality
i am a big fan of keanu reeves but his this movie is totally a crap his fighting actions are very much like very old hollywood films he talks like as he has some mouth disease and talks in very slow style when they stole his car and killed his and then the way viggo introduced i was super conscious and thought that would do something amazing and extraordinary fights but nothing happened like that in the whole movie just his dressing was awesome believe me that in the whole movie i was expecting that now  now he will do something amazing but nope people in this movie look so calm and in peace that they dont care about fighting  and whole movie looks like a video game just boring shooting in all the scenes worst story line throughout i would say that it was one of the worst movies i have ever seen,reality
people keep asking if he is backand yea im thinking hes backtells the story of a man seeking revenge the plot is very simple and straightforward so my review will be comparable experiences a series of unfortunate tragedies and consequently he spends the rest of the movie delivering head shots to the men who were responsible the simplicity of the plot is effective because it gives us plenty of time to focus on the action and the action is where this movie shines the martial arts and gun fighting provide eye candy like youve never seen and the amazing stunt work is accompanied by flawless editing and directing the guys who made this seriously knew what they were doingtakes place in a dark and stylish universe full of assassins and bounties the music is dope the characters are interesting the action is slick and keanu provides his best performance since the matrix as he performs 95 of his own stuntsone of the best pure action flicks ive seen in recent years 910,reality
i enjoyed the heck out of this the irony and spareness of the storyline are some its best features it successfully and succinctly establishes john character and why we should care without drawing out a melodramatic backstory the film is quick and to the point much like its protagonist yet creates a detailed and engrossing underworld of which i found myself wishing to see more every character is a bit of a clich but thats kind of the point stahelski is never self conscious in the decisions he makes with the film which makes for a robust yet focused action film as far as the acting keanu reeves brings the believable and understated rage of a hitman being forced out of retirement while no one was going to win an oscar for their performance the cast was perfectly suited for the movie each actor embodied their role and appeared to truly inhabit the films surreal and fantastical settings whoever cast the movie did a killer job pun intendedthe action sequences are artful to the point of humor which i think is great the crisp and imaginative movements of could belong to a ballet of violence rather than an action film its like a less believable yet more impressive jason bourne but i honestly think id rather watch any dayat one point in the film i had a complaint i cannot detail too much without spoilers but let it suffice to say that the pacing was off for a few scenes about three quarters of the way through but quickly pulled itself together before the end lastly i am tempted to respond to negative reviews but i am pretty sure would look at the couch critics disinterestedly for a few tense moments then turn his back and walk away knowing he was better than them i do have to say though for those persons wanting socalled realism then you should probably stick to documentaries and even then,reality
 its that kind of a character whose name is enough to inflict terror in the minds of people and whoever isnt terrified doesnt mean that theyre better it just means that they dont know john it definitely isnt the first character of its kind but very few characters of this kind convince you that they are what they are supposed to be lets just say that kicks a and he is pretty awesome at thati cant think of anyone else to be other than keanu reeves the guys living the character on screen the hand to hand combat usage of knives and guns the action it all seems poetic at times the thing i loved the most is that there wasnt too much noise no boom boom just the bang bang exactly what youd expect from a hitmanthe cinematography dialogues background score direction action everything was just what a movie like this needs it ticked all the right boxes for me and i think every action movie fan would lap this one upit is a great action revenge movie that never runs out of steam throughout its course so everyone who loves to see bullets flying all over the screen or to quote it better say hitting just the right spots go treat yourself to this movie youd be glad,reality
did anyone expect this 2014 action thriller to be a success the film took audiences and critics by storm with its exciting and tense action sequences a strong leading performance by the matrix star keanu reeves as well as a talented supporting cast a simple yet memorable plot and masterful directionkeanu reeves does what he does best in this smashing success speak little dialogue and kick ass by shooting and killing the bad guys playing a former hitman who is thrown back into the game after young punks kill his beloved puppy and steal his car reeves is on top of his game the actor brings his own agame to the part as he plays the title character as brooding mysterious and intelligent all rolled into a lethal combination reeves is a man on a mission and is prepared with a deadly arsenal of weaponry to dispatch his enemies the film also boasts a talented supporting cast particularly from michael nyqvist as russian mob boss viggo ian mcshane as former boss winston the actor will reprise his role in the sequel and willem dafoe as old friend and ally marcus the actors all bring their unique flavors from nyqvist being a quietly sinister villain who will take down reevess at any cost mcshane brings a worldly wisdom and silent ruthlessness to keep his prize assassin alive and dafoe brings his snarky quips and loyal friendship to marcus who is unwilling to kill his old friend which of course leads to trouble you can never predict what action some of the characters will take or where their true loyalties lie but it is thrilling to watch and wait for the actions sequences are relentless and fastpaced without resorting to shaky cam tactics guns fire blood flies fisticuffs ensue the colors are dark and vibrant and the motions are all frenetic the stunts are well choreographed as the actors move through fight scenes with almost snakelike slickness while the camera angles are wide enough for us to take in the action and relish all the excitement,reality
had been out awhile and at first i had little interest in seeing it as for me keanu reeves is generally whatever the opposite of a selling point is however i kept hearing about how this was a bit of a throw back of an action movie and upon reading the connection between the director and keanu i thought i would have to put aside my preconceived notions and give this movie a shotthe movie had two exstunt men one of which was keanu reeves former stunt double helming this film this resulted in a lot of practical effects instead of heavy reliance on green screen also familiarity with reeves likely left the directors with a base knowledge with how far they could push the star this left the films action scenes clean realistic to the point and a hell of a lot of fun to watchif i was going to break down the films format well it is of the semigeneric punisher type ex bad ass comes out of retirement to take on other bad asses type variety it was 75 japanese yakuza film 20 film noir and 5 video game one stylistic element that jumped out at me right away was the choice to go with a narrow scope of field for focus at first i thought maybe this was the projector in the theater but then i realized it was a choice made for the film normally this would annoy me slightly and i suppose still did as i am a big fan of depth of field miseenscnes set ups citizen kane is one of my favorite films i came to terms with the stylistic choice made for this film as it reminded me so much of eastern influences in this case it was reminiscent of zen ink and brush compositions where the sharpness lies in where the brush first touches down and the edges disappear into an almost mist like effectwhile keanu sold the action pieces well he wasnt asked to do too much to stretch his stoic emotional range which is just what the film required he was pretty much perfect for this part if i had been for some reason been asked to recast this film i would be hard pressed to find a better fit this would have been right up jason stathams alley however there is nothing more he could have added to it there was something quietly instance about reeves that made you feel that he was one not to be trifled with statham will always remind me of the character he played in snatch which was not at all overly menacing or intimidating rather if i had my choice of an alternative i would delve further into the japanese gangster genre and extract chow yunfat reeves was 49 in this film and still convincing as an ass kicker chow yunfat would have been ten years older but that would have further added to the realism of a retired hit man that is unwillingly dragged back into the businessspeaking of performances this film was full of great character actors from the action genre and otherwise one of these performances that i was not overly fond of was that of alfie allen you probably know him as the dickless theon greyjoy he worked in the part in that he was highly unlikable however i was not sure which accent he was trying to commit to this brings me to another flaw of the film many of the baddies simply did not measure up to be worthy of the challenge a spoiled brat son of a crime boss nor the crime boss himself an old man that the film gave no hint as to any physical prowess until the anticlimactic final battle gave any feeling that the fight would go any other direction except to a single minded killing strokei highly recommend this film if you are a fan of good action this easily ranks as one of the pure action movies of 2014 judged as just a movie it is simple in story structure but what it does it does very well,reality
95 percent of this movie is fine decent cast lots of action plenty of killing  cool cars what ruins this film is a beginning that dispels our suspension of disbelief that mr is a highly skilled super badass assassin which is required for us to believe he is capable of killing so many serious soldiers against crazy odds i mean like two of the weaker guys kicked his ass  killed his with no difficulty or resistance yea he got blindsided  clobbered but a lot less than in the rest of the movie and the character we see from then on would have dispatched them both in 10 seconds  saved his puppy but then it would be a slightly different plot with the mobster pop going after for killing his son in the beginning instead of both going after each otherthen theres the ending this lover who kills 77 people to avenge his murdered pal goes and steals a pit bull puppy from a veterinarians office which im pretty sure in the ignorant  lazy minds of the writers director  producers meant it to be a rescue of a pup in need this was a beautiful healthy blue pit bull puppy in a cage at a vets office not a sickly abused unadoptable animal at a high kill animal shelter i muse in the discussion boards that in the next installment the pit bull puppys owner goes after to avenge his stolen petim not saying dont watch it but there are better things to do places to go  movies  tv to see like rewatching two episodes of game of thrones any season,reality
films like always have me thinking how does a movie like this ever get made and what better films are now still sitting on the shelf its a big bundle of action movie clichs strung together and it doesnt take long to guess where this all will end you watch and you think ive seen this all before i wondered at some points if the movie was trying to spoof the genre because many of the action vignettes were trying so hard to be stylized with long choreographed fight sequences and bad music i find it hard to understand what entertainment this movie would hold for an audience unless you enjoy watching bullets enter and exit heads with great regularity why are movie bad guys so stupid surely theyve learned from watching james bond films that you kill the protagonist when you have your chance instead of interrogating him first because we all know what happens then and why are the baddies such poor marksmen perhaps they need to join john target range must take some powerful sedatives each night i dont know how hed sleep otherwise maybe keanu has the same trouble after making this movie,reality
its just blood shedding what a pathetic story line i will say there is no story i dont know how it got 72 rating it was a waste of time after you have seen bourn series he keeps on killing around like a super hero or something and you look at other people as if they are nothing people get killed like chickens nothing happens to the kenu as he is a super hero or something i had a lot of expectations after i saw rating 72  it was a waste of 2 hour and it spoiled my mood also they want you to write 10 lines for a review  actually no one can write 10 lines for this movie its all about blood shed he is a man of steel or something and he is not even quick in his moves why bullets doesnt touch him that should be investigated,reality
you will remember that name ever since the matrix left the theaters people have been wondering if keanu reeves would make his return to the action world after man of tai chi came out last year people were wondering if the man in the black jacket was truly back well i just came from seeing and to steal a line from the movie ya im thinking hes back you want the story ill spin it for you quick its been said that you dont mess with a mans car or his well apparently nobody told that to a young group of russian mobsters who do so to the grief stricken what the mobsters dont know is that although poor john might look like a scruffy nobody hes actually a badass exassassin and his retribution is baharutal this is an action movie like a real action movie not like those modern soldierspy action movies this is a straight up high octane muscle busting john woo style shootemup action movie my absolute favorite kind of movie it looks like keanu is a little miffed that he wasnt called to be part of the expendables team and in retaliation he made a badass movie of his own the film is directed by stunt choreographers david leitch and chad stahelski who believe it or not used to be standins for keanu reeves and hugo weaving on the matrix those two really know what theyre doing because the cinematography in is clear well shot and beautifully pieced together and the action is fluid quick incredibly violent but undeniably stylish and over the top which really makes it a lot of fun to watch plus it exists in this interesting world of hit men and secret clubs and unspoken code that really pulls you in and makes you want to see more of whats really going on behind the scenes this is helped a lot by the movies incredible cast which includes willem dafoe ian mcshane john leguizamo lance reddick and the mayhem guy from the allstate commercials its the most fun ive had watching a one man one way movie in a good long while and if youre a fan of movies like equilibrium or hard boiled or really any john woo film at all youll love this have a dudes night with the guys you used to watched jet li steven segal and chow yunfat movies with and see this movie gets a 45out of 5,reality
i didnt like the movie it gave me cognitive dissonance it is a professional work it has perfect styling the camera work is great the individual scenes are believable and well shot but it has no contentthe characters are shallow and dont grow the action is predictable the stereotypes are pure propaganda it just feeels like somebody wasted not only the viewers money but also hired the stars for nothingthere is just no message i felt like im voightkampff tested for being an android and got a positive result,reality
john life is not going well his wife of five years has recently died and he is barely holding things together then he receives one final gift from his wife a puppy it looks as if this is just what he needed to pull himself together but soon afterwards a group of young punks break into his house and attack him while looking for the keys to his classic car they also kill the puppy they also had no idea who they were messing with until met his wife he was the top assassin working for a russian mobster in new york the thiefs father is that same russian gangster and if he is to save his son he will have to kill first the killers sent after are soon dispatched and now he is on the warpath everybody who gets in his way is going to end up dead and a lot of people get in his wayif you are looking for a deep and meaningful story or even a sense of mystery you are likely to be disappointed with this from the start we know who the bad guys are and we just know that before the film is over our protagonist will have killed them all along with countless heavies if you want lots of action that feels real without obvious cgi wirework obviously choreographed fights and corny oneliners then this is just the thing with its almost nonstop violent action it feels more like something john woo would have made in his hong kong days than a typical hollywood action movie keanu reeves does an impressive job as michael nyqvist make a good bad guy and alfie allen is suitably unpleasant as his dogkilling son they are also enjoyable turns from the likes of willem dafoe and ian mcshane my only real complaint about the film is that the subtitles that appeared when anybody spoke russian were tiny and not at the bottom of the screen so that they werent that easy to read before they vanished that wasnt a major problem as this film is about action not dialogue overall id recommend this to anybody after a proper action movie,reality
ok first of all i dont like watching action movies i only suffer through them for my husband and he does know that i suffer through them therefore we dont watch them very often in our household this movie i not only watched all by myself but enjoyed every minute of it so why did i start watching it by myself in a first place one evening i felt like watching myself some eye candy that is reeves so sue me i was prepared however to stop it any minute i got tired of italso my first language is russian so yes i get annoyed too when americanbritishaustralian actors try to pass of as russian dudes when i cant understand a single word spoken in awful russian but i watched many other movies where a russian guys are bad andor stupid guys and b speak incomprehensible russian why should this particular movie be singled out its not the pointas other reviewers noted this whole movie is all about fun and pure entertainment and when i do watch a movie i want fun and entertainment not to be depressed shocked and saddened out of my wits real life can do that sufficiently enoughthe first 20 or so minutes were depressing but they went by fast and served as a backstory after thatdone enjoy the ride i dont think i have ever seen such upbeat action movie where i found myself laughing on numerous occasions and i agree there is something tarantinoesque about this movie but i actually thought that this movie was much better as it dialed down the gore while keeping surreal atmosphere throughoutin short this is entertainment people this is why we go to the movies in the first place i am just getting sick and tired of all the art pieces portraying real wordlifestruggles etc which regrettably are more and more prevalent these days,reality
keanu reeves has clearly found his niche as a brilliant martial arts actor playing the role of various action heroes executing flawless and beautiful fight choreographies taking names shooting bad guys breaking a few necks et cetera absolutely nothing wrong with that and this his most recent action film is definitely worth a watch for the visuals alonereeves is a retired assassin and hired gun who has recently gone through an immense loss and is just getting back to his feet enter the son of a russian mobster young enough that he doesnt recognize this dark legend of the underworld after an insult gone too far once again feels the blood boiling within him and the rest of the film is pretty much nothing else but his one man war against the russian mafia and you know what i dont really need anything else from the story these kinds of revenge action films work because of their style and because of their characters sure its nice if the story has some surprising twists but they dont really need itin this case the movie definitely has style bucket loads of it the fight scenes are phenomenally wellshot wellchoreographed and wellexecuted especially the first few the film also manages to build nice mythos around its world like the gold coins these assassins use to pay for everything or the whole code of conduct they all seem to operate under is a legend in the underworld and its great to see him casually nodding to other killers and having them lift their hats in return small things like that really deepen the world considerably and make it interesting to followunfortunately where the film falters a bit is the cast of characters none of them are bad and most of them are played by talented actors but they are pretty much text book as far as the writing goes stereotypical failing to surprise and mainly there to move the plot from one action scene to another plus while the actors are not bad by any means none of them are what you would call alist with the exception of reeves and even hes a bit debatable nowadays well okay theres willem dafoe but hes in a minor roleall in all is definitely worth a watch for all fans of action especially if youre into the martial arts and gunfu subgenres,reality
is a good movie with a very well developed storyline and a great cast its a simple action movie that never wants to be anything more than that it never gets too complicated its story is easy to follow and the action sequences are amazingly choreographed its a huge surprise to know that its made by two first time directors because they already seem like professionals i felt the movie needed more depth though i did certainly feel certainly feel for the main character they glossed over the story about his wife it should have been more constructed its only an hour and forty minutes long and they easily could have added an extra fifteen minutes to develop their relationship some more the performances are excellent there are some top class acting from the likes of michael nyqvist willie dafoe and ian mcshane but the best performance certainly goes to keanu reeves who shines in this film and for the first time since the matrix he feels like a real action star his characterisation for is terrific hes flawed emotional and vengeful its a character that we can easily feel for and support action packed and a ton of simple fun i would recommend to anyone looking for a good action a hitman comes out of retirement in order to take down the men who took everything he loves away from him best performance keanu reeves worst performance omar barnea,reality
i didnt expect much with this movie just another action film in which my easily impressed friend announced was his new favorite movieturns out it was actually pretty enjoyable sure it doesnt have a deep plot or interesting characters but it has a twist on modern action movies that i havent really seen i dont want to spoil anything but it was actually quite humorous i found the overthe topness to be quite entertaining the action is good nothing special though typical action movie action except reloads his gun thats right this action movie is not only creative but realistic now thats a rarity in action movies these days overall is different and it scores points on that level however the ending was forced which really took away from the experience and the action plot and characters really arent anything special except reloads which is where it loses points i understand that its an action movie but that doesnt excuse it from key points required in making a good movie in the end if your looking for a solid action movie then is the movie for you,reality
basically this is a charles bronson death wish movie from the 70s redone for our times there used to be a series of bronson movies all literally the same something bad would happen to the main character and he would take revenge thats it and strangely enough that is enough for a movie to succeed even nowthose kind of movies and this particular one play on the feelings we all have when criminals take something away from us or we are physically or mentally attacked by someone we want revenge hatred roars in our minds and if we did not have the tiny layer of civilization and self control the entire world would play out this revenge story again and againso there you have it reeves plays pretty well although with his usual poker face expression during most of the movie someone takes his car and kills his and of we go on a 250 body count murder spree to kill the criminal i should mention the stands for more than just an animal its a symbol of lovereeves must be carrying an ammo stock pile on his body that would have normal people unable to move but if you disregard the i have myself 1200 bullets please its an enjoyable if very violent 100 minutesi suspect there will be a 23 and so on as hollywood has rediscovered bronson revenge movies,reality
after hearing about the surrounded hype of one must have been decided to see for themself how the film stacks up and for one i believe the film lives up to its hype having been called the best or one of the best action films of last year 2014 it really does deliver on action and what makes the film standout is the style and visuals we have seen many action films in the past years but delivers and standouts due to its level of nonstop action and the way the action is being brought upon us there have been plenty of action films with characters such as highly secretive hit mandetectives that play it cool but in this film we see keanu reeves really play the part perfectlylike most films especially like he equalizer another 2014 action film this film has a great set up and it builds the suspension but as the film gets past half way it really does become a great entertaining ride like many the action is a serious tone and it works well the sequel will be very anticipated and we all hope it delivers keep a steady eye out for it we all know it will come upon us quickly,reality
this is very much my kind of movie straightforward lots of good action our hero never waivers from his path and no social or emotional nonsense those who have watched the movie might wonder why i claim that there is not emotional nonsense since the entire plot is driven by john very emotional response to his wifes death and the subsequent killing of the that he received as a last present from her what i mean with no emotional nonsense is that is never second guessing himself the movie never really tries to portray him as an ordinary guy having second thoughts about killing the bad guys and he doesnt go into some silly oh should i really pull the trigger trance and drops the gun in the worst possible moments as is done in a lot of movies sure there are emotions in this movie rage and thirst for revenge in particular with the addition of a healthy dose of fear from the bad guyseventually that isthe plot of the movie is as i wrote quite straightforward and classical retired hit man gets wronged by idiot son of big bad guy hit man gets pied off and goes on a quest for revenge people die a lot of them hit man and big bad guy have a show down at the end in terms of story that is about it however such a story can be told and presented in a good and entertaining way and in a less good and entertaining way as far as i am concerned the way the story is told in this movie is very very entertainingkeanu reeves is quite good as the hit man so are the big bad guy and most of the other actors of any importance during the course of the movie we get more than a few glimpses into john former life and it is a quite cool background that have been elaborated the secret world that was once part of and how it works and operates would be worthy a good oldfashioned james bond moviethen of course there is the action it is an action movie so you do expect quite some expenditure on the action and this movie do not disappoint there are lots of action and it is good action sure the ease by which picks off his opponents waiving his guns in all direction without hardly looking is sometimes a bit over the top but it is still done with a fluidness and grace that just makes it  so cool the gun fights are generally mixed up with some equally good martial arts close combat stuff and it is really well woven togetherone thing that i really like with this movie is that is the cool cold determined not to be pied off killing machine from start to finish there are really no slow parts or obligatory scenes of doubt and selfrecrimination it is the bad guys will pay all the way this of course gives the opportunity to include some other elements that i quite like in a story like this for instance the parts where the spoiled total idiot son of the big bad guy slowly gets his arrogance replaced by some good honest to god fear fear of death and fear of the guy he so carelessly pied offneedless to say i enjoyed this movie a lot when i sat down to watch it with my oldest son yesterday,reality
if you love fast paced action where the hero recovers from numerous crippling assaults and stabbings that would kill any bad guy faster than you can say jack be nimble this is the movies for you story line is very very simple acting mediocre but fully action paced to the hilt our hero kills at least 84 bad guys including the big boss and effectively takes out the whole russian mafia all because the big boss son kills his and steals his car our hero makes superman batman and spiderman look like kindergarten babes as he wisks through more than 80 thugs and trained killers and underworld henchmen like a 300kmhr tornado the movie starts off with our hero collapsing you think he dies due to a mortal stomach wound then it flashes back to fill in the intervening events and ends with our hero rising like a phoenix out of the ashes as good as new almost for what could only be a the first step towards a future sequel after beating and killing over 80 trained and ruthless mobsters our hero is given a very good hiding by a female assassin just hours after he was patched up from a previous almost fatal beating and stabbing and a day or two later the only way he can disarm and beat a much older and nowhere near as fit or capable as our hero crime boss is to let the crime boss stab him in the preexisting stomach wound so he could take the knife off him and stabkill him perhaps this is where our heros batteries were running lowthough not all is far fetched fantasy because this is one of a very few movies where the heros gun runs out of bullets as any normal gun would and we do see him reloading a few times apart from the miraculous recoveries more than once of our hero the movie does have some somber or comical scenes to break up the voluminous killings like when our hero goes to a classy hotel akin to a sanctuary or demilitarized zone where only assassins hit men and criminals are allowed entry to gather stay and unwind or just take a breather from their hectic routine with very stringent rules where any transgression carries an immediate death sentence as ones greedy guest discovers and for the car enthusiasts our hero does do some very impressive drivingpursuit scenes pity because with a bit of toning down on the outlandish stunts and super recovery from serious injuries this could have been a much better film,reality
might be the most uneven film ive seen in 2014 the premise is good and the film wellconstructed but the pacing is poor it takes far too long for the action to kick in the first hour is all setup with characters repeatedly telling each other and the audience that is really tough however it takes forever for us to actually see this with only one good action sequence in the first hour when the action finally kicks in its pretty glorious but it overstays its welcome in the final act with one dramatic fight scene after another towards the end feels too much like a video game with the protagonist simply proceeding through enemies like levelskeanu reeves reminds us in the overlong opening act why producers and directors dont hire him for his acting talents fortunately once the first hour has dragged on he reminds us why we do hire him  hes a complete badass who at 50 plus years old is absolutely still in his prime dean winters and alfie allen are excellent casting additions though not exactly for acting talent but for the presence they bring to the filmoverall is a nice timekiller and most promisingly constructs a world i would love to revisit in a better paced sequel,reality
its just good fun the acting starts off kind of cheesy but after the first 20 minutes its all action after thatand pretty good for all those out there who studied freud as an undergrad and like deep multi layered multifaceted characters with a lot of character developmentstay home and read a good book if you need to get your mind off your boss who might or might not be an ss your parents or your wife nagging you then this is the movie for youevery movie cant have you in tears or have you thinking why were we put here on this planet in this time in this universeor maybe this is the parallel universe i just blew your mind blah blah blah bottom line is this movie will entertain you give it a chance its about a man and his guns getting revenge,reality
this movie screams kill bill  sin city dont expect anything but fun  violently fight  shooting  killing scenes the movie is full of dream cars dark humor handsome man who can kill 300 people over 2 hours perfect movie for people who enjoy the action scenesthe script and lines are fantastic none of it bases on the reality almost like the comic its very enjoyable and very entertainingi love how they mix imagination of the russian mafia and the assassins world together a lot of details like gold coins transactions are interesting and give the movie more noveltyi dont think its a good movie for kids though,reality
the setting is similar to many comic themed movies think sin city if you are looking for a mind blowing plot that keeps your attention throughout the movie this isnt the movie for you however if you are looking for fun action packed film that keeps your attention for almost two hours then its the right flick to check out im not exactly sure what the record is for most kills in a movie however would be that this would give it a run for the money every kill was done with such precision you find yourself excited about the next one its certainly nice to see keanu back on the screen although not as good as speed or point break he gives a fantastic performance move aside stephen segal and jean claude fun movie to see on the big screen,reality
i had a couple of hours to kill and being a keanu reeves fan especially for his dedication to the martial arts genre i thought id check this out first half hour was enjoyable it felt like a 70s grind house action thriller then came the video game carnage scene after scene of underworld minions getting shot in the face at point blank range im sorry i walked out at the hour mark i realize i missed a cool car chase at the end  and that sucks but im just tired of it tired tired tired tired of gun violence in movies man its not just morally objectionable its just not exciting its just boring so depressing to see keanu involved in this kind of project what really pisses me off too is when critics give lousy ratings to tyler perry movies which have nothing but positive messages and then lavish praise on this movie which is nothing but casual throwaway gun violence from beginning to end oh yes but its so stylish yeah right,reality
the movie was good but i must say that the musical score was terrible it actually ruined the movie whoever wrote that score should be fired and the producer that allowed it should never produce if one could put a good musical score to this movie it would be great the music overpowers the story and the action i am graceful for giving it a 4 if it was not for the music it would have been a nine it amazes me how a bad musical score can make a movie bad to watch the acting gets a 95 the movie gets a 4 the music in the movie ruins the movie the story is just ok but is not much of a story there is no plot except revenge the action is good but is overpowered by the horrible music they should learn from 007 that the music should actually fit what the action says if you want ghetto music with 007 action watch this if you want action and can not stand the ghetto music turn the sound off because the dialogue says nothing,reality
my friends sat me down to watch this movie last night i thought it was going to be another stupid action flick boy was i wronghere is my review was a wonderful lighthearted romp for my hour and a half on the couch i loved the cute puppy scenes the 1969 mustang and the stylish suits mr wore on the elegant sets what a total surprise that keanu could mug joke and sing so well he mostly danced with men from the russian ballet troupe and the choreography was first rate his performance could easily rival fred astaire and shows the world mr reeve can do so much more than his previous dead as a stick acting skillsit was mostly a mans musical three women had minor roles his deceased wife was glimpsed in brief flashbacks there was a girl tending bar who had a few lines of dialogue and lastly there was adrianne palicki who had only one short pas de deux and chanson duet with john mr reeves best song was im thinking im back this was easily the most grammy winning piece in the entire musicaland dont get me started on the snappy dialogue i mean it i was clutching my sides with laughter at all the witty repartee among the actors the script writers could certainly teach woody allen a thing or two i would have given this movie 10 stars but i gave it only 3 for ending way too soon it should have gone on much much longer the final dance number on the docks near the helicopter pad was pure romance and reminiscent of gene kelly in the pouring rainwith all the mindless american action movies featuring nonstop ultraviolence it was refreshing to see the film makers treat us with an upbeat musical comedy afterwards i felt like audrey hepburn and started singing i could have danced all night,reality
a grieving hit man after a series of unfortunate events goes about exacting revenge on his former boss sonsince rocky 4 the stereotype russian bad guy films seemed to ease off however mirroring the politics of today there appears to be an increasing influx of bad guy russians equalizer taken 3 jack ryan die hard 5 to name just a few amongst the abundance of them comes with its on location feel and slick action sequences wonderfully directed by chad stahelski  david leitchs with great action scenes and derek kolstads solid dialogue goes from one scene to the next exacting revenge on those who have wronged him its a fine straightforward affair without the quirkiness or humour of the likes director guy ritchie or paul mcguigan stahelski delivers a straight up action thriller with hard hitting violence blood baths through a hotel church cars and blood spattered clubs unashamedly from the shootouts to knife fights it oozes cool complemented by the lighting sound design music tracks and score from tyler batesthe cast are unprecedentedly on form with michael nyqvist alfie allen adrianne palicki and memorable willem dafoe bridget moynahan and ian mcshane cameo with john leguizamo small part effortlessly stealing the cameo show keane reeves is perfectly cast with his minimal dialogue and screen presence even with its dark tone its more fun than the comparable excellent equalizer yes like all actions theres an obligatory jason stathamvan dammelike showdownfight off and is unavoidably reminiscent of get carter and payback but as a revenge action it is as completely rounded as they come  recommended,reality
i cant say i understand why many people are raving about is it that peoples expectations are so low these days maybe its because the film is reminiscent of the matrix and because it features refreshing oldschool action choreography sure it seems like with the character of keanu reeves is back to his glory days of speed 1994 and the matrix 1999 but this alone doesnt make for a good film is an often enjoyable action movie but theres nothing original about it gone are the days of bright upbeat action movies like beverly hills cop 1984 lethal weapon 1987 and under siege 1992 yes those days seem so far away now today we have to watch dark depressing and truly violent action movies like and the equalizer if you want to see action in an upbeat movie now you have to watch a specialeffects summer blockbuster but to be fair does contain some humor the cinematography by jonathan sela is impressive some of the action scenes are truly entertaining and that movie poster of keanu with a gun sure does look cool in fact sometimes the film reminds one of the glory days of action movies reeves is confident in the leading role michael nyqvist seems to be enjoying himself as viggo tarasov the films main antagonist in addition most of the supporting cast are good though there isnt a single character that i found interesting director and stunt veteran chad stahelski refuses to embrace the postbourne identity 2002 trend of shakycam action thats commendable but the action choreography is still unremarkable even if it is competent can kill people without problems if the character had been infused with more style however and provided with more of a personality the film would have been more enjoyable derek kolstads traditional and predictable screenplay also drags the film down when goes on his vengeful killing spree he begins with the pawns and works his way up to the head of the crime syndicate so even though is mostly a competent action movie theres nothing in it that can elevate it to the status of a classic i dont recommend it but if youre in the mood to see an action movie you may like it,reality
i dont normally write reviews but this one took me by such a surprise i thought id try and save some other viewers from wasting their timebefore watching this i had a look on imdb normally anything above a 6 is watchable this was 73 so i thought itd be our movie for the evening unanimously the group of us thought it was direproblemsthe plot the set up for the story is unbelievable we spend 15 minutes looking at mourning his wife at the start of the movie it wasnt the most riveting stuff later in the movie we find out that everybody in new york i think seems to know who is except for the 3 idiots that stole his car which brings me to them why would they bother stealing his car what was their motive yeah its a nice car but they stole it to sell it they didnt need the money apparently theres only one cop in america we see about 100 people die in this movie in the city and the only cop we see is at housesome corny scenes we dont see how is the bogeyman we get told it that seemed cheap to me did you know he killed 3 guys in a bar with a pencil great good to know had the main car thief in his sights half way through the movie he could have shot him there and then nope were only half way through the movie so ill just look at him when im pointing my gun at him when he runs about 10 seconds later ill start shooting the hotel manager meeting the girl assassin to tell her that her admission to the hotel had been revoked permanently only to have her shot immediately did he really need to make the trip the bit with and his mate at the graveyard that was some of the driest dialog ive ever seen fuel the chopper good god has anybody ever made a phone call to say that to anybody ever why wouldnt the chopper be fuelled already are they stored empty why not just say were on our way have the chopper ready the main bad guy has tied up and ready to die rather than finish the job ill leave it to my too henchmen and ill run off to my car to drive off can you guess whats going to happen next when finished his killing spree and going to head off into the sunset ill kill his only mate and ring him up to tell himwhat annoyed me most i think is that with a bit more effort the film could have been good how about at the start of the movie have his wife killed by an attempted carjacking rather than having 15 minutes of him moping around after she died of cancer i could get behind his killing spree then rather than him going off after his which he had for 2 days was killedon the plus side keanu was on top form in the action scenes in the dialog scenes he wasnt so good but i think thats more to do with the dialog being so bad,reality
seriously what was it imdb 77 rt 70  for this even keanu reeves can not save this lousy script hardtobelieve story bad and pathetic dialogs main character doesnt talk much it suits keanu perfectly he probably took this role for personal reasons as he loose someone close himself but it doesnt mean you should watch it and pay for it if you love keanu reeves and cannot stand it  buy the dvd watch online save your money this movie is really boring and disappointing it doesnt worth much of your money and time well youve been warnedabout movie itself  was doing killings for the russian mob but met a woman and quit couple of years after she died leaving him with a and a car car was stolen was killed and now he takes revenge from the same russian mob do you believe it so far ok this it where action starts plenty of it ive spent only a couple of months for studying some martial arts but even this was enough to say  action was unprofessional inefficient it took him longer then should it was staged and unbelievable even gun part real disappointment especially from keanu reeves bad script bad dialogs bad acting bad action almost bbad leaves us just keanu reeves,reality
ill say this about this sure wasnt boring the plot set up is ridiculous and laughable a deathand animal lovers may just get behind this me realizing this as i write itfuels the rage of a former hitman named keanu reeves in a role tailor made for him known to as the man you call to kill the boogeyman had left behind a trail of dead bodies a life where he perfected the art of the execution a man he worked for a russian crimelord named viggo tarasov michael nyqvist of the girl with the dragon tattoo series unfortunately has an entitled punk kid named josef alfie allen game of thrones who seems to look for trouble and has been coddled by his pops to the point that he is burdened to clean up his messes when josef sees john parked by a gas tank pumping for a 69 mustang he wants it and along with a couple of his crook cronies home invade taking the keys of the car and killing his cute pet purchased for john by his dying wife as a parting gift so he wouldnt be all alone so furious and seething with rage will wage a oneman war against any of viggos hired thugs and hit men or hitwoman as one case arises that gets in his way of executing josef because josef is such a creep seeing him narrowly escaping who must destroy an army of russian henchmen it is hard to imagine even viggo would be so inclined as to relinquish so much in favor of saving the piece of human excrement yet family means somethinguntil has a grenade gun pointed at him viggo hires willem dafoes marcus to take out but he instead winds up rescuing him twice from narrow demise dafoe just to tell you is rather wasted in his role but with ian mcshane as the owner of an exclusive hotel for a particularly criminal clientle bridget moynahan as the wife who dies from cancer supposedly taken by god because of life of murder for money and john leguizamo as the owner of a car shop that seems to operate illegal chop shopping all make brief appearances as folks encounters or knows mcshanes character has eyes and ears that could very well assist on his journey because rules within his continental were not met adrianne palicki of the friday night lights television show is a hitwoman who accepts a contract that would urge her to break the code held for anyone within the confines of the hotel to not practice within this safe zone and it was because of viggo this was usurped so has friends that will help him on his missionwith plentiful gun violence and lots of john woostylized gunplay within martial arts and handtohand combat rarely takes a breath once it gets going it starts dramatically and once josef does what he does the film takes off and remains a body count actioner the rest of the way with a determined face that has a lot of ticked off aggression barely contained reeves recovers some of that old action star mojo that was missing in the big budget flop 47 ronin the film does absolutely nothing newsimply put reeves with guns fighting skills knives and speed cuts a swath through a lot of men leaving a mess of bodies in his wake i think the first major sequencein home when viggo sends some men to kill himshows kill about 20 men in like three or four minutes oh just wait until you see him in the red circle clubviggo has a lot of bought protecting bodyguards that service the film as gun fodder not to let cars go to misuse we see lots of vehicular carnage where men dont fare well as open targets on foot or inside the car it doesnt matter if men are up close or at a distance can put down targets with relative ease and barely flinch it is like watching a shootem up video game is a bad ass who drops human targets of all shapes and sizes from all directions you enter his orbit or within his line of sight and are an enemy threatening his mission your ass is grass if this is of interest to you check the film out dont expect to receive a cerebral dramatic work of artthis aint it but will not only shoot you in the eyeball or forehead hell make sure to punch you in the larynx or break your arm before doing so,reality
first let me say that i am not a big fan of keanu reeves i think he has the acting range of a mannequin but with that being said the character in this movie that is exactly why it worked he is a stone cold killer he doesnt care about taking lives it is just another day and that is why the premise works he is emotionless until this moment and then when he actually feels something it is taken away and now there is going to be hell to pay people have asked whats the big deal it is just a and a car that is what makes it make even more sense watch it it is the best keanu movie he has made in a very long time you wont be disappointed just dont go into it thinking this is going to make you a better person or understand human nature or make you feel good it is mindless stupid action and that is why it works,reality

having watched the equalizer just over a few weeks ago i couldnt help analyzing the similarities both these films share together while both films serve well the purpose to kill time when you have got nothing special in mind needless to say both movies are easily forgettable neither of the movies offer griping story stunning performance or brutal action in my opinion is slightly more entertaining for one keanus character is somewhat more developed and believable as a hitman returned from retirement two there is also a parallel storytelling of underworld structure and code and three has got style however if you are in a mood to see bloody violence go watch the raid 2,reality
is a well made action movie that does not consist of big explosion and bigger sets most of its action pieces rely heavily on close combat and gun it is stylishly and sleekly done with a tormented keanu reeves at the centre of things the choreographed action sequences are very much close and personal with the brutality of every shot fired and every blow landed resonant in the shots the directors who were formerly stunt directors have infused variety in the settings in which the action takes place and keep the action flowing and one thing that really got me interested was how the movie weaves a community of thugs smugglers assassins and mob bosses it seems as if it is altogether a different world with its own set of laws ethics codes and loyalties since the story is an internal one happening in the underbelly of new york city this is the only world you get to see and it is intriguing and fascinating so much like our world and so much unlike ours driven by our desire to survive and thrive is the kind of action movie that is rare to find nowadays if you like some old fashioned vendetta movie and love to see keanu reeves kicking some asses this is the movie for you,reality
wow this was bad like others have said it was like watching someone play a video game shooterthe film feels like it was written and directed by a 12 year old boy trying to just cram as much graphic violence in as possible to see how much he could get away withthere is no tension whatsoever keanu is bullet proof we are asked to consider him the hero even though he murders nearly everybody he comes into contact with usually by shooting them in the head sometimes multiple times just for good measure the plot is virtually nonexistent keanus car is stolen and his killed so he goes on a killing spree the endif you want to see a good pure action movie go and watch an arnie film from the 80sif you want to see ultra violent movies done right watch kill bill part 1but avoid this its terrible,reality
really i dont see what all the fuss is about it must be my age and experience having seen quite a few movies i must say hasnt this done before so many times ill tell you i could not get into the movie and found it impossible to finish it it bored me out of my skull and once the shooting began it did not get any better the whole plot is very unlikely and empty to me and the special effects did not help it really doesnt happen often that i quit on a movie halfway through but you managedso dont try to convince me of the contrary its no use my suggestion dont waste your time on this one,reality
men are hypocritesif there was a romance movie with a shitty plot but it had quality shots and beautiful people kissing and sexing a lot then men would clown the movie however this movie has a shitty plot with quality fighting scenes and famous actors but men constantly praise it i dont get it then again the female equivalent is 50 shades of greyanywaythe plot is the stereotypical bad foreigners do something slightly bad to white american man he goes on a killing rampage to get revenge if you only care about mindless fighting and action that super badass then this is the movie for you if you actually want a decent plot then you should skip the movie the only good thing about this movie is the action and the acting itself isnt too bad,reality
im all in favour of a revenge movie especially when the bad guys kill an innocent animal but two necessary features are that 1 the bad guys dont realize what they are up against and 2 said bad guys pose a credible threat this film fails to meet either criterionfirst the vengeancetaker keanu reeves used to be a hit man for the mob so they should be prepared for the worstsecond they are not the way that the goons conveniently break cover and shoot to miss would be risible if it did not go on and on and on who knew there were so many incompetent bad guys and what is a good actor like reeves doing in this film a big disappointment,reality
kr is brilliant in this ambiguous deep and strangely moving film like dw in the equalizer kr has risen above the amoral dirty business of assassins whose job it is to keep hell filled with souls he had his most profound hopes fulfilled by brigitte moynahan who significantly is not in the film she appears only in krs memories so that he can perhaps maintain a connection with the pure life of joy he had in this world moynahan is symbolic of dantes beatrice his ideal woman residing in heaven who guides dante to paradise but before is able to mourn the loss of his beatrice sick sycophantic arrogant yet pathetically weak urchins invade his home and kill his sweet beagle sent by his dying wife called daisy which his beatrice has sent so as to allow him to go on and believe in the beauty of this world when this last vestige of purity is torn from him however he descends to the twisted almost phantasmagorical life of darkness and death in which assassins and their minions reside in order to return he must dig up his tools and his coins symbolic of his past life as an assassin having been sent down to hell he had been reborn only to die when he buries moynahan the dramatis personae he meets during his descent to the world of death are likened to the souls who come to the shore of the styx river to be ferried by charon and was then miraculously returned to life the burial of daisy faintly suggests the greek god of fertility the opposite of charon the portrayal of the assassins is shot in the light of suspended disbelief symbols of those who take life descend to hell and buy their way back to the real world the imagery is brilliant and never misses a beat all of the assassins strangely want him to return as if he is lucifer himself and they express joy and legitimate fear that he is backegthe cleaner the concierge at the continental whose name is charon because the producer knew that the audience needed the symbolism dumbed down kr was apparently the best of all each of them must admit but the question that tortures them is why he has returnedthey have never tasted the purity of real lifeso has he returned because the real world could not satisfy or is it the reality of the assassins dreamworld that has drawn him back this is the tension which is played out on the edge of a knife the images of the film pass from real to dreamlike and back again one has to reorient and accept that both are false the assassins consider themselves professionals while kr who has perspective on this murderous world knows their evil nature the coins used by the assassins as their only currency and are a brilliant allusion to the ferryman charon of greek myth who is paid to ferry the deceased across the river styx to paradise the coins are used exclusively by assassins in place of money because fundamentally these trained assassins dont need moneysince money is only valuable in this worldand charon does not take but a coin for his ferry they need the coin for that is their lot in life to need to traverse the river in a campy scene kr finds a puppy again in an unnecessary hit the audience over the head image signifying his return to this world after banishing death from this world,reality

my throwback thursday isnt going so far back only to last year of early april when the anticipated was released i dont think it got the recognition it deserves here in the uk being released more than six months after the us date in september 2014 i remembered seeing the trailers back in early 2014 and was fortunate enough to be excited enough to catch it at the cinema when it was finally released here which only lasted about two weeks theres so much to love about this film the comic book style mythology the gunplay the muscle cars and the actually lack of script it has a strong cast and also boost a superb soundtrack and score from tyler bates and le castle vania tracks like m86s in my mind and marilyn mansons killing strangers suit the film perfectly the film just oozes style and cool along with ultraviolence the title character is superbly introduced by allowing us to meet before the urban legends unearth around him all because of that classic dont know who youre messing with premise automatically earns that hardcase personal of someone you really dont want to upset similar to characters like takens bryan mills and the equalizer retired hes someone that just wants peace and quiet until a situation awakens that dormant volcano of violence we meet other characters of the world and quickly understand that people either like respect or fear possibly all three at the same time the local police doormen and other underworld business proprietors pretty much everyone that matters knows who and what is and only the ultra brave and equally stupid go up against him hes the baba yaga of course but not exactly the boogeyman michael nyqvist ghost protocol the girl with series is the russian mob boss with game of thrones alfie allen as his idiotic son who makes the fatal mistake of stealing car gives him a beating and kills his puppy unknowing who is evoking a path of carnage we meet chopshop john leguizamo waste disposal david kelly patrick the crow commando the cool continental hotel owner ian mcshane and resident doctor matrixs keymaker randall duk kim not forgetting fellow sniper willem dafoe as with a lot of keanus movies there is a lack of script but it works sometimes answering with silences that gives more impact than the telephone tough guy pitch it enforces the idea that theres so much brewing under that black suit of his i have always been a firm believer that letting other people boast about your abilities is more effective than it coming from horses mouth this is a classic example its a directorial debut for stuntfight coordinatordouble chad stahelski whos worked on the matrix series 300 and even the more recent captain america civil war which would explain the action the bullet ballets and realistic punchups its raw fighting nothing fancy or over thetop and uses military grade tactics keanu doing most if not all of the stunts is fast becoming a cult film with a stream of fans awaiting the announced sequel keanu reeves has done what brandon lee did with the crow 1994 in fact i only discovered writing this that director stahelski got his break doubling for lee after the tragic accident ive even dressed my gtav avatar to look like him with matching cars it makes me play better honest its dont what you did that angers me so its who you did it torunning time 9 the cast 9 performance 8 direction 9 story 8 script 9 creativity 9 soundtrack 10 job description 10 the extra bonus points 10 for a refreshing urban myth of an antihero having all the right ingredients for the perfect actioner 92 910,reality
the filmmakers of looked at action movies and figured out a way to make them better what if you cut everything that the movie didnt need  the love interest the convoluted plot and the moralizing whats left is a pure action movie without anything it doesnt need they knew people liked choreographed action sequences and they filled the movie with plenty of them in subtle ways it makes advances in the genre for example notice how characters react when they hear the name  theyre instantly terrified the one thing that i wanted that the film didnt give me was something truly original unlike the matrix or inception which really changed action movies this movie doesnt but man if it doesnt change the game it plays the game like a true master,reality
a heartracing action thriller movie starring keanu reeves as the main antagonist follows the path of a recent widower whos trained assassin past is reborn as russian thugs steal his car and destroy the gift his late wife left him to be remembered by succeeds in its simplicity a combination of fluid fight scenes and an epic soundtrack headlined by marilyn mansons killing strangers creates the tense feeling of a blockbuster action movie despite having a relatively straight forward plot it works sufficiently in setting up a situation where the rest of the greatness can happen  stylized and awesome fight sequences where goes through multiple kills in a short period of time most noticeably within the red circle nightclub where ability to perform multiple head shots is displayed expertly combining all stereotypical action movie elements whilst raising the bar substantially path of vengeance sees him rest at a hotel for international assassins whilst one by one eliminating the enemies which stand in his way and the companions of his target iosev viggos son willem dafoe alfie allen ian mcshane and lance reddick all lead a noble supporting cast michael nyqvist was made to play villains as seen as the razor sharp viggo portrayed in compared to films such as taken doesnt reinvent the notorious revenge actionthriller genre but contributes massively as one of the best action films seen in the last few years has laid the foundations for a highly anticipated action franchise and fans of the movie wont have to wait long as the sequel will be released in 2017 subsequently this good intentioned assassin film is a must watch and is overall a stand out film amongst its competitors lets hope the man you send to kill the boogeyman can top his performance in the sequel,reality
one of the best revenge movies out one thing i really like is the shootouts keanu trained with real tactical trainers using real guns im a gun guy so seeing movies with guns really turn me off because what they are doing is not practical there is a youtube video of keanu shredding at three gun thats where you are going through a course using a rifle handgun and shotgun people are comparing it to taken with liam nesson i think it is a better movie then taken there is good acting not only from keanu but also alfie allen theon from game of thrones michael nyqvist and willem dafoe below is a link of keanu shooting three gun competition httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvtpr8oqyjkic,reality
writing a review for the first time and several months after watching this movie i just wanted to share my feelings about this moviei have to say i never expected keanu reeves at this level on an action movie since the first matrix certainly he has had some films out since then but those are not even close to this one i really enjoyed all the action scenes and the world of darkness in which all these hit men live i want to know more of it more from the characters more about the history of the continental and im pretty sure everyone wants to see more of the boogeymanis a solid movie with a great argument great action sequences an understandable motivation and  last but not leasta great keanu i cant wait for the already announced sequel,reality
hearing nothing but good things about the sleeper action film 2014 i figured the high praise was enough give this one a go let me start by saying nothing in this movie disappoints the premise is ridiculous the flick knows its off the rails and what makes it work is that it simply does not care what you think the people behind the revenge picture might as well have added a disclaimer that reads sit down shut up enjoy and with that being said holy body count was this a nonstop funfest even my lady liked it thats saying somethingreeves starts off as a sympathetically stoic widower having a tough time dealing with the loss of his ailing wife moynahan keeping to himself very little is given about his backstory other than he has a sweet ass car and an adorable new puppy at times the opening feels like they were going for the sappy levels we succumbed to in the gut wrenchingly somber intro of up 2009 but that all comes to a screeching halt once the son of a russian mob boss allen takes an unhealthy interest in car while filling up at a gas station word to the wise dont mess with another mans ride after breaking into his home and stealing amongst other horrific acts the beloved vehicle much much more is of past life slowly simmers to the surface and eventually leads to an all out boilover of who this relatively quiet man truly was and it just keeps getting better from therethis movie was drag out blood and guts slambam add more silly terms at your leisure from the end of act one on and it doesnt let up until the final shot normally this can be tedious and ineffective but the world that opens up to the viewer is so well crafted that it leaves the audience clamoring for more the supporting cast is amazing as well dropping familiar faces into this gumbo of awesome at a steady but not over saturated pace rough gritty and self aware of its coocoo bananas plot the filmmakers put together a production that comes with a slick polish all the while throwing everything they could at the screen without apology i havent seen a movie this confident in a crazy premise since jason statham ran amok in crank 2006,reality
the acting seemed a little bit hammy im not sure what hammy means or where it is derived anyway a little bit hammythe scenes were pretty stylish and had a neveau feel to them i give it good stars here because it was some deviation from hollywood and that it what people are trying to achieve these days on that it was pretty good but on the story line for me it went astraytoo much violence and lacking subtlety right if youve seen it then youll know he takes out 12 people in the first encounteri mean come on yeah we have all seen rambo 3 some of us liked that for the humour value but i think this film was going for realism and on that card it kind of went askew into fantasyall this money pumped into a film for all this violence over the death of a little puppy i mean i think we need to be questioning what we are entertaining in our minds here 3 stars,reality
the only thing i can say about this movie is awesome the whole buildup as to why started to kill in the first place might seem a bit stupid but you forget the reason soon after he started the assassins code the hotels the coins only when you watch you will get all of this but i have to say you will be amazed at the wonderful and classy world they have built for the assassins t there is not much to say honestly im not a professional reviewer but im very hard to please when it come to action movies this one is beautiful but also actionable you wont loose anything watching it and when you watched it for a day or so you will think and think about the world they built up how amazing it would be to live in that world the backstory they hint oh the backstory they give you hints and tips about johns past which just makes you keep wondering and wondering about everything and keeps you wanting a followup to this movie,reality
very lousy acting and poor plot that makes me remember the old school shoot em up games full of weapons bullets and muscle carsthe lack of connection between the different parts make of this movie a patchwork with its incongruous parts and elements i cant even compare this movie with taken because the two are in completely different levels starting by the acting and the plausibility of neesons character compared to i enjoyed taken in opposition to this very disappointing movieempty of substance this movie relies only on the main actor and a lot of random violence to give you something that in my opinion its not worth your precious time,reality
this movie is the beginning of a franchise and an almost perfect film in and of itself there is so little dialogue in this film but this is not a bad thing it gives you a break from the exposition heavy origin stories that are so tiring the action starts from minute one and never stops the editing set design and acting let you know everything you need to know we dont need back story we dont need exposition we know how bad ass is in every scene hes in keanu reeves shines more than any film hes ever been in hes more bad ass than in the matrix more likable than in constantine this is the role he was born to play woah hes the antihero weve all been waiting for him to play and he does it with aplomb hes an unabashed killer and you will be rooting for him every second of the way is the boogeyman,reality
although this viewer has not seen many other works of reeves i can see he is an experienced actor getting himself back into the big films reeves stars in the allout action packed the film shows the events of an ex hitman who comes out of retirement to seek revenge on the russian mafia who stole his last chance to find solace in his grief over his late wifethe film is filled with nonstop violence which presents reeves matrix acrobatic skills as he takes down highly trained assassins what make the film most fun is how the violence is shown for example the acrobatic skills and moves performed by reeves is very admirable and exciting to add style to it as well reeves also pulls the trigger by wearing very smart suits which makes the action very cleanthankfully the film does not resort to all elements of a typical action film the girl the archenemy and frequent defeats the film also displays beautiful cinematography and stunning visual effectsunfortunately the story is all not fixed to me the film felt like the middle of a story lacking an introduction and a revolving ending also reeves performs more with his body and less with his voice which weakens the actors performance the film is also very cold and dark which gives the audience the same feelingto all lovers the first 15 minutes of this film is not for you to action enthusiasts this film completely deliversto summarise is not a must see but a cracking good watch and is the action of the year,reality
review after listening to all of the hype surrounding this movie im glad that i finally got to watch it the plot was a bit weird but i enjoyed the matrix style gun tooting action the last few keanu reeves movies have shown a moody side to his acting compared to the earlier days of bill  ted and i must admit im kind of liking it his no nonsense demeanor really worked as but there script was a bit sketchy anyway the movie is about a ex assassin who has recently lost his wife and become a recluse in his house with his which his wife got delivered to him after she passed away whilst filling up his car at a petrol station some russian gangsters offer him money for his car but he kindly turns them down and he goes on his way this is were the plot was a bit weak in my opinion for some random reason the russian gangsters turn up at his house and they beat him up take his car and kill his i was hoping that there was going to be a twist in the story which would make that aspect make sense but they were just being total out of order anyway keanu reeves decides to go on a killing rampage trying to get to the culprit who killed his but he has to go through the russian mafia which puts his life in danger along with his close friends the storyline is pretty straight forward but there are a few elements that were a bit sketchy to me now hes supposed to be an untouchable assassin who people call the boogeyman but he was getting beat up near to death in most of the action scenes i dont know if the director was trying to make it seem realistic or not but the way that some of the characters was describing is yet to be seen ok he was going around by himself causing havoc in new york but if it wasnt for willem dafoe he would have died a few times in the film with that aside i did like the action scenes and the whole dark intense feel to the film really worked there definitely has to be a sequel because the character is really needed in hollywood at the moment enjoyableroundup i really cant believe that keanu reeves is 51 and its now that hes decided to become a action hero i suppose its after all the training from the matrix movies anyway his movie career started in 1986 in the popular youngblood ice hockey movie with rob lowe and patrick swayze but he really hit the big time with the bill  ted movies in 1989 after getting branded as a comedic actor which he didnt like he decided to turn to action movies with point break in 1991 and speed in 1994 in between those movies he took the lead in brams stokers dracula which didnt go down well with the critics because of his accent and little buddha which also was a bit of a failure but he bounced back with the devils advocate and of course the matrix trilogy since then he has struggled to find a genre that he was comfortable with and he starred in various movies like hard ball sweet november and the gift constantine had mixed reviews along with scanner darkly which was a brand new way of filming and then he came out with two disappointing films which were generation um and henrys crime recently he has turned to action movies like man tai chi which he directed 47 ronin and of course this movie which he plans to star in a sequel in total his movies have grossed nearly 3billion so he has had a impressive career to date hes never been comfortable around the whole hollywood scene but he has proved to be a bankable star even though he doesnt like to admit it anyway this film was directed by chad stahelski whose done the stunts in over 70 movies which include point break the matrix trilogy spiderman 2 die hard 4 rambo x men iron man 2 the expendables tron legacy sherlock holmes and the hunger games so he really does have a impressive portfolio when it comes to stunt coordinating this is his first movie in the directing chair and after its success he plans direct the sequel hopefully with a meaningful storyline anyway for his first project i was quite impressed with the result and i cant wait to see causing more havoc againbudget 20million worldwide gross 79millioni recommend this movie to people who are into their actionthrillers about a exassassin who seeks revenge after russian gangsters kill his and steal his car 610,reality
i didnt know what i was going to get when i bought this on br sure keanu is cool some times and so is mr dafoe but what about the rest what about the story this isnt a scifi or fantasy movie where keanu seems to pick good onesso what is this movie its a 2010s version of a 1980s revengeaction movie it gets bloody soon enough and stays that way till the end you are not going to have much to think about in fact the only thing i would constantly do while watching this was smiling with satisfaction for the action i was watching in a movie what was more impressive about it was that at no point it felt boring as many action movies do even when they have lots ofaction probably unnecessary warning but this is not for the young ones it gets very violent and graphic all the time i rarely place a movie in my favorite list especially if it is an action movie but oh my this is one good solid entertainment piece,reality
is a rare example of hollywood getting things spoton when it comes to creating the nearperfect action film is a relentless pulsepounding thriller that has plenty of similarity to the liam neeson classic taken albeit with a more simplistic and also more emotionally intense plot line this is the kind of lean pareddown filmmaking thats all about intensity and momentum it sits well with classic international fare like point blank sleepless night mea culpa the man from nowhere and the raid filmsisnt a perfect film some of the dialogue is sloppily some of the writing is too broad and occasionally the music is intrusive however when it gets things right as it frequently does you can forgive all of these minor niggles and sit back and enjoy the ride the clever decision was made to employ a martial arts expert as director so the emphasis is on realistic superbly choreographed action sequences and theyre hardhitting and plentiful the nightclub setpiece is the obvious highlight but nearly all of the action here is spectacularkeanu reeves has been in lots of average or overrated films over the years but this stands as one of his very best alongside speed his dry laconic turn is light years ahead of his other recent action flick man of tai chi the supporting cast is basically unnecessary but michael nyqvist willem dafoe and alfie allen all put in decent turns in the end though is all about the action and quite simply it rocks bring on the sequel,reality
i found the film increasingly predictable and tedious as it went along but it was still worth a watch in a noiresurreal sort of way just to see what sort of stunts the director would pull off but these comments are posted just to let you know that isnt half as good as it should or could have beenthe film didnt quite work it didnt have enough tongueincheek ridiculousness in it to classify it in the same breath as kill bill and there wasnt enough technical believability to make it into a valid matrix clonethe film seemed to be centred around neo being the one and having some sort of super power that made him biggerbetterfaster than everyone else but whereas i could believe that in other films i couldnt believe it here all he did was brood keanu reeves didnt even look the part nor tough enough nor capable of half the things he didit was too farfetched to be enjoyable and even though credit goes out to the director for knowing the film was too farfetched and playing to those strengths but it wasnt original cheeky or tongueincheck enough to make it shine as anything other than an average and unrealistic rambocommando type of action flick even the russian gangsters were corny and clichdweve seen it all before and if you want to make a ridiculous film like this work then you have to approach it in a completely ott manner like kickass here they kicked russian butt and kicked it some more and it was ridiculous and please remind me why even did it something to do with a puppy from his dead wife being killed and having interrupted the grieving processin the end it mildly insulted my intelligence in a fastandthefurious sort of way but im still giving it 610 for its valiant attempt,reality
keanu reeves it is a name closely associated with career defining roles and missed opportunities he has had some of the top fan favorite roles and cultural icons over the last twenty five years from neo the matrix trilogy to ted bill  teds excellent adventure john constantine constantine to jack traven speed he has been a part of science fiction remakes the day the earth stood still expiramental animation a scanner darkly and horror bram stokers draculamr reeves has shown an acting range from the dramatic comedy and physical action though he has had a tremendous career his characters have tended to flat and a little unbelievablesure he proved in speed that he could be an action star in the watcher that he could be creepy and could handle lead acting duties in a franchise with the matrices though his roles had become diminished over the last five years though his performances have never been bad the expectations that surround him have always been out of reach then came john as of late mr reeves has begun a comeback of sorts the phrase of sorts is used as his comeback is not finished yet it started with man of tai chi and 47 ronin and has continued into it has the feel of a role that is perfect for mr reeves acting abilities is a character who is dark and brooding the character is not put into a position where he would express happiness he is angry sad and on the verge of grief throughout the film mr reeves ability to perform choreographed action scenes is put on display here these range from intense fighting scenes to wonderfully choreographed shootouts to elaborate set pieces that border extravagant but dont cross the lineseveral times throughout the film the fight scenes are set up in a manner that allow mr reeves to perform in a flawless manner this is done by letting the camera roll as opposed to the standard practice constant cuts during filming and letting the editors piece together a fight scene the director of keeps the camera rolling and allows the audience to experience john physical struggle and exhaustion these are not simple fight scenes either in a couple of instances the actors are having to perform dozens of physical moves while the camera demands perfection mr reeves not only succeeds at this but also helps to show the believability that he is capable of in the right circumstancesone can only hope that this movie will continue to place mr reeves in strong roles that he is more than capable of continuing to play it is a definite treat to see mr reeves at his best again,reality
has all the makings of a decent mediocre action flick but is utterly and completely ruined by the crippledfake russian and some bad dialogue choices the style of subtitles however suggests it can still be enjoyed as a grittygoofy comedy since the dramatic element is hard to maintain in this state with such level of detail offered to stunts and choreography which is to be expected in a film made by two stunt coordinators its even more frustrating to see or rather hear that all the dialect departments work has been futile or non existent at times i guess 15 years into xxi century it is still too much to ask hollywood to consider showing their foreign lines to an expert andor dubbing them at least if native speaking actors are not an option it doesnt even have to be an expert really of course all of this in poses no threat to those unaffected by understanding of russian,reality

i watch a lot of action and a lot of horror movies the more you watch of a certain genre the more picky you get well at least me most movies are just ok thats the sad truth most movies are neither horrible nor excellentthen along comes pretty much from the first second i just liked it the atmosphere is great keany reeves is great its crisp it doesnt waste your time normally a movie might start real good then dip down or a movie starts badly then gets better starts excellent and it just doesnt let up every scene is good i love animals i dont even eat them p  and if you love animals this movie is such a treat man oh man i have been waiting for a movie like this for i dont know how longthis movie has more head shots than the combined history of call of duty ok maybe not that many but a crapload for sureit is violent the action direction is superb but one of the best things about it which makes it so damn efficient is that the buildup is so darn awesome they do all the right things to get you to understand what kind of ultra badass is it is so expertly done by the actors the reactions the directionive seen naysayers complain about the lack of originality or whatever in and im just sick to freaking death of hearing that if you want originality do something else than watch movies because originality has nothing to do with whether a movie is great or not if the movie is well made and entertaining it is good and is just about as well made and entertaining as action movies getwatch it and if you dont like it youre to blame not john ,reality
keanu reeves is back well its not like he was gone though you could argue his character was in this one before being forced to be back but this might be his best movie in years certainly one he is starring in and i dont mean any disrespect against 47 ronin which couldve been a lot better and im not talking about the poor cgi at places but in generalis kind of an equalizer but different while denzel is clearly the better actor this evens everything up with a choreography that really gives you everything it got gunkata is a term you might have heard a couple of years ago its here again and its no wonder that the two directors have a good relationship with keanu since working with him before a couple of timesgreat guest appearances and really good cinematography this looks great and it has a lot of violence in it if youre down with that go ahead and watch and prepare yourself for the inevitable sequelprequel or whatever comes our way,reality
this film is well made no doubt about it and my reasoning for a low score has everything to do with the subject matter of the antihero the obvious mkultra programing that has been incorporated into the sound design and the message of the theme song which is played more than 3 times through depictions of murder the lyrics whale we dont kill the ones we love then suggests we kill strangers the extremely violent well choreographed scenes of gun play look like a masterful ballet of bullets and blood which made me really wanted to like this movie and i commend the filmmakers for their skill set however i guarantee future shootings and random acts of violence will source this as material of encouragementthe story subtly suggests that the antihero is not one to idolize but quickly is countered in its sound designtruly questionable material i would not recommend for children or teens or anyone easily influenced by manipulation,reality
it has been a long time since ive seen an actionrevenge movie as enjoyable as and those who know me well are aware of just how much i love a good revenge story it looked like it might be fun to watch but i had no idea how much i was going to like itthis was easily one of the most epic collections of choreographed violent episodes i have seen being a lover and an owner of a beagle since she was a little puppy that only made it all that much better to watch someone exact the most out of proportion vengeance for the loss of a this isnt something youd want to watch if youre looking for something intellectually stimulating but it is something i would recommend anyhow,reality
it was an ok movie but nothing we have not seen before a 100 times was kinda hoping for a bit more same old tough guy butt kicking act that you see in most cheapo films like i said nothing even faintly original about it about some russian who kill his and now he really flips out and starts shooting a lot of people would have been better if they gave it some kind of crazy twist like kill bill then it might have been in the running i guess that is the producers fault for lacking a bit of insight to see that a whole bunch of killing can become a bit mundane if there is not a good enough twist added to the movie in short if i could have my time back i would most definitely not even have bothered wasting it on this movie,reality
a loud action movie with a depressed kr acting a getting wild ex hitman shooting everybody down completely  completely  bullshit unrealistic unnecessarily stupid boring lining up of bad action sequences i love action movies  also the bad ones but this is just trash  no even a bclass one very disappointing kr should pay attention what he plays in the futureaeh the story youre asking for hitmans gets killed  he kills the dogkiller and all the hit men his father is paying  which is about a hundredno twist no clue no fun  watch hitman again and you treat yourself better,reality

is no exception so i finally got to seeing this hyped up movie and meh just another generic clone of mission impossible and other such movies in the staple of spyassassinwhere as more series depicts the sociopathy ie driver by ryan gosling the bond movies leon the professional assassin bendaras stallone and stoneface acting which reeves mastered ala matrix however excellent examples of so called gun kata the fluidity of strikes and evasions are abundantthe currency and underground society and infrastructure of the assassin world was a creative touchi expected more from the stonewall expert that reeves is mediocre film,reality
the only reason ive given this two stars is that unbelievably ive seen worse films but not manywhen the action is so over the top and plain stupid with a driving soundtrack that never lets up it just becomes a borefest glad its over,reality
is my personal favorite keanu reeves movie as it has everything that he is best at spectacular stunts and actually great acting with chad stahelski directing the movie it couldnt have been bad choreography or action sequences as thats the background he came from and it shows in the incredible choreography and action sequences that mixes martial arts and gun fu which is a blast to watch derek kolstad wrote the movie and it isnt really that original script but it works perfectly for the action genre but where his writing shines is the world he built from the assassin network to the characters simply amazingthe ensemble cast is my other favorite thing about the movie having keanu reeves as the main character is never wrong having michael nyqvist and alfie allen as the villains was perfect as they portrayed the villain roles perfect and michael shined the most of the two stunning performance there is a lot of other interesting characters that are played by ian mcshane and willem dafoe isnt either wrong simple to say its a fantastic cast with a list actorsthis movie is personally one of my favorite action movies of all time it has everything an action movie should have and much more just the fight choreography is something i could rewatch this for and mixing it with the suspenseful story helps a lot,reality
the movie came in with perfect intentions for to do the needed damage i was very excited for his reign but this boogeyman killer shadowman looked a little rusty maybe because of his retirementi did root for all the way through but when the bad guys clearly have more than one chance to easily kill him and they dont but instead decide to throw him around it makes me feel a little awkwardsome shallow choreography in the shoot outs it seems is the only one that can shoot straight except that is when he has his first clear shot at his main target hahaalso seems hes the only hitman who can see his opponents first more especially when hes walking from room to room  wall to wall shooting them like targetsalso the arbitrary rules of a code between all the community of hitmenwomen was up in the air and disconnected from any of the stories momentumin an action movie all these details make a huge difference on the pay offall this production needs is a good script and better choreography,reality
i like keanu but the scrip for this movie is incredibly banal the soundtrack is trashy this is just another simplified action movie and there is nothing you havent already seen i expected more because of the solid ratings that this movie has and i was quite disappointed,reality
with a basic look at action movies looks like a regular action movie but when you watch it you can tell that its more than your basic action movie it has moments where its character driven and you really get a sense on why the chracters act the way that they do and we really see this emphasised with john as we feel his pain and we understand his character and we know and care about him and we can devote time and effort into caring about himkeanu reeves is the perfect cating choice for this movie he can kick so much ass and i have to say that i cant think of anyone to play this role he just does so much and puts in effort and care for thre character and i love how he can go from someone who seems soft especially all the stuff with the characters wife and then become the scary hitman who could kill you in 5 seconds and that is quite some acting and i could honestly talk about great keanu reeves is in this role for so long that he goes for me from being a actor who i thought was good to being one that i want to see more movies with him in themalso in the cast is michael nyqvistalfie allenwillem dafoeadrianne palickidean wintersdaniel bernhardttoby leonard moorebridget moynahan and lance reddick while the supporting cast was good they really are over shadowed to keanu reeves and they are good i just dont think they were the most dynamic cast and had a rushed time on screen but really they could have been used a little morefor me was good there was some pacing issues for me in some of the parts where i thought they were trying to pan the run time but thats really what i thought and i really liked this the final act was one of my favorite final acts in a action movie from recent years and the action scences involving the gunplay was great and the hand to hand combat was also very well done they have done it in such a way where i can really belive that the action was real and overall the movie delivered on the action violence and the drama all in one and i thought that overall was very enjoyable and defiently a action must watch,reality
i saw here people complaining about simple plotline no twists and little dialogue maybe they expected something like no country for old men well no its not that type of movie its great though simple plot great camera shots script does not try to come in the way of entertainment combat scenes  awesome believable intense in this category its almost masterpiece if only bad guys were more interesting itd be 1010,reality
john tahelskis action trilogy is every fan boys wet dream he clearly ought to be one of them to justify and glorify the characters like such on screen his old productive textbook methods are testament to why it works and we nod so effervescently in his every possible scenario even though it raises questions every now and then this people pleasing entertainment has one and only one reason to communicate it so thoroughly and its tendency to lean towards the mythological aspect of the characters despite of being dipped into a pragmatic mafia world it makes sure that there is one key to every lock one moon and one sun that shines over these surprisingly loyal and professional businessmen on that note the amiability of it to grasp that theme and beam us back to our childhood days stahelski is successful in his workin fact personally i feel the lead to be eerily similar to the comic character heman he too has a pet animal and is incredibly feared by his enemies something that stahelski has got it right on the mark the build up of his presence on a room or even a mention of his that makes others writhe on the spot is so precious for this storytelling to move forward that stahelski has made its priority and with reaves a smart casting choice since he already has such a reputation on the realm he can sleep peacefullyand yes it is for every man himself reeves never turns off the switch he oozes power chic panache and flamboyancy in his body language to own the surrounding the car the gun and the hype the entire movie hangs on a single moment that it is built towards a moment where finally reeves accepts his fate and claims the title that everyone has been giving him something that you would encounter in a mythology and that of course because of brilliant execution is one of the best shot scenestahelski coming from a stunt department the action leaves you in an awe of it from imputing humor and bedazzling moments in this gore visual galore of his the camera work is purely stupendous and this is probably the only reason why it aches you to encounter a disappointing final act since the choreography is neither clean nor is it shot perfectly enough to give even a vague idea to map around ones mind the supporting characters are balanced and well bred with antics that are derived from their equations dafoe palicki and nyqvist stands out alone for their lethalnessstahelskis theme resonates more like goddard the creator of marvels daredevil than it does with wachowski brothers which is surprising since he came from that background another appealing aspect of it is the cleanliness its huge neat production set and props that makes you want to pick up the gun and shoot out wild is not pushing any boundary in cinematic world it respects and accepts its place and delivers the best knockout there is,reality
i have mixed feelings about this movieon the plus side it was perfectly cast the reptilian keanu reeves as the reptilian is spot on the other main characters are also quite believable in their respective roles 1010 for characterizationon the negative side the action sequences basically the whole movie was extremely well choreographed and fun to watch however the way kills literally dozens of attackers without being seriously injured himself strains credulity and really bugs me 410 for believabilityhowever i allow that this movie was not meant to be taken too seriously but to be enjoyed at face value so i will average the two and give it a 7,reality
what can i say the triller is interesting and when you watch it you will never sorrydont mess with me orlol,reality

i dont think this is much of a spoiler that the the first person shooter video game scene in the movie does not just draw a parallel to what this movie is made of but also meant as a selfaware criticism of our era and what mindless consumption has been doing to us would be a tired attempt at copping out to defend hypocrisythat said the choreography scenery and cinematography itself are so good that you cannot take your eyes off the movie the tempo along with the captivating photography works like a drug the choice and use of color in this movie was probably what immersed me in it the mostthere is this heartbreaking scene at the beginning that was hard for me to watch as opposed to a horror flick it was very real and traumatic tears welled up in my eyes i only advise you to watch this one if you are aware of and thus not vulnerable to this problem of desensitizationi could have rated this higher and said the same thing but i feel that film makers directors writers and producers are all included abuse their expertise and initiatives too much to boost the influence they have over their audience selfishly denying any responsibility they should be having for others by opting to exploit their vulnerabilities such as the need to have good time as there is little free time or the need for instant gratification as delicious and harmful as a snack dipped in all the wrong things for a healthy body,reality
having seen the second film first from redbox i was hesitant to turn back with this action film john starts the film as a beat up and depressed white privilege like it says he is coming out of retirement as a retiree he is sitting pretty he had a home decorator come in and his house looks like a womans home he has those decorative pillows from pier 1 and some candles he lost his wifegf so hes depressed clearly he misses his woman he gets a puppy to cheer himself up john doesnt really understand he feeds the a bowl of cereal then he gets knocked out by a bunch of thugs in the dark in his house and they off his he is a damn fool for not locking his doors considering he is an assassin alarm system strangely his fighting skills disappear during this time also it is clear he is not a light sleeper out for revenge digs up his old suitcase of assassin guns he broke his oath of weapon chastity obviously he should of known his career would never be over when people hate his guts considering his weapons he has a variety of sizes he usually likes the big black ones ive also seen him put an extender on the handheld he doesnt like the fully automatic because he wants to move it himself he oils them up and cocks them for good measuring i can tell hes a pro after i watched the matrix then he goes and kicks ass for a 1 minute fight seen after that he goes to that hotel from the second movie i got bored with the repetitive rhetoric and couldnt watch the rest four stars,reality

this movie was incredible the plot was pretty simple but they were able to make a simple plot an awesome movie this movie has your attention from the beginning this movie was a solid 9 for the simple fact that the action was awesome and the characters did a great job acting the movie took a turning point for me when i realized marcus william defoe was still being a good friend i didnt know how this movie would stand out until then,reality

i liked this film because it follows the formula of revenge but its not terribly boring it feels somewhat fresh there are good believable performances and it manages to hold your interest at a medium level for the entire film some of it feels original as well i like that the gun work is amazing the fight scenes are good and the create a world that feels believable i was able to suspend disbelief for a little while and enjoy this world to many film today operate with the premise that the audience knows its all fake a good film draws you in and makes you believe in the theme of the story the plight of the characters and their emotions id say this film has some success in doing this,reality
i finally got around to seeing folks say you should see the this one before seeing the 2nd the movie is exciting enough the soundtrack is loud and seems to ebb and flow with the level mr killing carnage mr reeves is certainly looking good for age 52 and is impressive as he jumps around wrestling and killing folks i will never get the concept of someone going off to war because someone kills his and steals his car but you certainly dont have to understand that to enjoy the movie im not sure how many of these movies they can keep making without giving the character a little more emotional resonance the way it looks now is some kind of natural step between humans making and directing movies and artificial intelligence taking over the movie making,reality
the first 10 minutes of the movie are somehow misleading you may think that youre watching a dark drama driven by revengefortunately more than unfortunately i guess this is not the case it is a pop movie made to please the audience in a tongueinchick manner you enter the world of mobsters and payed assassins where everyone is known everyone goes to the same place for entertainment follows rules and is slick and understanding like cheers where everybody knows your name so this isnt a movie to be taken seriously its just for fun and after numerous killings lame martial arts moves and macho one liners you get exactly thatall the clichs you know well from thousands other movies are here too the villain so to speak because everyone is a villain instead of killing his captured victim right away and solve all of his problems in an instant starts blubbering philosophical bs and chooses an unconventional way to kill him instead of lets say a bullet in the headso is that kind of the movieis it entertaining well yes i think so i wasnt bored for the most part i learn quickly to ignore the plot holes and just tried to enjoy itoverall its a popcorn movie so go get your popcorn ps fun fact eva longoria is one of the producers,reality
watching i was sure that this was a project offered first to sylvester stallone stallone was just the kind of guy to go to war with the russian mob and win as keanu reeves does hereis a retired hitman and walked away from the life of crime because of the love of a good woman the good woman dies but has a sent to reeves as a remembrance actually i can sort of understand that i recently acquired a cat from someone who was close to me and died unexpectedly if i had keanus killing skills i might do what he doesbut definitely this was a role that cried for rambo as keanu plows through the russian mob the son of the mob leader tries to rip off keanus car and beats him up in the process and kills the that last remembrance of his wife puts him over the edge and then look out russiansi did find it hard to wrap my mind around the concept of an organized crime safe house where reeves takes up residence while he does his thing an interesting part is played by adrianne palicki as a female hit woman who wants to show up the men in the profession by taking down the guy who was number one ditto for willem dafoe playing an old associate of reeves in the murder businesskeanus fans will enjoy this action fans who like lots of blood and gore in their cinema will like it still stallone would have pulled this off better,reality
keanu reeves acting talent was wasted for this poorly written rolethe movie is just killing every russian guy with very poor dialogue and almost nonexistent plotalso the action scenes werent that great very average in my opinion,reality

edly actionpack entertainment is what brings the movie instantly y wakeyd me up with its noholds barred bravado tone kudos to director chad stahelski for his masterful action orchestration of the picture stars a sensational keanu reeves yes you heard right as the title character is a former russian mafia hitman who seeks allout vengeance on his former boss son for stealing his car and killing his puppy beagle hey i am a beagle owner myself so i can empathize with i would go bezerk if someone hurt my beagle is pretty much a badass oneman army in seeking his revenge as he battles an entire russian mafia army sure it goes overthetop at times but who cares the action sequences is the paramount of the picture keanu reeves has never been better i dont know what kind of red or blue acting pills he took to prepare for this but it worked the always great willem dafoe also delivers a hit performance as a former accomplice of and michael nyqvist delivers a good performance as the baddie head russian mafia honcho viggo tarasov so hopefully i have ed you up before i gogo and have convinced you to take a shot at  excellent,reality
if youre asking me if is entertaining the answer would be a resounding yes the action is fantastic throughout most of the film the gunplay is some of the best in modern cinema and the unique elements of the film make for a combination of intrigue and strange humor that make the fairly short movie a joy to watch if youre asking me if is a good quality movie the answer is more of a meh not really but its not bad the acting is almost nonexistent seemingly by design to fit keanu reeves style the plot is about as generic as they come and the ending is laughable during the first 90 of the film they made an effort to be as realistic as possible that end sequence almost erased all of it it was still an entertaining movie but i was hoping for more,reality
tv labeled this as suspense so i thought this would be serious action movie like die hard or an overthetop seagal movie from 90s where the good guy wipes the floor with everyone even arnolds movies had good plots total recall made sense terminator or were lighthearted swashbuckling action like true lies instead this was a comedy scene after scene i couldnt believe it i thought may be its supposed to be a parody of the 80s and 90s movies1 it starts out nice but then he drives around the airport like its supposed to be a challenge driving fast in wideopen spaces2 he got no alarm or any safety on his house and gets ambushed like a complete amateur by guys wearing hard soled shoes his excuse was that he was rusty but only a day later he is not rusty any more but without any practice he kills 12 people which brings me to 3 this rusty guy has an aimbot in his brain and hand and kills everyone with headshot despite incredible speeds at which action must be moving when a dozen people attack you at the same time4 everyone in new york knows him everyone is afraid of him even cops people at hotel garage owners and russian mafia but only the son doesnt know him in the end i was expecting the mafia guy to contact corrupt army general who sends drones to attack but when the radar recognizes the computer sets and locks the autopilot to fly back home5 when he attacks the son and the vigo his aim goes bad due to signal jamming6 this war machine foolishly leaves curtains open so any twobit sniper can take him out from 100 meters7 he lets the woman sneak up to him again while sleeping without again setting some kind of personal alarm 8 bad guys shoot him 3 times in the club instead of unloading 2030 bullets in the guy that just killed half the club he shrugs 3 shots easily carries no armor9 he is in wide open space only 2 guys manage to hit him when someone is about to shoot from behind he feels the aim and turns and instantly shoots the bad guy10 he does all this for a but before the film is over and the bones havent even decomposed he find another like he has already forgotten about the old onethats how much he loved himthis is only what i can remember right now im sure there is more this movie full of fantasy scenes strange motivations inconsistent characters and old plots vigo and his bad son  strange assassin operation i bet they tried to get morgan freeman to play the black guy at the reception desk etc doesnt deserve anything but criticism or these idiots will continue to put out movies like this i gave it 210 official 7 rating is hilarious obviously fixed with fake accounts and what not i dont know why reeves accepted this job the second movie that is coming out will tank badly,reality
no story to speak of or character development or any memorable line of dialog or surprises a really very shallow script even for recent hollywood standards keanu reeves is ok nothing special the great willem defoe was sadly wasted in a small role theres lots of action but very little suspense villains are dumb mostly just lots of shooting with loud music tiresomebasically a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothingif youre into that sort of thing go ahead i prefer a bit more of thought put into the screenplay ps i think the motivation was more than reasonable and i liked the it was cute,reality
first of all i never intended in seeing this film i only saw this movie because of its good user reviews and rating on some sites oh boy should i had followed my instincts this movie is damn terrible i felt like i was watching a movie from the 80s or a video game the movie was filled with dumb villains and a hero with a big ego the action scene were kind of cool but thats just about it there was an ultimate stupid scene where after had killed so many bad guys the boss had the chance to take him out but instead left him at the hands of two morons you can guess what happen next  he escaped  these kind of plots only exist in the 80s please stay away from and yeppi this is my first review,reality
accomplishes everything that it sets out to it is an action film at the very core and does not muddy the waters with the addition of pointless subplots or heavy complicated storytellingthe plot is very simple revenge thats really all you need to know to be able to appreciate this film if they edited out the first ten minutes of exposition it would not take away from the remaindersome people when reviewing are comparing it to all the wrong films this is not an epic drama or high fantasy set in a wondrous world is simple down to earth action moviethe cinematography is outstanding you can really tell that each shot has been framed exactly the acting admittedly could have been better keanu reeves appears to be playing keanu reeves but thats what he does best and thats what the character of requires as a side note willem dafoe puts in a solid supporting performancenow the action is something that i have not seen in an action movie for a very long time and it had me exhilarated has about him an air of cool calm professionalism whenever he is working this makes the moments when he comes unravelled and boils over that much more compelling suspension of disbelief is required when you actually watch fighting but this is something that you will do eagerly the fights are extremely well choreographed and very fluid there are very few neckbreakingly quick cuts that are now all too popular in action scenesthe gun play is awesome to watch very rarely misses a shot and he doesnt leave the big bads alive to come back and get him the only time he does leave an enemy alive is due to rules outside of his control and killing would leave him in a worse position than leaving her alive he is ruthless and efficientin summary do not judge by any other standards than those which it claims to uphold as an action film it has exceeded,reality
keanu reeves has not been in the lead role of an amazing action film for some time in fact i would go as far back as 1999s the matrix not including its silly sequels that film showed audiences and critics alike that there was still freshness and room for expansion regarding the science fiction genre likewise has the same effect on the action genre the last film truly off of the rails and full of excitement was 1988s die hard yes is that awesomeis an exhitman he is overcome with grief when his wife dies from a fatal illness knowing that she has little time left she leaves john a gift to remind him of her a daisy within the next few days they form a close bond alas it is not to be masked russian gangsters break into his house killing his and stealing his car it is time for to take his revengeif sounds like the next taken film or average revenge tale then you are mistaken this film has style energetic and frenetic fights as well as an actual plot think of it like kill bill with keanu reeves replacing uma thurman in the title role may not be as outrageous as the work of quentin tarantino but it is far more daring and fun than the recent batch of action films from hollywoods generic production line this is what makes stand out from the crowdkeanu reeves in the starring role gives solemnity thus lending him realism as opposed to liam neesons bryan mills from taken who was stapled with clichs we buy reeves character because he is a broken man with nothing left as a result we can sympathise with him iosef the leader of the russians who break into john house is played by an egotistical alfie allen he makes the mistake of triggering john unstoppable anger iosef loses his cool real quick when he realises the gravity of what he has done enter his father played by the sinister michael nyqvist who shows little compassion and love for his son iosef strives to please him leading to some very foolish decisions iosef does not think about the consequences of his actions until it is too late and comes a calling willem dafoe is never less than magnificent his role makes an impression he is johns trustworthy ally and gives him a purpose when no one else in the world willwhat is primarily involved in and the centre of the audiences interest is the fight scenes they take place in a variety of everyday locations a house nightclub hotel secret safe house and even briefly a church do not fear shaky cam is barely present you will actually be able to tell who is punching who this was clear in the bourne ultimatum and anything but in the taken trilogy the action is not a rehash of the films previous set pieces and each one is unique and wholly original in its approach take for example the scene in john house the camera is locked down with wide angles we can take in each punch kick stab and bullet wound with ease makes you feel alive the set piece in the nightclub differs in style as runs towards iosef the camera sways from the left to the right it may prove disorientating to some viewers yet you can always establish what is going on and who the enemy is it does not prove distracting or poorly framed i felt reborn and could revel in each detail to my hearts contentmost action films feel obligated to make it past the two hour mark not all the fat is trimmed off so that only the meat and core of the film remains intact therefore you are not left waiting too long for the next set piece i do have one minor criticism of so minor in fact that it is barely worth mentioning the very first scene feels redundant when you look back on the film however it does not hurt the film and only the most picky audience member will take issue with itthe score by tyler bates and joel l richard compliments john uber cool clothing and look it is in touch with the film and increases the mood and tension to a considerable degree undoubtedly without this elegant score the film would not be half as charming as it isthe cinematography is polished and sophisticated the action takes place within the frame this means you can stay focused without feeling ill you only have to look at the most recent taken outing to see how poorly this can be executedis a top tier action film filled with layered characters confident performances a suave score radiant cinematography and free flowing fist fights this is the best film of its kind since die hard and miles ahead of taken in every aspect if does not become a franchise then generic action flicks be warned i am going to take my revenge upon you,reality
keanu reeves is back with a vengeance a real vengeance is easy to follow reeves having lost his wife and attended her funeral is taking the time to mourn the one he loved an unexpected delivery in the form of a new pet jolts him out of misery that is until a mob of russians break into his house kill his and steal his car they have unleashed the monster in him he tears through new york city leaving a rather large body count in his wake first time directors staheski and leitch makes an incredibly powerful film theyre known in the industry for their stunt coordination skills so its only right that theyre at the helm keanu reeves martial arts is replaced with raw grappling and gritty kills the action is smooth energetic and dynamic reeves is ideal as the wounded hitman saying little and expressing emotion through his brawling the russian gangsters and their boss play a familiar tune viggo nyqvist knows his sons crossed the wrong person humour accompanies his importance as a leader adding value to the films atmosphere topping that is the films rich dark blue hues in every shot giving us a tease of ny citys underground scene i mean who wouldnt want to check in to a hotel where all the other hit men stay is stylish sophisticated and compact a sequel is already in the workscheck out my other reviews on httpstraighttellingcouk,reality
is an action film with video game type shooting scenes but a somewhat barmy plotting keanu reeves makes it watchable despite the scriptis newly widowed and his late wife gifted him a puppy which has been killed by the wayward son of a russian mobster who has also stolen his car however it is soon revealed that is an ace hitman and now he is back to get revenge and get his car backthis means various shooting and fight scenes is the man who the mob would call to kill the boogeyman yet we have scenes where minnows are easily dispensed with but the alpha male somehow survivesthere is a female hitwoman out to get and somehow he leaves her alone to cause further mischief the russian mobster whose son wants to kill is also let go by him when you would have thought it would had been better to shoot him fastit is entertaining schlock the plot is full of holes reeves acting is not stretched he is required to be mean and moody say a few words and do a lot of shooting,reality
the title and cover makes it look like a bgrade movie however the fighting choreography nicely linked with background music and dialogue lines that shall ever be remembered has made in my opinion a stand out of most action movies of the year and even the decade i have seen many many action movies sure the raid2 has better action scenes overall with the fighting choreography with music that sets it alight and the lines have made a great movie it is a definite must watch and must buy1010 it has been a long time since ive seen an action movie where i was like wow this is really really great buy it its worth the money,reality
saw this on dvd thinking that it would be another dull movie staring keanu boy was i wrong this has got to be up there with point break and matrix for his best films to date he stars as the typical action hero  antihero and unlike all the usual crap talk about how hard the main character is in all of tom cruises films this one actually measures up its not stop action all the way and there isnt any stupid cgi to take over the screen or unbelievable action sequences that defy the laws of physics or gravity which is a major bonus in my book if you want a flash to past when action heros were tall mean and shot lots of people then this is the movie for you,reality
did you see payback then stop now because theres nothing new to see and even less talented actorsif you just want body count then youre set with this oneif you want a script actors and decent direction youve already wasted too much time reading this revieware you a keanu fan well you might not be the only one but its a small crowd this is even more keanu than even keanu is worthy of youll seewhy did i give it a 6 because it wasnt quite bad enough to turn off i might have even given a 7 but the ending screwed that off he didnt pick up a stray  he stole someones pet from the vet if the friggin was so important then why didnt he at least take one like what he lost i call bullship on that scene why just why,reality
since i was born because of the influence of my father and grandfather action movies have always played an important role in my knowledge for films as many reviewers have said before at first glance the title for a film seemed ridiculous therefore whenever the movie trailer came out as an advertisement on youtube i would straight away skip it i did watch the trailer once and thought it was terrible to me it made no sense at all however one day i decided to watch it clearly because i had nothing else to watch or do at that time and so my review begins the last good and by good i mean really good action film i saw was lone survivor but for me that a different category not really action on the other hand is pure 100 action no expendables type of action no fast and furious type of action not even james bond type of action this is something else first of all it clearly shows how well keanu reeves trained for this film i dont know if it was kravmaga or something else but it was incredible well done and looked very realistic second of all the story is just very cool i like the fact of how the hotel runs with important rules etc and russian mafia i mean that makes it cool too and just to finish the thriller part plays well in the story and how the actors act great movie for anyone who loves and knows how to appreciate a good action films,reality
this movie totally kicked ass from the wonderful characters to the amazing action scenes the soundtrack was on point it drew the viewer into the movie the hallmark of a good actor is to make you forget the actor and believe the character they are playing keanu is yes the plot was predictable and a little over the top who cares the plot was simple but the pacing and action scenes more than make up for the simplicity of the plot you rooted for john character i could imagine all lovers saying kill em all after the bad guys killed the most adorable puppy ever the only thing that could have maybe helped believe johns motivation for destroying everyone was if more time between him and the was spent together bonding but despite thisthe movie was never boring i never once thought this movie is stupid or rolled my eyes at the ridiculous of it like i have at other movies like expendable 3 you wanted john to come out on top the action was exciting it did try to be more than it was it was an action movie so great full that they didnt make this movie in stupid pg ratings that is why many of the other action movies suck people getting there heads chopped off but there is no bloodstupid this movie held nothing back it did not waste time on sappy love stories sex was not overly displayed great characters again one of the best action movies for the year i hate i missed seeing it in a theater,reality
this is buy far the best action film for yearsfrom the start to the finish is actionits got a good story its easy to keep up with the action camera moves at the right speed so you can see all the moves and they is a lotthis is what hitman the movies should have been like and it makes the bourne movies looks datedi loved this movie and hope they make a second one its got great special effects great cars some cool camera work there is nothing i can say bad about this movie best movie i have seen for a very long time keanu reeves plays the part brilliant best i have seen him,reality
american cinema has been continually producing very bland and forgettable action movies the equalizer serves as a recent example does anyone even remember that movie this years earlier martial arts showcase the raid 2 easily beats out everything else from the genres crop and that is especially including the marvelsuperhero movies that are more about spectacular set pieces than innovative fascinating action choreography well maybe the american kungfu fanrenowned action star is the best chance we have at an effective american action film at this point people keep asking if im back yeah im thinking im back keanu reeves returns to staple badassery as who has recently lost his wife to cancer after the painful funeral he unexpectedly receives a delivery package at his doora final gift from his wife in order to help ease his grief a cute little of course trouble never ceases to find and after unintentionally pissing off a group of russian mobsters at a gas station they give him an unpleasant visit where he witnesses the murder of his and suffers a brutal beating oh its on little do those guys know who theyre messing witha bogeyman who has even spooked the mob boss into beating some sense into his culprit son and letting him know what exactly he has done john with his deadly skills teased and his true background mysterious readies his weapons and pure ruthless revenge ensues from there on out the movie accomplishes just what american action cinema fails at every time the action sequences are filmed with the use of astonishing cinematographyplenty of wide shots to perfectly display everything that transpires onscreen without confusing the audience the camera invariably gives us a good layout of the particular environment which is followed by john clever utilization of those surroundings to break bones and rupture skulls in fact the film is so embellished with glitzy style that even its subtitles come all vibrantly colored with a catchy font and ingenious screen placement the majority of the film is set at nighttime and thus we get that metropolitan vibe along with a dusky color palettean alluring greenishbluish hue in addition a groovy cool soundtrack incessantly complements the impressive action sequences the best segment taking place in a violetlit intenselystaged night club as guns blaze and dubstep drowns out the screams and despite keanu reeves transparently limited acting range this toughasnails role certainly plays to his strengths with the intimidating monotone oneliner delivery and that neverending rigid look of sheer ire unlike the raid 2 however theres no compelling narrative to give the films duration any necessity to continue simply comprises one action scene after another unfortunately the combat gets repetitive fairly quicklyrepeating wrestling techniques choke holds etc and blowing brains out with the same upclose strategyand it honestly feels like the plot struggles with where to proceed next oh i need to kill this guy and now i have to kill this other guy in another location the story essentially follows this formula and hopes that the viewers find that adequate enough for nonstop entertainment an hour in though it clearly begins to drag and doesnt show any sort of storytelling restraint in terms of when enough is enough which is the same issue the equalizer shared if this highoctane extravaganza was only slimmed down by thirty minutes it wouldve made for a far more satisfying and memorable experience but i just cant say that even compares to the consistent mastery the raid 2 boasted this one has its fair share of cheesy awkward moments albeit with intention but also just overall shallowness with that being said beholding the first hour alone makes it worth seeing over every american action movie this year i still dont know if that says a lot about the staleness of the genre nowadays or if i should just accept that surely possesses stunning quality,reality
this is officially my first review on a movie and it isnt because i actually care about writing reviews at all rather it is because i fell victim to what most have no doubt already read from other reviewers  this movies bloated score no bloated doesnt even do it justice  its fabricated downright unbelievable fairy tell of a ratingi watched this movie because hey it has a ton of powerful actors in it i dont even blame the actors as most have in other posts on this movie nope  this is just poor directing and poor writing through and throughwhatever  heres the deal this movie sucks  bottom line it is not worth even spending a cent on to rent wait until it becomes free through a service like amazon prime  but dont pay a dime to rentbuy it this movie is an utter disaster and every actor who was lured in to work on it regardless of how much they were offered should seriously hope that no one ever judges their abilitiesperformances off this film if i were any of them  i would be ashamed i had even allowed myself on its screen,reality
spoilers ahead the film has some cool elements although some things are a bit over the top there is drama action and a very cool depiction of a civilized mafia subculture with rules and regulations and a lot of politenesswhat i cannot get over though is the setup of the film which totally ruined the whole experience and traumatized mewe get to know this really cute full of life full of happiness and then after we fall in love with it it gets killed  just like that as a vehicle to make the audience empathize with the character of and disregard nay rejoice over all his revengedriven killings of everyone in his path it is masterfully done however this does not at all quench my personal thirst for vengeance that i would like to visit on the writerdirector of this movie for traumatizing me there is a line and it was crossed i know it is only a film but unfortunately my emotions are realif you like at all stay awayend of rant,reality

i dont know how deeply i want to get into this its like stepping into a septic tankso lets keep it short keanu reeves is wearing a cloak of ordinariness some russian miscreants insult him at a gas station that night they break into his house beat hell out of him steal his car and kill his well the beating yes the car maybe but the  no his response is firstorder change he knows who dunnit because he just retired from a special ops group and hes skilled at martial arts the use of deadly weapons and has a talent with macram none of these guys with a hidden past ever turns out to have been a busboy or a plumber similarly the bad guys as here tend to be either germans russians or arabs weve never quite forgiven the germans for world war ii russia was balanced on the fence but now with putin in charge a dictator manqu they seem to be fair game again im certain that in the crepuscular recesses of hollywood board rooms they are dying to drag muslims into the narratives but it wouldnt be pc now would it the plot oh the plot shoulders his way through a crowded night club where the russkies hang out and shoots everyone who looks disagreeable his gun is quick and hes thorough one ugly adversary gets three bullets in the abdominal cavity and one in the center of the forehead the wounded lying on the floor he shoots and kills more or less in passing not really paying much attention to them thats just the first brutal encounter several others followin between massacres there are a few minutes of metaphysical discourse john what happened you and i were colleagues yes but bonds fade with time surely some symbolic interactionism persists well  yes and no at least as the systemic level but not as individual traits but how can you know that my epistemological intuition bang shoots interlocutor in center of forehead dead center on the saggital suture by the end has either killed or brought about the death of dozens of men and women willem dafoe dies horribly for reasons never explained it was just time for another bloody killing i guesssomeone else suggested that this was a perfect action movie because it had nothing much other than perfect action and if you dont like action movies then stay away from them i suppose i dont like most action movies  the stallones the schwarzeneggers the van damms although i have a few on dvds if they have something going for them besides blood  if the narrative is properly jelled the bourne identity or if its so silly its amusing the terminator  but takes itself seriously as if it were structured in a way that distinguishes it from one of those skin flick with just enough of a thin plot to link the sexual episodes the genre that begins with a happily married couple then drags in a new lover for each then the chauffeur then the mule and so on yet the perceptive viewer is able to discern a moral message beneath the mayhem leave alonewhy go on chapter 2 is already in theaters,reality
first off ive never been a massive keanu reeves fan to me the only decent films he had been in were parenthood bill and ted excellent adventures and the matrix trilogy i thought speed was awful and havent watched point break yet yes he isnt the greatest actor in the world but think he plays this character how he should be played hardly any dialogue or emotion the perfect hitman just doing what he needs to do until the job is done i thought the action scenes were very well done with the shoot out scenes done amazingly yes the story isnt the best in the world and some of the acting is very over the top and unbelievable and the ending could have been a little better but with a film like this sometimes its just nice to forget all the little flaws like that and just enjoy the film for what it is i enjoyed this film all the way through i never found myself looking away or thinking it was over the top i really hope they make a sequel to this,reality
predictable uninteresting transparently all geared for fighting this is an awful film i have given it three rather than one for the reason that some of the fight scenes are mildly entertaining dont watch this for anything other than a fight scene though  the story is seriously bad a seemingly unbeatable russian gangster puts all of his biggest baddest toughest guys against this one person and surprise surprise in an incredibly unbelievable feet of athleticism and dexterity against all odds beats them all youll notice i havent explained the reason for this conflict  thats because it was clearly an afterthought for the film makers as well  mmmand what is the reason for all of these fight scenes and action the writers must have pondered i know the son of the gangster steels his car and kills his farcical i didnt bother watching the last 10 minutes because i could see there was zero hope of any substance coming out of this 2 hours of drivel,reality
ok i felt compelled to write a review for this movie after watching it being completely let down and wondering how in the hell others have rated it 8 9 and even 10 something seems fishy to me as if folks are being paid to promote the movie by reviewing it on imdb which lets face it is pretty big these daysok so to go into the movie a little where was the character development keanu reeves hardly says a word ive noticed this in other movies like the recent one with liam neeson on a plane non stop its as if the makers of this film felt that they could get a connection by playing some moody music and focusing on silent poses it doesnt work for mei couldnt give a monkeys for the main character throughout was he a real person or a robot i watched the movie to the end to give it a chance to improve but was all pretty predictable revenge revenge revenge lots of gunshots etc etc pretty much sums up this entire moviesave yourself from the bs,reality
riddled with errors and no character development first an ex hit man with no alarm on his home second an ex hit man that lets 4 guys beat the crap out of him with no resistance and later kills 12 guys in like 3 minutes third the was nonessential to the story and only diverted my attention from the rest of the movie but if you were going to do it you should have put pit bull in the front and cute one in the back it was only killing and violence with very little story or character background i thought it was just dumb and so stupid it was kinda funny and not dramatic seen much better than this lately gone girl and no good deed for a couple,reality
keanu reeves is a problem a really big problem all of the characters that he plays turn out to be neo the guy who saved us all from the machines in the matrix they all even have the same facebut seriously the guy is perfect for a lot of the roles that he has won the matrix point break speed its just that its wearing a little thin now one thing is for sure other than a razzie reeves wont ever be picking up an award this film sees reeves playing the titular part of we meet him just after he has lost his wife not in a shopping mall or out on the beach sillyshe has died very recently there is something of a mystery around history who he is what he does where has he come frombut all those questions get answered throughout the filmthe film asks little of reeves the action is blisteringly fast and some of it is genuinelycool the gun fights and hand to hand combat are handled with a visual panache that i havent seen in a few years chad stahelski and his team certainly have a firm grasp of how a fight should be conducted the great thing about having an action film starring keanu reeves is that with all the action taking place there leaves little room for reeves to talk he really says only a hand full of words in this film lovers be ware there is a scene on par with mad max 2 you have been warned and you will end up hating alfie allen even more than you do watching game of thrones a classic by no means but this is the kind of film that you can disappear into watch and never think about again i dont think i will ever watch it again it was a perfect throw away film a good waste of 2 hours on a sunday night,reality
keanu reaves after a long time it is always good to see him normal acting ok direction but the scriptstory was not digested the film comes with an old approach action based plot and you always know when someone gets out there to take revenge what happens some good jiu jitsu moves and close combat gun shots can be seen max payne flashed through my mind while watching the film it was broken in between in many ways where you will just say does it really happen or why and how did this happeni would say its just an average film and you can watch it for once and enjoy the action,reality
i recently wrote a review for equalizer in that review i complained about encountering the same old clichs over and over again in action movies clichs that you will find in a mysterious protagonist who has lost his wife in unknown circumstances to the viewer the bad guys who always happen to be russians andor speak with a funny accent and obviously the protagonist being capable of taking on an army of killers as if they were playmobile figurines no need to say that even though he finds himself in the most stressful situations hes always calm enough to use sarcasm when he speaks have perfect hair after every battle and even have a few ladies fall in love in the process and all the troubles and the hundreds of killings yes keanu reeves kills more people in an hour that in the matrix trilogy over a stolen car and the killing of a puppy i jest anyway enough with my own dose of sarcasm theres only three words to describe this stereotypical actionpackedihaveseenitallbeforemovie boring boring boring but i guess that since it still manages a surprisingly high 73 rating my opinion is only shared by a few so watch it at your own peril and whether you like it or not tell me if anything i say here is untrue,reality
there is not much to say that has not already been saidbad acting stupid bad guys bad cgi could have been a hit in the 80s,reality
the music was too loudcharacters are speaking but you cant hear what theyre saying because the music was too loud,reality
this movie taught me to never mess with other peoples dogs,reality
ill be honest and say that i initially thought this film was just another action movie of all the action movies that come out these days there wasnt much that intrigued me enough to spend the time with this particular one however after some of my friends were raving about it and i saw a few youtube videos describing why it was so great i decided to give 2014 a chance to say i was pleasantly surprised would be an understatement this film was not just another action movie in fact it was quite exemplary in its breaking of traditional action movie tropesthe most noticeable difference this movie has compared to other action films is its camerawork ever since the bourne identity 2001 changed the action movie genre the cameras have been quite shaky and the action is therefore increasingly hard to follow not so with the smooth and steady camera shows off the incredible talent of its titular main character as he performs a highly choreographed dance of death killing all who might confront him or impede his progress toward his vengeful goal surprisingly enough because everything happens so quickly the violence is almost toned down despite the enormous body countadditionally i liked the character of portrayed by keanu reeves not only is he calm cool and calculating but the universe in which he lives shudders at the mention of his name the whole infrastructure put in place to support was just as fascinating and entertaining as the stories people would tell of his previous professional exploits and while the premise for leaving retirement was flimsy at best it drove home the point that you should never ever cross this charactera revolutionary new way to do an action film i give 40 stars out of 5,reality
missed this in theaters because am not a big keanu reeves fan but was so entertained by this film some of the best gunfights and action scenes filmed even more so keanu trained hard with taran tactical and unlike so many other action films he is accomplished with the firearmsmay go down as one of the strongest trilogies around,reality
keanu reeves and willem dafoe star in this 2014 action filmreeves speed plays the title role who is an exassassin nicknamedthe boogeyman and hes mourning the loss of his wife helen bridget moynahan due to terminal illness soon john is robbed and beaten by thugs who steal his car and kill his puppy that helen sent as a present john decides to take up his old job skills and hunt them dafoe spiderman plays johns mentor marcus this is a great flick and keanu definitely makes a comeback if youre into revengetype action flicks like the punishercheck this out,reality
dunno why its so highly rated honestly i didnt even like keanu reeves in the role much the rest of the cast and direction is just as disappointing watched part 1 and 2 and the second is no better if you really wanna get some cheap thrills from action go all the way and watch some crappy bollywood action moviesi wish better projects get so much budget and attention its sad that creative ventures struggle while such such projects get all the budget,reality
everything says i should have liked it a lot more but while it was a decent action flick i dont really see what the fuss is all about action scenes were well done indeed but not the groundbreaking work i was told the actual plot is paper thin i wish they had spent more time developing that whole hitmen underworld thing,reality
guy who never directed movie and is stunt crew made a movie of course result will be such whoever liked a bit of this movie should be forcefully castrated dialogs acting story line everything is wrong with this movie,reality
this movie makes up a terrible excuse for it to exist and does it this way on purpose after that its just action no story or character lots of bullets and action sequencesnormally i would give this type of movie a 5 but in this case the very few characters we got and the small amount of dialogue we got was just so bad that i had to take a points away willem defoe was atrocious thats really hard to dothis movie is just bad even if the action is good and sometimes great,reality
i expected more this movie doesnt deserve 73 rating on imdb,reality
i was really pumped up seeing the first few scenes but then i had to leave and upon coming back i just couldnt force myself to watch it very boring and generic esp the gun fight scenes in club i knew it will expire after 48 hours in youtube but just couldnt make myself watch it it became extremely dull and boring and nothing captivated my attention after the club fight scenei gave it 3 stars because the introduction of baba yaga was amazing as well as dropping the russian language bomb in gas stationcool concept but badly executed also the fight scenes are not machine like and precise and clean like bourne or equilibriummeh film,reality
i have seen twice once before watching oldboy and once afteron my first viewing i loved the film the scenes at the start which kickstart the plot were so unexpected and shocking that i immediately wanted to go out and kill many many peoplethe film was not plot heavy but it wasnt really about the plot it was about the action scenes and the action scenes were beautiful the styling of the action scenes were it pulls away and creates a dynamic movement thats elegant and precise and isnt cut to shit so you can actually see whats going on was amazing to me at the time the nightclub scene alone is one of the most incredible pieces of action cinema that i had scene the action styling was perfect it didnt reduce impact and cut away for a pg13 rating and the way in which it dimmed the sounds of the violence and turned up the music made it seem almost like a dance and the world building i was fascinated by this world the golden coins and the hotel and all of the little intricacies laced into the movies were incredible in short i loved this film first time aroundthen i watched park chan wooks oldboyoldboy is a masterpiecewatch iton my second viewing of i was viciously let down after the first fifteen minutes in which the events that kickstart the plot take place the plot ends thats it after that kills people for an hour and a half even the world building that enchanted me so much the first time around fell flat on a second viewing it just seemed rushed and only existed so that john could kill somebody else it was a means to an end and that showed people could argue isnt about the plot its about creating a clean stylish action flick with stylized yet unflinching and realistic violence but to those people i say have you watched oldboy everything that makes the violence in so good came from oldboy the dulling of the impact not clear and precise but thick and realistic comes from oldboy the long action takes the gorgeous action choreography all from oldboy the other thing that oldboy has that doesnt is plot now the clean stylish action flick is fine by me but if its as unoriginal as and everything in it has been done many times better in a movie that didnt sacrifice plot for violence and delivered masterfully on both just dont bother watch oldboy it has a plot and fight scenes cooler than the ones in where enemies dont feel the need to come one at a time so john can pick them off,reality
i considered turning this film off early on but did not because i was hoping that something would take place to redeem it not to mention that in general i tend to watch films to the end whatever style was attempted for this film failed miserably the hotel could have taken out the murderer of his and thief of his car very early in the film when he eyed him in the bath he shoots everyone in sight except his target i find that kind of scene a mechanism to keep the story going to be weak thumbs down i dont know what i was thinking ordering this movie i generally do not care for keanu reeves acting,reality
i love an action movie but in amongst all the stunts car chases and fight scenes i do expect a little bit of suspense intrigue and good script this film has none of the latter this might sound very snobbish but youd have to be of a certain age andor intelligence to rate this movie highlyyes its fun and mindless entertainment but nothing mre than that ive never seen so many people killed in one movie and that includes war films and all killed by one man john there was easily about 100 different gun shots to the head and face in this movie the first few are kind of entertaining and then it gets ridiculousi cant recommend this movie to anyoneperiod,reality
keanu reeves does not act in this movie this is simply another violent copy of so many other movies i cant think of anything positive to say about this movie i am half way through 2 and cant watch anymore with so many people raving about these movies i am sure a third one is already in production too bad,reality
i just saw this movie today roughly three years after release and cant believe that it took me so long to watch this the reviews dont do it justice and as others have said on paper the premise doesnt look that interesting which might also be why i overlooked this this is a revenge action flick and the only thing i can think of to explain the lower reviews is that some people just dont like revenge action movies in generalthe story isnt very complex which is typical of revenge action typically i prefer a little complexity pure action like transformers and max max road fury usually isnt my thing however while the story is simple there is just enough of a story to separate this movie from the two i just mentioned some people say the action in this movie is non stop but i disagree there are small breaks just when you need them to explain the films universe and its characters another thing that separates this movie from pure action films like mad max road fury is that there is an actual clearly established goal and you are given a very strong reason to actually care about the protagonist and his desire to accomplish it not to mention an unusually strong reason to really really hate its antagonistsas for the acting i was very impressed by its lead hero played by keanu reeves hes stepped up his game from previous films he can really sell the emotion of sadness this time which was critical in this movie if he acted the way he did in the matrix this whole movie would not have worked for me,reality
i think the director started from the correct observation that too many revenge movies have very similar premises the protagonist is revenging his family the wife and daughter in death wish the unborn baby and a four year coma in kill bill the wife in memento the family in gladiator etc so instead of thinking that there might be a good reason for this family premise thing our storyteller decides to break the mold and have the protagonist revenge his puppy a totally excessive and brutal retaliation in which dozens die together with the perpetrator and his father but then again on a second thought maybe its not good to break completely free of this family premise after all so lets make the puppy be a present from the recently deceased wife oh but maybe the puppy is not enough lets have the expensive sports car of the protagonist be also stolenthere there now were creative novel traditional and have insured that a large audience can clearly empathize with our keanu protagonist and cheer at the death of the bad people who did all these horrible thingsbesides this lack of a reason for its existence the revenge is well executed thus 6 stars,reality
is one of my alltime favourite movies full of highly stylized action frequent droll wit and a relentless pace its loaded with action and violence but unlike a lot of action movies action sequences dont stop to dwell in gore  they just keep blazing along suits me perfectlyi cant imagine better casting the many supporting players are superb and reeves is outstanding he does so much with extremely subtle movements and expressions  along of course with all the martial arts gymnasticsi wish this could be rerun in theatres,reality
leaves you breathless from the amount of action and killing if you enjoy simple stories with a lot of guns killings and simple dialog this movie is for youthese stupid spoiled rich russian kids unknowingly attack and start the fuse that leads to massive unbridled mayhem in the city is an assassin who cannot be defeated apparently since theyve made a 2 but its not for wont of trying because boy do the bad guys through everything at him including the kitchen sinkkeanu reeves does a good job of being stoic every so often throwing out clich lines as hes killing people non stop i loved his interaction with his associate wilem defoe which was a highlight of the movie the story is simple the plot is not complicated the action is heart stopping if you like these kinds of movies you wont be disappointed good luck  be prepared for the ride,reality
as chapter 2 is on screens and gets unexpected good reviews and not only from fans i thought that its a good opportunity to see the first and original which also received some positive echos much above what is typically delivered for a film in its genre its certainly a matter of setting expectations but i personally was not disappointed if violent action movies are one of the genres that entertain you good chances that you will not be disappointed eitherrule 1 to enjoy such a film is to accept the conventions of the genre the story takes place in the parallel universe of the crime underworld although bodies start to accumulate in piles pretty soon there is no policeman in view with the exception of one cop showing up at one point looking at the scene of the carnage and wishing good evening to the hero who happens to be a professional killer this parallel universe is not lawless its just that the laws or better said the rules are different there is a code of honor there are territories of neutrality and there is only one punishment  death  for breaking rules or trespassing borders at the roots of the story stands a failed tentative by the main hero to break the cycle of violence of his profession and jump in the universe of normal people all this is just memories when the action starts this film is for keanu reeves what jack reacher is for tom cruise and i suspect that at some point even taking the name of the hero as a title is not a coincidence its the start of a series and the second installment was not too late to comeassuming you bought into the story and the convention there is some good stuff to enjoy stuntman chad stahelski is sitting for the first time on the film director chair and he delivers exactly what is expected  a coherent story telling and perfect choreography of the many action scenes that occupy more than half of the duration of the movie keanu reeves delivers what is expected and a few other fine actors show up in small and even smaller supporting roles cinematography is just beautiful with combinations of dark colors that fit well the violent dark universe that they populate if you can just forget how sketchy the whole story or pretext of the film is you have good reasons to enjoy it,reality
you must let the suspension of disbelief prevail when you watch youll enjoy it more by not going in with expectations of realism its nearly a super antihero moviei have two complaints the spark that ignites on his killing rampage could have been better the interconnections of the mafia thugs accidentally meeting him at the gas station was just too coincidental and random to work well also i wasnt sure what all the burnouts in the mustang was about maybe it was filmed for a sequence that was never completed maybe the director needed some filler maybe keanu just wanted to spin the tyres of an awesome muscle carbesides those niggles i loved the stylized violence very tight direction and the sheer number of deaths packed tightly in a fast moving easy to follow plot a perfect movie to watch when downing several beersthis film is the very definition of a violent action movie a bit like those i remember from my youth we knew what we were getting if we rented anything with van damme schwarzenegger jackie chan or stallone in it now we have one by reeves,reality
now ive seen mr also doing something human like sleeping in a bed sharing some breakfast with a lovely little dogimpressive scene discovering the puppy and reading his dead wifes letter as the first film of a manchad stahelski the director who has previously been a stuntman and a martial artist its a great achievement accumulating considerable experience as a stuntman in films as point break 1991 the matrix 1999 the matrix reloaded 2003 the matrix revolutions 2003 constantine 2005  man of tai chi 2013 all with keanu reeves it was natural that stahelski and reeves will work together again achieving something even more spectacular good action and great music,reality
i liked it it doesnt deserve 10 stars but was a good movie a combination between james bond with daniel craig and jason stathams movies i havent watched many movies with keanu reeves lately and im glad i saw this now ill watch the chapter 2 to see how is it i hope ill like it,reality

john simplicity is what brings this movie from a minor league to a major league in its glory gives us as viewers eye candy to watch over and over im rating this action film high because this is one of the very few action movies i can watch over and over it does have its shortcomings however fails to deliver new action thrills and sticks with the same old movie tropes that we have become accustomed to just as the matrix set a tone for this almost masterpiece it suffers from ive seen that before oh but thats a great scene i recommend for people who like action and a simple plot thank you for reading,reality
another typical adrenalinefuelled revenge flick lowlife angers unstoppable killing machine carnage follows secondary subplot develops further carnage lowlife dies secondary subplots resolved by additional carnage semiredemptive ending with unstated promise of a sequel  need i say more the movie would have benefited from little more focus on the underworld motif and a few less exploding suvs and generic russianmafia corpsesinwaiting if you like this kind of thing in general youll really like the movie hence the relatively high imdb score if you dont you likely wont make it past the first death i fall somewhere in between i like these kind of movies when there is some substance underlying the style unfortunately there is nothing to beyond endless photogenic but interchangeable fight scenes,reality
this is a great action movie the premise is as simple as it is effective loses everything and goes on a revenge spree the reason why it works so well is that the characters and the setting are both very interesting and the action scenes are very goodthe movie is set in an almost comic book like world where theres a community of hit men and people in the underworld with their own set of morals and code they all use certain businesses or services which ties them all together its this universe that makes me curious for sequels to the characters in this universe are mostly quite fun and a lot of that owes to great casting the way they gradually reveal john past is interesting and it leaves you wanting to know more about who he once wasbut despite all the good things about the movie it never elevates above its genre,reality
without being able to claim to be a particular fan of keanu reeves then i had very little expectations to prior to sitting down and watching it i knew it was in the action thriller genre and that was about itand now that i have seen it i must honestly admit that i was more than pleasantly surprised with the outcome of this movie i was more than entertained by the storyline and the sheer volume of action sequences in the movie is more than sufficient to keep any action fan more than happy i will actually go as far as to saying that this is actually among the more enjoyable and entertaining of movies that i have seen starring keanu reevesthe storyline in all its simplicity is about a retired gunforhire played by keanu reeves who just lost his beloved wife and as a small puppy shows up at this doorstep as a last gift from his departed wife john finds some reason to continue on in his grief and his downtrodden world however when a group of russian thugs steal his car and kills his puppy they have no idea who they are messing with nor the magnitude of his skills and capabilitieswhile the story is fairly simple it is tremendously entertaining and the added spice of all the action sequences really help lift up the movie to a very enjoyable level the action sequences are really well executed and equally well filmedis not a movie that requires any thinking from the audience so you just simply sit back and enjoy the actioni am rating a solid seven out of ten stars and it was good to see a movie of this scale from keanu reeves if you enjoy action movies then is highly recommendable,reality
is the kind of action movies which will remind the action films fans of the movies in late 80s and early 90s the action scenes were paced well and entertaining also this movie must have definitely given relief to keanu reeves as he delivered a hit after long time especially after the disastrous 47 ronin i felt that michael nyqvist as the main antagonist was cool and at the same time menacing along with other secondary villains another best part of the movie was that this film was not dragged like other action films in recent times i am definitely waiting for the sequel which is releasing in 2017 and would hope it would develop into a better franchise is one such movie that should be seen without any logic and would prove to be entertaining on any weekend,reality
keanu reeves is the of the title a grieving one man army who gets tipped over the edge when gangsters kill his carnage ensuesthe paying public do like a good revenge flick there have been plenty this last couple of decades and they do go down well once the setup has been staged  grieves at the loss of his loved one  gets some small joy via a pet  only to have that snatched away from him then the film becomes a joyously unstoppable actionerin good hands with a moody and beefy reeves face fuzz strange though strong in presence cuts a swathe through the gangland eastern blockers and thats pretty much it characterisations are thin on the ground its a bit nutty and of course preposterous but boy is it fun there you go a box office winning actioner without pretensions enjoy 710,reality
did a great job of bringing back a proper action packed movie dont be fooled there is no storyline at all there is just keanu being awesome i was entertained through the entire moviethis is the best keanu movie since the matrix he goes back to his classic cool demeanor and is extremely entertaining delivering his cheesy lines he just kicks everyones backside the entire time and does it with ease he basically takes on an entire army the stunts and effects crew deserves a lot of respect for this its a great action flick and that cant be done without a great crew there were long fantastically choreographed fight sequences it is all fast moving and extremely entertaining non stop action this is exactly what you want in an action movie like thiswas pure entertainment keanu was back to being keanu and the fight sequences were awesome watch if you are an action lover 710,reality
this is a film that you just sit back with a bowl of popcorn and devour it has a simple plot that moves quickly to set up the action scenes the writing is well done and allows the viewer to follow the story while being invested in the characters it could have been just another mindless action flick but the actors and the dialogue give it some depth to make it a film worth watching more than once keanu reeves a retired legend in the assassin world mourns for his dead wife her last gift to him is a puppy and a note telling him to love and find peace it doesnt take long for iosef tarasov alfie allen to mess up johns path to these things in response delves back into the criminal world he left behind to seek retribution for iosefs actions the story weaves past life into his present life and reconnects him with old faces including the female assassin ms perkins adrianne palicki friend willem dafoe and former employer viggo tarasov michael nyqvist he faces the difficult task of breaking viggos organization to get to the man who took his mourning period away from him viggos sonput this on sit back and expect a film that delivers for the expectations of action a simple but tight story and an enjoyable time,reality
keanu reeves plays the liam neeson role in this slick sharp vicious little bout of revenge fantasy with support work from a whole mess of i know that guys and a blowaway effects budget its a real riot to watch not to mention one hell of a tech demo for the masterminds behind the fight scenes like those neeson killemalls though its as straight as an arrow and shallower than the kiddie pool in some ways its refreshing to just dispense with all the stereotypical origin trappings and get right into the firefights but at the end of the show it just feels like one long easy excuse to watch a whole mess of cool stuff without any extra justification lustworthy cars ferocious weaponry powerful westernstyled physicality stereothumping tunes magnificent cityscapes the list just goes on and on escapists delight for has come to deliver a dream cinephiles well just sit back and try to let the sheer celebratory brutality beat your conscience into submission it wont be too difficult,reality
it feels like a very long time that keanu reeves has been out of the game for the last film of his i believe i saw before was the matrix revolutions way back in 2003 hes had films in between now and then of course but i suppose none of them have really caught my fancy or been highly praised enough to warrant a view then out of nowhere along comes that everyone is raving about and saying reeves is back i was delighted in fact im disappointed with myself that ive taken this long to see it nevertheless it was worth the waitthe film isnt really what i expected first of all the kill count was astronomically higher than i ever would have expected secondly the style caught me quite off guard hitman characters are always cool theres no way around that but was another level on from that the scene with the policeman showing up at the door and being entirely comfortable with the fact that there was a dead body lying on the floor over shoulder was absolutely perfect and set the tone for the rest of the film brilliantly this was no ordinary assassin if there is such a thing reeves performance was good the role was suited to him in the sense that he didnt have a tremendous amount of dialogue and he could get by with the odd oneliner here and there to carry things through say what you want about the mans acting abilities but he portrays cool like few others can i read that this is intended to carry on into a trilogy so it will be interesting to see where they go from here i think a lot of what made this so enjoyable for so many people was probably the same feeling i got of witnessing something you hadnt expected obviously that effect will not be available to them in the sequels and i feel like they will struggle to up the body count so what exactly it is theyll do to keep it fresh im not sure however they choose to go about it though ill be happy to see another outing from ,reality
aahhh it took me a while to watch this movie because it looks like just another bad action flick the poster is not helping either i love films from foreign docsfestival to the hollywood blockbusters of all genres i hunt for certain directors and i do love intellectual films or some might call them art flicks but the genre that i do miss is the action trash  grind house films  in the glory days of vhs many films were released only for the vhs market many of those are the simple dirty action films some are bad and some are so bad its great wellreminds me of that no bs revenge filmsif you are aware of the charles bronsons death wish has a similar idea recently i am very happy with what liam neeson does  taken 12 and a walk among tombstone has similar feel  dont expect cannes films or look for holes this is like i said a b movie on a mainstream market great ride shootem up midnight snack  only if those seedy cinemas still around ,reality
directed by chad stahelski stars keanu reeves as a retired hitman when his wife dies and his cute puppy is killed embarks upon a quest for revenge standing in his way is viggo tarasov michael nyqvist a local gangster with hundreds of men at his disposaljohn a loveletter to over 70 years of action movies its oldest ancestor is fritz langs the big heat a 1953 film in which a vengeful cop takes down the mob bosses responsible for carbombing his wife other blatant influences include john boormans point blank sergio leones spaghetti westerns john woos hong kong action flicks the crime dramas of jeanpierre melville yojimbo payback 1999 and the toughguy films of charles bronson mr majestyk in particular where differs from these films is in its slick action sequences this is unsurprising stahelski has long been a stunt coordinatorhas been compared to gareth evans raid movies but unlike evans work has a sense of humour it knows its ridiculous and its wellhoned comicbook dialogue manages to be simultaneously funny and portentous indeed the film spends 30 minutes hyping up the superhuman dangers of who subsequently unleashes himself upon every mobster in the film like a lavaspewing mount vesuvius more interesting though is the world stahelski has created like alice in wonderland with machine guns this is a dream world which seems to exist 2 inches below contemporary reality willem dafoe costars7910  worth one viewing,reality
much has been said of late about the rather sorry state of the modern action film and apparently the makers of were paying close attentioneschewing elaborate car chases shakycam action sequences and cuisinart editing in favor kinetic but not overly elaborate fight scenes is the blueprint for how to deliver white knuckle thrills without all the phony bolognaalso working in its favor is a simple straightforward plot thats supplemented with some really nice world building the cast lead by the ever underrated keanu reeves is exceptional and really help to lift the material to another levelmay not be art but it doesnt aspire to be like its title character its aim is true if youre in the mood for action hes the man for the job,reality
well this isnt reeves worst film its probably somewhere in the middle it reminds me a lot of those mindless 80s action films that were led by silvester stallone arnold schwarzenegger and chuck norristhe plot is simple no problem this is an action film and theres plenty of it think 80s action films but with more gore and intensity it all looks pretty too this is supposed to be a fun movie i get it but it wouldve been nice to see more realistic gun fights that showed john using his entire repertoire of skills to take out dozens of armed gunmen instead of just showing his incredible quickness and ridiculous gun shooting accuracy im not sure how this film got rated above a 7 the film looks pretty but the script is awful and the characters are uninteresting if you want to watch an action film thats been recently released and are similar to this i suggest watching either shooter or olympus has fallen these films are just as violent but are more interesting to watch,reality
dont get me wrong i didnt dislike this i just thought it lacked substance mr reeves fits the role well hes the sad loner type with hidden depths who is seething beneath that unreadable exterior what i found hard to swallow was the seemingly vast assortment of similar characters and the almost comedic stereotyped mobsters who are so incompetent there are ways to make this type of action realistic and more believable jason bourne trilogy but this film just relies on clichs to carry it along its one man against an incompetent mob and from the minute you see it start to get going you know the outcome all very predictable for most people which left me feeling a little bored cinematography is good its stylish in a simple sort of way but what little dialogue there is could easily have been omitted and you would have no problem following the simple plot i suspect this has either been taken from the plot of a video game or will be made into one for those people who like mindless killing sprees and first person shooters,reality
i saw this movie cant say i loved it or hated it it was passable what baffles me is how many people seem to love this film there are much better films out there that do the same storywhy latch on to this one keanu is used wisely meaning he doesnt say much the supporting actors are all great but theyre not given much to dothe choreography is passable it seemed to be that this was the only reason the movie exists and in that case id say its a bit of letdown it starts off great but it doesnt really go anywhereplateaus earlythe cinematography is very good and the music is appropriatelike i said a passable film but i couldnt find anything that stands out here payback taken and borne identity all do it better,reality
i am a big keanu reeves fan i was looking forward to this movie and for the most part i was watching it with a huge smile on my facethe action is brilliant reeves does some original stuff in his fight sequences and makes them look believablebut there were several scenes which took the movie down a few pegs in my opinion keanus super tough character struggling to take down a girl who looks more like she should be selling perfume than she would be capable of fighting and killing sorry this is not remotely believablegetting caught and needing to be saved time and again throughout the film how amateurish watch the bourne trilogy instead bourne never made the mistake of letting anyone know where he was which is why he was always a step ahead of his pursuers if he ever got picked up hed planned it in advance so as to attain information by contrast continually blundered into situations that would have seen his end in an even half way real worldbut the fight scenes were original and awesome oh yeah and regarding keanus acting being terrible which is what ive read from others here on the discussion board and in reviews he cries when he reads his wifes letter and he makes it look more believable than most actors ive seen dealing with similar emotional scenes his acting was greatso will you walk away from this film considering it a masterpiece not if you like a decent amount of believability and logic in your story linesbut is worth watching yes if only for the fight scenesi may even buy it on blu ray just for those moments,reality
most people have touched on the plot and such so im not going to run on that same thingone of my biggest issues other than the overly spoken about plot by others is the crappy action is suppose to be this bad a which he was pretty bad a with a gun but hand to hand combat he stunk i mean he was so very bad every time he had no gun and went hand to hand fighting im sorry but since the plot stunk and you portray as a bad a why did you write him as such a stink when it comes to the hand to hand combatif you like a movie with a plot dont even try this movie if you like a movie with a bad a again this movie isnt for you you want a bad a guy in a movie watch the equalizer that plot is far superior to this movie and denzel is actual a bad a except very end scenes they sorta got off track,reality
after years i watched the movie as the result of my friends insistance on the claim that it is a unique film and different from all the other works in the genreunfortunately this is one of the worst action movie among the ones ive seenordinary full of cliche lack of aesthetic and far from a solid storydo we have to suppose that being heartbroken and agonised film tells sources of these emotional accumulation in 23 minutes is an enough motivation to kill numbers of men does this motivation provide any profoundness to the movie is the director aware of the wizards like tarantino besson scott etc,reality
those clich about russian is bad guy and american a good one is such a boring there is no story only killing and russian bad guy yes it is action movie but really you still whant new ivan drago from rocky,reality
while this movie is definitely light on story and characters theres no way youd be watching this movie if thats what you were looking for this is a fantastic action movie filled with perfectly choreographed violence and an epic soundtrack the cinematography and color palette are what really kept me watching all the way through this movie is a feast for the eyes of anyone who appreciates great filmmaking i would highly recommend this movie to fans of amazing shot composition and action if youre not too into violence i would at least urge you to check out the soundtrack as its great,reality
i like this movie he has a lot of action this the best movie in my entire life i recommend people to watch this,reality
is a breath of fresh air for those tired of the jump cut style action moves of the 2000s keanu reeves trained extensively for this film and it really shows no more infinite magazines and confusing jump cuts,reality
theres a reason why works big time as an atypical action filmthe film is dark brutal and everything an extremely serious action film should bethe first 30 minutes are enough to prove thisthen we have some really unconventional action sequences that are both real and stylized at the same time keanu reeves is really one of the greatest action stars and this role is pretty much tailormade for himwhile the film might feel slow in the beginning you can realize it later on that like any other intelligent action movie it needed a proper setup to get us invested emotionally in the characters and action sequences that followturns out to be different from other killingmachine actioners in terms of its action and the universe its set in every character has something to offer to the story and the action sequences are filmed in a natural and realistic style honestly i was expecting another quickcutting action choreography like in most modern action movies dont get me wrong i am a huge fan of the quick cutting technique but the longtake action choreography involving mostly guns won me over this is hollywood action cinema at its best,reality
this is enjoyable enough  just a couple of things though  it doesnt really have a story and hardly a plot  it also has the faintest subtitles all across the screen which you can hardly see  otherwise if you enjoy seeing mass slaughter on a grand scale set to music then this is just for you  not good for animal lovers ,reality
it was a good action film and i did really enjoy it but where the action and the background music were loud the actors spoke too quietly it was very confusing as i sometimes had to rewind scenes to hear what was going on,reality
contains mild spoilersim confused why this film has such a high average rating the plot of the entire film revolves around being some kind of super assassin the best of the bestduring the film we see him kill people with guns knives other random objects and his bare hands it seems everyone in the criminal world knows him everywhere he goes people know who he is even door men at clubs they all seem to know that nobody messes with john yet at the beginning of the film he is beaten up by some criminals that broke in to his home these criminals come from a gang which he worked with 4 years previous everyone in this gang appears to know who he is except for the 4 guys that raided his home  how convenientthe problems with the plot are as followssuper assassin has no home securitysuper assassin goes down stairs in the middle of the night following his that woke him up and does not consider the may have heard somethingsuper assassin can shoot people through walls without having to see where they are happens later in the film but cant tell there are 4 guys in his own housesuper assassin does not even attempt to block blows from guys in his house beating him up but exhibits super martial arts skills later in the filmim not done yetsuper assassin can do head shot after head shot for minutes on end then misses multiple times when aiming at key characters whose death would have ended the film prematurely this happens twice once when the son in running from the pool and again when the father is in the carthe way the director plays with john abilities now he is god now he is mortal now god again depending on which fits his forced plot ruined the film for me,reality
the three dumbest things in the world are keanu reeves action movies and music videos so now heres an action movie starring keanu reeves thats shot like a music video i am overwhelmed by the accumulated dumbness imagine payback with mel gibson only without the wit guts human suffering and wisdom and mels been replaced by tab hunter frankie avalon or someone like that imagine the replacement killers only without the romance elegance tension and simmering sexual heat theres no mira sorvino here and chow yun fat has been replaced by beavis and buttheadall through this movie there are moments that are laugh out loud stupid where the film makers clearly expect the viewers to fall into a worshipful stupor and start jacking their bones wow look how fast that car is going man that is a sharp looking car i am getting so hot now just looking at that car and the music is so loud man loud music makes me so hot and now guys are getting killed man i love to see guys getting killed loud music cars guitars gunshots oh my god im coming right now and of course our hero must look cool at all times he cant just take his guns out of the closet no he has to take a sledge hammer and smash the floor to dig out his old guns so cool and when the bad guys are coming he has to put on a sharp threepiece suit with cuff links so he can fist fight and pistol his way around i mean a ripped tshirt and jeans might be better yes to move fast and have quick reflexes but no its so much cooler to watch him put on a suit and tie with all that going on take some time to notice the sadness on the faces of all these veteran actors theres that old black guy from the wire  he looks almost grateful to be getting killed after five minutes theres willem defoe  he still hasnt forgiven himself for making all those spider man movies oh but its not just aging hasbeens who are being humiliated here whos that good looking young chap running through the crowded disco in a towel can it be    can it be    its alfie theon grejoy allen did you see him running through the crowd looking like a goofball no lets slow it down how many minutes of alfie running in a towel do we need to see but its okay hes got tons of music blasting away and its loudi really wanted keanu to ask alfie did you pay the iron price for that car you stole and then alfies last words could have been what is dead may never die,reality
not being a fan of action movies i watched this on tv out of a mild liking for keanu reeves i know he has a reputation as a bad actor but at least he never tries anything he cannot handlereeves is a superassassin living in what i gather or hope is a parallel world retired to live with his wife but she died and left him a puppy as a goodbye giftthe premise of the retired professional is one of the stalest in the movie world such as the killer with a heart and we get both in this movie gets out of retirement to avenge the killing of his and the theft of his car obviously it is no regular villain who angered him but the reckless son of a russian megamobstermoving from his designer villa to the city of new york gets to stay in a luxury hotel called the continental where criminals must refrain from conducting business or else being excommunicated from the great criminal brotherhoodcriminal pals are sympathetic about loss and also scared of him because of his fierce reputation knowing that honor among thieves and criminal luxury world are bullst helps rooting for revenge it also helps that the villains are russian mobsters and everybody knows the world can do without themas in every action movie one also knows that the hero is next to indestructible and that some preposterous fighting scenes will pave the way to a car chase sequence or viceversa as long as you keep your expectations low will deliver reeves is predictably laconic and the world his character inhabits is suitably menacing and dark a sort of lawless gotham cityps i did not see this threadbare plot as an opening for sequels there being very little original material to carve out more stories but unfortunately it happened and it just went downhill,reality
in this 100 minute long action sequence the action is relentless theres action action some more action and then just for good measure an added dose of action fans of the action genre will love it especially since they dont have to concern themselves with any sort of plotseriously though is so blatantly actionoriented that any intentions of coming up with a plot and sticking to it go completely out of the window within the first 20 minutes or so the film gets so carried away with itself that any story that it was supposed to be telling is soon forgotten aboutif this is what the action genre has been reduced to then why not just make a generic special effect show reel instead of pretending that theres some sort of interesting plot behind whats happening on screen when there blatantly isnt,reality
what can i say about a movie i had to turn off at the halfway mark the main character is a gary stu male version of mary sue his character is so unrealistic and blown out of proportion that i couldnt handle it anymore if youre over 21 and you like this film i feel bad for youthe russian villain omg so clich this guy is a pure gingerbread man everything from his cool and collected toneofvoice his accent to the fact that he is an avid drinker make him completely uninteresting,reality
if you like action maybe you can bare this for the full duration of the filmi have personal preferences for keanu reevess acting he is quite talented actor and i believe he did some really good titles the problem he has in this film is the scenario i guess there is not much part from go kill some poor fellows he all of sudden obviously there was a trigger for this he went from a pensioner to killing spray machine similar to the matrixobviously he sometimes got wounds otherwise it would have been a lower rate from me no matter how fond i am to him since the time he played neo the chosen one in the matrixin a sum  my rating is a bit higher than it should if you like action shooting and blood  you may like it there is a story but it is not yet developed  hope they would be better in chapter two this film has no specific cinematographic qualities and wont be something to remember in a month after you see it for a first time,reality

a friend of mine had see this movie and told me to go and watch it i asked him what its all about he simply said that its about a exbad ass coming out of his retirement to kill other bad asses of course i wasnt that interested because this kind of plot has been done to death over the time i heard a lot about this movie and decided to watch it and boy this is truly one of the best action movies of the yearkeanu reaves has done most of the stunts himself which has given the movie its realism no action scene in the movie looks artificial even the gun shooting scenes had a certain realism to it as you can see them reloading their guns at proper intervalsall in all this is an entertaining movie and specially a treat for the lovers of this genre and fans of keanu reeves dont expect many twists or shocking moments from the story as it is quite simple but it doesnt matter because even if they have kept the plot simple they have executed it to perfectionin the movie there is scene where a character says is man of focus commitment and sheer will after watching the movie i couldnt agree more enjoy ,reality

is truly truly dreadful if you watch it with your brain turned on and analyse every part of the awfully weak and plot hole filled script or if you arent interested in a strange resurgence of american kungfu movies which are basically the same as asian ones except from instead of hand to hand combat its close quarters shooting with pistols followed by explosionsbut if you decide to take a break from watching films with a storyline characters that make sense or anything remotely good is the film for you its non stop action from beginning to end and who cares if it doesnt make sense if you can turn everything off and just relax and watch the carnage then you will enjoy john ,reality
its a basic gangster revenge movie where bad men disturb a sleeping bear and live just long enough to regret it it is also complete fantasy a new york city where no one who dies has has family no innocent people get hurt and superassassins stay in their own luxury hotelthe movie makes up its own rules but it sticks to them is destructible he is not stronger than his enemies but merely faster more resourceful and more determined his weapons run out of bullets and do not do more damage than those of his opponents  he just shoots them more accurately it is not realistic  it isnt supposed to be  but the conflicts are balanced enough that his revenge feels earnedit is also stylishly shot the small depth of field technique adds a otherworldliness that does not distract from the entertainment but does serve i think to distance us enough from the violence that it doesnt feel sickeningbut the best things about the film what really makes it work is the tight focused plot the minimalyeteminentlyquotable dialogue and the commitment of everyone in the cast to make their characters memorable,reality
i love a good revenge story there is about these kind of tales we can get behind choose a side and thats usually enough to justify the violence in most movies nowadays is a revenge story and on merits of its action scenes a pretty amazing ride however where it excels in quick paced action it certainly leaves a lot to be desired in storyis a well to do man in his 30s seemingly wealthy and in love his wife is beautiful and she has a way of making him whole but these things rarely last and his world is about to come apart at the seems he has a hidden past something he isnt proud of but its what has given him this life of luxury and the ability to spend so much time with his wife shortly after the beginning of the film in which we find our main character badly wounded we enter a series of flashbacks where we learn his wife had become ill to some unknown disease and he has very little time to process this loss as events unfold john returns to his old ways on a killing spree against new foes and some old ones as wellthe story that unfolds isnt great by any means but there are some real amazing action sequences of such military precision that they are a pleasure to watch keanu reeves underwent 4 months of firearms training and it really shows through his work some of the best action sequences are the close quarters hand to hand combat where used a lot of japanese jujitsu but incorporates his firearm in so many of the moves slightly reminiscent of the film equilibrium 2002 although some might be turned off by the level of violence and high body count this is really why you watch a movie like thisunfortunately the plot itself is so outrageously thin and badly written that it kind of ruins the whole thing for me when i think of the classic revenge story a few titles come to mind right away oldboy 2013 or django unchained 2012 for example the main characters of these films are men obsessed with revenge and you can easily understand why the characters would go to such lengths to get back at the people who have done wrong by them this is what is missing i couldnt understand why a man would throw his life away for the memory of someone who is already dead he goes up against an army of mafiosos and leaves bodies all over the city and anyone who gets in his way is a dead man but why i couldnt grasp that concept in this film and it left me so unsatisfied and crying in disbeliefso it does have some of the best fire fights ive seen in a film and excellent hand to hand choreography michael nyqvist nearly lost an ear but the whole premise of the movie kind of fell flat in my eyes but i hear this is the first in a trilogy so they have lots of room to improve story line in the future610,reality
keanu reeves has been recently bereaved and as a last gift to him his late wife has given him a presumably so that he wont be lonely and so that he has something to remember her by a short while after a gang approach with the intention of purchasing his car refuses to sell the car and has a minor altercation with one gang member and promptly drives off later the gang track down beat him up and kill his it turns out that was a former employee of viggo tarasov michael nyqvist who is the father of the man who killed when tarasov gets wind that is the man thats coming after his son he does everything he can to defend himself against someone whom he knows is a formidable adversarywhen i saw the premise for this film it reminded me of revenge for jolly  a truly awful film involving people getting revenge against someone for killing their this put me off watching this film initially as i feared that this would be another awful dogrelated revenge film thankfully is a million times better than revenge for jolly for several reasons keanu reeves plays the title character of and it seems that he was channelling liam neeson in the taken films inevitably reeves suffers by comparison because he arguably lacks the screen presence that neeson brings but he is still effective here  although sometimes it is hard not to feel as though youre watching a poor mans liam neeson in a poor mans taken even though it feels like a poor mans taken it is still very enjoyable basically for the same reasons that taken is a good film in that once it gets going it very rarely loses momentum guaranteeing that boredom will not set into me it felt like directors chad stahelski  david leitch had watched a few luc besson films as the style and the fight choreography are very similar its fast and frenetic and both directors do well to get a credible performance from reeves  hes not the most reliable of actors but is actually quite good at being emotive here and screenwriter derek kolstad does a good job in setting the story up and getting some heart into the filmas with most action films you get the impression that action comes first and writing comes second as there are a few flaws within the script for starters we dont learn much about former employers nor do we learn much about what theyre all about i didnt really understand why they needed to steal his car at the start or what was going on at the place where they delivered his car to was it stolen to order it also seemed contrived that the gang were able to find after they left him  unless they followed him home so yes has its fair share of flaws and yes there isnt much in the way of originality here however if youre looking for a fairly fastpaced thriller with plenty of impressive action sequences then this is definitely worth your time,reality
my own scale of rating movies is simple there are just three possibilities 1  waste of time 5  entertaining but leaves you unsatisfied 10  superbis a perfect 5 keanu reeves is delivering a fine performance i am not really a fan of him so fine means he is not annoying but entertaining the reasons to watch this movies aremuch well paced shoot out action mixed with enjoyable martial arts it almost feels like a music video when the actions scenes start to roll youll hear thick drum and bass club music fast cuts painful stunts and musclecarshowoff the story is almost a no brainer which is for some days perfectly okay usually i have my brains switched on generally so following flaws spoiled this fast cooked action fast food soupthe story and development of characters is static and very predictable what the movie also lacks is a real terrifying evil antagonist look on one hand we have keanu who really is bad ass on the evil side we have michael nyqvist a mafia boss but i dont believe him i was wondering where is the real mafia boss not his writerafter all the movie is a box office success if i would have paid a cinema ticket i would have regret the waste of money now on amazon prime its ok,reality
have you ever wanted to go on a crazy rampage because someone killed your stars keanu reeves michael nvqvist and willem dafoe and is directed by chad stahelski who funnily enough was the stunt coordinator and instructing actor for keanu reeves in the matrix i enjoyed this film for the most part there was some very good realism that you rarely see in movies mostly in the action sequences john actually reloads they used really cool unique subtitles for the russian dialogue and some of the comic relief in serious situations was perfect my issues with the film have a lot to do with the story and characters i never was really interested in mr or anyone else there i found myself waiting for the next action sequence rather than enjoying the story itself i also have had a hard time with keanu reeves ever since i first saw him in hardballthat combined with my lack of excitement for most action movies today due to clichs is the reason i gave this a b 610 johnkeanureeves hitman actionmovie,reality
if you ever want to get lost for a while and forget about your immediate surroundings may be the solution for you the movie is 101 minutes of nonstop action through which the bad guys get it in all sorts of captivating ways there are no twists no mind benders no smart was of taking someone out just one straight shoot them dead sequence after another the action scene choreography is really well done camera work is great so despite all the rapid action you will not miss any detailsif you do not have the stomach for blood or violence then skip it otherwise get cozy and watch the boogeyman do his thing,reality
ever wondered what the matrixs bulletstopping neo keanu reeves would be like in the real world he would probably be like the eponymous former assassin of codirectors chad stahelski and the uncredited david leitchs refreshing action movie which puts coherency back into setpieces and polishes its simplistic premise with buckets of style theres a key scene in the middle of the movie where sledgehammers his way through the concrete floor of his basement to reveal a hoard of buried weapons he is literally digging up his past and is symbolic of the films refusal to have its protagonist brood over heavy themes and its willingness to simply let him get down to businessthat business unfortunately for a gang of russian mobsters is of a highly skilled assassin mourning the recent death of the woman he left his life of crime behind for receives a puppy who his wife arranged to be sent to him upon her death at a gas station the cocky iosef alfie allen  the son of a mob boss  spots 69 mustang and when refuses to sell iosef and his cronies break into his house kill his and leave him battered and bloodied iosefs father viggo michael nyqvist finds out and begins to contemplate the inevitable  warpath of revenge and the death of his son taking residence at a hotel that caters for men of his ilk finds himself wastedeep in the life he thought he had left behindtheres a lot of joy to be had with the boldness of operatic overblown and featuring a scene of viggo muttering a tale of the boogeyman to himself in a room lit by a roaring fireplace it transcends its straighttodvd plot with some outlandish and truly thrilling setpieces free of shakycam and rapid editing shoots stabs and strangles his way through an endless russian hoard and allows a flowing camera to capture his asskickery reeves is at his best when he says little and hes virtually silent here delivering a performance of endearing sullenness it is by no means a great film  its hampered by genre conventions and a wafer thin plot  but you certainly get what you came in for,reality
when i watched trailer i thought the movie will be awesome as i was blown by it so i wanted the movie to be good and when i watched it i was blown by the movie too the acting and action done by reaves was just quite awesome he looks working hard for this movie and he really did it despite he is fifty years old he has done superb action he looked a real bad ass assassin and he has set a new benchmark in action by doing gunfuand the other supporting cast were also good at their places and this film also tells us one thing never mess with a otherwise you will be killed and alloverall the film was awesome and a must watch for action lovers and also those who love brutal action like me the film is a good treat for usi heard about its sequel is in works definitely going to that one,reality
im a big fan of action movies and especially keanu reeves he often gets crap over his acting skills or lack thereof i think hes well suited to action movies where a lot of the time story is told through the action sequences and a bit more nuanced its hard to find fault with this movie and ive seen it at least 34 times all the actors supporting or main do a great job there is a lot of action in this movie and the movie does start out a bit slow but then picks up very quickly the action gun fu and stunts are awesome some of the best ive seen in a long time you can tell they really practiced and tweaked the stunts a lot there are often long action segments with a brief intermission of story which is how i like most of my movies the soundtrack is amazing as well with marilyn manson contributing to the main theme of the movie and the composer for the movie doing a great job i would have liked to see william dafoes character expanded on some more but that may come in the second movie in flashback sequences,reality
some of these reviews are a joke loosen your shorts people im not sure what some thought they were going to get with keanu in another action movie a shoot em up high body count fast action and shiny cars movie but a classic meaningful flick was never in the cards if you dont like gun fights video games style action or fast cars  you wont like this movie this movie is like a country song he lost his wife lost his and lost his car  and then he gets revenge on the spoiled idiot mobsters son it took me half the movie to figure out that was the guy from got i knew his face i just could t remember who he was who had no idea who he was messing with is it realistic that depends on how much realism you expect to gain from an action movie are they ever nope not one of them its got about as much realism as kill bill which i love that does not make it a bad movie the thing i do like about this move  if nothing else  is they showed him reloading his weapons multiple times action movies dont typically do that so they get points for not having guns that never run out of bullets as for the actingkeanu  he did a great job with this is stoic and not in a good place at all and they messed with him on the wrong damn day i actually prefer him when hes not the hero good guy when he plays a darker role he seems more relaxed guess theres no hero pressure there my only complaint is willem dafoe  ian macshane didnt have bigger roles but they did a great job with what they did have im so tired of reviews blasting thrillride movies because theyre not how the reviewer thinks an action movie should be its easy to criticize when youre not the one putting the work in is it perfect nope but its fun  if you like this brand of fun,reality
imdb is normally a good judge of standard but i cant understand why this rates so high very disappointed spending good money time and effort watching it in the cinema for such a low grade film i would have been happier if i spent 50p buying it in a boot sale and could have resold it again the following week limited plot and dialogue but action was good and kept me awake when occasionally i found myself nodding off some of the plot is implausible and not to be believed it didnt keep my interest and i wouldnt recommend watching this film unless your looking for a break from thinking too much and want a rest if your looking for excitement this film is not the answer,reality
rare is the film which strikes on the perfect mix of worldcreation atmosphere and action superbly shot in metallic shades of dark blue grey and black set in a world that can  and should if you ask me spawn a cinematic universe on its own and proceeding with a glorious sense of fun is the action movie and say what you will about keanu reeves acting he can play a cypher pretty well keanu reeves is an exsuperhitman who is recovering from a personal tragedy a couple of gangsters disturb his mourning the bloodshed starts from there and does not stop till the end of the film the film is highly reminiscent of the 80s hong kong actioners such as a better tomorrow both in style and in the themes explored such as the impossibility of retirement from the criminal world this movie is highly recommended for any action fan and if your heart does not leap with joy when victor the main antagonist says no is not the boogeymanhe is the guy we send to kill the boogeyman  you are dead inside,reality
this is a very silly film redeemed by the fact that it appears to glory in its ludicrousnesskeanu reeves takes a very fine italian suit on a number of increasingly violent adventures to avenge hisumpuppy a former enforcer for the russian mob he is feared as baba yaga which we are told again and again is the boogeyman that anyone remotely aware of folklore can tell you that baba isnt the boogeyman is the least of this films narrative flaws the curious incident of the kevlar vest that vanished in the night is a fairly major plotgoofthat it works is down to reevess deadpan delivery of some preposterous dialogue the playful use of supporting actors ian mcshane clarke peters and lance reddick are very amusing more could be made of michael nyqvist and alfie allen seems to be destined for a career playing a succession of disappointing sonsalso if you like shootemups this is very much your film  or franchise i should say the producers intentions in that regard are very clear long before the credits roll reeves offs a ludicrous number of baddies  i literally lost count in the mid50s  while having only one of their weapons come anywhere near himand only then because that kevlar vest i mentioned seems to have inexplicably evaporated between scenesas i say very silly indeedbut fun if you are amused by cartoon violence,reality
james bond jack bauer jason bourn jack reacher john carter and now  writers do seem to have limited imaginations when it comes to the names of their action heroes jw is a retired assassin and we all know that in the movies it doesnt take much to bring a man with a very particular set of skills back into the game kidnapping his daughter usually does it but if you want to be sure kill his this really makes keanu reeves back on cracking form mad of course we knew who the bad guys were even before their mistake with the mutt because they speak russian and the subtitles are presented in comic book style to add to the funtheres minimal plot but maximum action in this film directed by chad stahelski keanus stunt double in the matrix and david leitch another veteran stunt coordinator is not out simply to disable his foes but instead never leaves death in doubt and he is no silent assassin but absolutely litters the screen in bodies in a riot of action and noise that somehow escapes the notice of the new york police department according to those who count these things the original taken movie clocked up a body count of 35 but racks up a much superior 76 i saw the movie on an imax screen so i was both shaken and stirred,reality
is the greatest action movie of all time i have seen all of the great action movies and none of them are better than i have seen three times twice in imax and once at home and the first time i saw it i was so blown away i had to go back a few days later to see it again then i waited for it to come out on dvd and watched it again and thats when i decided it was the greatest action movie of all time this movie gives you everything you want in an action movie the story is perfect it grabs you and keeps you hooked the entire time they give you an action hero to root for the whole movie the movie does an amazing job with first getting you to see as a human so you can understand the pain he is in and then the movie builds him up to be a feared and respected legend of this underworld and when the action starts you will understand why it is the greatest action movie of all time the gun play in this movie is by far the best i have ever seen in any movie kills so many people it is awesome read the trivia section to find out how many keanu reeves gives the performance of his career the directors chad stahelski and david leitch were stunt men their whole careers and is the first movie they have ever directed which explains why the action is so perfect in this movie i dont want to give any spoilers because i know as a huge movie fan that nothing is worse than finding out too many details before you see a movie trust me and go see right away i recommend this movie to everyone i give a 10 out of 10 a,reality
if you mess with a mans car better look out if you mess with a mans better look out but if you mess with a mans car and his well theres just no tellingkeanu reeves is the perfect actor for this type of thing that is a character that is myopic speaks in short stunted sentences and never looks distracted by anything requiring thought beyond those instinctive and highly trained survival skillsthis is one of those that must be applauded for not reneging on its promise to deliver what you pay for it knows its target audience and doesnt try a bit to educate enlighten or expand their worldview it serves up just what is expected and required to not disappointthanks also for the r rating no cop out fudging the violence that would have been a disaster just look at the expendables movies when there is so much carnage on screen and no blood or heads exploding the result is a dull affair of repetitive frolicking in laughable and lame action scenesnot that this thing is trying to be realistic far from it its roots clearly lie in first person shooter land and there is about as much dialog or concern for character development as in a video game shoot em upthats really all this is and it makes no apologies there is the added treat of many cameos by recognizable character actors and that adds to the fun the movie isnt anything that special its just a highly competent and enjoyable ride of revenge flick mayhem and requires you bring nothing more to the screening than a desire for escapism,reality
with the action genre running low on fresh if not entirely original ideas over the past several years this stylish action film starring keanu reeves as the titular character is one that comes with surprise this movie sees reeves reuniting with chad stahelski and david leitch who served as the fight choreographers for the matrix trilogy and redefining himself as a new hero with hightrained set of skills with guns and handtohand combat although reeves is no stranger to the action genre since he exploded as the visceral action hero neo in the matrix this film pins the actor into a fine polished role as a guntotting hero facing down the guys calling this film is a gamechanger in the genre would be saying a bit much but it does indeed stand as one of the most entertaining films of the category in further words it shows the genre is still far from dead keanu reeves plays a former assassin devastated by the death of his wife after days of mourning is surprised with a gift of cute little puppy to help cope with his lonesomeness while trying to readjust to his life is visited by a group of russian mobsters lead by losef tarasov played by alfie allen son of corrupt mob moss viggo tarasov played by michael nyqvist who brutally attack him destroy his house steal his mustang and murder his poor little puppy in an act of revenge must rally up his former accomplices including marcus played by william defore and chop shop owner aurelio played by john leguizamo to hunt them downthis movie provides action movie junkies with plenty of thrills and visceral action set pieces to fuel the adrenaline for most although the plot is rather thin and falls short of originality beyond a simple revenge story the major driving force of the film is the dazzlingly choreographed action sequences along with the compelling character study of our tragic titular protagonist from the opening scene is established as a man with a grim past and faces a deep tragedy with the death of his wife from an illness that is never specified the beginning effectively breaths humanity into the character without being overly sappy or manipulative and the final product is a protagonist viewers can sympathize with even when he journeys to the dark side of gunning down countless individuals when the action begins it is truly stunning the first action set piece takes place in the main characters house where he fights and mows down an array of criminals in a sequence choreographed in a style of what almost resembles a poetic dance routine and this scene is only the beginning of the enormously high body count he racks up throughout the film while the action scenes stand out gracefully the films shortcoming perhaps come from the characters mostly from the antagonist category alfie allen and michael nyqvist both do their duty in the villain roles but fall victim to rather underwritten characters why did they try to kill a explanation is never deeply explored or at least not in a way that is understandable and william defoes character is given rather little to do overall these come as only minor gripes and should not stand in the way to witness the alluring direction chad stahelski and david leitch drive this fastpaced vehicleis a sleek stylish action thriller that redefines its charismatic lead actor as a visceral action hero and at best sprouts as a shining star in the slowly diminishing genre this film may not shine as a game changer in the genre it clearly sets a solid example of what meets the criteria of a good action flick,reality
one thing i noted while watching was its simple story told with fascinating execution and commendable action scenes and that is the beauty of this film which was overstretched in the climax but was saved by outstanding scriptis an exhitman who comes out of his retirement in search of a mafias son who was responsible for killing his the last gift sent by his late wifefirst time directors chad stahelski and david leitch did pretty well in shaping the movie to be a blunt and taut revenge actionpacked thriller the movie takes sometime to build on but when it does  there is no turning back each scene is beautifully depicted with rocking background score and applauding dialogues it gives an holistic view of gangland and rules they live in and high respect for each other icing on the cake is the wellchoreographed action scenes which has been executed brilliantly with graphic bloodshed looking like a pc game script is tight and will keep you engaged the flipside is unnecessary inclusion of climax scenes which could be easily be edited keanue reeves is back in form and i loved him after long time especially post matrix series he does well in dialogues delivery and will be appreciated for his actingoverall a kickass action which will pump up your adrenalin good 35,reality
wowi loved this film mr reeves is great in this film i love all the crimegangster films anyway although it might not go down as one of the greats it is still in its own rite a great filmloads of action revenge fighting killingwhat more would you need in a moviesglad to see mr reeves back on the big screen in a good action role once againplease please watch this film its really really goodenjoy,reality
the film that has been branded as keanu reeves comeback and to be fair it is a good film its stylish and has a interesting plot with lots of action a 100 true bloke film butand there is a but and its that there is no soul in this film yes you feel sorry for but you dont become attached or bothered if he wins or loses in this film this is not really keanu reeves fault as he does play the role well i think it may be the scripting of the film the realism that lacks heavily in it william defoe does a great supporting role in the film which you would expect i would advise you to watch as its a good film but at 1hr 40mins you will walk away thinking they could of probably done that in less time does bring keanu reeves back to our big screens but there are bigger films due out this year which will make this one quickly disappear,reality
starts with promise and quickly devolves into stupidity hijacking the current template for action films pioneered by the raid series in which a single determined hero takes up arms against hundreds of nameless one dimensional bad guys in a rapid fire killing spree its not that i have anything against bloodshed in film provided it serves a purpose but theres really nothing of substance here to grab onto leaving us with scene after scene of revengemurder chic that plays more like a video game than a film never has cold blooded murder looked so coolis nicely shot and opens on a dreary and mysterious note one that i wish the film would have sustained with a better story and better character development without the fundamentals we might as well be pressing buttons jump dive shoot if i try and step back and critique it purely as action entertainment  the film is lacking in interesting choreography or chase sequences basically happens upon completely unbelievable scenarios over and over again pulls a gun out and shoots no matter how many times the filmmakers put him into uncompromising positions i never feel like hes in any danger the routine gets boring after the first half hour and eventually the autopilot sets in,reality
i dont understand how this has 73 total waste of an evening,reality
this is a decent action movie but dont expect much more just so so,reality
we should kill you why do animals have to die in movies i know they might not have died in real life but why in movies lets kill all you and put you in a film see how you like it  ,reality
as the title clearly tells us this movie is really about one man  john is a sort of super perhaps even superhuman hit man for the russian mob but hes retired he found love he got married everything was great he left the life but his wife got sick and then died and as her parting gift to the devastated john she arranges for him to be sent a puppy after she died the puppy comforts him in his grief until  one day he has an encounter with the son of the russian mob boss he used to work for they dont know each other the guy falls in love with johns car and later breaks into johns house beats john up kills johns puppy and steals johns car it was the killing of the puppy  the last link with his beloved wife  that pushed john over the top hes back and hes out for revenge bloody merciless and remorseless revenge against anybody and everybody even remotely involved with this heinous actthats it more or less the movie then goes through a whole series of bloody gunfights and fistfights and martial arts sequences as john keanu reeves singlehandedly wreaks havoc on the russian mob in new york city the fight scenes go on and on and on they seem neverending it was a very onedimensional part for reeves but then again most of the characters in this were one dimensional the point of the movie wasnt to tell a story or to give us meaningful moments and characters they were all pretty one dimensional working with a plot that was straightforward and largely predictable this is obviously all leading up to the climactic confrontation admittedly i wasnt entirely sure who johns final confrontation was going to be with until the son was killed with almost a half hour left to go clearly it wasnt him so it goes on and on and on for a while longerpersonally i found the last half hour quite tedious viewing if you really like this kind of genre  violent and bloody action with little or no story  then this is a movie youve got to watch i have to admit that this just really wasnt my style even though i can appreciate a man wanting to take revenge for the killing of his puppy 310,reality
i didnt think it was possible to make a movie this bad in this day an age is tougher than james bond batman ethan hunt and jack bauer and could probably take all of them at once the body count is completely ridiculous or maybe just absurd not sure i wont give away john motivation but lets just say he overreacts just a bit you take a bite of his muffin and he will kill your family type of overreaction stay away from this movie complete waste of time not a single redeeming thing here,reality
is one of the best action movies ive come across in recent memory and its critical acclaim and pure action euphoria is what will make it a classic of the genre in years to comethe story is quite simple a retired hitman played by action star keanu reeves used by the russian mob soon confronts his past when members of the mob kill a his wife gave to him on her deathbed after the incident goes on a rampage to kill the gangsters who killed the only thing he had leftgood violent action polished cinematography as well as believable acting by reeves and others is done well the movie also draws inspiration from japanese anime 80s chinese gunfu movies italian westerns 1960s1970s neonoirs from european cinema the world is also very gritty and dark for an action film but that just makes it more speciali recommend this to any action fan who enjoys energetic shootout scenes and is willing to see reeves make a comeback,reality
at first i was content with the cinematography and the story it got me sucked in feeling cosy and poetic about the choreography of killing people in large numbers this film has a covert aura that wants to make you feel good about seeing hundred bad guys shot in an aesthetic manner i realized i was enjoying how the lead character was shooting people skilfully and with style there is no artistic aspiration or audacious indepth exploration of the drama of life in kill bill maybe there was an attempt of that in it is just a guy that uses his guns like a ninja his swordsfrom the cinematographic viewpoint however this is a film well done,reality
this film didnt work for me it feels like ive already seen this film countless times before basically it involves the good guys or guy against the bad guys and thats it theres really nothing else to it nothing new or interesting happens theres just some action which isnt very new  its all been seen before when it ended i thought thank god for that i feel ive said all i need to but the minimum submission is 10 lines so ill waffle on a bit more couching tiger hidden dragon was good because it had exceptional action and it was all new and refreshing but just your standard action flick weve all seen it all before theres really no story line i was thinking anyone could basically make a film like this  just have a non existent story where the goodies fight the baddies have a load of action scenes that have been done too often and hey presto you have this film,reality
when the kingpin learned about whom did his son messed up with its thats where the hype started eventually as the story goes the hype is kind of messed upim kind of unsatisfied about how kills his enemies his killer moves is not a move of a killer its not poor acting i guess its just a fair acting he moves so lame and looked untrained its like his enemies have a lot of chances to gunned him down but theyre not taking the chancesone more ridiculous scene is when viggo caught and tied him in a chair yes viggo didnt kill him in that part even after ambushed him in the church but after viggo interrogated him he commanded his guard to kill the funny thing the guard tries to kill with a plastic bag the man who is feared known by the killer circle will be killed with a plastic bag by suffocation seriously but that didnt succeed because his old friend who first tried to kill him saves himat the end viggo and battles handtohand and then handtoknife because viggo thinks hes going to lose it so he used a knife the fight scene is very unacceptable i remember viggo told his son that killed three men in a bar with just a pencil and then the film give us the said funny fight scene was able to stab viggo in the right shoulder while viggo stabbed in the stomach whats more lethal and whats the chance of survival when youre stabbed in the stomach versus stabbed in your left shoulder you dont need a medical degree to decide the obvious the film defies biology viggo died because he was stabbed in the shoulder and survived the lethality of his injury what the helli think my vote is just fair i enjoyed the first half of the film which is good til the second  last half of the film which gives an unbelievable poor story,reality
sure nice fight scenes but feels repetitive midway through cool physical handtohand combat with use of handgun and other fight choreography but thats seriously it the world of these underworld hit men is decently well crafted but definitely not used to the fullest its like having made a really nice world for a video game but not creating a story for it when this is supposed to be a movie isnt it more of a demonstration or trailer for what it could be story line is lame something a 10yo kid who watched some anime could think of hence the title actually its worse than anime its not even close to being called a story i could easily think of more better ways to kill come on these mob guys stupid or something pretty sure theyre not you have the money use a friggin bomb or a squad of rocket launchers or something movie would have ended at 15min holy hell please you want testosterone yeah this review definitely came from that and im laughing about it,reality
great to see keanu reeves back it must have been since the matrix 1999 that i saw him in a flick but i must say even as this flick is available really cheap these days that i thought this must be bad that i was wrong this is a great movie and to be honest i liked it very muchthe story itself is rather simple you know wife died getting out of business receiving a getting robbed and got killed its payback time end of story but from the beginning until the end i enjoyed it very much the score the fight scenes the shoot outs the way it was shot and edited the way they shown the translation of polish everything was great and the acting of all the thespians was way over mediocreit never really becomes brutal or you dont see a lot of bloodshed or even say nudity it somehow doesnt matter because the action is what its all about a surprise it was in fact reeves shows that he can still carry a movie and it was so great to see all those well known names from yesteryear and nowadays working together and for the lovers of muscle cars it do contains a lot the mustang chevelle charger and challenger are all in gore 15 nudity 05 effects 35 story 45 comedy 05,reality
ive watched a number of times now mainly because of the emotional kick i get out of wrongs being righted so satisfactorily i suspect you will either love or hate this film but if you like kickass highadrenalin films about vigilantes then i suspect like me youll love this film its beautifully shot for a start the action never lets up for a second and yet unlike many modern movies where you cant work out whats happening half the time this is stylised and perfectly framed its a violent movie in the best possible way its all violence from almost the first frame to the last and yet it packs a huge emotional punch too these arent shallow caricatures and i was totally invested in the outcome of the epic battle keanu reeves is one of my favourite actors and hes a revelation in this film his emotionally contained acting style suits this character entirely i would liken this performance to that of another great actor mads mikkelsen mads can convey more by a flick of an eye than most actors can with long speeches i will watch again its a film to return to when the dross coming out of hollywood gets you down,reality
wordofmouth can be very useful in gauging if a film is worth seeing or not but it can also lead to erroneous expectations i went into this thinking it would be this absolutely awesome action romp and to a degree thats true i just thought it would also be a little more fun is by no means a bad film but one that seems satisfied with a cool soundtrack and brutal wellchoreographed action while having a rather weak foundation of a story the setup is that keanu reeves is an exhitman who gets dragged back into the life after a russian gangsters upstart son foolishly steals his car and murders his thats it i wasnt expecting anything deep mind you but i would have liked a little more complexity and intrigue it was straightforward almost to the point of being boring at times and without a lot of the production and character design that fleshed out something like mad max fury road or the manic humor of kingsman the secret service to the films credit the action goes against the current trend of flashy camerawork and tricky editing so one is able to comprehend and appreciate the brutality and choreography and even though a lot of it takes place at night geography is never in question and you can tell where people are in relation to each other these elements were also wellsupported by some good special effects bullet hits etc in terms of the world of the film there were a few nice touches that hinted at a complex criminal underworld one where assassins have their own hotel and criminals use their own currency the film was also wellacted for the most part despite the characters being so shallow apart from keanu reeves to me the film largely wasted talented actors like ian mcshane michael nyqvist and willem dafoe by not really giving them anything fun or interesting to do when it comes down to it all the film really has is keanu reeves charisma and some admittedly good action and that wasnt really enough for me bringing this back fullcircle expectations can make or break a film and i think i went into this expecting a little too much for the diehard action fan who doesnt really care how much story goes along the beatings and bullets will do just fine for those who expect a little more from a film theres plenty of others to choose from,reality
the good this movie is nonstop action the storyline is explained within the first twenty minutes of the movie the rest of it just unfolds into nonstop action you will find yourself rooting and cheering for keanu reeves to kick more butt it is finally so good to see mr reeves doing his thing once again he is a superb actor and certainly delivers in this action filmthe bad this comment is a spoiler the only bad thing i have to say about this film is the scenes involving his dying although this was an important factor in his unresolved griefthe ugly the movie has a lot of violent scenes so if you are unable to watch movies with a lot of killing and bloodshed then this movie is not for you the other action scenes cover primarily a mixture of martial arts fist fights and a few car chasesoverall i rated this movie a 10 for nonstop action great acting and for the love of seeing keanu reeves in a great movie once again,reality
ah the revenge film is it possible not to root for a masochistic protagonist who feels the need to slaughter the people who did them wrong whether it involves uma thurman slashing lucy liu vivica fox and an odd assortment of japanese bodyguards or lee marvin thirsty for retribution after being left for dead there is something lipsmackingly satisfying about seeing a badass make fair and square with all the wrong peopleis as much a comeback vehicle for keanu reeves as it is a sumptuously shot throwback to the days of charles bronson and sylvester stallone the film doesnt necessarily update what weve come to know about the revenge movie over the years  it instead provides for a refreshing take on a subgenre that in a world accustomed to liam neeson threatening kidnap happy terrorists has gotten a bit dusty here is a movie that knows its predictable but is smart enough to understand that going through the motions just wont do this time around like the kill bills before it everything is so stylistically visceral that we hardly have time to roll our eyes and remember that the hero always finds the fulfillment theyre looking for we have to sit back and enjoy the blood soaked ride reeves after years away from the action scene portrays as a man wounded by his past he was a hitman years ago but left the scene in pursuit of a blissful marriage as the film opens however his wife has as it seems died of a serious illness which is never explained damaged assassins are never a good thing and after his grieving process is interrupted by a gaggle of russian thugs who steal his car and kill his something in snaps he goes from loving husband to murder machine in a matter of seconds and so the film goes on autopilot but not in the ways you might expectthe plot feels very been there done that and reeves who ive always labeled as the most wooden leading man in hollywood goes through the motions without a single ounce of emotion to back him up even in a scene where he breaks down we are hardly convinced he looks anything other than a circa 2009 kristen stewarts father somehow though doesnt seem to be about plot or reeves for that matter rather we are intent on how the plot is executed how the action set pieces set themselves apart from the other thrill heavy movies of the decade or cough cough the matrix and for the most part we are presented with an entertaining revenge movie one who takes its gun fu very seriously and one who just finds violence artistic as long as its done right chad stahelski making his directorial debut here is confident in his every move making john sleek thrills pack more punches than your average pulpy exercise in madnessthis is a wellmade movie no doubt but im not so sure it presents us with anything new its all been done before though here its quite a bit more stylish obsessing itself with a michael mann reminiscent tinting process and its been done better but maybe im just cynical because kill bill is close to being the best thing ever and no revenge film can ever come close to its greatness its hard to get over your first love after all,reality
i saw this latest keanu reeves actioner off hbo over the weekend and to my pleasant surprise it was actually pretty decent reeves plays a hit man one of the most deadliest around who retires after making a deal with the his crime boss michael nyqvist so he can settle down and be with his new bride bridget moynahan only problem is she dies shortly thereafter but leaves him a parting gift something to remember her by which happens to be a cute little puppy he bonds with the pup but then gets into a scuffle with some local gangsters who kill the poor thing  frown emoticon  and steps back into his hitman shoes in ultravengeance modethis is one of the best roles ive seen keanu in for some time now and hear this may be the beginning of a franchise i hope so would like to see more of this badass character i see this film was actually inspired by a few different action classics john woos the killer jeanpierre melvilles le cercle rouge and le samoura john boormans point blank and the spaghetti western subgenre of western films and you can definitely see that influence when watching this ian mcshane john leguizama and willem dafoe costar,reality
very minor spoilers aheadits for the most part nicely shot and nicely lit keanu reeves despite hamming it up with an unnecessarily raspy voice in every scene is also capable as the lead and there are several strong supporting characters that provide for some depth in an otherwise simplistic and shallow plotthere ends all the good i have to say on the subject of john trangely enough one of the primary failures of is the sound design its not as godawful as chappie with its belt fed rifles but there is a terrible discordancy here between what were shown and what we hear the soundtrack in particular sticks out like a sore thumb whenever man with a purpose leitmotif lights up theres something to be said of the missed opportunity of including somber jazz or grunge and instead going with generic and grating hard rock in a movie which is otherwise more tonally similar to noir than typical action farethe plots pacing and direction is where the film really begins to lose me however and it becomes clear rather quick that little forethought or planning was put into the script is described as a loser for example by a man who spent the preceding night trashing his very unloserlike home and stealing a car that he admired so much he would rather keep than sell to his fence not enough time is spent on the titular character himself either to establish him in any way instead what we get is a couple lines spoken about him in hushed reverence from another character  who neither he has been properly introduced at that point and from that point on the rest of the movie is singularly focused on the revenge plot and while it plays out in a number of visually interesting settings the fight choreography visual effects and inconsistent behaviour of as well as the extremely long scenes make for a complete doozy instead of allowing for a gradual buildup of tension followed by brief bursts of violence our hero dispatches enemies with such ease and in such great numbers that its hard not to think youre watching max payne the movie im reminded of a quote regarding droids in the star wars prequels if our heroes are able to deal with these enemies with such ease and in such great numbers that their presence is entirely inconsequential why even include themfinally theres the issue of our russian crime boss being played by someone with a very obvious swedish accent i dont hold anything against michael nyquist but hes a poor fit for menacing bad guy and even if he were able to speak english without his accent theres precious little he could do with the pathetic dialogue afforded his character attempting to pass of a swedish man as a russian mobster so jarred me out of the movie i ended up simply fastforwarding past any scene where he made an appearance which of course meant took a nosedive towards the endit might be interesting to consider for a moment what couldve been done with the basic themes and characters here if the project was in the hands of a competent director editor makeup team and effects artists but itd be a lot simpler to simply say  dont bother,reality
i enjoyed watching this movie john selas work behind the camera is a pleasure to the eye great cast excellent acting all around keanu is believable and to the point the action scenes are superb in quality  this movie was fun to watch and kept going however non of that can compensate for a weak plot we are expected to believe that the top hitman ever born who struggled so much to get out of the game is now back because someone stole his car and killed his puppy that was left behind by his late wife to keep john happy if you are looking for to pass on some time enjoy fantastic cinematography and action scenes  this movie is great other than that this big hole in the plot imo places this movie at a cool 7,reality
i loved this movie people are saying this was a horrible movie but they are wrong this movie was fluid smooth stylish and hit all the right notes keanu reeves performance was excellent this is his best movie he has done since the matrix and the but who directed the movie was a stunt man on the matrix i hope that they make a sequel to it i beard that they are planning on making a tv series out of if i were to pick a best action movie of the year this would be in my top 3 list people who are hating on this movie just dont like keanu reeves keanu is an excellent actor and in this movie he shows off a lot of his best skills the reason he hasnt really done any good movies is because the movies he was in wasnt him it was the director but in he did a lot of his own stunts and the director let keanu improvise which made the movie excellent i really liked this movie will definitely buy this on blu ray,reality
i believe action movies are not quite my thing as most hollywood action is generic these days the latest one i saw is overall quite similar to another recent action flick the equalizer one retired specialist is brought back in action to destroy an entire mafia gang it may entertain hardcore action lovers but for me its utter boredom at least the equalizer was backed up with some story which is almost absent here is an exhitman who had retired to leave peacefully with his wife unfortunately she dies o cancer and all is left with is his supercool mustang and the his wife leaves as a gift but john is pulled back into the action when his car is stolen and killed by the mafia heads son driven by grief and revenge he decides to take down the people involved using his superhitman skills thats basically the entire story and what fills the 100 minutes is routine monotonic action sequence they are not bad being nicely shot and wellchoreographed actually the problem is the lack of intent and the totally predictable nature of the script which made it less engaging there arent any twist in the story too which is surprising just plain straight forward action if thats all you i believe you will end up having a good timejust like in the equalizer easily kills dozens of men failing to do so only twice and both the times escapes in what i would say the lamest part of he script i found it hardly realistic there is absolutely no tension built up as you know that can easily kick everyones asses character build up is weak dialogues just forward the action sequences and acting nothing special keenu reeves gives an honest attempt though still i couldnt connect with that much to completely root for him to end this was just another forgettable action film for merating 25,reality
well everyone knows this is a revenge movie with lots of action and yeah theres lots of action but honestly  thats all there is there isnt much in the way of character i never figured out why the willem dafoe character acted the way he did theres no humor to speak of i didnt find the action sequences to be very creative and i actually found them to be repetitive for example there was one plot element where a lot of people are waiting for to come and they are all checking in with each other by radio and then exactly the same thing happens later on theres lots and lots and lots of action but its amazing how soporific it all got and i mean it literally put me to sleep i was payperviewing it and i literally dozed off more than once it had been a long day at work i admit but if it had had any hook to hold my attention i would have stayed awake but it didnt well there is this comicbook assassin subculture stuff with an economy based on special gold coins but nobody past the fourth grade could believe in itso i was honestly pretty disappointed and im not someone who cant enjoy a good action film take salt for example which was also nonstop action but which i found way more interesting and with more plot twists and stuff there arent really any plot twists in this movie it was just entirely firstpersonshooter for an hour and a half now if someone says but thats exactly the kind of movie i like youre just biased against firstpersonshooter nonstop hitting and pulling the trigger movies i guess i dont have a good retort but there it is,reality
my parents own the dvd i watched of this movie and i borrowed it from them it took me forever to watch it but now i am happy to report that i have viewed the film so now i can return the copy back to my parents it turned out to be a rather good action movie as well kind of in the same vein as the punisher films and the film dredd lots of action a lot of bloody action that is this film is almost non stop action as the set up of this film is very brief before it introduces us to john dark side and the insane criminal world he lives in granted it seems as if this film was based on something as there were a lot of rules in this criminal world that seemed almost like we as the viewer should already know but i do not believe it was based on a book or graphic novelthe film starts out with portrayed by keanu reeves looking in rather rough condition and then we spend the rest of the film finding out what happened to put him in the place he is his wife recently passed and after a very unfortunate turn of bad luck and timing he must go after some people that have wronged him he will have to take on former allies as he wages a one man war against the head of a criminal familykeanu reeves does a good job as the title character and he apparently put a lot of work in training wise to play the man with special skills the other cast members do a good job too but the only other recognizable ones were only in the film for brief periods i thought the film was going to be devoid of humor but it had some moments here and there as it was funny to see how quickly people were to let off the hook as they had no urge to cross himso all in all a good film as it was a bit of a super violent action flicksomething the last expendable film failed to be it did not hold back on the violence but i am a bit surprised that there was no nudity as i was sure there was going to be some in the couple of clubs that john came across it does use computer blood unfortunately as it seems they must use computers for even some of the most basic special effects these days however my complaints are few as this one kept me entertained throughout,reality
my son kept telling his dad about this movie but didnt think i would want to watch it so i thought why not give it a try ive watched the punisherwhat could be worse than that i can honestly say ive not seen anything close to this movieive watched the punisher taken 1 2  3and i can saythis movie beats them hands down brilliant acting little speaking keanu doesnt need tohe has a way with his look that speaks volumes lots of action amazing moves choreographer needs an award gets to the point of why he does what he doesand why some people have to suffer matter of principal some people have messed with the wrong guy and a lot of people unfortunately are collateral damage because of one spoiled rotten brat whoever wrote the story line has a brilliant mine for detail i wonder what the book reads like for the movie was chocked full of emotion action scenery and good plot line with many little side roads to keep you wondering this movie does what it is supposed to dokeep you entertained and on the edge of your seat not wishing to blink for concern one might miss something important bravo i would watch it again withouthesitationapparently my son is more worried about what i view than i am,reality
i was hoping that keanu reeves would resurrect his career with 47 ronin a remarkably boring film with some interesting cgi here comes from marketing to execution a barebones action flick that leaves nothing to be desired except a better plot reeves titular character is a retired hit man who is unwittingly robbed by the son of a russian mob boss in the process john puppy is killed the puppy was a gift from his dead wife who died of cancer days before apparently feels he has nothing left to lose is determined to destroy the man who killed his puppy no matter how many russian mobsters must die in the process and boy do they die in terms of actionadventure special effects etc this film is an example of doing more with less the action scenes had none of that cgi music video feel they were all realistically choreographed and shot which helps a lot with the suspension of disbelief the performances are about as good as the script will allow but nothing stands up to scrutiny with being as unstoppable as he appears to be its odd that he would have been the hapless victim of a home invasion and why why wont we listen to reason as the film is aware it was just an fing dog,reality
spoilers aheadgo see this movie if  you like very fastpaced action flicks  you dont need a supercomplicated plot  you like to see a good guy kill lots of bad guys  you appreciate noir and you understand what it is  you like to see a well constructed worlddo not see this movie if  you dont like violence  you have no appreciationunderstanding of noir  you need the goodguy to be totally a good person  you have no appreciation for ultraviolence done really well  you dont like revenge movies  you expect the disney logo at the start of every good moviethis is the best action movie in years i say this as an actionflick junkie who likes ultraviolence but not tortureporn the plot is simple and linear by design it does not need to be complicated or twisty  we all should know what is going to happen and the enjoyment is seeing how this unfolds if you cannot understand that this plot setup also indicates the intent and to a certain extent the setup of the noir then you will not like this moviesaid more bluntly the killing of the puppy is stupid by design it is there to show that the badmen are really bad and that this event is a simplistic device to unleash carnage the beauty of this movie is in the worldnoir we get assassins who have their own hotel their own currency their own creed and their own body disposal service the rules of this world are presented and then adhered to  and are quite interesting a couple good examples are when a cop comes to john house after john has shot 12 people who were sent to kill him john opens the door to the cop who he knows by first name and says noise complaint and after the cop sees dead bodiesblood behind john he says deadpan you working again this is a fantastic scene in a movie with a bunch of them another is when john enters a club where his intended victim has been stashed he puts a gun to the head of the bouncer at the entrance who he knows and they talk about his losing weight while the gun is pressed to his head the bouncer then asks tentatively are you here on business knowing that john will likely kill him as he is protecting the bad guys instead john says why dont you take the night off another great scene in a great moviefinally the music is very good both the songs that were integrated into the movie killing strangers by marilyn manson and the soundtrackfor context i found the equalizer and jack reacher to be two of the better action movies to come out in the last couple of years but this movie blows them away,reality
normally keanu doesnt have to act he has to show up and remember his lines and leave however in between all the gunfights and car chases keanu actually has a few scenes where he has to act expressing grief for the death of his wife and also by extension the murder of his adorable puppy that said the bulk of this movie is one long action sequence with one of the highest body counts that i can remember i especially liked the cinematography by jonathan sela night time shots of new york city are very common but in the cinematographer brings a fresh eye to the proceeding there has been some discussion of a possible prequel or sequel but is satisfying without any more details,reality
per terms i have to write at least 10 lines for this to be considered a review i dont really agree with this as my review would be short and to the point no need to fluff this box with over analyzation or critique for this masterpiece for all the people that did not like this movie its not for everyone for the people that enjoyed the ride it was made for you i will see how much longer i can stretch this until i get to the real review really is this necessary that i write 10 lines who came up with this sometimes less is more apparently imdb doesnt agree with that what else can i say in he meantime guns check love story check action double check okay weve finally reached the point where i will describe this movie spoilersidiot kills his now everyone must die the end,reality
35 well heres a not so good movie that is so bad you may want to kill yourself because you recognised the leading actor after watching this movie i had to write a review because i cannot believe how the rating got to this high half that would of been fair as some parts were quite good  if it was a game for a console unfortunately it isnt well not yet anyways the bad guys are about a fearsome and effective as cigarette smoking the plot is shoot em  while your at it even when theyre dead shoot em some more because whats wrong with overkill were all friends here if you want to watch lots of meaningless action it may be your thing,reality
i wanted to like this movie i like keanu reeves point break is one of my alltime favourite movies and this got good reviews on imdb i dont expect too much from the plot of an action movie just that it sort of makes sense and there are really good action scenes however this script was so terrible that i just could not suspend my disbeliefthe production values are very good and the cast is great but this movies just doesnt make any sense the action scenes which are the best part of the movie are just too routine to be very interesting spoiler alertthe plot such as it is is that keanu reeves character is a retired hitman the son of the man that used to work for comes to house and beats him up kills his and steals his car lots of revenge killings and mayhem then ensue prior to the son attacking they have a brief altercation at a gas station where the son asks how much car is and says its not for sale and they both call each other a bitch in russian literally every single other person in the movie instantly recognizes including a police officer who comes to his door and knows that he is a hitman even though he has been retired for 4 or 5 years however neither the son nor his entourage recognize and the son has not even heard of him also doesnt recognize the son of the man he used to work for or any of the sons goons even though he speaks to him in russian at the gas station the problems with the script continue from there,reality
people who like films like the punisher taken man on fire and similar filmsfilms about men with bad destinies who go out to take their revengewell people who like this kind of films will also like the film is not really deep or something compared to taken or 96 hours for example but theres a lot of action and its really entertaining after matrix i thought for a long time that reeves started to act in all his roles too cool without a lot of mimics and gestures as that would have been totally okay because he plays a coldblooded hitman but no reeves acts very well i really had to laugh in the scene where iosef aka alfie allen aka theon greyjoy appears for the first time in the same moment puts the gas pump into the tank im not sure if the directors have realized the hidden symbolic and the jokebut yeah people who watch game of thrones will know what im talking about it was funny,reality
   as the coldblooded murder of john pet beagle results in the violent killings of 81 men and one woman to add insult to injury daisy the late beagle is replaced by a pit bull all the trouble can be traced to the white russian mobsters who control the new york city and other us metro areas in real life we just saw the exact same thing in the drop and the equilizer seeing it twice on the big screen might be a coincidence but having it shown three times in a month proves its true these foreignborn ruffians have no respect for american values such as beagles hot apple pie and chevrolet they spend most of their time jibberjabbering away in foreignwhich no one else can understandplotting against our welfare and beagles incomprehensibly millions of taxpayer dollars subsidize countless school and college students in their scheme to learn these plotter language codes with no background checks whatsoever john neighborhood cop jimmy has encased all of johns guns in concrete due to noise complaints and john can barely retrieve them in time to avenge daisy with more and more of americas in the news for learning now to shoot the bad guys themselves its heartwarming to learn that the bangs organization broke americans need gun stamps has awarded the real life animal actor who portrayed daisy an honorary beagle americans need gun shells tag,reality
is an unapologetically rrated action film with action scenes that are fast but not too choppy to follow but unfortunately its also a modernized action film burdened with overuse of color grading lens flare and irritating rock music and the film takes too long to get past the exposition and into the action the former slightly outweighs the latter so i give a 610 would recommend waiting for this to come out on your favorite video service to watch unless youre desperate for something to watch in the theaters still i have to give hollywood kudos for attempting an original rrated action film and hope this is part of a continuing trend that can lead to better action movies for adults,reality

maybe one of the silliest movies evertotally laughable fightsthe hero kills most of his enemies by a shot to the head  the baddies just talk talk  talk until they also receive deadly headwounds yaeh keanu reeves can not act  even if he is threatened by a shot to his head,reality
a movie that means absolutely nothing with a very poor action and directing keanu reeves needs an outstanding director who knows how to move him otherwise he is only someone trying to work hard with no results ive watched the first one aiming to watch chapter two but after what i saw im pretty sure i will be away from any movie he is in,reality
did i really need to see yet another movie with an indestructible herothe whole plot is a chain of very used clichs they laid out the plot in like the first 20 minutes and i already wanted to leave at that point after that it was just shooting and even ray charles could envision the ending oh my god they killed someone very dear to him where have i heard that the last 20 times yes taken is a much better movie compared to this much more believable and with better characters,reality
is a full on action movie i wouldnt go into the plot of the movie however i will share my point of view as a critic positive 1 the surprise element of the movie was johns old friend marcus the character gives a very good support to john and we get to know this only when he prevents johns death 2 the music used during the action scenes was very good approach 3 the movie is very stylish overall negative 1 firstly i was expecting some fist fight or any martial fight there was two fights in the movie without the use of gun however these fight were for very short duration 2 lots and lots of shooting at one point of time i got the statement that is a very good hitman or as they call boogeyman so killing every mobs throughout the movie was a bit boring3 at the end if had taken the breed of the which was killed then it would have been very good,reality
i give a 4 because the music is very good the music enhances a film that would otherwise simply be a ufc fight night for those fans who scream  growl for that sort of nonstop bonecrushing bloodgushing eyesrollinginbackofheads action step right up and get your gorefix would be the ringmasters intro if thats your thing youll love the movie as many on here  other hight aggressives rate it 78 or higher howeverif you prefer a more challenging intellectual twisting plot  cinematic engagement then you can skip this until there is absolutely nothing else to do or watch on the theatertv screen for an hour  45minsdid i mention how great the music of the film is,reality
so just when you though keanu reeves acting could not get any worse it has hit bottom his empty stares and monotonous voice have plateaud to a new level a new height i thought he could never achieve but the movie kept me on my feet nervous about the next scene and empathetic towards characters that i should feel for and hating the ones i was supposed to hate solid action scenes with a light comedic element to it with things happening similar to fast and furious where the hero achieves a new superhero level of abilities movies continuity is smooth and well casted throughout i had low expectations for this movie and came out pleasantly surprised,reality
i dont know what is worst this or the equalizer two great actors in so bad movies it could be a hard action movie and ok we all understand the purpose but in these case its really a pointless movie with free cheap action that maybe in a chuck norris part would be accepted but not with these kind of actors im sorry but doesnt deserve more then 5 out of 10 for the storyline the action parts all combine just is rubbish im glad i didnt went to the cinema to see these movie because was just a waste of time and money and for shure i couldnt stand the entire movie normally the star reviews are very accurate but in these case these movie doesnt reach near 6,reality
its an action movie thats all it is its thick with clichs silly dialogue plot holes bland characters and a watery feel  in fact one could argue that that aspect pulls the viewer out of the experience but at the same time its full of lowestcommon denominator emotions great cinematography fast and fun gunfights and it has a huge overall entertainment value if youre looking for a smart movie this is not it but if youre looking for an expensive flashy studioquality cinematic fps this is absolutely it itll make you pause and yell are you serious thats asinine but youll still laugh when someone gets hit with a car i think it sums up 2014 pretty well actually,reality
if youre 13 or 14 years old and you absolutely adore violent video games get your mom to take you to this picture and you will be in awesomeness heaven if youre not youll probably want to steer clear of this ultraviolent and essentially nonsensical hit man revenge shootemup the body count surpasses most war movies  i lost count after the first 50 heavies had been dispatched in gorgeous squibs of blood and gore the film requires a good deal of suspension of disbelief  for instance theres a special hotel where hit men and women stay paying in krugerrands theres also an exclusive club for hit men and women where they can dance the night away as long as they respect the rules about not carrying out contracts on the premises keanu reeves is better than usual as the retired hit man who gets dragged back in although i cant help feeling there is something sick about glorifying the talents of a hired killer and there is a supporting cast of alwaysgood character actors including willem dafoe and ian mcshane who add some grit and texture to what is otherwise a glossy and superficial fantasy of balletic violence but getting back to the attractions for teen video gamers  there are some really cool cars in this movie too and keanu does this majorly cool thing where he drives real crazy and shoots people and runs them over what a cool guy,reality
ruthless and frighteningly efficient assassin retires to live in peace with his wife a good woman she dies 4 years later but as her last act has a puppy delivered to him so that he has company to grieve with he is attacked in his own home by thugs led by the son of his old boss but who dont know who is who steal his car and kill the puppy comes out of retirement in order to exact retributionthis keanu reeves vehicle is devastatingly simple not to mention being as dumb as a box of rocks there are at least 3 points where ruthless killers having been nonstop ruthlessly killing for some little while fail to ruthlessly kill the very person who they should immediately ruthlessly kill in order to prevent the subsequent bloodbath resulting from the notruthlessly killed person resuming their own ruthless killing and dont get me started on the incredibly accurate shooting except at the person where it is dramatically important that they dont get shotbut as well as being simple and dumb it is also extremely stylish often beautifully photographed full of well choreographed action sequences and quite good fun not to mention being a very good vehicle for reeves minimalist understated style of performance if youre undemanding as regard illogicalities plot holes and the like you may well enjoy it as a straightforward violent action romp,reality
what keanu does best in this movie is kill people the death rate must be huge people getting shot left right and centreit s mass murder with a musical backgroundwell worth a visit to the cinema but dont take your girlfriend or wife as its a very much  men only movievery cool shots and camera work here folks but as with all this sort of movie the big question i have to ask myself is why dont the bad guys employ bodyguards who can shoot straight very similar to the recent gunman with sean penn and probably runs along side with it i dont have to explain the plot as its obvious if youve seen the trailermust remember to move to the area as there is not a cop in sight it does what it says on the label but wont go down as a classic or one of his finest movies but there you gocant argue with the box office that this will probably bring ini gave it a 5 because of the direction of the action sequencesotherwise would have got a 4,reality
typically revengeaction movies like this are easy to enjoy even if the acting isnt that great keanu reeves is not a good actor and it shows big time in this movie unfortunately the other actors and the action were not enough to make it even a decent movie the story concept was good and there were some cool ideas like the neutral hotel but other than that it was weak at bestthe action scenes were very repetitive and predictable a few decent choreographed moments but pretty clich with nothing new to offercould have been a cool movie with some minor adjustments unfortunately it falls flat,reality
while can quite literally be described as an endless parade of bullets and headshots seriously mr just loves a good old fashioned headshot chad stahelskis stylish loud brash and unwaveringly violent opus of revenge is a highly watchable stock standard tale of a scorned man on a warpath that weve seen before yet never seen quite like thisfront and center to this incredible bodydropping journey is lover and suit wearer played by the thankfully watchable keanu reeves almost like 47 ronin was a bad dream john is clearly a man who at one stage in his life utilized his skills of killing for a price and as per usual got out once love came his way john is a man that even the bogeyman fears and a man who doesnt take kindly to having his puppy brutally murdered by a bunch of russian thugs the story of is slight and couldve easily been written by a teenage boy whilst playing the latest call of duty but theres a market for these throwaway action flicks and up and coming director stahelski clearly knows thisdirecting the film like its been injected with a drip feed of red bull stahelski barely stops to breathe in amongst the processions of finely tuned and impeccably crafted gun fights from a home invasion firefight a nightclub massacre and rain soaked battle at a port finds himself literally fighting across new york in increasingly ott yet sufficiently satisfying gun battles stahelski cares little for trying to be realistic and the films tone is almost comical in its treatment of hotels for hit men and waste disposal crews and you get the feeling this film was aiming to be more john woo than james bond which gives it an added sprinkling of charisma even though we all know keanu reeves isnt exactly the poster boy of emotional embodimentif you dont like a liberal dosing of blood and a body count to match then is going to be a living breathing nightmare for you but for those looking for a welloiled and at times almost fanciful rendition of the revenge tale then is going to be a new favourite of yours a welcome return to form in many ways for keanu reeves and a calling card for director stahelski is under no illusions to what it is and neither should the viewer be when judging it with a sequel already in the pipeline its pretty clear that did its job and hopefully can do it once more in the years to come3 pencils out of 5 for more movie reviews and opinions check into wwwjordanandeddiewordpresscom,reality
first of all i really like keanu i dont want to waste too many words on the film itself should be more than enough that it was directed by a former stunt coordinator or check the stunning list of works of writer derek kolstad and you will understand immediately the reason to write this post is about imdb scoring system and so many reviews beginning with i went to see this movie because of the imdb scores but the companies who are investing 1030 million dollars in a film quickly realised that if the reception on imdb is weak than their expected turnover falls how simple it is to influence that you need a pc and few hundred fake identities and the masses follow quickly after few years the statistical majority of real viewers will determine the final verdict thats all it is really sad that we lost again an independent and noninfluenced opinion sharing possibility but we have to live with it  and forget imdb as a reliable source at least in the first year of a hollywood released movie the next question is hypothetical of course would it be difficult for imdb to change policy and let only real identities in,reality

i dont understand all the praise that this movie is getting this review is from old school action fan first of all the story is plain dumb way too unrealistic and without heart in it weve seen a lot of one against army or gang movies but this one is just too much i dont get how some people can compare it to taken keanu reeves is the same like in any other movie same face same gestures same talk although there is something attractive to keanu when it comes to action movies he is just mediocre actor the movie is also dark and camera is shaky so it is hard to see who fights where and who shoots i didnt see much blood or gore either on the contrary it seems like many shots were toned down the movie is very inconsistent in some places theres a lot of blood when person is shot in others there is no blood at all the conversations between russian gang is very stupid and childish i cant ever imagine how gang can talk like that i give it five stars but even that might be too much,reality

people keep asking if im back and i havent really had an answer but yeah im thinking im backis as predictable and formulaic as the other 99 of revenge action flicks out there but what makes this stand out is how well the action scenes are choreographed and what a breath of fresh air it is to see the action take place without all the extreme close ups and fast edits which never allow you to enjoy them was directed by two former stunt men chad stahelski and david leitch who seem to have a grip at what theyre doing because they dont take any of the fun away from the action scenes derek solstads screenplay is pretty straightforward we are introduced to the main character john who is grieving over his recently dead wife she leaves him a cute puppy which will help him during this grieving period but a group of young russian mobsters break into his home one night to steal his car and in the process they kill the that brings john to his breaking point and we discover pretty soon that he is no common man he was once a feared hitman who later retired after meeting his wife now he is set on getting his revenge and the action begins john is the typical hero we can route for and identify with for his loss while the villains are ruthless and deserve to be punished weve seen all this in almost every other revenge film but what makes this one stand out and feel fresh is that the action scenes are stylized and energetic so despite having a predictable plot you are entertained with some of the coolest action scenes of the year this is no raid 2 but it does get the job done there is one particular action scene that takes place in a nightclub that is fantastically choreographed these are the strongest moments of the film but if you are looking for an original plot look elsewhere because this is very predictable there are some interesting elements that solstad introduces in this world where the mobsters have a series of codes and rues that they follow giving it sort of a video game vibe to it at timesin order for the action scenes to work for a film like this where they arent cutting the scenes every second you need to have an actor who can pull them off they found the right one with keanu reeves who definitely knows his stuff he delivers in every action scene with some fantastic choreographed moves the mobsters build him up as someone they fear and respect and once you see him in action you believe it he also delivers during the quiet moments as well despite not having the best dialogue to work with he was made for these roles and delivers the supporting cast is excellent as well alfie allen from the games of thrones series is getting typed cast as the hateful villain who behaves like a child at times his father is played by the excellent michael nyqvist who used to work for he knows his kid made a mistake but tries to protect him nonetheless putting a generous reward on johns head willem dafoe lance reddick and adrianne palicki get some screen time as well and they were a lot of fun the way everyone treated john when they realized he was back in business was also another nice touch that the directors made and help lighten the mood at times this was an extremely entertaining film with some of the best action scenes of the year despite all of its predictability stahelski and leitch succeeded in making this predictable story feel fresh and if you are a fan of keanu reeves work you will not want to miss this,reality
is the tale of an angry keanu reeves hunting the men that supposedly took everything from him the film has a surprisingly strong start by relaying what happened to mr to cause him so much distress in a way its a very clichd story about a man seeking vengeance that has been done an uncountable number of times however when the action picks up it only slows down for cleanupliterally and a little bit of exposition one thing i will note is that this is probably keanu reevess best performance in a long whilehowever you want to take that he is actually capable of emoting for a few sparse moments throughout the film but i digress unfortunately he really cant carry the weight to make this an amazing film this movie suffers from an often pretentious style that really tries to shove it in your face the smooth gentlemanlike assassin world is interesting but when the film is done through and through youll realize that there was so much potential wasted for the sake of clichd theatrics and situations that were obviously contrived the one thing that the creators did manage to do perfectly was the soundtrack it always hit the badass note and felt appropriate the fight scenes were mostly superb with keanu moving swiftly like he dropped a few years but a fewand trust me youll know which ones were way too hollywood if youre looking for an enjoyable action flick that isnt overly thoughtfulwhich is what i was in the mood for when i watched it id recommend john 710its average,reality
this movie may have scenes of an unsettling nature eg his is killedis an action packed thrill fuelled fun ride starring the likes of keanu reeves the matrix trilogy willem dafoe spiderman 1 michael nyqvist the girl with the dragon tattoo series swedish version and alfie allen game of thrones directed by stunt men and first time directors chad stahelski and david leitchkeanu reeves is a retired and extremely dangerous assassinhitman who leaves his fraction so he can spend time with his wife until his wife bridget moynahan i robot unfortunately dies due to a terminal illness when he is driving home from her funeral he stumbles upon 2 russians who show a little too much interest in his car and his a gift from his late wife he is awoken late at night by his as he goes downstairs to confront the noise he is attacked by the same 2 russians they beat him and kill his now he doesnt like that not one bitthe action in this movie is phenomenal fast paced and always keeps you on the edge of your seat by far the best thing about it on the other hand the script is pretty darn ridiculous to say the least coupled by the poor acting chops of keanu youd think that after over 20 years of movies hed be a little better at it by now the acting from the russians with the exception of michael is even worse one redeeming factor of this is that although the script is bad the general plot and story unfolds well which gradually makes the movie more fulfillingall in all unlike most of the us action movies just being about a guy killing everyone and with a poor handled story and even worse script only has one of those things thus making it more superior,reality
5 stars is a push for this one i love keanu reeves dont get me wrong but this film was just another shooty shooty bang bang like so many out there there wasnt anything special about the way fights or shoots there was nothing set this one apartfor a tldr summary of the film is a supposedly legendary exhitman who everyone is afraid of the guy from game of thrones that got raped and had his manhood cut off comes round house and kills his and takes his car gets annoyed gets his guns from his secret hideout and goes hunting down the mob who killed his dogalso the world that lives in is really unbelievable are we really expected to believe that theres this hotel specially built for hit men who can come and be safe under some specific code its crap its boring the whole film is predictablesome people have been comparing this to the equalizer which is why i wanted to watch it in the first place but the equalizer is 100 times better there is no comparison whatsoever dont get me wrong this wont put me off keanu but it has made me realise that not every film he is in is gold hes a bit hit and miss and he really needs a good story and writing to come off well,reality
i just saw the movie and liked it i do not judge the script though great acting of most of the players good handling of action scenes and i think very good directors but why the why did anyone think the could made sense and serve the purpose in the film i mean a former hitman a cold blooded killer a guy who is supposed to have little empathy with life in general decides to decimate his former employers underground empire because the death of after all just a i got the meaning of the okay but the significance attached to it is so complex it is about an emotional transfer from dead wife to his peace of mind and soul tantamount to philosophical levels of understanding this in my view throws the very premise of the movie into sheer uncertainty to the viewers why couldnt be much simpler such as in for instance in order of disappearance where the guys son is murdered lets imagine the following premise wife shows up at the outset is kind beautiful gets more substance borrows the sports car for shopping the same scene at the gas station and suddenly after she gets back home a bunch of drunk russians kill her accidentally with a baseball bat just to steal the car who they so very much liked and all this with john not being at home even more viggo s sun was supposed to know who john was since he is the son of the boss right but and this would have gone just fine along the lines of the movie he was stupid and drunk enough to forget about his name which the wife had mentioned at the gas station while refusing to tag a price  even after 5 years of john retirement the son would still have been a dead man and provoked the kind of anger and disaster etc etc what do you think,reality
how bad can you wish for a car and how far are you prepared to revenge a stolen car and a if you watch youll see ok this was some solid action but the rest leaves a lot to wish for im disappointed i think the audience have to send the message that lazy movie makers have to shape up is it really fun to watch this superhero of a hitman shoot 450 enemies coming against him as foolsreeves makes a part thats dead serious and then you have nyquists character thats more out of a comedy it simply doesnt work out then you have dafoes marcus that signs on for a contract and then doesnt shoot when he get the chance and he doesnt shoot the other hitman coming at either it makes no sensethese logical twists are just examples of details that ruins this movie but if youre 15 and have absolutely nothing else to do you can see this movie cause the is quite nice,reality
this is wholly forgettable typical action and revenge style as merely stylethe only way i can think of to describe it is this an aging star or other has his agent fish around in the market for a script where he will have to look pained in spots heroic in others liam neeson seems to do this yearly denzel found a new franchise last year statham makes his living this way there are probably any number of identical scripts floating around at any given time that fit the criteria one is picked from an agencys hat or because it slightly stands outsomeone is brought around to direct a crew is assembled along the way a few spots open up for known actors to get a paycheck in return for a few minutes of screen time a few of them here work is done perhaps a hundred people go home with money to make mortgage from set dressers to mcshane if decent enough it makes up its money with some profit viewers get their moneys worth of gunplay theres nothing wrong with this work is work its how anything gets done its that this particular one never convinces as anything other than what i just described people dragging themselves out of bed to go to work and this line of work has spoiled us to expect so much more than people simply doing it when dafoe talks with reeves at a funeral within the first few minutes thats not a conversation between characters who immerse themselves in the significance of some story its one actor standing where he was told to and repeating lines after the other has finished doing so,reality
how very convenient for the us government that hollywood cranks out this movies with villainous  hateful russkies east europeans or bearded arabs or sliteyed north koreans that way they have already prepped up the american public so that there are no objections if the us starts a war over there with american lives lost hey they sacrificed their lives to fight demons and subhuman species so that is ok and they say that hollywood is not on the government payroll but i am supposing to be reviewing a movie so here goes as an action movie it is kind of slow and the action here is mostly shootouts i have always liked keanu reeves and i enjoyed this movie as far as his acting is concerned still i wont really say the action here was greatas government propaganda however this movie would have made goebbels green with envy,reality
one would think that the overarching theme of this flick would be redemption by revenge at least from most of the murmurs i heard duringafter the screening as well as read online however no one redeems themselves here someone whos stopped living and is trying to deal with loss is given a cruel jolt to get back to in terms of life and ironically that living is made possible by killing however to quote an oftrepeated clich this time its personalthis is almost like a stepchild of movies that are in on the joke of sending genres up like shoot em up that it is extremely entertaining since it is done right just the way that clive owen vehicle was but as serious as those movies that are not selfaware of the genre more on that ahead in this piecethe character is so much in the shadows already by the time the movie begins that one almost dreads it becoming a parody of itself something that john cusack or nicolas cage does with bigger budgets and better at least on paper filmmakers paul schraders making the latest cage vehicle that still might go dtv to me that is one of the major achievements of this particular flick  not succumbing to how easy it is to churn something out and let it languish on a disc without making it cinemaworthy firsttime directors one of them strangely uncredited chad stahelski listing those movies that seem to be close cousin of this one  stuntwork on safe blitz faster ninja assassin mrmrs smith the mechanic and constantine  another reference for this coming up and david leitch stuntwork on ninja assassin the bourne legacy bangkok dangerous mrmrs smith the mechanic constantine make this genre their own making us wish that they do more movies in this genre in addition to quite possibly make a strong sequel or series of sequels to this oneso many are gonna walk out remembering reeves and the stunts on this one and theyd be right too but this one also needs to be remembered for how great michael nyqvist is and he has not got such a meaty role since his turn in the original girl with the dragon tattoo he has as many scenes as reeves does and is a strong presence throughout taking care not to chew up the scenery and he sure can and evoking great memories of his fantastic final manoa mano fight in the parking garage with tom cruises ethan hunt in mission impossible ghost protocol the fights in this one are a companion piece to that particular encounter strange though it may soundthe always great gunfu stuntwork is accompanied by impeccable production design sumptuous cinematography and perfect metal soundtrack both the helmers and their leads work on constantine seems to have given them the license to borrow liberally from both the look and some of the concepts in constantine concept of neutral hotel ground for assassins in this one was borrowed heavily even placing lance reddick and ian mcshane in djimon hounsous shoes speaking of comparisons adrianna paclickis assassin is as bad as mireille enoss assassin in sabotage and in a good wayevery stunt sequence is minimalist blunt and brutal doesnt go on for longer than it has to and respects every stuntperformer each performer who takes a hit in our eyes is seen to feel the hit even an explosion that way we see the damage actual violence does and this could also make a great case for why is should not be used as a resort though im not sure most would feel that way this is how each action scene no matter what the movie should be composed and ha ha executed otherwise it has the danger for not allowing the impact or consequence to be feltlookwise and action setpiece wise this also has many things in common with both payback and safe and makes all of them look good since the comparison is fair and complimentary i still hold the other to be superior works but this is high up there as wellwillen dafoe and lance reddick couldve been given more to do and mcshane shines in the 2 scenes he gets alfie allen plays another dck here and people who hate him from got will be allowed to regurgitate those emotions herein spite of the fact that the cuts to the gore and violence are minimal in the region i watched this in the body that did said changes makes up for those omissions by posting a huge antismoking warning on screen in bright white large capped font the movies almost entirely dark so you can imaging how we all had to squint during those sequences that completely detracts from anything that might be happening on screen for the duration that any character lights up or has a smoke in hand therefore i will not recommend a local theatrical viewing and instead suggest that this be viewed theatrically in regions that retain both the rating as well as do not have onscreen diversions during its runtimeone more thing  the prologue and the loopback to it were completely unnecessary narrative potholes imo though the postloopback was kinda relevant and gratifying,reality
2 well maybe this film starts out very good after being a fan of keanu since i was 8 watching bill  teds at this stage of the game i love seeing keanu and him being an assassin going by his name i definitely have to see this well although the film is very predictable it still made for a good check out action flick probably some of the best things about this movie was the cars 70 chevelle 69 mustang and a very nice what i would suspect as to be a 2014 charger all very cool after losing his wife some punks decide to take his nice ride and kill his big mistake it ends up how ironic it is that the kid that stole the car is the son of the guy he used to be in with in the killing business i title this as 2 because as this would and could be the set up for a nice sequel because now the audience knows everything there is to just how good of an assassin he is how he got to where he is i am wishing there was a little more of john leguizamos character because he is the car guy the reason behind the mustang and chevelle overall keanu did his thing enjoyable from his acting stand point there was good action but all the bullets and headshots dont get over the gimmicky side of it story very basic the odds that your car is stolen by your ex bosss son and even in the club i would say its safe to say he kills about 50 guys and its like they all just run into his bullets or throw a few punches and then shot in the head it would have been good for a slight plot twist or better ending but if your a fan of keanu  muscle cars give it a watch,reality
is sick go on you can take the literal one herefirst things first you dont kill the cutest beagle on the planet that too a pup in a movie we are not yet ready for that but if you do which as a matter of fact theon greyjoy did just make sure it is avenged right ramsay bolton are you listening okay so we already knew the plot thanks to the trailer that spoke louder than keanu reeves with thousands of clichd stories of agents mercenaries and hit men that are out there has nothing much to offer except one thing  rad action headshots exquisite finishes gore and mustang engine revving are sheer orgasmic but what it lacks big time is a proper storylinethe direction is not that great either we often see building shots of the city for like 57 times that are downright dispensable fight sequences were pretty cool though who are the directors again stuntmen okay that explains it what can we expectthere is literally no drama present in the movie and the entire movie carries a background beat that goes boom boom which makes it an effort to concentrate on the dialogues dispersed the score is well trance basicallyit is as if the directors thought  lets just build up a huge crowd of hooligans and let keanu shoot them one by one from different angles nay make him headshot each one of them and there will be lots of blood spluttering and let him drive something kewwwwwl too while we are at it let us give him a badass name has a nice ring to itpassable stuff watch only for the action,reality
why have to show the hurt and dead keep animals out of it,reality
huh in response to the ratingsreview after watching the movie yesterday i liked it but the glowing reviews is going a little too far the character of stems from every western youve seen the past lone character whose purpose in life is activated by a terrible tragedy and is slung into action amongst other people similar to him yeah westerns arent made this is the closest to it and its very effective and silly at points and its fun and definitely worth the watch i only wonder how terrible the movie industry has become that this will probably set a new gold standardto be fair i felt the same way about guardians of the galaxy its overblown hype and wonder if some of the overwhelming positive reviews isnt coming from paid reviewers at best this is a blevel 70s style revenge flick a lot of bark and some biteits okay,reality
liam neeson has a special set of skills and now it appears that keanu whoa reeves has them too so ok picture this guy loses wife to illness guy gets as a present from dying wife guy then gets beautiful mustang stolen by russian mobsters who beat said to death guy who was once a professional killer goes into vengeance mode by offing tons of paperweight russkie heavies and finally guy gets visited by police officer at his home who asks him if hes working again huh that guy is of the movie and hes played by none other than thespian in hiding reeves clocks in as the fourth revengehitman thriller to venture into theaters circa 2014 it lacks the startling epiphany of augusts the november man and the high caliber of acting from a certain denzel washington in the equalizer however its much more focused and assured than the totally discombobulated 3 days to kill the weakest of the fourfor the most part is a silly ludicrous picture that doesnt really add anything new or reinvent the wheel via the revenge thriller genre its look is mirrorball glitter and glitz and its style is reminiscent of a hong kong action extravaganza but with less kong and tons of ganza this is a vehicle where keanus dispatches so many bad guys you lose count within the first half hour he does it with some impressive martial arts much more polished and realistic than what he did in the matrix and guns that suggest laser tag video game artistry and men in black i wasnt the only critic who picked up on this as you watch you dont condemn it but you wonder how it didnt somehow land in the straighttodvd category basically the whole point with this october release is that the filmmakers throw in scene after scene of nonstop death and destruction its to distract you from realizing how generic and tepid it isso ok here are some things i pondered while viewing this bad boy with an undernourished 101 minute running time 1 why doesnt anybody in this movie bother to wear a bulletproof vest i mean shoots a lot of his enemies in the chest this might bring down the body count a little 2 why does the antagonist in this case viggo tarasov played by michael nyqvist not shoot the protagonist when hes defenseless and without weapon you know hes gonna eventually get ya in the end if you let him live jeez 3 do the lives of 50 people have to end just because a died i mean i know the was last gift that reminded him of his dead wife but come on he knew daisy name for one or two sequences thats it and yet just about everyone that wasnt involved in daisys passing gets the death incarnate treatment in general i cant help but thinking that is trying to be a parody of your everyday vindictive revenge fare when says the russian gangsters took everything from him i guess he left out the fact that he still has his beautiful home expensive tailor made suits and plenty of discretionary wealthin conclusion this thing is mildly mediocre but i found the lead role of a former humblized contract killer to be a nice fit for keanu reeves hes one of those actors that is better off saying the bare minimum of dialogue in order to get through a movie his job here is to look cool act cool and basically exude a brooding screen presence in his 42nd feature film he pulls it off with veritable aplombduring the second half of keanus title character says quote unquote people keep asking if im back yeah im thinking im back not entirely mr cool breeze but nice try though youre getting thereof note in terms of john stylistic voyeurism look for a dance club scene where reeves gets his killon tom cruise style a la 2004s collateral also look for various subtitles in that seem akin to the ones used in tony scotts man on fire also from 2004 in the realm of casting be on the lookout for three high profile actors whos roles are underdeveloped with most of their scenes probably left on the cutting room floor john leguizamo plays a chop shop owner willem dafoe plays a fellow hitman and friend of character and bridget moynahan plays characters wife oh and watch for the goofy guy from the allstate commercials dean winters you know mr mayhem in a small role as the main villains fruitful lackey,reality

the basic premise of this movie is that is a retired assassin on a revenge rampage were supposed to empathise with a man who was and is a ruthless amoral killer whose former employer included a russian mafia bossthen were supposed to believe that this man is so well known that the entire city knows him yet he lives alone in a literal glass house with zero securitythe local town has an assassins hotel and hangout big enough to house the population of yankee stadium and luxurious enough to have the budget of a small country and this is not played for laughs or weirdness  its just a thingthe assassin himself roller coasters between supposed awesome displays of lethal skill and breathtaking showboating ineptitude such as simply getting back into the vehicle that was stolen from him and returned without checking if its bugged or booby trapped recovering from his failed hit in a hotel known for homing assassins without drawing the curtains or securing the door or taking on the boss and his most deadly henchmen in a carpark without remotely securing the areathe number of times just blasely strolled without so much as a pair of sunglasses or a cap to disguise his identity into situations with dozens of trained killers waiting for him was downright insultingthe gunplay was stupidly showy the martial arts was stupidly ineffective and flashy and every actual hand to hand fight was in the darki liked the movie at the time but hated it in retrospect every scene was a massive insult to my intelligence it lacked the comic book hyper reality of sin city yet it was far too silly to consider as a serious attempt at the genre fal fail fail,reality

what i saw in this movie was the firing of more bullets than i could count guns guns and more guns the movie that trump would love and that the civilised world should revile how can this sort of film exist at a time when massacres are becoming a very frequent event in modern americais it not time to devote creative endeavours to something a bit more meaningful,reality

honestly so dumb and the violence scenes are so long and drawn out there are plenty of amazing films and shows with a ton of violence that i love because theyre interesting but there was nothing interesting or intriguing about the plot or characters in this movie,reality
when you want to spend your evening brain dead this movie is for you no storyline no plot whatsoever pointless violence and unrealistic fighting scenes but the good guy wins all and thats what makes you feel good because hey they killed his as an added bonus anti russian sentiment and gender equality all the bad guys are russians and our hero slaying butterbeans in seconds had his hands full and was nearly killed by an 80 pound female ninja the one thing i did like despite all the stereotypes and mediocre acting was the continental hotel its there for hitmen only and for an equal number of pretty hit women off the grid of law enforcement parties of course who were almost completely absent the whole timeconsider this a comedy rather than an action movie when you are looking for action or a thrill i suggest to skip this movie and book a room in the continental hotel obey the house rules though or you may get killed with a pencil,reality

2014 is a typical action movie about a man taking revenge the movie started with get out from a car while badly injured then the screen goes black and showing him at his wife funeral at the first 20 minutes of the movie its showing us about the daily life of a no one man named and how his killed and how his car get robbed toobut after that 20 minutes running time the movie started to show us about how badass he is and horrible his job world before its turn out that was an exlegendary hitman that retired after his marriage even the car robber father whos was one of his old clients afraid of him so much and tell us how dangerous was that he killed 3 armed men just with a pencil then after that the movie continues with shoots people in the face until the end of the movieas far as i know is the best action movie series this movie is just filled with pure action there was never a dull moment happened there is no pointless long dialogue that makes action sequence to sequence felt confusing every action sequence in this movie is amazingly executed you will never have trouble to understand what happened in front of you all you need to do is sit tight and enjoy the movie,reality
is keanu reeves second best movie next to speed it has tons of highscaled action one heck of a plot and runs in a fast and steady pace for 100 minutesthe movie is about a man played by reeves who retired from being an assassin after the death of his wife a savage mobster and his thugs then steal priceless car and kill his puppy so now its time for to seek vengeance and kill the people that screwed him overi would say this is also a perfect example of a revenge flick similar to kill bill the protagonist must get back at the person for killing something of theirslike i said has incredible action it has enough to satisfy an audience to where they are speechlessthe acting is very good keanu had one hell of a performance in this and knew what to do all the other cast members did a pretty smooth job as wellthe one thing i do not like about this film is when the puppy dies that scene was way to difficult to watch and almost makes you cry but thankfully manages to get back at the back guys for doing thatall in all is outstanding highly recommend it,reality
lots of action scenes some executed beautifully but no story no character development very little dialogue for keanu okay maybe thats a good thing no plotwhats the point of the little videos of his wife and telling us shes dead without explaining the how our the why surely if she was killed hed be more concerned with avenging her than his car and the he had for 2 days might as well have written him as a bachelorthe policeman turns up at his door after he kills 12 men in his house the police officer sees the bodies and the blood on his face but its okay because hes john upposedly hes the top hit man but we dont see him working just getting revenge,reality
i have a love for cinematography so the shots of john in action are just done beautifully,reality
keanu reeves is an exhitman who on the day of his wifes funeral receives a puppy as a final token of love from his wife when thugs break into his home kill the puppy and steal his beloved and rare ford mustang he sets out for revenge which leads him on a path that brings him back to his former lifestyle and pits him against the russian mobis not only a terrific action movie but in my opinion is definitely keanu reeves best role and best performancethe movie is directed by longstanding stuntmen chad stahelski and david leitch and the stunts in it are seriously impressive and keanu reeves performs the majority of his own stunts himself which is really good to see they have made a slick looking movie with not only some incredible action scenes but some really good dialogue scenes toomichael nyqvist plays the main villain and head of the russian mob viggo taraso and alfie allen is iosef tarasos arrogant and foolish son who was the leader of the thugs behind the attack on homeall the acting in this film is superb and as i said this is easily keanu reeves best movie since the matrix and definitely his best performance not just for the action scenes but there are some fantastic emotional scenes too that involve a great deal of anger and despair and reeves is seriously incredible in all of these toothis is such a good movie because its not just a revenge action shootemup movie there is so much more theres actually a lot of interesting character developments you learn a lot about this underworld of criminalsthe action in this movie is almost unrelenting once its starts amazing shootout sequences intense hand to hand combat sequences and what makes it more enjoyable more believable is that you can see its actually reeves doing all this its not a stuntman and this is what keanu reeves is good at he knows how a good action movie should be he famously did his own stunt work in both speed and the majority of stunts in all three of the matrix moviesis a nonstop action movie which has a smart script a terrific hero great villains and some heartpounding action scenes its great to see a movie made by directors who understand the action genre so well and who have made a slick appealing movie with an amazing castbut as i said this isnt just an action movie its so much more and the dialogue scenes are just as intense as the fight scenesif there were any faults in the movie im finding it hard to think of any the final scene of the movie seemed a little sloppy and forced but thats it really i couldnt find fault this is an action movie that knows what it is and a lead actor who knows how to immerse himself in a role,reality
if theres a modern movie that better exemplifies the 80s action movie i dont think ive come across it the plot doesnt really have twists and there are basically no subplots to speak of its just a straight line from beginning to finish reeves plays the titular retired hitman whos just lost his wife to cancer but who receives a beagle as a final present from her delivered after her death he has the for like two days before russian mobsters invade his house to steal his vintage mustang and kill the just for kicks and thus the most plausible revenge plot in history is set into motion theres a lot of violence a lot of characters die some of the action is very reminiscent of the matrix the weaponry is impressive as is the handtohand combat theres a lot to love about the movie as long as youre part of the intended audience ie the actionmovie fan,reality
amazing action performance great cast lot loveable moments of kill his enemies amazing revenge story everything about it of hardcore revenge film it actually perfect film 100 100 a 5050knight caldwell,reality
where to begin keanu was the perfect choice for the ex assasin plunged back into his world by a terrible tragedy it had everything really lots of action and fighting carried well by keanu and eacho actor in their own right are believable  john makes you actually feel for him and stay on his story though out one of the most important things i take from this is that unlike a lot of action films ive seen recently this stays consistent with no boring bits or fragmented conversation you know whos who and can just enjoy it well deserved 910,reality
woah worra filmlove this it gets straight into itno messing about with build ups to the action partonly just watched this recently and this is action all the wayit is quite sad at the same time though but the storyline is simpleeven for me its so easy to follow and when i got to the end i was likenooooooi want mooooorethen i watched the 2nd film and that was fantabulous aswelli cannot wait for the 3rd one omg hows he gonna get out of this onewhoever made these films did a really good job and id love to see more like thesea simple storyline loads of action a cast that suits the parts no flaws no sick no boring romance lots of empathy for the main character what more can we wanti dont normally like too much shooting in one film but this is comprehendiblei love keanu xxx,reality
this is an action revenge movie starring keanu reeves with william defoe michael nyqvist alfie allen and adrianne palicki the script of the movie is very predictable but this definitely will not disappoint the movie experience the action is impeccable and the screenplay will keep you engaged direction needs a special mention who made a great action movie without any specific plot or storyline keanu reeves is magnificent as an action hero and does his job with utmost honesty william dafoe is a super talented actor and he shouldve been utilised more in few action sequences the background music goes mute and you can hear the sound of falling bullet shells which excites background music and songs supports the screenplay there are few scene where aurelio punches alfie and says that his he knows viggo more then his son and when viggo punches his son gives predicts and indicates for a entertaining joyride this is a great entertaining action movie which will keep you entertained,reality
i hate violence usually and have not watched all of reeves movies but i really like keanu for the authenticity he brings to his characters makes me feel like he is someone i would love to meet i could almost touch his grief in this movie,reality
surprisingly good movie it seeems like there is little to work with at first but the world from which retired is very interesting and i want to know more the solid writing and performances and the brutal action scenes make this a gem,reality
i cant praise this movie enough its absolutely brilliant can do action like no other action hero in hollywood ever dreamed off you gets these quick and brutal action scenes thats just sucks you in to this hitman kind of universe were a tough guy just kills everyone if you like action movie then dont skip this one its f amazing,reality
this exceeded my expectations and i really enjoyed it the plot is a basic one almost bordering on ludicrous retired hitman is wronged and seeks revenge but when the action starts wow reeves is excellent as the hero the action sequences are slick and original the mood lighting and soundtrack rocks there is humour and originality in many aspects to the movie i especially liked the hotel for villains storyline which i believe they may be turning into a tv series a really good watch i only had one real gripe reeves is wronged at the start of the movie by threefour russian mafia but then goes on a rampage where he quite easily slaughters hundreds without breaking a sweat surely these few hoods at the start could not take out such a seasoned assassin then again it is hollywood and without it we would not have a movie so will let it slide great saturday night popcorn movie entertainment,reality
just good the starting was good direction was good and acting was good except for viggo he was also good in the beginning but i dont know what happened later i liked the headshots in this movie and that how the whole shooting killing was shown but the plot or story was a bit weak for what i have rated 7 otherwise the camera work and direction was good,reality
stories are very traditional keanus acting skills are suitable for such an expressionless pure and cold character the whole film is devoted to bursting but unfortunately there is a little less plasma,reality
i think with the second movie its the best action movie trigology it hasnt completed yet but the 3 movie has got so i call it a trigology after original bourne trigology,reality
is he made for these films or them for him either way the director gets kudos for a wise choice to a guy that never lets you downas a compliment he has a cardboard way of acting that is uniquewith a heir of mystery to what he brings so coupled by a top actor who shows perfect emotion when falling down you get john a pissed of slightly aging neo who is just as mucha badass then throw in some of the best backdrops to modern cinema a great soundtrack and a very unique story all  1010,reality
i believe keenu reeves at its best as john i liked the movie all the way may for some you didnt like the way but i cant find anything drops in ityes its an usual revenge concept but the way that approached was fabulousbring an exceptional start for the upcoming series,reality
briliant starting from all best action i seen in a while,reality
is a fun action spectacle with a pulsepounding score that is smart enough to cast an actor against type who is committed completely to this abusive insanity,reality
im not someone that usually enjoys action moviesbut i must say this one got meit has all the right elementsmainly actionbut it has that bit of dramaand sadand compassion as wellwhich made it a great watch for me,reality
25 october 2014 is graphic with plenty of bloody special effects especially to the upper body this movie introduces an appealing cerebral element that the director or screen writer along with a more layered antagonist making making for its own bourne identity 2002 character the interplay between and his former partner is consistently developed and brings a tense evolving relational element not part of too many action thrillers there are two lighter scenes which offer up a nice break in the action without having to sacrifice the serious dramatic tone of the movie entertaining satisfying and adding some nice new martial art touches worth the money to see it though,reality
at least they shouldnt kill his dogit was a last gift from his loveable wife omg keanu reeves i am very very sorry i want to be same like you a true lover,reality
high profile stars loose storyline and a hitman as hero who is unbeatable this is good as a one time watch but keep expectations low,reality
keanu reeves portrays a quickly likeable character very quickly the action and special effects are great but the story is what keeps this movie going you immediately want this guy to succeed no matter what well worth checking out even if you dont usually like action films tears shock and anger this film has them all,reality
the film has a loose premise but sticks to the promise of being an engaging crime thriller,reality
the movies is my best action movie i advice to all,reality
if you like action movie than its 100 worth watching a generic action story but they built up john legend so well that youre not gonna care about the story that much keanu still looks young,reality
the best movie star keanu rives and best of all time film is this i hope people get 10 star of this film good job,reality
in the decade where superhero movies are crowding hollywood gives us something different not only it made gutsy move in its story it has best action scenes after matrixjackie chan movies yes jackie chan moviesim not saying that action is same as jackie chan movies but it is taken in a single shot of course action is 1000x better than jackie chan movies i dont like action scenes which involves too much video cuts because it takes advantage of confusion instead of giving us real action also it gives me nauseawell clearly broke the useless tradition of this decade and presented us with wonderful movie with well polished story this is a must watch,reality
fantastic action scenes fights and medium shots that make you believe you are in the middle of the fight,reality
best part of the movie was by far taking the pitbull home from the shelter perfect,reality
best action movie keanu rockswatch it as many times always a rush feel,reality
awesome movie i love this movie actions are amazing,reality
despus de verla dos veces debo decir que mi primera impresin de esta pelcula fue bastante cegada por los grandes momentos de accin que presenta pero despus de verla de nuevo recientemente eso es todo lo que tiene que ofrecer s esos momentos de accin son brillantes pero eso es todo no hay un fondo decente est lleno de clichs del gnero y a la larga es una pelcula bastante mala en su totalidad es refrescante y un mrito total su contribucin al gnero en trminos de coreografa y accin pero nada ms es genial pasar el tiempo pero no te invita a apreciarlo de otra manera si tuviera que compararle con algo sera con un buen videojuego de disparos no uno con una historia fascinante sino uno divertido y con el que pasar el rato pero que al finalizarlo no aporta nada a tu vida,reality
apparently this is entertainment when in reality it is a piece of 1962 propaganda wrapped in a package that got lost in 2014 nothing much to see here just the usual hollywood antirussian propaganda a mans gets killedand whos the baddies the russians of course this just shows me that since 1962 up to now we havent moved forward one bit  a lot of movies are still filled with antirussian propaganda but the directors never contemplate about the dark side of imperialist states like the usa and britain they are probably going to make a movie sometime about how the usa and britain have never lost a war and how they are always doing everything perfect and never lost a single soldier in a battle go and watch this if you want to be tormented by the usual egoistic protagonist who takes out a whole bunch of russians a lot of people argued that the fight scenes are brilliantly done but that doesnt compensate for the egoism and downright propaganda of the story lighting visuals are quite good and here and there you will find some suspenseful moments but dont get too excited suspenseful moments that have the potential to be constructed into psychological masterpieces are merely watered down and consumed by the apparent heroism of the protagonist,reality
am i the only one that didnt really appreciate this moviei gave it 610 for the stellar action scenes if thats all you want from a movie its a 1010 if on the other hand you expect a movie not to insult your intelligence with some ridiculous story and situations then this movie is lacking everybody dreads and he can kill you with anything like hes freaking riddick or something that may work for vin diesel in a fantasy sciencefiction setting but not here yeah yeah people say the movie doesnt take itself seriously and the ridiculousness is tongueincheek but for some reason it doesnt click for me so no 6 out of 10,reality
everything goes to the screenplay and scriptingkeanu reeves acted like liam neenson many times,reality
if you like this type of actions when every second is action after another and you enjoy realistic one by one fight scenes this is your movie but if you like to see a nice story line  a good plot  great characterization and a good twist and anything meaningful you should ignore it it was full of cliches and a 10 year old could write this plot  just a mediocre film like most of the action films they make these days if you want to see a great action movie see oldboy 2003 for example great character building great story line  great acting  suspenseful and realistic fight scenesor one of the most underrated action films intime that is meaningful has an interesting story line and has a message despite being in action genre  i dont know why people who make action movies think action movie genre is an excuse for putting a lot of action scenes together without attention to plot and characterization,reality
pure action and bloodfest exhitman takes revenge motive can only be a joke instead of a violent death of his wife his motive is a dead probably a statement never mind the reason we wanted pure actionstoic characters little substance but plenty of style blood and action,reality
is a master builder and he has had way more wins than that he once killed me with a scar and outbuilded me to launch pad his way to his 700th victory royale his wins need to be edited to fit his victories but it was a great movie 1010 he was amazing when he rekt those n00bs at tilted towers i would recommend this all the way especially to season 3 battle pass teir 100 players 3 is said to be better than the first to so i expect some epic build battles and pump shotgun trickshots,reality
one of the best films of keanu reeves what action  top top top,reality
he got beaten so bad that makes me wonder is this or john weak,reality
i just want to say how much i enjoyed this movie it is now one of my all time favourite movies if you like this genre of movie then you simple must watch it,reality
awesome action movie keanu reeves at his best in john ,reality
at start u may feel wtf is going on  as it goes  than u have a surprise  boom boom  hats of to the director who gave a different and a strong emotional reason  the and the car  to kill a gangster,reality
this movie amazing really good thrillerlong time since i last saw a movie like this love it,reality
for gamers only reeves makes it watchable if youre into brainless violence im not so only made it half way through,reality
i know all the matrix references have been made but its true the matrix has good gangster good solid movie with plenty of action and gun battles and man that car,reality
he never misses he is literally unstoppable this guy is a tank never seen someone move so quick amazing acting all round great acting i was really impressed by how well this film was composed this is great example of what a good film looks like,reality
the new franchise to boost keanu reeves acting career is certainly gonna go down as the best action movie of 2014 it has a great cast with very serious and grim performances while still being charming and intimidating the film starts off with a very generic plot  mans wife dies leaves a  homeinvaders kills and steals car man sets out to avenge the crimes even though it had me bored for the first 10 minutes of plotbuilding i got so immersed as soon as the action and dialogue started popping the cinematography and style is so beautiful and different from other action films which makes it a unique and fresh breath into the genre the film is also filled with stunning performances from reeves and the compelling antagonist  even a surprise performance from willem dafoe one thing i noticed during the action is the fact that the kamerawork has shy completely away from shakycam which is much harder to achieve and so pleasant to look at it makes the action more tangible and easy to follow even though the plot is not really a new thing its unveiled and structured with such grace that the only critique  is the simplicity of it all but overall a really satisfying actionflick that clearly blew me away,reality
legendary movie probably one of the best action movies i have seen in a long time,reality
after a long time i saw this kind of revenge moviethe dialogue of this movie just awesome10 out of 10,reality
need to make a on how he became for real the younger yearsepic money,reality
after watching afew things come to mind 1 probably one of the best action movies ever made2 theres more dialogue in an episode of teletubbies3 you know the story would have played out alloooot differently if his wife gave him a cat 4 would be like  ye  fk that cat  i didnt like it either5 keanu reeves is one of the biggest bad asses out there6 after this movie peeps be like  keanu reeves is the best   im like bitch please  keanu reeves has been killing it since point break 7 body count is 84  excluding the 8  damn  john leguizamo got really old  and really fat 9 keanu reeves hasnt aged at all since bill  ted10 best date night movie  gf loved it 11 gf be like  oh no  they killed his  those fkers better die ,reality
this film tells the story of a retired assassin who is forced out of hiding by a gangsters son who doesnt know who he is messing withi watched the sequel first then this film and i think this film is more realistic than the sequel at least in here gets hurt it is stylish and is fun to watch,reality
might be keanu reeves best movie in years a stylish revenge movie that grabs your heart and attention in the first few minutes and hold you on the edge of your seat for the following ninety the action in this movie is beautifully choreographed and very satisfying this is a must see movies for any fan of action movies such as the original taken or collateral it was my favorite movie of 2014 and i have to give it 910 i love this movie,reality
some films are at their best when they are monosyllabic every rhythm moment and action sequence here was familiar but this movie knew what it wasthrough and through the action did the talking and the characters did the opposite the stylized violence became almost a dance music  guns no words required and  other than the few moments of keanu talking  it was pretty perfect,reality
when this movie released i thought it was just a normal action movie but it changed my mind i watched it over 10 times and i was never bored rather i wanna be john ,reality
the simplicity of this film is attractive straightforward characters motivations and storytelling it doesnt get hung up on unnecessary backstory or fleshing out characters beyond what they need to be for an allout action film this is a good and refreshingly honest choice  it maintains the pace makes the transitions through the story slick and allows you to sit back and enjoy it it is also a risky tactic because the lack of depth demands that every element of the film be tight and foolproof it nearly pulls it off  the performances which have to drive the narrative and create the energy in the absence of detail  are all excellent and the leads very well cast unfortunately the film seems to chicken out at certain crucial moments falling back on tired tropes to manufacture tension makes one or two decisions which do not fit in with the limited picture we have of him and therefore feel incongruous theres a clumsy kill everyone except the woman and then regret it later clich most disappointing is the ageold antagonist walks away leaving henchmen to kill hero trope which feels utterly stupid and out of place in a world constructed as deliberately ruthless viggo is supposed to understand the situation and the man he is up against he knows his ability to escape impossible situations and he knows how many times his own men have failed he has no affection for john and he wants him dead but he leaves his armed henchmen alone in the room to suffocate him with a plastic bag this ruins the whole atmosphere and aesthetic of the filmdespite these disappointing moments this has enough to it to make it a worthwhile watch an honest action flick is one to be praised,reality
this film is nothing more than a reimagining of those old movies from the 70s where some evil people kill a guys wifefamilydogwhatever and he goes on a bloody vendetta the outlaw josey wales comes to mind or basically any charles bronson film with a touch of taken and the usual suspects thrown in there is no time to get to know any of the characters they have zero depth which is fitting since keanu reeves lacks the ability to portray threedimensional characters as the body count piles up willem dafoes character drifts in here and there but he isnt given much to do except look pensive and drift away again this is the perfect film to watch if you just want to zone out and not think very much there are no challenging ideas for you to struggle with just lots and lots of stabbings shootings and headbashings it must have been incredibly easy to write the script for this film,reality
credible in itself yet rooted around one complete ridicule of violence over an individual theme of revenge which is universally baseless a five outta ten is significantly worth the making besides some pretty cool dialogues and oneliners the film does catch the moods of poignancy and darkness quite vividly and exceptionally though couldve been a six from my side but the theme and violence confined my mouse to five,reality
is it a bird is it a plane is it a ufo no its john bullet this movie is probably the best action movie ive watched for me when kenu did the matrix he was amazing but this this is his next big great movie i cant wait for jonh 3 that movie will probably be amazing no spoilers,reality
after loses his wife helen to a terminal illness he receives a beagle puppy named daisy per helens instructions to help him cope with her death he connects with the puppy and they spend their day driving around in his vintage 1969 ford mustang mach 1 at a gas station he encounters a trio of russian gangsters whose leader iosef tarasov insists on buying his car but john refuses to sell it the mobsters follow john to his home that night knock him unconscious steal his car and kill daisy,reality
this is a fast paced action film that gets a solid 810 for the genre the plot is a little thin but compelling nonetheless dont expect too much talk from the lead character hes all about business and getting done what needs doing well worth a watch  hoping chapter 2 isnt a needless extension for the sake of franchise dollars,reality
the story is about a miserable man he loses all his things to need to protect and revenges himself on his enemies who deprive him of the which is sent from died beloved as a memory although the subject matter is dark and sad i think that the audience loves him because his anger is intense and his quick action is bold and beautiful interesting point is that he is known well to people around everybody knows his ability to fight he is wonderful killer the audience can see the story from his angle so they are able to feel as if they were really super strong anyone will come to like him another point which the audience should notice is that this film depicts the black society to be able to watch what we basically do not experience is goodness of films,reality
for the people rating this film low quite frankly i find your lack of taste and intelligence disturbing as your narcissistic view of other people like me who adore this silly yet badass film about vengeance nevertheless there is little i have to complain about this filmnow spoilers ahead i think it simply a near perfect film about how a oddly relatable super assassin who is just grieving the loss of his wife and just wants to be left alone and have some semblance of peace in his life but some punks who think they are just the coolest guys ever come in and break into his home kill his and foolishly because they are typical foolish thugs leave the man alive from the beginning of the film up to that point you are 120 on john side as he effortlessly just dispatches men like they are ants with the mob boss running scared doing everything he can think of to keep the legendary baba yaga from slaughtering him and his entire family and his entire syndicate even attempting to hire a man that could have possibly picked off but ultimately betrays his own mob boss client in favor of john at the cost of his life i really dont have much bad to say about this film other than it is admittingly silly and over the top but that is also what makes it so charming and fantastic and the film even is aware that it is silly but yet its entertaining from beginning to the very end it gets a very rare 1010 from me,reality
although is full of action is boring since its easy to anticipate keanu reeves is not daniel craig not the best actor no style after seeing the first movie i wont bother for the second one the same old tricks not surprising ugly cars no matter how strong was hit hell be back on his feet as new,reality
on paper this film looks like a typical action film however the things that set this film apart is the stylishness of the film and the incredible world it createsfirst of all keanu reeves shows he still has what it takes to be a successful actor he gives a multi layered performance as mr and makes you fear this fictional character and after watching the film i am thankful one thing that adds to the film is that reeves did that majority of his own stunts this makes the action feel more fluid and the man even more badass after seeing reeves in this film i could imagine no one else in the role the films strongest trait is the fight sequences once the action starts it never seems to stop the fights are brilliantly choreographed and they seem realistic and brutal the mixture of martial arts the character uses shows real skill and adds to the realistic feel of the film and world created proves himself capable of killing with both hands and firearm if youre a fan of brilliant action sequences then this is the film for youthe only criticism of the film is the plot although the story brilliantly creates a world of assassins the plot itself is nothing new and has been seen before however despite this i was left satisfied that i had not seen an action film like itoverall left me wanting more and is a real treat for action fans and keanu fans bring on chapter 2,reality
i think im a little late to the party on this one and i guess it must have cost me im an actionmovie fan i grew up in the arniesly era of the eighties and i have plenty of mindless action flicks in my dvd collection  everything from commando to the mode recent shoot em up pleases me to a degree and keanu reeves pops up a fair times in my watchlist however somehow his film where he plays the titular slipped past me ive only just seen it after its sequel was released and during that time ive seen many a positive review saying how great it was therefore by the time i got round to watching it my hopes were highi guess what happened is the reverse of when i watched sex tape and the big screen adaptation of the dukes of hazzard both had been absolutely slated by the critics so my expectations were suitably lowered by the time i saw them and weirdly enough i actually took some small amount of entertainment in both im not saying either were particularly good but enjoyable enough if you were in the right mood this time my hopes were so high i found that what i got didnt really live up to what i was expecting i was waiting for something truly revolutionary and different from anything id seen before what i got felt like just another action moviedont get me wrong  its not bad it was enjoyable enough but it wasnt anything i hadnt seen before is a retired hitman whos forced out of retirement when a baddie played by game of thrones alfie allen kills his yes thats basically the catalyst and motivation for the entire film what follows is your average and i deliberately use the word average rollercoaster of violence and revenge everything youd expect is there gunfights are plentiful theres at least one car chase a betrayal and eventually comes face to face with the evil head honcho so its all there and its well done the violence and there is violence  no pg13 here is believable and gritty and keanu reeves is always fun to watch even when hes trying to be moody and miserable hes still that longhaired bogus surferdude we all fell in love with back in the early nineties so i can see how theres much going for it i was just expecting more and thats a shame really because my hopes were so high that even though everything i like was  technically  there i still came away with the feeling like it wasnt that much of a big deal but like i said earlier a sequel has been made and i will definitely watch that tooat the end of the day this film may not have entirely clicked with me but im glad that keanu reeves is back in a decent franchise and it puts him back in the spotlight  maybe can team up with liam neeson in a taken crossover o,reality
very good action movie that is worth watching very good characters and awesome storyline it is quick pace and throws you right into the story and holds you there until the final scene the characters are likable believable and have audacity the scenes are well done and consist of some of the greatest gunplay that i have seen in any movie,reality
one of my friends suggested me to watch this movie because of my love for the max payne video game series one good thing about this movie is keanu he looks cool throughout the movie a bit blunt here and there but thats okay the dialogue story and the costars and supporting actors did a terrible job i have seen movie with thin storyline but they stand tall with the execution screenplay dialogues unfortunately is not one among them,reality
did the gangsters give john wife cancer no but they did take everything else that was left after his wife died now a broken man who placed heavy sentiment on his car and the unfortunate thieves were john boss son and friends what motivation did they really have to steal the car i mean theyre rich just ask your dad to buy a car like that you idiotso they kill his but they have the nerve to steal his car how dare they revenge silly premise brutal action and lots of killing ridiculous but enjoyable i guess,reality
keanu reeves is an immense performer as he is an elite hit man on a revenge mission his name is enough for his enemies to question their decisions its foreshadowed in the whole movieit is an awesome action movie a deep story and a strong character arch and produced with the slick action techniques of today which you will see in very few films unlike most action movies of this era this film does not rely on quick and nauseating camera movement to show off its cool action moves instead it uses steady and uncut scenes for you to appreciate how much of a bad ass keanu reeves isit one of those hidden gems that are between these piles of garbage if you hit it you are rich it one of those which deserve popularity but is dragged down by the lack of promotion i am so glad i watched this looking forward to chapter 2,reality
this is an extraordinary movie even if its only about shootings and fights it is still amazing and very entertaining to watch and serious,reality
its the story of theon greyjoy who kills the puppy of a professional assassinirony this assassin has no purpose in life other than to shoot other assassins they all hang out in the same club and buildings which is very practical in this kind of situation of course as the french would say not bad for an action flick but im definitely over gun fights and gun choreography in movies so i didnt enjoy this one as much as some people theres really not much in terms of story arc and character development,reality
another awesome performance from keanu reeves i really like the plot all the action are very nice executed if some real fighting moves from martial arts i like the shooting scenes and for these one keanu received some special training the soundtrack is another interesting thing from the movie it fit well i am looking forward to see the second movie of that one released earlier this year 2017 for action movies fans keanu reeves fans this is another movie to be seen,reality
is an amazing action movie it is everything that i love about action revenge type of movies and i think this one nailed it out of the park keanu reeves performance as the title character was awesome he didnt need to say a word for you to feel what he felt and that is awesome you can get behind his character 100 and root for him if you like action and revenge movies i highly suggest this movie,reality
just wondering where the sudden rain and lightning came from when viggo pushes johns car off the ledge on the docks side question 0 of all millionaires go all the way across the city to a helicopter at the docks love the movie just confused if john is after me i would go somewhere other than my house to sit and wait,reality
the bloody action movie added a new style to action and reignited the long career of keanu reeves as an action star reeves0 is a retired assassin who has moved on to a simple life with his wife when she dies of cancer overcome with grief is only able to have a semblance of hope from the gift his wife left him a small puppy encounters russian gangster iosef tarasov alfie allen and seemingly insults him by not selling awesome car iosef retaliates by coming to house beating him up and killing his this action sparks a series of bloody gun battles as pursues iosef through gangsters on a violent path for revenge iosefs father viggo michael nyqvist is the head of the russian mob and seeks to protect his son from the boogeyman that is he hires a former colleague of marcus willem dafoe to take him out path leads him to an exclusive assassin hotel where there are rules to not do business inside the walls and hints at a greater world of assassins check out more of this review and others at swillikycom,reality
i seriously can not wait to watch the sequel for this there are so many things i love about this film i dont know where to start i love how this movie came out of nowhere and just kicked everyone in the backside reeves is intense and you can just tell he is loving every minute of it the world building is an extra bonus the only thing i didnt like about the film is the final fight scene other then that hats off and great times for all the film is about the son of a mega boss killing the of keanu reeves and reeves taking vengeance this movie has the action moves along great the dialogue is the magic behind it all keanu reeves is such an underrated actor because he does action flicks people love to watch im just happy to see him owning his craft,reality
imagine that your entire family was wiped out killed one by one and all that is left in your life is a puppy and someone kills the puppy well that is the story of our friend john here he will stop at nothing to figure out who killed his best friend the this movie is a lot of fun to the core action and suspense packed with thrills i highly recommend seeing the movie if you have a strong appitite for a action packed fun thrill ride kinda movie or if you are looking for a good time i suggest that you watch it yes the violence in the movie is strong and brutal at times but it is still a winner watch it you will not be disappointed that you did,reality
i wanted to give you a quick review of this film and i do recommend it if you like hitman movies this movie is about a hitman who has gone into a peaceful lifestyle and stopped his work as retired until he is forced back into work after becoming involved with the russian mafia it is a great spin of a story taking place in new york city and has fantasy aspects that you may enjoy if you are a fan of for example hitman agent 47 movie  video gamei watched this with low expectancy having keanu reeves as my 2nd to most favorite actor of 2017 i decided i wanted to see this after new years check out this movie 2 coming out in feburary 2017 i will too,reality
for years decades hollywood tried to shove stupid action movies down our throatsevery bullet misses punches arent heavy at all and the hero aaaaalways has to say somethingfeaturing the fantastic amazing wonderful keanu reeves is showing hollywood how its supposed to be done in a 100 minutes long movie which is actually rather short for todays trends the movie makes us feel like john feels hate like john hates and cheer as john kills its one of the few nonsuperhero action movies that wives and husbands can watch together and completely enjoy itwhile respecting the the heroes story timeline mixes it up and shows us all that all it takes to create a badass action hero and a great action movie franchiseshoot kill repeat no senseless talking explaining dramatizing does exactly what every single one of us watchers would want to do in his situationgreat movie great fun awesome keanuthe only thing that could improve the movie would be brendan fraser,reality
i missed the very beginning but soon caught up when dad asks son you stole john car and killed his the game of thrones actor clearly never learned his lesson back in the day and should have just presented his nut sack on a plate to and said sorry as it was he didnt take his error of judgement seriously and we get to enjoy a retired hit man regain his touch a lot of dead bodies usually clinical believable action if you believe in trained man against oafish clumsy boys few facial expressions little humour it works cause who really cracks jokes when fighting for your life or dusting yourself down after being given a good beating which receives quite a lot actually more grown up than die hard not as dark as the mel gibson i just want my 70000 dollars movie great cameos in there too during a good action shoot em up hour and a half,reality
i have ambivalent feelings after watching this movie this is a stylish action film where the actions are so cool and believable and sometimes even too realistic however the acting of the supporting roles actors is simplistic we have seen thousands of such acting instances in average hollywood movies the story is bad i understand the the movie is meant to be an action movie for having fun time but sometimes the story is so bad that i felt uncomfortable on my coachone interesting fact there seems to be a cinematographic novelty in this film with regard to fights the full scale mixture of martial arts and gun fight this was what i was long waiting for because in reality this is what will happen if we have a welltrained hit man good job,reality
i was concerned this will be another dull same old same old moviebut it wasntthis is a great action movie that creates a new superhero assassin it pulls you in emotionally and then kicks the holly out of the baddies i love it there is very few words spoken in the movie but it achieves something incredibly entertaining the magic of the continental and the sophistication of the secret world combines with the hardcore grip of a pure action adventurethe director and writers should be commended for creating a masterpiece that other recent superhero movies can just aspire to,reality
i like action movies although fight scenes usually bore me a little most scenes in this movie however are very smooth the men in suits make things look more sophisticated the magnificent choreography is almost graceful all in all the fight scenes are beautiful and fascinating to watchthe use of russian is cool gives the whole thing a rough edge i love the subtitles they have put in so much work to get that just right the accentuated words make you hear what words are stressed even if you dont speak russianthe music is excellent strong meticulous with a rough edge perfect for this moviethe story is compelling from the first second youre drawn in im very curious for the sequel chapter 2,reality
read a review calling it kinetic thats pretty much it good guy seeks revenge on bad guy and his minions plot is thin so its all about style and this does a pretty darn good job considering just how hollow and clichd the story isactually good soundtrack good taste in music and a score fairly diverse but always coherent with the scenes the dialog gets a bit too stereotypical on occasion but theres some good fun there and theres enough in the film to make it a relevant watch without completely despairing as youd think from such an utterly actionoriented productionthe cinematography is actually quite good and visually this movie deserves to be seen in high definitionits really pretty good for how little there is to work with 6510,reality
this movie is a absolute banger from the top notch acting all the way to the simplistic but greatly executed story  this movie is amazing and thrilling in every sense of the word and not just as a thriller but as a film it may be just a revenge angle but you totally get the main characters motives and get behind him quickly everybody who wants a great thriller that is entertaining and stylistic from beginning to end this is your movie its worth it for the fight scenes alone to say more about the look and sound of this movie it looks suspenseful and fascinating kinda like a comic movie this film also has a great score and some perfectly fitting songs in it like killing strangers from marilyn manson which fits the story very much so like i said this is worth your time i think enjoy,reality
i do not get tired of watching this moviethe main character has a skill set that is powerful and compelling the action gunfu segments are flawless and clearly resulted from very professional choreography if you are into firearms you will want to watch this over and over the sequence that featured the keltech ksg shotgun made me go out and get oneit is a compact powerful and lethal weapon for home defense the underworld depicted the continental the red circle were very believable although you know that they could not exist and i enjoyed seeing what dinner reservations turned into and how they used gold coins as their own private currencyvery creative,reality
my favorite movie of the yearthe truth is that is just a messy third act away from being a completely perfect film but i dont think any less of this material nor the intent and thats all thanks to a group of filmmakers with the simple gusto to actually make a revenge movie but that just becomes our waypoint into a world full of weirdo hitman hotels tactical double tapladen action and a populace filled with nothing but goofy reverence for keanus pulp menace wheres hes really at his bestso yeah this one is absolutely awesome,reality
wow watching this is so satisfying a straight to the point film from beginning to end no moment is wasted and i loved every single second of this film stylistically the film is carried out beautifully the action sequences are intense the idea of this underground world based in the continental use specific gold coin currency and their special waste disposal service is as intriguing as the character himself what surprised me the most was also how funny the dialogues are when you least expects it from viggo and this is easily my favorite action movie of all time i wish the sequel is about backstory on how he left viggo,reality
pretty sure this is how everyone would imagine we would react if someone messed with our oh and our wives as well okay with that being said this was an excellent movie the best action i have seen keanu do since the matrix moviesthe story is good enough to hold your interest as welli rated it excellent because i had low expectations for this movie and they were blown away however if i saw this movie in the theater i am not sure my ratingreview would be the same it is one of those types of moviesenjoy then prepare for the sequel,reality
if you start a drinking game where everyone takes a shot whenever someone in gets shot in the face theres a good chance at least one of you will be admitted to the er with acute alcohol intoxication i see this film as an opportunity missed keanu looks amazing at 50 and definitely carries the sad action antihero role well the technical aspects of this film are excellent the action sequences flow beautifully in their cartoonish brutality but the film falls short in the execution of the script a story this silly should not take itself so seriously if only they had more fun with the ludicrous plot and dialogue i mean youve got the mayhem guy from the allstate insurance commercials playing a badguy executive secretary surely thats good for a joke somewhere an 80s action movie in 2014 needs a little more effort to make me laugh with it rather than at it id only recommend it if you are willing to turn your brain off for a couple of hours and enjoy the ride,reality
now this is an action film  from the beginning  well not actually first 10 minutes or so but to the end is full of action interesting plots and scenes and really keeps you entertainedi must say that i have not seen in a long time a better action movie keanu is perfect in the role all other actors are too the story is great the moving of the filmplot is done perfectly all those secret society mafia agents living by the rule are great there is really nothing that you can say is bad about the moviethe language they usei thought it was romanian almost entire film but when they mentioned the russian church i figured out it must be russianloved the ending of the film most of the films have some kind of a bad ending and that can ruin all but this one is perfectmy favorite partscene when those cleaners come to his house after the first shooting and wrap those dead bodies like mummies  man that was somethingnine from me dont know exactly why it is not ten but 950 would be more exact,reality
is there some sort of rule in hollywood the once you hit 50 you join the hitman club because if there is i have no complaints if they keep dishing out movies like theseas you knowkeanu reeves loses his wife and she gives him a so he doesnt cope mourning alone gangsters rob him and kill his and all hell breaks loose the body count and blood in this movie is ridiculousmax payne is what should of beenbut keanu reeves and co have simply made it better the action and the booming soundtrack is fantastic say what you want about keanu reeves being wooden but ive always enjoyed his moviesthis is more of a resurgence for him as it was for liam neeson in takenoverall score 810,reality
to start off the bad points of the movie half of the actors including the main villain felt average or even below average acting skill in some places the effects were easily noticeable sometimes terrible and last but not least the move felt cheesy it felt like they try to paint this super powerful image of the main character just like internet does with chuck norrisnow with the good points as i mentioned half of the cast was pretty bad but keanu reeves was really good i also liked willem dafoe ian mcshane john leguizamo daniel bernhardt and clarke peters some of them had so little screen time but when they did it felt so refreshing to see an interesting character after the sea of average and obviously the most important thing is the stunts a lot of the time they were impressive and kept me on my toesall in all is a pretty good action movie i wouldnt give 7 if it wasnt for keanu i feel like hes a good actor and he deserves a good movie once again after the matrix trilogy but this wasnt it ill keep my fingers crossed for you keanu,reality
keanu reeves is an outstanding actor in this movie and i have always loved his acting he really is a talented person and i must say this movie is a must watch to everyone out there with an interesting story title how he misses his wife after she dies and how he receives a pet puppy as a present from his dead wife is a really interesting storyline and when the gang of thugs of a known businessmans son comes and takes everything from him it is the time to unleash the beast in him and for them to pay the price for the damage they did the directory and the person who did write the script did a great job hard to find such meaningful movies these days when all these fantasy movies comes outgreat movie no more words to describe it,reality
okay so i finally took the chance in watching even after all of the negative reviews that are everywhere good thing is those negative reviews are bs only thing i can agree with in the negative reviews is that keanu reeves is not the best actor for this genre but he did do a fair job keanu done well in the matrix but as for action films he just doesnt fit that part especially a film like where he is the top assassinso after watching the film i see it is exactly what anyone would expect to see the story was good and the acting was fair the film style and the graphics were great this is a fairly put together film sheds light for many with the what would you do in such a situation check the film out and stop listening to those bs reviews out there most of those bad and good reviews are bought reviews,reality
first i hesitated to buy the dvd cause of the so many bloody bullets fallen in this thriller so you are warned then when i read the reviews here i thought to give it a chance also my friends who watched it recommended to check it out in fact i dont regret its a clear revenge story  la rambo i was never bored the pace is fast and the film has been cut to a perfect running time of 97 minutes keanu reeves looked cool and credibly in the real fight scenes with he succeeded no doubt in an unexpected comeback i hope to see him soon in a sequel710,reality
i am glad to see that reeves has returned back to action films as i think he is one of the best together with tom crouz in this kind of kickass filmsi found the acting of reeves as playing mr was again great reeves has class even with few some extra kg and i like itbut the plot was the absolute zero it was like that knock knock  who is there  the bogeyman  the bogeyman who  the bogeyman wanna beat to death your dogkiller soni think the public would appreciate something more than this simplistic plot i cant compare that film with matrix or constantine but in any case there are some very good action scenes here so it worths watching it one time and thats it,reality
is a 2014 american action thriller film directed by chad stahelski and david leitch starring keanu reeves michael nyqvist alfie allen adrianne palicki bridget moynahan dean winters ian mcshane john leguizamo and willem dafoe the film stars reeves as john legendary assassin keanu reeves retired from his violent career after marrying the love of his life her sudden death leaves john in deep mourning when sadistic mobster iosef tarasov alfie allen and his thugs steal johns prized car and kill the puppy that was a last gift from his wife john unleashes the remorseless killing machine within and seeks vengeance meanwhile iosefs father michael nyqvist  johns former colleague  puts a huge bounty on johns head,reality
after all these years though hes still quintessentially keanu he radiates a zenlike calm which makes him simultaneously elusive and irresistible especially in the face of great mayhem theres still a boyish quality to his face but it belies the wisdom of his years hes smarter than he looks but hes in no great hurry to go out of his way to prove it to youat least not on screena character like is right because it allows him to be coolly almost mythically confident yet deliver an amusing deadpan oneliner with detached precision but when the time comesand it comes often in john he can deliver with a graceful yet powerful physicality,reality
is a 21st century gift to viewers who were tired of seeing action movies with poor story shallow plot  cgi is a grand piece of action which has bullets  like lot of bullets great dialog cool 80s reference  few funny moments which are missing in todays action movies keanu reeves look was amazing  the fight choreography reminds me of movies like collateral  the even the influence of martial art movies are quite visible the villein is quite strong great dialog good sets  different languages for all the movie action gun battle lovers is a great piece of action which would surly take your adrenaline level to the topps if a prequel is made it would be great to see how  why is so bad ass 5 star for this amazing movie,reality
as mentioned by many and as may have been guessed by reading the short description the conflict in the movie is very one dimensionalyou do however get a subtle glimpse into a complex world left behind and surprisingly convincing action scenes well the whole movie was really just one action sceneyou can count the bullets fired and he runs out of bullets as you would expect he doesnt have superhuman abilities he does well but not magically his minor character development presents a person who you would believe could be real and who would respond the way he does in the film  though you dont really get to fully understand that until laterbest part for me is that consequences of actions are shown i cant really explain that more without adding spoilers so i wont but by the end of the film it should make sensealso you can see a camera man or stage hand in one of the many many many many fight scenes  which is always a bonus,reality
from my perspective theres only one reason to watch a picture like this and thats to simply escape reality altogether and get your vicarious thrills through the impossible escapades of the films titled hero thats not meant to be a put down i enjoy these flicks myself when im in the right frame of mind but i dont pretend theyre anything more than over the top shoot em up action as they go for the proverbial gusto i must have lost track of keanu reeves career there for a while because i never would have considered him to be the kind of action hero the picture calls for here at the age of fifty the role calls for a fair amount of athleticism and reeves pulls out all the stops sometimes if im alert enough ill start taking a body count when the carnage begins but with this one i got distracted by the waste disposal crew accepting their dinner reservations setting the torch to viggos michael nyqvist private stash was the icing on the cake for this viewer drawing me to the conclusion that the russian mobster would have been a whole lot better off offering the four million dollars to to just go away,reality
some people get this movie others dontxkcd explains it bestjust once i want a real action movie 30 seconds of exposition followed by a perfect 90minute action scene with a huge budget a good choreographer and a great director and they should center it around some character we already know someone we will never get tired of watchingcoming this summer keanu reeves beats up everyonehttpsxkcdcom311still waiting for the river tam version,reality
i have to make a confession before getting into this movie  i normally cant stand keanu reeves apart from playing a likable goofball in the bill  ted films and an okay performance in the matrix i dont think hes a particularly good actor which is the main reason why i avoided this movie when it played in theaters i decided to give it a look after hearing several positive reviews of it and after finding a copy i could check out for free from my local libraryafter watching it i am glad that i took a chance for starters reeves gives an adequate performance it certainly helps that he doesnt have a huge amount of dialogue but what he is given he does deliver acceptably however he does a bravo job when it comes to the physical part of the role  he throws himself into the action coming across both as a spectacular skilled foe while at the same time not coming across as outlandishly fancy  i could believe a man could be skilled enough to do everything he did it also helps that he gets wounded and hurt along the way which prevents him from becoming unbelievably and annoyingly perfect while im on the subject of action kudos has to also go to director chad stahelsk for staging it successfully again and again the gun fights and martial arts are spectacular praise has to also go to him for keeping the movie moving speedily along without any boring bits despite there not being a terrible amount of plot and for the fact that the little plot there is will be familiar to many viewersi see they are making a sequel to this movie if both reeves and stahelsk return ill definitely be seeing it,reality
is a dark and explosive action hit now before you commit to watching this movie you must be in the mood for overthetop unrealistic action violence  if that is what you are looking for then provides in every area the movie revolves around a retired hitman who recently dropped out of the game to stay at home with his wife after a series of unsettling events john is thrown back into the world of underground mobsters and assassins as he seeks revenge against the men who took all he had left the story is not great but provides enough sway to convince you to cheer for throughout the movie as he kills dozens of russian mobsters keanu reeves performance is subpar as his character rarely speaks and shows little to no emotion but since he is a world class assassin this may fit his character perfectly the fight scenes are entertaining and the handhand combat competes with that of the bourne series but the story is not as compelling and also not as confusingoverall is a satisfying action movie but dont watch it for anything but a good time,reality
liam neeson must have been busy so the director got keanu reeves to take his place problem is reeves isnt known for playing this type of character and took away something from the filmhowever since the film has got a cool plot to it its still pretty good even with reeves as the lead reeves plays the deadliest hitman ever that just so happens to be retired because he fell in love well his wife died and left him a puppy he encounters some punk russian kid that wants his ride later the kid shows up takes the ride kills the and beats up john well he messed with the wrong guy it just so happens the kids mob dad was the guy john used to work for and now he wants revengewhats cool in the movie is the whole hitman code speech the continental hotel where one doesnt do business paying with these gold coins and making a dinner reservation the ending is where the film falls apart and just becomes another action flick with the hero out to get the final bad guy it was rather silly but the first 80 minutes was really goodfinal verdict check it out good story for action fans,reality
heh so thats what it looks like when matrix and equilibrium have unprotected relationship sadly if the two movies above were filled not only with extremely brilliant scenes for the technology of the time but also quite deep and meaningful plot  seems to be a pretty onesided coinhe lost his dearly beloved he got mugged thats all the premise you need though i do admit that viggos exposition was impressive some background would be nicegranted all the plot unravellings i dont understand why would he hang up viggos call both john and viggo know better and instead of going on some mad rampage a simpler fate couldve been arranged much simpler or it could end the same but it would at least look plausiblered circle encounter is laughable beautiful obviously until he stares at his desired victim and just lets him run away i first thought he wants the usual suffering torture etc but apparently he never needed it so why not end the movie halfway through if there was a chanceall the side characters are merely plot devices female assassin has to explain what the management was marcus deus ex machinayosefs death could probably only rival talia alghouls home siege red circle car scene all these great performances yet the very antagonist of this movie was supposed to be hidden in impenetrable fortress but snipe here snipe there done seriouslythe list can continue but the point is that very often the suspension of disbelief is raised even if you really want to keep itand of course i cant help but stand in line with every russian who was severely offended by this movie now i know that between italian and russian mafia  these nations shouldnt really be surprised when their people are slaughtered and i would never imagine that hollywood would ever get russian actors but that song the lullaby i know russians are a sick nation firsthand but not even the craziest of us would sing a lullaby in a nightclub in a bath with half naked womeni feel that giving the movie 710 is a very generous gift if not for and viggos performance  510 wouldve been the right place aka  a movie that really isnt remotely good but is at least worth looking for the some thrills but hey i can play as now he is played by ol good neo and there was plenty of gun fu who can resist that,reality
this film surprised mebecause i didnt expect it to be so much funwhen i first saw the trailer for this filmi figured it was just going to be this really over the top action movie that will certainly be loved by animal rights activistwhat i didnt expect was for the main character that being to have so many layersnowadays many action films tend to lean toward the protagonist being this icy and remorseless human being who wouldnt show any expressions even if he stepped on a nailbut didnt do thathe had a difficult past he cried when he was sad he loved his car and he showed a great deal of affection to his dogthe story had a few plot holes and was a bit choppy and silly from time to timebut at least the movie had substancethis is one of those films where there is no need to be concerned about character development a well written story or oscarcaliber performancesthis is a good old fashioned popcorn movie to which the audience can simply kick back relax and have a good timeand thats all there is too it,reality
keanu reeves stars as the badass hitman who happens to kill dozens of people in order to avenge the death of his that was gifted by his recently deceased wife the action is slick and in some ways is reminiscent of taken in the manner of the deaths throughout the movie the motive behind the action of is not clear he basically does all the killings in order to take revenge for his and his stolen car it does not make much sense which is why it is hard to understand what the screenwriters were thinking while writing the performances of keanu reeves is understated and a tad bit disappointing the short runtime makes it easy to watch but the absurd plot will not please the people who are looking for a smart ingenious thriller please leave your brains at home before watching this movie,reality
i mean cmon cmon movie you are a fun movie stop being so grim about things you had great action great cinematography appropriate  casting of keeanu reeves as that plain faced gunchrist being all stupid and honorable goofy russians more goofy russians terminal amounts of goofy russians that scene with the policeman its fun even some keanu moping was appropriatebut why did you have to kill a puppy movie killing puppies is not fun movie its antifun if you have a character kill a puppy a shot in the head wont be enough closure and so it wasnt and the movie was made significantly less fun by it on the bright side i kinda now like ramsay a bit more,reality
is not just another action packed train its a roller coaster and in which i happily enjoyed my ride you have a easy opening sequence like going up in a roller coaster but just minutes into it the ride starts with endless ups and downs for you to cheer then there is acting of the cast each one did their role perfectly and effectively and the cast is great from neo to goblin to theon greyjoy we have a variety of good actors and then again after one last upside down the movie flats outs like at the end of roller coaster ride this movie will again remind you a big budget is not important for big thrills this is a roller coaster ride you should try one time,reality
so why watch i asked myself that same question when the wife and i got a free redbox code and she had heard good things about this movie and wanted to watch it while i on the other hand not being a big fan of keanu reeves originally wanted no part in it but decided that as long as we were watching for free then i couldnt complain too much and there was absolutely nothing to complain about i loved this moviethe draw to this movie is of course the nonstop heartpounding action the plot wasnt complicated and there was a lot of this universe left unexplained but i felt that actually added to the movie they didnt have to get into ever painstaking detail of who was because the bad guys knew who he was and they were terrified of him that was really all you needed to knowlike my summary says this was just a surprisingly fun movie just sit back dont let your brain think too hard about the journey and just enjoy the ride,reality
i suppose for me the idea of was something like falling down but without the social comments and instead of an ordinary guy pushed over the edge here the protagonist is a retired hitman needless to say the entire plot is adequately summed up in the trailer and if you like movies that set out to entertain in a simple way the comic book logic and emphasis on stunts and action here will be right up your alley from my viewpoint i hesitate to say reeves carries this movie to a certain extent but i dont want to take too much away from the rest of the cast though some like palicki arent given much of a chance to demonstrate their full range of talents or have a strong impact on the proceedings for lack of time on screen nyqvist gives an interesting performance but is fighting against a particularly weak script even by action movie standards and his russian mob boss character often comes off as somewhat of an imbecile even if there are deliberate attempts at humor peppered inoverall reeves is appealing and inherently sympathetic with a sombre lowkey performance sort of reminiscent of what he did in the watcher notably his physical work with regards to the action is commendable but in my opinion it is a shame it was not applied to a movie with a slightly stronger script and direction when compared with a movie that strives for similar goals like the equalizer which lacked those deficiencies and made for a more well rounded and engaging viewing experience worth watching could of been better so  out of ,reality
under normal circumstances i wouldnt have seen im not a big fan of action thrillers and keanu reeves hasnt been my favourite actor either the selection of movies was pretty limited at the theatres so decided to give a chancehave to confess that i was pleasantly surprised by the film and enjoyed it much more than expected in particular keanu reeves as was very good in the past the only roles that he ever looked comfortable and appropriate in were the characters who looked somewhat bewildered about what was going on the first matrix film in particular played to his strengths whereas the follow ups didnt convince as he was supposed to be a stronger character there is no doubt that he pulls this off in so will not be quite as snooty about keanu in the future the film itself is quite stylish and somewhat similar to sin city in terms of style personally i found the on screen comments quite annoying but the film is reasonably written in terms of screenplay if you are a fan of action thrillers andor keanu reeves im quite sure youll really enjoy this movie,reality
a retired hitman gives up his criminal lifestyle due to personal tragedy  when the russian mob steal his car and kill his puppy he decides to go in a revenge mission and thats that as far as inciting incident and plot line goes in this modern film noiraction thriller  despite having a painfully over familiar story that youve seen countless times is far more thoroughly enjoyable than it has any right to be  the fact that it stars keanu reeves as keanu reeves action hero should put you or any other rational intelligent off the film but hes actually quite good in this  okay hes basically choreographing all the same moves as he learned in the matrix but thankfully reeves doesnt have to do much involving the skill of acting  why break the habit of a life time   but as a no holds barred enjoyably mean thriller with its tongue firmly in cheek  sorry to disturb you mister but weve had a complaint about the noise its very entertaining  if you want to find out how this movie could have been check out the horrible mess that is smokin aces which has a not too dissimilar plot,reality
i do not understand why this movie has that many good reviews sure it has some good things going for it choreography some characters nice action scenes interesting places but thats it the whole plot especially the first 20 minutes happens too fast for the audience to even feel some sympathy for dialogs are clumsy some situations are ridiculous and i do not mean the fight scenes those i can cope with the flow is justweird oh and lots of clichs really predictable characters with no real personality everyone is kinda hollow and simple i dont know maybe it was not supposed to be taken seriously but it sure does not feel like a light hearted action film,reality
ok i know it is a movie a complete work of fiction i know actors didnt really die but this kind of movie glorifies pointblank execution killing justified because the guys being killed work for a russian mafia in new york but it still cheapens life and we simply have too much of that in our moviesin general i like keanu reeves and i like his character here who formerly worked as a hit man for the same russian gang that he has to turn against he had successfully gotten out retired and had a life with his loving wife but she had a terminal illness and she died still in grief he gets a delivery at home it is a cute puppy that his wife had arranged to be delivered right after her death so he would have a companion and he could remember herstopped for gasoline in his beautiful 1969 mustang puppy in the front seat a guy walks up and asks how much shocked simply says it is not for sale the man says something rude in russian then is shocked when answers him in russian that night the alerts and gets up to find three men in his house they must have looked up his address from the mustangs license plate they beat him mercilessly killed his and stole his mustang sounds like an old western movie doesnt it well this guy is the frivolous son of the russian gang leader and when the dad michael nyqvist as viggo tarasov finds out his son stole john car and killed his he knew would hunt all of them down which is what he does and that is mostly what the movie is aboutthe other good role is willem dafoe as fellow hitman marcus who appears to accept a 4 million job to kill but instead he ends up helping himthis is just a plain shoot and kill revenge movie and it could have been so much better but i suppose this is what appeals to movie goers nowadays,reality
i really struggled to choose a rating for this movie lots of good lots of badgoodkeanu does a great job just the right mix of believable and unbelievablereally excellent directing and cinematography its really easy in these kinds of films for the action scenes to be hard to follow but these are great no surprise this crew were associated with the matrix whose action scenes were similarly cleana few nice little surprises but not enough of thembad spoilers hereoh lord the clichs first the entire premise badass hitman forced out of retirement to avenge a wrong done to him russian mob boss with brash dumbass son obligatory stash of weapons and money sealed under concrete floor old friend who appears to have turned on our hero but saves his bacon at a couple of crucial moments climactic fight with the main bad guy in which they toss aside their guns and fight hand to handthat wrong done to him killing his and stealing his car seriously i get the sentiment behind the and his dead wife and all but still i was reminded of the bit in last action hero about how they killed his favorite second cousin or whateverif this was the first movie youd ever seen in this genre it would be totally amazing as it is i kept seeing a lot of things id seen before and not enough things that i hadnt those things were really well done but that doesnt make up for them being horribly unoriginalif you can quiet your brain enough to just watch and enjoy this is worth seeing just dont expect to see much that is new,reality
is an awesome video game and one of the best thirdperson shooters ive ever played with incredible groundbreaking graphics a handsome lead character to control in and a more clever story premise than you might realize whats that is a movie is a movie is a movie that explains why i was so good no wonder has a video game plot video game action a video game reality a video game mentality video game art lighting and text and a bunch of random dudes popping out out of nowhere getting shot one by one like theyre in some video game or something keanu reeves kicks serious ass as and i laugh at the thought of people who dont think hes a good actor reeves is keanu reeves is really cool is really uncool i love puppies as much as the next guy but not as much as apparently john 75 man kill count speaks volumes has a genius story premise with well choreographed and very well shot stylish action that is fun but not that suspenseful almost has too much pointless violence but they did mess with his puppy and it is such a pure action film,reality
of its genre a quite entertaining if ultimately absurd way to spend a couple of hours of your life other posters have gone into the plot discrepancies before and considering there isnt really what you could call a plot then these are major flaws the only slightly interesting plot element is the continental hotel a hotel for hit men and hitwomen where psychopathic killers can be assured a good nights sleep without fear of being attacked by other psychopathic killers perhaps there is a hole in the market for that sort of thingbut if you are able to overlook the films flaws you will find much to like here it is slickly and stylishly shot the action sequences of which there are many are well paced and choreographed in a style which borrows heavily from mma its has a strong supporting cast and even keanu reeves looks convincingthere is a time and a place for this sort of film and it does what it sets out to do with a degree of flair and i for one wouldnt mind seeing more of john ,reality
totally insane movie with awesome fights keanu delivers a terrific performance the story line is very weak but the characterization of the hero is stunning the other characters have limited screen space full credits to the stunt master is a killer ghost man he can kill three men armed only with a pencil but somehow manages to overlook a couple of brainless thugs hack into his house lets them beat the crap out of himself kill his and steal his car is so famous that even the policeman the bartenders the mafia all the town know him but the son of a mafia boss for some reason does not even hear about him the funniest thing in the movie is the hero kills hundreds of gangsters the mafia boss and his son just for a stupid this movie should have been titled a man rises for a dog,reality
just another action movie with an ok script good cast ok acting nothing but a lot of action really liked the character by keanu reeves and his past liked the parts where he speaks russian but a lot of scenes are just so much clichjumping out of the car in the last second dodge a bullet in the last second things that you see in all of other ok movies out there i thing that they had all the potential to make a great movie but turns out to be just ok dafoe could had been used in a way better way than what he waswell i think it will be just another action movie that nobody will remember in an near future ,reality
7210 from 94363 users not bad huh i honestly hope its a solid 7 i really have a weakness for keanu reeves and some of his films are one of my favourites the last one i have watched was the 47 ronin 2013 and hated it 6 minutes  its dark and gloomy i already love it 8 minutes  and they already want me to make cry i have a goodie good feelings about it 15 minutes  holy f a reason to start the action going on is dumb as it gets but damn now that will justify everything that hes going to make to the bad guys 26 minutes now thats how you build up the tension and atmosphere amazing work i want see more29 minutes  nice action ruined by cgi blood for f sake why oh why they cant stick to the 90s blood effects they were realistic and looked amazing and this craps is plain rubbish 33 minutes  the film has a big badass written all over it great cast keanu reeves willem dafoe ian mcshane alfie allen music story action and a bad cgi blood 52 minutes  an amazing mixture of equilibrium 2002 lon 1994 and assassins 1995 and all this with keanu reeves 1h minutes  first lame scene but it was a fight vs a girl those are always lame1h 13minues  the action sure as hell looks amazing and there is one after another all the time wtf with the ending just wtf it was a direct insult from a director because you cant call it anything elsenice action film ruined by a terrible ending there is also no story whatsoever the longer i think about it the more i am surprised that i liked it lets just leave it heretgchans rating 610,reality
the first 30 minutes is very the equalizer i was thinking give up on it the policeman scene after the home fight changed my mind and scenes like this one actually is the entertaining part of the movieim not the fan of the story so when the police showed up i thought john is about to be hunted by both gang and police which is a sign of you can spend your night better than thisno the conversation between john and policeman jimmy change the tune of the whole storylegendary hitman is a famous hitman a fair hitman a man whose reputation is so good even police dont want to bother him everyone in the business knows him and almost everyone respected him with this idea in mind the story makes a little sense now the ridiculous decision that let the gang boss go and killed his son is because his fairness johns business is always with the dogkilling son until gang boss killed his friendthe idea of continental hotel is interesting too when hitman does business they stay in the hotel so they can reset without worry the one breaks hotel rule will be executed by the hotel this alone can make another moviein the end ive to say movie like this one and the equalizer makes me aware that my time is passing kids nowadays like movie like such a lot of action less story,reality
this is a nice movie if you are looking for some action without any further sensekeanu is the completely overpowered superman hero killing every guy on his way to revenge he could have killed easily some times because one of the bad guys obviously was a better fighter and has beaten him up twice but of course keanu wins at the end it is like one of the old superhero movies or macgyver the bad guys always kill the innocent just for fun right when they get in front of the gun but the main enemy cant be killed when unconscious no those enemies has to be brought into some prison and even then the bad guys dont kill them immediately no they chat and have a good time and before he gets killed the boss leaves of course maybe he is too soft to see his enemy dying just as an example of this noncredibility but still nice braindead actionthe storyline is pretty much linear no big surprises some strange decisions and some illogic moments,reality
a one time watch movie with lots and lots of head shotsi guess he kills 2 of every 3 gang members with a shot in their head same revenge story but this time for a dogvillain character is not described properly and is portrayed less muscularthe story revolves around a guy who returns to the hell of mafia he once retired for his love just before his wifes unexpected death she gifts him with a puppy which some jerkvillains son kills for his car so seeking our for his revenge his melancholy life becomes a action packed hell ride and end up killing everyone and also finds another dog,reality
i didnt buy it i really like keanu and some of his movies are really cool and interesting but this one is like an almost complete nonsense for me just killings and killings of bad guys because is sad and there is nothing left for him in this world maybe in the killers world they are like that i dont know i liked taken with liam neeson better it had a more credible story in most of the other actors didnt perform wellthe son of the big boss is playing as unsustainable as he did in game of thrones i guess keanu had to drag all this movie by himself and he wasnt that convincing all the time although there are some scenes where i liked his acting and the fight scenes were pretty realistic without too much fancy moves and visual effects i dont want to criticize the work and effort put into this movies is just that this movie its not for me 100 ,reality
john quick and slick close range shooting hasnt been developed or observed in this movie making eraso these gun fights were unique and mind blowingkeanu reeves couldnt be any more of a perfect actor to play this character because of his slim body and ninjitsu skills which he carried out from matrixhis black shiny suit attire and black mustang suited him and his devotion on getting his gift avenged i liked his dedication and his focusreally cool movie,reality
going into this film i had high hopes regarding reviews all around is keanu reeves back no does keanu reeves excel in the role of yes but not many people couldnt this film lacked in every way possible regarding substance when i say substance i am referring to the plot acting and overall feelyes keanu reeves acting was on point yet everyone else in the movie seemed like straight to dvd actors trash especially the villain michael nyqvist such a corny performance if by my taste i was reviewing this movie i would rate it at a 4 thats a weak 4 but i am going to put myself in a neutral position since action movies arent my forte to conclude if you are in love with action films please see this movie you will love it but if youre more of a bourne trilogy kind of action film fan then dont story could have been understood by a toddler yet this is rated r what kind of adults just watch movies for explosions and gunfire let us relate to a character,reality
not bad for movie cheap night my wife and i went to on cheap tuesday was a good stress release for a bad week what worked reeves is a physical actor how he moves walks etc and plays the action sequences well jason statham would have been a better the revenge plot where mobsters kill johns and steals his car resonates with the viewer what did not work the action is too fast in a video game style there was a need for more humor which the movie mel gibsons payback implemented well if you are in the market for a revenge flick i recommend payback over is okay a vod movie six out of ten,reality

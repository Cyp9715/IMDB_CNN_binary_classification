wow  i had already read reviews of this movie and with the writer being one of my favourite directors luc besson i just had to go see this movie as soon as possiblei was not disappointed im not sure if this was intentional but there were no trailers before the movie so being thrown strait into the film unexpectedly with people whispering is this it then  only helping build up some initial tension and excitementthe film starts nicely but with overtones of spy thrillers like day of the jackal coming to mind neeson seems a bit pityful at the start but soon overturns that impression with a taste of his handywork after around ten minutes of the thrillerthen before you know it its over 93 minutes gone in a blur of fighting fear chasing and excitement at serious pace the artwork and direction is nicely done giving you the feeling of being the one attacking and the chair squirming feeling of being the poor gits who get annihilated in almost every way possibleit was one of those films that i wanted to applause after the film i actually clapped about three times but noone joined in too afraid of being the only two people clapping i supposeneeson was great and i cant wait to see the movie many more times i only gave it 9 out of 10 as it was too short  the film could have been easily stretched to 2 hours in my opinion with some more development and intimacy with the characters but i guess this may have not made it so exciting still well worth the money to see this in the big screen,reality
the most thrilling movie ive seen in a long time neeson is what we would fear if james bond went to hell and came back for revenge i doubt big budget quantum of solace will top this i loved jason bourne but where bourne is confused for half the movie neeson is looking down a barrel of a pistol 34 of the time in a three way spy battle i would put neeson edging out bourne who would be a step ahead of bondbetween the jawdropping action sequences was the subject matter of international trafficking which was pretty miserable to watch although killing is wrong death was never more satisfying to watch,reality
first thing to say is this is a great and fun movie from beginning to end if you like the bourne titles then you will love this movie the fighting style and the way things get done is similar to matt damons character and it doesnt get old and is interesting and great to watch throughout the whole filmthe movie has a similar plot to other action thrillers but even though you may know the outcome it is the journey that counts in this movie it is the way he does what he does the way that he fights and overcomes problems that draws you into the movie and makes this movie so great to watchliam neeson is such a great cast for the main character he delivers an outstanding performance i love to see an actor that can portray themself in anyway a good guy or a bad guy and in this film he fights for his daughter and he will not stop for anything you love to watch him seek revenge and feel for him the whole time maybe just because its liam neeson can you help yourself from loving this guy he is such a great actor and shows himself as a badass with charm great great  greatness i loved this movie so much and had great fun watching it if you love the bourne titles you must see this movie all i can say is its so much fun to watch it love it and go check it out,reality
just saw the movie in the sneak preview first of all this movie will get a lot of those people who will whine about everything that is not realistic really if you are one of those youll have a lot to whine about but if you can just enjoy a movie as its intended to be and you appreciate some action this movie is near perfect the main character is so pure and non complex finally an action movie that doesnt try to give some oddities to the characters to make them more interesting but just straightforward high speed action watching this movie was a great experience and i was surprised that i could enjoy an action movie this much my tip sit down enjoy the ride and dont moan about imperfections,reality
a no nonsense kick the crap out of everyone who gets in your way action movie liam neesons character is the angry love child of bournebond and all the other pretenders put together if i was asked to cast the movie i guess he wouldnt have been my first choice but having seen it i cant think of anyone else id rather have in the role the fight choreography is bone crunchingly good this is one kick ass flick and one i will definitely buy on dvd theres little doubt who the bad guys are and they get a very satisfactory smack in the mouth  when they arent being shot or electrocuted this was made by people who like the genre and know how to get an action movie from a to z i cant help but giggle at those reviews that mention plot and probability in this kind of movie what kind of movie did they think they were going to see,reality
i saw this movie tonight at the sneak preview and i was completely surprised and blown away i went to see this movie with no expectations in the beginning it seems that it was going to be an easy to watch movie but after a short time it turned into a highspeed action movie i found the story original and so did my friends at some times i found it hard to watch because of the drug abuse and violence to know that these practices still occur also gave me a horrible feeling i was completely away by this movie at some points it was very very quiet in the cinema because of the excitement you wonder what is going to happen next some moments in the story i found a bit not convincing but the rest of the movie makes up to that liam neeson in one of his best performances it had good action a good story some humor there are also some sensitive  sentimental scenes there are no plot twists it is just a story being told this is one of those movies which stay in your memory for a while and let you think about bad things that happen the movie that had that same effect on me was traffic 2000 personally i think this movie is underrated but maybe this is because it is new i would give it 810,reality
im still under the influence of this movie so my comment is likely to be superlative i went to this movie knowing that one of the writers and the director were both french and since ive seen some notsoimpressive movies almost fell asleep i was really skepticalbut this one proved to be a great action movie the best movie to compare with is hitman the idea is somewhat the same lots of action shots flying bullets etc  though the motive for the actions are not money but the level of realism the motivation of the character the cold blood which moves him on makes this flick a good option to choose when selecting a movieliam neeson does a great performance perfectly interpreting his role of a former spy as he says in one of his lines hes retired but not dead having an opportunity to show everyone what he knows to do bestthe movie covers a hot topic too kidnapping young women to force them to prostitute and all the business this involves you get to see the kind of people are supporting these arrangements and what it takes for the victims to be thereof course the movie has very small almost invisible drawbacks like some lines in a wrong language english instead of french and some rambo  stuff but the overall impression is simple a strong recommendation,reality
i freakin love liam neeson and this movie does him justice and more if you want an awesome and i mean awesome revenge story then this movie is for you the story is so gripping and its the type of movie that you cant stop thinking about after you watch it,reality
since the entire plot of this film is given away in the masterfully delivered trailer its not divulging anything to say that is a modernday revenge thriller this presents an interesting experiment actually considering that there arent really any surprises to be found in beyond those we were offered in the prerelease snippet are splendidly realized action sequences enough to carry this film the answer here is a resounding yes may be a simple film but its not simplistic and even though the first third of it is spent recapping what we knew going in the second and third acts here deliver enough thrills and action to make this film riveting even if we know exactly where its goingby setting the chase within the ultrasleazy world of human trafficking which we secretly hope is just a media creation but know deep inside that this reprehensible and inhumane phenomenon is a reality the film is propelled by a sense of urgency that isnt present in most revenge films liam neesons daughter isnt dead shes so his race against the ticking stopwatch tracking her probable fate provides enough tension to diffuse any disappointment in knowing exactly whats going to happen herethe selling point here is how deftly liam neeson hacks his way through a bevy of albanian baddies neeson is untested as an action star but watching him maneuver his way through the sea of detritus here were left hoping that hes got a franchise in himthe film may not have the intricacies of the expertly crafted bourne films although like every action film made since bourne appeared on the screen the fight scenes here owe an obviously rich debt to matt damons antics but the gritty and realistic path neeson carves to get to his stolen daughter is sufficient to deliver the promise implied by the fantastic traileryou dont have to be a parent to understand and sympathize with liams plight here and there is a morbid but exhilarating sense of release in seeing the evil empire pay for its transgressions sometimes morally complex ambiguous studies of mans desire for revenge are too preachy to be entertaining doesnt really care if you like liam neeson or wonder if hes doing the right thing by flagrantly taking the law into his own hands the film just wants you to strap yourself in and enjoy the tidings as he hands out beatdowns all over paristhis film doesnt want you to think like neesons character quickly realizes thinking is often not a luxury present in dire circumstances like these action is what counts and for those who miss the era of the lean mean 85minute skullcrack fest will reconjure the giddy thrills of watching dudikoff seagal and vandamme chomp through a slew of bmovie terrorists having an oscarcaliber actor delivering the judo chops only sweetens the potforget about oscars plot points or coherence this dudes daughter has been kidnapped and hes a former government agent trained to make bad guys lives a living hell do you want to see him find his daughter and take down the scum who took her of course you do even reading this review is overanalyzing it,reality
this silly but very violent bit of nonsense could be summed up neatly as daddy knows best and france is dangerous not much else to the storybasically a girl from a well off background gets trapped into the sex slavery market through kidnapping and drugs while visiting paristhe daddy is some sort of superman super spy who now works as a body guard he knows all about the world and was immediately worried when his daughter set off to spend some time in europe with a friend he knows how dangerous the world is and of course in the traditional daddy knows best theme it turns out that france is a dangerous country so then daddy turns into superman secret agent and kicks butt all over europeif you dont mind pointless violence like french bashing the obligatory arabic sounding bad guys or if you think that outrage over a daughters abduction justifies torture murder and other atrocities shoting some french cops wife than well perhaps this is your filmpersonally i vacillated between laughing at the stupidity of the premise thrilled at the display of martial arts and at the same time disgusted over the films violenceregarding the stupidity of the premise i should explain that there is a terrible irony in the depiction of europe as dangerous when the murder rate is 36 times higher in the us than in france in addition sexual slavery often involves importing 3rd world women into the us and into france for that matter not kidnapping well off us kids in france,reality
gone to see liam neeson ive just seen a great movie much action some american humour you americans dont take it too serious and thats just as pleasant taht way  a liam neeson at the top of his art and as a background a very hard subject that makes you think about it procuring i dont know how the critics are reacting in usa but in france they are vilifying this movie so whatever your american critics are saying just do as usual  dont listen to them  and enjoy this ninetyminutes show regarding liam neeson well i am a huge fan thus i cant be unbiased yet i found his interpretation very convincing he is still the same  one of the best actors ever along with hum ill stop there dont want to be controversial have a good sitting  by the way do excuse me for any mistake i couldve made as im french i imagine you couldve guessed it since we are the lucky ones who are the first to be able to see this film ,reality
i went with very few expectations despite being a fan of neeson and besson i came out pleasantly surprised the film is very much in the bourne trilogy mold  neesons character is a beenthereseenitall former cia agent who knows all the tricks and is also a dab hand at dispatching henchmen quickly and effectivelyanother reviewer while giving the movie 110 noted all the clichs in the movie that is true pretty much everyone is a composite of previous action movie stock characters the acting is pretty wooden at times and neesons american accent as usual doesnt overly impressi say above couldve been even better and sadly it does seem like this was an opportunity missed to make a movie that would challenge bourne sadly it falls short there the action is excellent neeson is a very believable tough guy though the audience i watched it with laughed towards the end when his character takes on almostsuperhuman powersthe film offers a very brief glimpse into the world of sex traffickers but you get the sense that neesons character doesnt care about any of these women except his daughter i think in the end that saves the movie  neeson doesnt try to save the world he only wants to save one person and will do pretty much anything to achieve thathighly recommended but dont expect any daring social commentary just sit back and enjoy while wondering why liam neeson has never tried his hand at any role of this sort before,reality
this movie had me excited from since i had read reviews on imdb about it and it did not disappoint this is a fast paced thriller that had me gripped till the end with great elements of action a bit of gore a lot of suspense and all in all a fun movie that was completely worth the 90 minutesliam neeson once again proves himself to be up there among the best with another brilliant performance and this one has really made me a big fan of his work especially after great performances recently in batman begins and voice roles in narnia and fallout 3 all through the movie he gives you the impression that he is not one to be messed with and makes the action sequences look absolutely fantastic the next bond although a bit old he would fit into the role brilliantly seeing as how easily he carried it through in all in all a great movie and one id recommend to anyone who loves a good action thriller nine out of ten,reality
yes its only an action movie yes the script has more holes than the victims of the main character yes neesons rampage in paris is very implausible yes its not oscar material no great actingstill its a very good movie i gave it a solid 8 i left the movie feel very satisfied its that kind of movie that is fun and thrilling and brainless at the same time doesnt get tiresome when its outrageous its funny when the action gets going you feel right in it allwhen you finish seeing the movie you do wonder why bond and bourne arent as macho or mean niams character bryanb letter too beats up baddies way better and he looks more scary and real somehow than those other pansy agents,reality
i absolutely love these kind of movies is awesome when it comes to how fast the story moves and leaves the viewer thinking what next the scenes are well shot the movie is absorbing and acting simply superb to the point and no nonsense liam neeson does justice to his role as a retired cia agent trying to get his daughter back by the time the movie finished i wanted more and thankfully we now have 2 coming just hoping its as good as the original oneit appears that story has been written keeping neeson in mind because he fits the role in a very natural way all in all great movie and if you are into action thrillers then this is the movie for you and if not then go and watch this maybe you will become a thriller buff,reality
just watched this film and have to say very good in the scheme of things the film is quite slow at the beginning as others have said however it quickly gathers pace the way the script introduces you to the characters is excellent and its only when you see liam neeson tackling a crazed fan that you think he is an excellent choice in the lead role in fact he carries it off very well i wasnt too sure on holly valance as the pop singer but as the number of scenes she is in are fairly minimal its ok action sequences are very well shot and you can tell luc besson had his hand in this to this end the overall film has an excellent pace which keeps you very well entertained it has the same sort of storyline as man on fire so if you liked that film then you will definitely like this i would say its probably slightly better with the direction and cinematography being just a bit classier overall i thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend you seeing this 78 out of 10,reality
i think this film is brilliant i love it it was interesting and enjoyable to watch from start to finish the second wasnt as good but this first one was a top film and the famous saying liam says in the film is so cool and makes the character seem coolerthis film is brilliantly planned and the main actor liam is great at playing the part of a retired agent who is also a loving father it is one of my best films usually with films like this i lose interest more or less half way through but this draws you in and makes you want to watch the film all the way through it never got boringthis film definitely deserves a 9 out of 10,reality
liam seesom stars as a a retired cia agent who travels across europe to find his kidnapped estranged daughter he has to rely on his skills and wit to rescue his daughter from the kidnappers who are trafficking young girls for prostitutionthis film gives the notion as to what highs and lows a father would go through in order to save the ones he love and it is intriguing to see all his methods and skills of survival he utilizes on his missiontrying to find somebody in a foreign city of millions makes you feel the suspense and eerie of being in a foreign country where you know almost no one and where you do not know your surroundings  everybody and everything is a stranger to you this just makes this rescue mission even more thrill in goverall a very entertaining and nonstop action film that is a mustseegrade a,reality
a great action packed thriller that will not disappoint you first the action leaves you at the edge of your seat and gives you that rush and it just never stop its a huge thrill ride that leaves you eager and makes your heartbeat a simple but good idea executed well by the director it does more then enough to keep you entertained it gets very intense and thrilling at times too partically one scene a movie with intense non stop action through out what more could you wanta definite must see again should be up with the best of them this year such as dark knight etcliam neeson did superbly in his role as an ex spy who is professionally trained to kill to go save his daughter kim maggie grace the length of the movie could be longer but its still a decent amount of time as the action never stops this movie by far takes the spot of this years quantom of solace overall if your looking for a really fast paced action packed thrill ride go see ,reality
as you all know i am very rarely wrongnote the sarcasm lol well this is one of those cases where i was extremely wrong when i saw the trailer for the movie i thought oh great another surprising and suspenseful thriller that will im sure be the ending we never saw coming after all ive seen way too many of those movies but after so many positive reviews of this movie i decided to go ahead and give it a fair shot i adore liam neeson but when i heard the role that he took as a deadly agent that you dont wanna mess with i was in question i tell you this movie took me by complete and total surprise this was a great movie the story is something that weve seen a million times before but what made this movie more special then the others are the fantastic performances and script that made this into an exciting and intense thrillerbryan mills is a retired cia operative from their elite special activities division he describes his former job as being a preventer but has recently retired in los angeles solely in order to be close to his 17yearold daughter kim who now lives with his exwife lenore and her new wealthy husband stuart mills discovers that kim wants to take a holiday trip to paris with her friend amanda despite his initial concerns about the trip mills allows her to go later discovering that their actual plan is to travel around europe following the band u2 arriving at the paris airport kim and amanda meet a frenchman named peter who offers to share a taxi with them to their apartment when they arrive amanda reveals to peter that she and kim are unsupervised because her family is in spain peter invites the two girls to a party kim is reluctant but amanda who is sexually attracted to peter hastily agrees in the house kim receives a phone call from her father which she answers in the bathroom from the bathroom window she sees men entering the main room and abducting amanda mills is able to gain critical information about the kidnappers in the final moments after kim is kidnapped by telling her to shout out everything about them that she notices briefly mills talks to one of the kidnappers warning him that unless kim is released he will pursue him and kill himseriously im so glad that i was wrong about this movie i couldnt tell you how many times i had my hands over my face or cheered or screamed during this movie it was so exciting liam neeson i couldnt believe how scary he was ive seen him in tough guy roles before but just the delivery of the line i will find you and kill you was delivered so perfectly just calm cold and confident i just loved how the bad guy said good luck yeah he wasnt as confident when liam popped up in to get his revenge another thing about this movie that i absolutely loved is that it wasnt one of those big twist endings that are so stupid and predictable this was just one of those in the wrong place at the wrong time situations i highly recommend if you get the chance to see it its exciting and a great movie liam is one dude you do not want to mess with810,reality
ive never written a review before but this movie angered me so much i felt its my civic duty to protestthe movie is so full of clichs and unrealistic its unbelievable it was made by adults apparently were supposed to derive some kind of psychological gratification from the freudian symbols of innocence fatherly love superhuman strength and righteousness it actually reminds me of the fantasies i had when i was 8heres the plot a rich spoiled american virgin girl goes to paris with a friend and gets abducted by albanians and sold into sex slavery luckily her daddy happens to be a excia agent and tracks them down effortlessly kills and tortures them in a bloodcurdling fashion and gets to his daughter just before she gets her throat slit by the evil yet also stupid looking so you can still feel good about yourself toadlike sheik on his way daddy makes a such a spectacle of killing and torturing people that it makes you wonder whether anyone would take so much trouble if no third party was watching he doesnt even spare people who are innocent and are unlucky enough to get in his way like the wife of a french agent involved in the mess whom neeson shoots in the arm because her husband refuses to give him information on stclaire meanwhile their kids have been tucked into bed 5 minutes ago yet they dont seem to wake up yep totallyall the circumstances are miraculously in neesons favor his daughter is talking to him on the phone when she gets abducted otherwise how would he know most victims of sex slavery are poor east european girls who dont have cellphones which would be too boring also shes standing in the bathroom from where she can see her friend being abducted first so daddy has enough time to instruct her how to hide and to shout out the details of their complexion while being dragged away at which she miraculously succeeds despite her panic and the struggle she puts upalso multiple men can apparently easily get into a hotel room and abduct two girls but neeson has to use spiderman skills to get inside well thank god the bas relief of the wall was adjusted to his height exactly otherwise the movie would have ended thereanother point that disturbed me very much is neeson indifference to the scores of other girls who have been drugged and raped by albanians apparently the principle of sex slavery doesnt concern him just the fact that it happens to his daughterin the end neeson returns with his daughter to america with only a broken arm after fighting hundreds of heavilyarmed men also he has no trouble leaving france after killing each and every one of them france must be a third world country everyone is happy and his exwife has to admit hes not such a loser after all every freudian fascination has been satisfied trice overthis movie does absolutely no justice to eastern europeans all albanians are shown as stupid scum and were supposed to gloat seeing them being electrocuted and above all the real victims of modern sex slavery i could write a lot more about this piece of garbage but i think ive made my point now thank you for your attention,reality
i just want to say is the best movie about dads love,reality
i hadnt heard much about this film but it was on tv one day and i decided to watch it i have now seen this film about 5 times and it is one of my favouritesit is full of nonstop action shooting fighting car chases you name it this film has it a 90 minute thrill ride so gripping leaving you speechless at how good the action on screen isliam neeson is brilliant he was born to play the role of bryan mills and he executed his role to perfection maggie grace as his daughter was also good the plot was fairly simple and a little bit predictable but the action was just amazing bryan mills went to extreme measures to get his daughter back you just knew he would do it no matter how long it took and no matter how many risks he had to take it was exhilarating i couldnt take my eyes off the screenit was a short lived film but i think that made it better it just hit the spot perfectly it was breathtaking i could watch this film any time and it would still be great i would highly recommend it to anyonewere also left with one of the greatest quotes from a film  bryan mills i dont know who you are i dont know what you want if you are looking for ransom i can tell you i dont have money but what i do have are a very particular set of skills skills i have acquired over a very long career skills that make me a nightmare for people like you if you let my daughter go now thatll be the end of it i will not look for you i will not pursue you but if you dont i will look for you i will find you and i will kill you to which the villain replies down the phone good luck  this is so memorable and really sets the film up for a thrilling rideoverall one of the best films i have ever seen 1010,reality
from beginning to end this film packs an amazing adrenaline rush  that much is certain perhaps it is the straightforward nearly nonstop liam neesonassteven seagal action that is buoying the movies reputation as it enters the rental phase of its life or the legitimately serious topic of child exploitation  the worldwide childyoung adult sex trade but despite these strengths the film also causes me to pause and consider its even more distressing qualities  plot holes and inconsistencies ethnic stereotypes and the exchanging of one inexcusable violence for anotherplot holes almost too numerous to mention take your pick why break into a 5th floor apartment in the middle of the day carrying two young girls out kicking and screaming when you can pick them up for a party later isolate them somewhere in the city and then kidnap them how does a man with an irishamerican brogue pass as a french police officer without speaking a word of french why does neeson say he was a traitor not a villain or whatever he says on the rooftop  was there any other explanation of this i can do willing suspension of disbelief really i know that its meant to be mindless entertainment but rambo does paris its too much to be a film of any serious importanceethnic stereotypes this was particularly bad  spoiled ignorant americans safe in their virginal land of california until they discover the dangers that lurk across the ocean in a foreign land the french cutting deals with crudely stereotyped albanians and muslims the paris always surrenders myth while the righteous americans have to step in and kick tail and on down the line worse still was the death of the traveling companion because she has sex with boys and the salvation of the daughter spared long enough to be saved because she was pure and thus more valuable  while this may be a dirty truth of the human slave trade it still sends an unmistakably puritanical message to audiencesviolence violence against women  especially sexual violence  is abhorrent that being said vigilantism torture and murder are no panacea for what ails human society if everyone pulled a liam neeson there would be anarchya 7 or 8 out of 10 means that you want people to take a film seriously this film while interesting in some respects adrenalinepumping and exciting throughout merits no more than a 5 or a 6 for those qualities it is meant to be eye candy and a good mindless summer rental it is not a serious film that will have a lasting impact upon cinemaperhaps the most disturbing thing to me as a member of the critically thinking  public is that lately we have been eating these sorts of movies up like its our job  and then assigning critical kudos where none are deserved whether its wanted or we are mistaking mindless action which has its place at times for oscarworthy material i hope that we come to our senses soon and learn to keep the two in their separate spheres of influencea good summer rental nothing more and please i beg you critically analyze the mixed messages of the film i think youll begin to see how many a moviegoer may have been at the box office,reality
to save you the time in either watching this film or reading my critique of it here is a brief summary this film is the worst film i have ever seen this film is atrocious this film is so unbelievably awful that all the writers directors producers and cast that worked on it should be sent to the hague and tried for crimes against humanityin the first chapter of this film three facts are established1 there exists a man hes pretty tough 2 he loves his daughter very much 3 aforementioned daughter is going to parisin order to establish these three facts which any competent writer or director could do in about ten minutes the film takes over half an hour quite possibly the most laborious half an hour in cinematic historyas soon as the daughter reaches paris she is of course kidnapped literally as soon so there is a sudden escalation in pace that doesnt leave the watcher thinking wow i didnt see that coming or wo what a skillful escalation in pace but simply oh jesus christ saviour of the world thank god that something finally happened this sudden plot twist of course makes the liberal mother and fat short stereotypically wealthy stepfather look villainous and the absurdlyparanoidtothedegreethatheshouldseekprofessionalhelp father who believes his daughter is safer in los angeles than paris becomes the allknowing heroand of course the cia can detect from a tiny and poorquality voice sample the hometown of any speaker so we learn that the daughter has been kidnapped by an albanian gang who intend to sell her into sex slavery this is of course the point where the film ceases to be just bad and becomes outright immoral people trafficking with the intent of prostitution is a real and tangible problem in europe and indeed all over the world if you want to see an actually worthy film that deals with the issue i suggest eastern promises dirty pretty things or spare parts making it the subject of a hollywood action film in which the american hero overcomes all the odds to rescue his daughter is insulting to those women who have actually been in this situation particularly appalling is the scant disregard that our hero shows for the wellbeing of any of the other women it left me questioning is it supposed to be ironic morally ambiguous no its just a film that chose a very sensitive and inappropriate subject for a formulaproduced action movieas the film continues we are given more and more ridiculous scenes that insult our intelligence one particularly stupid oversight comes when the hero walks into a brothel posing as a parisian police officer and the villains show absolutely no suspicion of his being impostor despite the fact that he talks exclusively in englishand the most ridiculously appalling scene comes at the very end the girl is safe as she returns from paris to los angeles finally back in america where everyones safe in spite of murdering and torturing so many people and shooting the wife of a leading parisian police officer our hero steps off the plane with absolutely no problems despite her best friends death and a terrible ordeal the girl is happy and shows no signs of trauma whatsoever and in spite of the thousands of women who suffer in sex slavery every day of their lives a plight which this film does absolutely nothing to enlighten the world on we are made to believe this is a happy endingthis film is an insult to my continent and my intelligence and a mockery of so many people who suffer in silencebut im european so of course im an evil peopletrafficker nall,reality
ok here goesyou need to get past some poor direlogue and cheesy momentsacting in the first half of this film as the moment the daughter is is the moment this film will start to knock your socks offliam neeson makes for a very good 70s style hero although the accent waivers cant believe he passed himself off as a french policeman speaking in english in a irishamerican accent when he goes undercover in a scene but thats the scripts fault not hisother actors range from competent to annoying daughter but nevertheless this film has fight scenes that are sharp realistic nasty and well editedkudos to the sound designer who makes every punch and neck crack painful best action movie for a long while,reality
remember that time period when hollywood used to release incredible actionthriller movies in an orderly pace neither do i what used to be a great trend to participate in back in the 90s terminator 2 speed faceoff the rock con air die hard with a vengeance jurassic park the mummy the matrix bad boys under siege true lies desperado clear and present danger the hunt for red october patriot games saving private ryan reservoir dogs pulp fiction suddenly became a distant memory as the 2000s served very few decent hollywood thrillers instead we have to head overseas to find them the 2000s consisted of many surprisesurprise excellent european actioneers with hot fuzz run lola run transporter kiss of the dragon unleashed and this superb flick what happens nowadays is that hollywood is scaling back its amount of action in order to make the extra money in the first paragraph 15 of the 19 movies i mentioned from the 90s were ratedr in other words they did not care about the pg13 rating now nearly every action movie must hit the pg13 barrier even the fourth die hard was edited to not reach ratedr which was a die hard staple to add to that movies from overseas like this one become edited in the states in order to hit the weaker and friendlier pg13 but dont let that stop you is one of the most vicious pg13 movies youll ever see and youll enjoy every minute of its inability to cut back on the gruesomeness it sounds barbaric i know but if you truly want to see what good action used to look like from the studios of tinseltown look no further than this excellent effort luc besson and his talented filming crew provide yet another gripping story to sink your teeth into this time its about a retired spy liam neeson who searches all of europe in order to find his kidnapped daughter maggie grace he is given a small time frame since his daughter is about to be sold into the deep disgusting and grueling underworld of sex trafficking the movie starts off with bryan the spy trying to adjust to a life without espionage and the rest is just a wild roller coaster ride containing plentiful action scenes and fight after fight written by besson and robert mark kamen provides a healthy dosage of fatherdaughter sentimentality as well as provide an insight into a dangerous illegal world not seen often in movies but its not just the delightful taste of gunfire fights and chases that maintains the entertainment in liam neeson does an excellent job portraying the retired spy while there are indeed great action stars very few of them are excellent actors as well liam neeson can proudly say he fits both billings as his version of a spy is just as cold and calculating as even daniel craigs james bond most amazing fact is that he is over 55 years of age while jason bourne remains the most lethal of all the movie character spies in the last decade bryan isnt too far behind while everyone else in the movie delivers decent performances its neeson that runs and carries the show with a mix of emotion determination and rage pierre morel directs this movie well by keeping the action within a decent view maintaining good pacing and also allowing for the actors to breathe out a scene when more emotion is involved the fights themselves are brutal and not held back in the least bit you will feel every blow you will chuckle at every clever maneuver and trick and sometimes even jump in surprise as to whats happening the movie is quite cold as sometimes youll forget that bryan is the good guy especially in moments where innocent people are within the crosshairs like jason bourne in the bourne supremacy its at times difficult to root for neeson when he involves people that wellarent really involved but that feeling is quickly vanquished when you see him waste the next sap that is part of the sex trafficking ring bottom line this movie proves multiple things neeson can be an action star at a relatively old age europe is suddenly a rising force in the actionthriller genre and also that you dont need fancy cgi or special effects to craft a good movie that will also lead to good money quietly emerged as the top action film of 2009 and becomes another great film with luc bessons stamp on it the fifth element unleashed transporter nikita leon the movie has the trills and the tension but also has the heart that is sorely missing in most mainstream action films you will cheer this movie on as it delivers with a great storyline great acting and just an overall satisfying cinematic package did i already mention that liam neeson is 57 years old,reality
its been a long time since i watched an action movie and was so involved riveted to the screen and rooted so much for the main character as when i saw last weekend the thriller 2008 written by luc besson and directed by pierre morel the film has not been released in the usa yet even though its been out for months in europe and asia i dont understand why because as the action movies go this is very entertaining and dynamic picturethe plot involves the kidnapping of an american girl maggie grace vacationing with a friend in paris by the gang of albanian human traffickers specializing in selling young women into forced prostitution her estranged father bryan liam neeson a retired cia agent the member of the elite special activities division black operations is on the phone with his daughter at the very moment of kidnapping and hes got just a few days to find out who is behind the crime and to try to get his daughter back before it is too late if youve seen the trailer for the movie the neesons close up and his short but convincing speech addressed to the invisible unknown man who is listening to his daughters cell phone would tell you everything you have to know i dont know who you are i dont know what you want if you are looking for ransom i can tell you i dont have money but what i do have are a very particular set of skills skills i have acquired over a very long career skills that make me a nightmare for people like you if you let my daughter go now thatll be the end of it i will not look for you i will not pursue you but if you dont i will look for you i will find you and i will kill you the film follows this statement closely and makes it a really fast running 93 minutes the plot is anything but new  back in 1985 arnold schwarzenegger as retired elite commando had only a few hours to find and rescue his daughter from an exiled dictator the first and by far the best season of hit tv series 24 had kiefer sutherland as la based ctu agent jack bauer chasing of all sorts of terrorists who his teenage daughter in its bets moments brings as much excitement and adrenalin as these classics another thought came to my mind while watching the movie if ever liam neeson was considered for the part of bond james bond if not 007 himself he could have easily been s bonds older brother less glamorous but as dangerous and deadlytouches on horrific but sadly existing and blooming business of international women trafficking the slave trade of our times do not expect the movie make some serious social comments or provide the deep insight into the dirtiest business possible neesons hero is not out to save thousands of lost forever young women he is trying to find and safe one girl only who just happened not to know how lucky she was to have a deadly killing machine for a dad i dont recall when was last time i felt as satisfied as when bryan let disgusting and despicable villains of different social standings have it with great vengeance and furious anger i saw perfectly clear all movies weaknesses and clichs while i was watching it but it never bored me it was nonstopping action and it had a hero whom i desperately wanted to succeed perfect or not  i liked a lot and would recommend it without hesitation,reality

the latest rescueslashrevenge film to hit our screens tries to walk the fine line between the two classic character archetypes  family man and ultimate badass when the estranged seventeen year old daughter of a former spy liam neeson is kidnapped while holidaying overseas her father must call upon his unique skill set in order to rescue her before she becomes lost to the easterneuropean slave tradeliam neeson kicking ass and the potential of maggie grace showing a little  had my full and undivided attentionas with the majority of films that limp onto the silver screen these days everything seems to be a remake of a remake or at the very least a rehash of a tired idea what separates a stockstandard retelling from something that will stay with you longer than a halfmasticated corn kernel stuck in your teeth will almost certainly come down to the execution take a wellworn concept freshen it up a little but ultimately pull it off with dedication and skill while is by no means perfect it is a prime example of a wellexecuted retelling lets face it the concept of a tough guys daughter getting kidnapped and having said tough guy track her down defeating a million bad guys in the process is hardly anything new its basically the plot of commando or a dozen similar films for that matter what does well is to play on this triedandtrue formula it adds depth to the usual onedimensional characters and mixes it up in a giant cocktail shaker with stylistic elements that made films like the bourne identity such crowdpleasersour first encounter with former spy bryan is less than exhilarating youd almost expect to see some incredible action set piece from his preretirement days something that adequately introduces our brooding badass action hero qualifications  negative what we get is the image of bryan asleep on the lounge at home a wellthumbed pamphlet for a karaoke machine on his lap hes after the perfect gift for his seventeen year old daughters birthday and from what we can establish hes terribly indecisive when it comes to purchasing a present its kind of amusing that after less than two minutes of screen time weve probably already experienced more character development and insight into our main character than we would experience in just about any other similar film amusing and sad on the surface bryan doesnt appear to be that different from you or i he seemingly has the same faults shortcomings and fears that we all do its not until his daughter is kidnapped that we see an entirely different side of bryan emergefollowing on from the initial character development the film moves quickly onto the search for kim bryans daughter with bryan as our guide we navigate the murky underworld of paris our former spy using every trick in his book to find clues of his daughters whereabouts without giving away too much of the story from this point our lead character pulls out all the stops the action set pieces are amazing and uncompromising in their realism and brutality and while there are occasional moments where the suspension of disbelief is crucial for the most part its very much on the money guns boom with a satisfying reverb bullets hit their mark with deadeye accuracy and bryan proves that nothing is sacred when it comes to getting his daughter back alivenow ill be honest and say that wasnt entirely perfect  i did have a few criticisms of the film my first and major beef was with our lead characters detective work when it came to trackingdown his daughter  somehow it all seemed far too path of least resistance the quickest way to get from point a to point b everything felt too easy even for a man who used to be a highlytrained intelligence operative rather than simply moving from one clue to the next knowing exactly where to go and how to play his cards i would have preferred to have had another fifteen or so minutes to pad out this side of the story  maybe even throwing in a few failed lines on inquiry just to make it a little more believable secondly there were a few holes in the logic like a particular scene where bryan pretends to be a french police officerintelligence operative using a completely stock standard american accent  who the hell would buy that apparently the bad guys did and last but not least i did pickup on a few editing issues take the scene where bryan collects a fiber of the bad guys clothing  absolutely pointless nothing ever came of this scene however that was minor compared to the most innocuous editing issue  key parts of the kidnap scene that seem to have gone missing what do i mean well i dont remember the daughter kim yelling out any information on her attackers as instructed by her father yet bryan seemed to have it all on tape when he passed it off to his cia buddy for analysisoverall was a pleasant surprise its often difficult to tell what to expect from these types of cofunded foreign films but this one was certainly worth the money while some of the initial detective work by neesons character seemed very effortless and simply the easiest way to get from point a to point b ie straight into the action the action scenes themselves certainly made up for any shortcomings no punches were pulled the world our characters inhabited was dark unforgiving and morally ambiguous and as a result the methods used to get his daughter back were as equally dark unforgiving and morally ambiguous forget about bond and bourne  these guys aint got anything on liam neesonedited excerpt from wwwyouseenthatcom,reality
this is really a quite nonsensical and completely implausible film and not to be recommended to anyone that seeks anything more substantial the first tenfifteen minutes are quite embarrassing for everyone involved then there is nonstop action and here is where all the six stars come from well executed action no less no need to write anything about the plot other than that the seventeenyear old daughter of a ustrained killing machine get kidnapped by the albanian mob he finds all the bad guys kills everyone and rescues his daughter again the ending was embarrassing the emotions displayed by the young woman been through kidnapping drug abuse the death of her best friend and most probably rape although never mentioned was something that felt like the passing of an old aunt so what about the dark side well nothing more than that you kind of enjoy the endless killing of all the worthless people involved in slavery and prostitution definitely a waste of time but still very entertaining,reality
seeing as most revenge movies take place after a tragedy has already place and the hero has trouble dealing with the aftermath deals with a protagonist who takes his revenge while fighting to prevent the tragedy from becoming irreversible i kinda felt it was a fresh take on the brooding and lonely hero on a suicide mission to get revenge as in he isnt really on a suicide mission as he has to make sure his daughter is safe and make sure she gets home the fact that it tries to be authentic with both real world problems and a more realistic approach to the action sequences makes it very rewarding to watch as you keep rooting for him to save her and take out as many bad guys as possible its very clear hes the good guy and the bad guys have no redeeming qualitiesall in all it works really well for what it is and feels very rewarding when watching it it does a lot of things right no matter how accurate things are portrayed as it conveys them as though they are a fantastic actionrevenge movie,reality
one of liam neesons best performances was the movie that helped me discover that liam neeson is one of my all time favourite actors it was brutal and gripping with great cast a 90 minute thrill ride for me intense and actionpacked if you didnt think that liam neeson could be an action star you were wrong after schindlers list neesons performance in is the most memorable of all his performances ive happy that theyre making a 3rd film the first 2 were great especially this one is one of those movies that you can watch over and over again and not get tired of the action i was surprised that was an 18 certificate in the uk when ive watched films like kickass 2 and prisoners which are rated 15 but have much more graphic violence inno complaints for a definite mustsee movie,reality

i saw this film a while back and loved it recently i was looking at the reviews here and was surprised at some of the negative comments that it has received after making note of the more common complaints i decided to watch it again to see if any of them were warranted i just finished watching it and ive come to the conclusion that most of the problems people had were completely unreasonablethe first complaint was that it was insensitive to the real life problem of sex trafficking because the main character didnt go out of his way to save every heroin addicted slave prostitute that he came acrosswell what was he supposed to do rent a bus and let them all jones out in the back as hes offing scumbags remember he has 96 hours to save his daughter minus the 20 hours it took to get to europethe second complaint was that it portrayed albanians in a negative light  well this movie wasnt about normal albanians it was about albanian sex traffickers so i guess the writers should be sorry they portrayed albanian sex traffickers in a negative light the other complaint was that it supposedly took too long to get to the action so i guess you dont like any kind of back story in your action movies you just want people randomly killing people without any explanation it took 30 minutes to establish his relationship with his daughter followed by 60 minutes of nonstop action take it easythe other complaint was that it was somehow offensive to europeans because it somehow suggested that america is safer than europeoh yes its a common belief here in the us that our country of unrestricted gun ownership is much safer than gunless europe come on people its just a hypothetical situation and the only reason it took place in europe is because we dont have as much human trafficking here at least not in this centurythere were several more complaints that can all be answered with the simple explanation of its just a fkeaking movie its a bunch of hypothetical situation strung together in an entertaining way its not trying to make a political statement or raise awareness about one thing or another its just an excuse to watch fictitious aholes get whats coming to them as they so rarely do in real lifei give it 9 stars to counteract the haters in reality 79 is very accurate i would say,reality
stripped of all complexity this major box office hit is nothing more than a great way to release some pent up frustration about some despicable things that continue to go on with impunity around the world for those who maintain that it is xenophobic and racist well it has to be set somewhere and the villains have to be somebody so pick one it really doesnt matter there is no argument that america is also filled with such evil and nastiness that it might have place in the good ol us of a these things matter little in these comicbook movies nothing seems plausible or realistic hence comicbook category but it is so much fun watching the really bad guys get a really good comeuppancethere is some very mediocre acting just about everyone except liam and the movie never lets up enough to make anyone think about what is happening and it shouldnt this is for the tired of it all people who are sick of the apathy and talk and just want some good old fashioned payback justicerevengekarma so forget deep sociological analysis or anything that makes any intellectual sense this is here to continue the thing that makes great fiction viva the fictional vigilante,reality
with these words excia agent bryan mills has exactly 96 hours to set out and look for his daughters kidnappers in paris before she is lost in the sexslave trade thats it no subplots no cheap thrills nothing even the films length shows the simplicity of that purpose 94 minutes butwilliam friedkin said it best when making the hunted todays action movies are too long winded and overblown sure there are long action movies that are still enjoyable all 4 die hards true lies speed faceoff and then there are some which are dumb fun but somewhat incoherent altogether the last two pirates of the caribbean movies xxx and most michael bay films show this not here its short fast and definitely excitinga realistic knucklebound noholdsbarred thriller has the ingredients that make a great action movie added with some zing to make it better that zing is liam neeson his character mills is a flawed person a lonely man with a dark past his wife left him for another seemingly better man because he could not leave his job his only daughter seems to be the only thing that shows his true human qualities but take that lifesaving angel of his and he will unleash a hellstorm upon those who took her no really its all about characterization neeson is transformed from concerned parent to angel of death within a flash he would shoot punch kick snap kill anyone within his rescue path and yet possess some humane qualities that make him believable its great because neeson shows us that he can be an action hero that everybody can cheer on and be afraid of at the same time i wonder what would neesons career would be now if he had that action hero path dont get me wrong neeson is still an exceptionally brilliant actor but here he shows he can kick ass hard and still be up and out thirsty for more mills give jason bourne the transporter and 007 a run for their moneynow the story by action great luc besson and partner robert mark kamen is simple but it is refreshingly written well and quite original its clear these guys did their research the first 20 minutes is slowpaced explaining in detail neesons characterization as well as building up the tension and expectations however by then the pace will skyrocket and you will find yourself immersed in this speeding bullet of an actionier also it is straightforward and simple but thats how i and presumably most action fans like our action movies nowadays no confusing plot twists no cheap thrills no third person lifesavers and although there are some flaws its mostly because theyre predictable and clichd but that only occurs very few times in the film its literally inyourface action the dialog is also well written especially some lines as exampled by the title comment said by neeson himself in a cold and brutal manner all i can say is the simple childgetskidnapped plot device is slightly reinvented and done with justice here ala the outforrevenge plot device used in man on fire another excellent action movieits clear that almost everyone involved in the technical aspects of the film is french and seeing that the film is mostly set in paris comes to no surprise the direction by pierre morel is very lively and kinetic increasing the pace as the film progresses until the climax he shows a knack for directing action sequences  and there are plenty in this movie brutal fights shootouts car chases and handtohand combat are put to well use here  in fact this may be the hardest pg13 action film ever made morel is a guy to look out for in the future the scenery is photographed by fellow cinematographer michel abramowicz who clearly knows his background as we see the lively and glamorous streets of paris disguising the gritty urban atmosphere of the underworld its really neat and fits the mood of the film well accompanying these is slick editing by frdric thoraval and really neat music by nathaniel mechaly whose score can compete with john powells score for the bourne trilogy  fast and kinetic during action scenes slow and reflective during dramatic scenes puts you in the mood closing off this expanded review the supporting actors dont have nothing much to say as neeson alone has your total attention however some credit goes to maggie grace as the daughter convincing us shes not exactly the typical damselindistressoverall is not just solid its super solid its excellent not only one of the best films of the year its also one of the best action movies ever made a joyously refreshing film to watch especially if youre an action fan make this a mustsee on your list its freaking brilliant and will linger in your mind for some timeentertainment value 1010overall 910,reality

alright i watched the movie about a few weeks ago and after seeing its ratings on imdb i was expecting a really good action movie with good acting a wholesome plot and obviously some amazing action an 80 rating on imdb means its equal to movies like the matrix or die hardadmittedly im quite a big action fan and i do understand the concept of it not being realistic thats what films are theyre stories name me one movie that is completely realistic with no fantasy elements included and ill give you a million buckshowever when i saw this movie i was bored embarrassed during some scenes at how atrocious it was and i found it to be completely overrated the action was slow the cinematography was laughable the acting from everyone except neeson was very subpar and i just felt disappointed this isnt the action movie that would start a second renaissance of course not thats not what i was expecting i didnt think itd be anything more than a tourdeforce action film that was pure entertainment and silliness wrapped into a satisfying bubble and honestly all i got was another secondrate action movie thats not even worth the time and effort to watch unless youre an extreme fan of the genre i mean during the scene where neeson runs to the boat to get his daughter the camera cuts so many times and theres about a million shots of his car in different angles that i completely forgot what was going on thats just an example of the many things i thought brought the movie downi really dont see how this film deserves the recognition it has received ive read the forums and people say well its an action flick youre not supposed to take it seriously to that i say why isnt meet the spartans in the imdb 250 well its a parody flick youre not supposed to take it seriously the same principal appliesim not trying to say the film isnt enjoyable because thats down to tastes im just saying firstly film technicalities ie the direction photography musical score were atrocious and anyone with a basic knowledge of film and its production will recognize thissecondly the acting of the support cast quite bad not troll 2 bad but still not something youd expect to see in a liam neeson movie more like something youd see in one of arnold schwarzeneggers movies from the 80sthirdly the directing was very amateurish i felt this constant need to find pierre morel and hit him every time the scenes went on too long hed be extremely bruised right nowi really wonder how the screenplay went for this movie too im guessing the writersartists got very proud of their ability to draw and started getting excited during the car scenes resulting in about 200 frames of a car from as many different angles as possible and the director just went hey why not its action righti havent mention the plausibility of this movie because anyone here could go to the lotr forums and start asking how some old dude with a beard has magical powers or why some big dude explodes when he loses his ring and wed all be stumped for argument other than to say the same lines ive seen being used herebut for gods sake this is a generic action movie not an oscardeserving masterpiece if someone can tell me how im wrong why this movie does deserve its rating and explain to me what i missed i will be very gratefulfor anyone who thinks im talking nonsense  check out httpukrottentomatoescommcriticcreamcrop and see how they rated this movie these people are professional critics,reality

quite a surprise to see such a good movie highly ignored the film is shot similar to the bourne movies but carves out its own niche great job by neeson who once again proves that he can basically do any role and is highly underrated the premise of the movie is simple and the action starts out with a bang i just wish the release date would be the same in the united states as abroad supporting cast is solidaction seens ae intense and much more realistic then what is normally shot i think this could have had a very good theatrical run but being released so early in other countries means it will just be pirated hopefully well get to see a sequel but i doubt it check it out you wont be sorry,reality
what can i say about follows excop liam neesson in his adventure in locating his daughter maggie grace who has as the name suggests been liam is sent across the sea to paris to locate her as she was kidnapped not days before she became a victim of female trafficking with liam already pd off enough as it is he fights his way through paris to find his missing girl and whilst the story seems like a pessimistic tale of a heartbroken father searching for his daughter it really isnt just that the action elements of the movie are truly compelling whilst i was tempted to go and grab for my tea on the floor below my sofa i simply could not every chance liam had at smashing heads into the wall or quite simply teaching them a lesson he did it with such might and fury not for the fainthearted so missing a second would be enough to miss it allso in conclusion the father did succeed in finding his daughter in the end and they did live on but as a consequence to killing all those people to get to his daughter all the relatives sent out to kill him in the sequel 2 but i think we can all agree that t2 can be a film we can just forget about with its quite simply sloppy story and confusing motive it was just a disaster on many levels,reality
this must be the time of the year for old men to open some big ol cans of whoopass first we had clint eastwood as the sour racist in gran torino and next we have liam neeson on a globetrotting mission to return his daughter now all we need is them to star in a crossover hes my gran torino anyoneis not so much a revenge thriller as it is kidnapping film with revenge simply tagging along for the ride and its quite a ride bryan mills neeson does everything he can to please his daughter kim losts maggie grace he has retired earlier then his colleagues from his job as a spy he moves to california to be nearer to her and his ex famke janssen in an attempt to reconnect and regain his lost years while kim adores her father his disciplined background keeps them at a distance so when the opportunity comes to allow kim to take a trip to paris with her friend bryan reluctantly takes the points and allows her to go but shortly after arrival kim and her friend are my unknown assailants and it is up to bryan to track down and rescue kim before she vanishes foreversucceeds because of three things firstly the characters and the actors playing them especially neeson are developed enough and do sufficient enough acting jobs to lend a lot of credibility to the unlikely scenario secondly the low key way the story unfolds somehow manages to mask the highly preposterous likelihood kim would ever be found and thirdly because of its thrilling and gritty action which never for a second fails to entertain after seeing this film i was bothered by why i enjoyed so much more then other revenge or kidnapping films like 2007s death sentence which i found to be both utterly ridiculous and morally repugnant while had its somewhat sadistic scenes it never felt morally bankrupt like other films of its ilk it finally clicked at random is driven by an objective an end goal for bryan to return his daughter similar films are driven only by revenge and chronicle the vigilante killings and promote jumbled messages like i stated in the opening of this review the killings are the means to an end and because of that it is far easier to enjoyi have no hesitation in calling the best action movie of the year and it is certainly a joy to see neeson back on screen and doing something different and entertaining it just lends to the long running trend that acting is usually the last thing to go wrong with a film and with somebody like neeson at the helm achieves a whole new level credibility and could mark the beginning of a new face in the world of actionread all my reviews at httpwwwsimonsaysmoviesblogspotcom,reality
liam neeson immortalized himself in his role as oscar schindler here challenged himself with an action movie the end effect is sparkling even when i was sitting during the film i knew something big and exciting was happening although it may not be a happy experience for kim this movie has every elements that an actionthriller movie should have and must have a lot of bullets car chasing hand fight drug a supermanlike protagonist and a beauty kidnapped although i found the onset of the whole story a bit strange the development of it appealed to me liam neeson was perfectly fit in his role highlight was the scene where he negotiated with marko i couldnt imagine who anyone else can do this acting as convincing as neesonsomewhere i have read a comment if you like jason bourne a dude with a gun killing round then you should like this one too,reality
sometimes you just wish that you had the power to press pause in a movie and just tell the punters lookthis is one of the worst movies of all timeits trash and im going to show you why should never have been made now for every reviewer that has liked let me assure you that you are wrong is it that every story has been told in cinema that we must deal with the same old same oldover and over again there was nothing original in this film luc besson has proved time and again that he cant write this is his citizen kane is every actionthriller clich thrown into one violent shambles neeson is a retired agent who is suffering guilt at a wrecked marriage and at being a bad dad yawn famke janssen is the exwife she now is married to a dull rich guy she rants that liam was never there for her or the daughter after spending five minutes with them you know why they are horrible liam cant compete for the love of his hideous daughter he buys her a karaoke machine cos she wants to be a singer we never get to hear maggie grace singbut then again we never got to see her act either new dad buys her a horse which she rides around her party liam takes lots of photos on his throwaway product placement camerato put in the photo album he keeps of daughters birthdays oh liam just dont get all deep and tender and touch the photononohe touches the photo then daughter wants to go to paris but really shes doing all of europe following u2 liam is concerned the worlds a bad placeand u2 are a bad band daughter jets to paris with airhead blonde girlfriend they meet an ugly guy with cross eyes the girls play music really loud and jump around and then the blonde is by albanian human traffickers who were contacted by crosseyed guythe daughter phones dad then shes there is a fantastic clichd funny scene as liam jets to paris he holds the tape to his earlistening to the kidnapper saying good luck he pushes stop rewind and listens againand again it is a sidesplitting moment within 5 minutes of you just wish someone would whack the daughter she is an acting vacuum and just really annoying aaannyway liam chases crosseyed guy who gets killed by a truck hes luckyhe got out of this horror story early liam does some researching hangs out in with an albanian translatorthen some hookers the translator tells liam that his daughter is at the construction site which liam finds immediately because there is only one construction site in paris he doesnt find his daughter in the site brothelbut does find her hideous denim bedazzled jacket he takes drugged girl jacket and a gun and does some killing and car chasing then he saves the girl in his hotel room with a drip full of stuff to get her over her jones methadone liam is if nothing else very prepared for every situation he starts doing lots of killing around this time lots there is one hilarious scene where he challenges his bent french cop pal who has just come home with a bread stick under his arm because thats what french men do hahahaha and liam shoots the guys wife then yells its just a flesh wound as a way of chilling the french dude out this whole movie is a flesh wound to the brain it is funny and it wants to be serious it is stereotypical racist sexist and violent beyond need every character is a parody liam the conflicted father the nasty bent french cop the cold exwife the innocent daughter the nasty tattooed albaniansall called marco hahahahaliam eventually finds the daughter she is being auctioned off maggie grace tries on some method acting as if she is drugged she fails maggie goes for half a million dollars this is insanely overpriced now some of you reviewers noted that this film is important for dealing with the topical horror of human trafficking ummcan we stop just there stop reading into this film stop trying to wring some deeper meaning from it it is not deep or thought provoking if you truly thought this was a deep profound storyline then you are an idiot say it with me idiot there better good okback to the plot liam gets the daughterthen gets knocked out then we find him tied up over some piping above his head how many times have you seen this scenario and right on cue the pipe snaps liam really snapsand he is off on some more killing he searches through some rooms to find his daughter he finds lots of other girls chained to bedsbut leaves them he finds blonde girl but shes dead he doesnt seem too worried about this tough is our liam liam then steals a car and goes on a long car chase alongside a river to get to a boat with his daughter on board the daughter is found on a boat in the arms of a fat greasy guy the head baddies are always fat and greasy who looks like jabba the hutt liam kills him he killseveryone really then he is calmly allowed through international customs to jet on home with his daughter no questions asked ohand there is still time to pop around to the singer to drop the daughter off for her big break how peachy how anyone could find this film interesting enjoyable or original is quite frankly probably retarded you should probably stop watching movies and at the very least stop writing reviews praising such a clunker,reality
wow judging from the reviews on this site you would think was this incredible nonstop thrill ride when at best its a disappointing rental every aspect is far fetched beyond beliefthe nasty exwife the rich step father that gives the step daughter anything who begs the lead for help after he realizes he was wrongthe naive daughter who is kidnapped 20 minutes after getting into the country then liam neeson springing into action and blowing up every and anythingevery step of the way this film never rises above cartoon status reading the comments on this site im frightened for the future of man then again mall cop was number one two weeks in a row so i was already afraid,reality
after seeing the high imdb rating of this film and reading some reviews last night i watched this film with a friend of mine in the local theater1 well i think this movie deserves a 3 or 4 tops i cannot understand why some people compare it with bourne or even james bond here goes my one star to balance the rating2 if you like a clichd film with a story as deep as a spoon of water with many plot holes this movie is right for you3 the reason why i gave this film one star instead of zero is that there are actually some good acting in the film also zero star is not an option on imdb yet4 in case you are attracted to the movie because of the name of luc besson as the writer i should warn you that he is not the same luc besson who wrote the masterpiece leon he is another person after he apparently did a whole brain transplant a while ago 5 some say actually i read it in one of the comments here that luc besson wanted to fool the american audience and get away with the money 6 whats up with that 17yearold girl acting and running around like preelementary children all the time 7 why are the girls kidnapped just 10 minutes after they arrive in france why does the father find all bad people only one minute after he decides to chase them you know this kind of exaggeration ruins the film for me 8 i expect that a spy even a retired one have some hightech devices not just a sony tape recorder and a walkie talkie 9 in the scene when father is on the phone with her abouttobekidnapped daughter why doesnt he ask her to lock the door and call the police yeah i know the french police probably doesnt care about the safety of an american girl in fact they are probably busy helping out the albanian gang that rule in paris 10 why isnt the girl even a little bit sad about her friend who was raped and died one friendly suggestion for those people who described the action scenes in this film as jaw dropping you may want to see a jaw doctor ok here ends my comment have a good day,reality
i dont know what movie the other commentors who gave this film a favorable rating were watching but it wasnt the one i saw the opening dialogue between neeson and the shop store owner made me want to puke the storyline that neesons exwife married a rich rich man is so old and worn out it wouldnt clean the puke that came out of my mouth watching this garbagenext neesons daughter gets a pony from her stepfather yeah its horse not a pony but all i could think of watching this dribble is that a 17 yearold is excited about getting a pony at 17 shes into boys and cars not ponies also the daughter wants to be a singer so what happens neesons buddies that night talk him into body guarding a rock singer and someone tries to kidnap the singer which neeson prevents how convenienteveryone is rich in this film except poor liam neesons wifes new husband his daughters girlfriend and her relatives if youre going to kidnap someone for sex slavery dont kidnap the rich kidnap the poor the rich have resources to hire people to come after youneesons a good actor but sometimes he fails to deliver lines with the proper emphasis it was a trailer not a building delivered totally flatfurther he shows up at the hideout impersonating a french detective and speaking in his americanized accent uh are we supposed to believe the bad guys actually thought he was french the most interesting character in the film was the translator and he was only on screen for a few minutesluc besson has always been a disappointment to me and once again he shows me why ok the actions scenes are pretty good but not worth the time watching this film if you like good cinema,reality
after finishing this film i was like when you kick a man in the groin i was making funny faces not that i wasnt during the film and felt really bad for myself and for liam neeson i was thinking where did he go wrong from oskar schindler to this crap usually when i see a good film im full of questions about the plot the characters and everything else well im full of questions right now but for all the wrong reasonsfirst of all why why is this film rated so highly where did humanity go wrong if you get to the point where you find this kind of garbage even watchableplease tell me what did i miss so i could go check myself out then whats with the terminatorsuperman hero character who can recognize a man by 3 seconds of voice sample from a few thousand miles away and can kill the whole mafia and then leave without a notice to celebrate with his rescued daughter whos best friend was raped and killed only a few hours ago and i can continue on and on but i wont do it cause it will only make me more angry if it wasnt for my girlfriend with whom i watched it i wouldve stopped this crap after 1520 minutes and watch something more watchablelike animal torture110 shame on you luc besson and all you liars who rate without thinking a little bit,reality
poor liam hes excia which we find out when all his excia friends show up at his house and start reminiscing about the old days in the cia how convenient that his excia buddies talk him into a bodyguard job where he heroically saves a noname singer from being knifed to death this allows him to not only prove his manhood and handtohand combat skills but also get the singers business card to give to his daughter slash aspiring pop princess not that she sings at all in the movie did i mention she just turned 17 and received of all things a pony from her rich stepdad at the extravagant birthday party he threw for her oh and she wants to go to paris with her best friend just the two of them and needs her dads signature on some immigration formliam is skeptical about sending his daughter to paris but her mom liams exwife wastes no time telling us about how she hated his cia job and cant believe liam would be hesitant to send his daughter to paris unescorted i mean whats the worst that could possibly happen to two teenage girls by themselves in paris how dare he be so paranoid after all they will be staying at her friends cousins house in paris and like most parents who send their underage daughters to paris without adult supervision she didnt call the cousins to ask about the arrangements and oh by the way instead of just staying in paris theyre going to be traveling all over europe to see u2 concerts with that kind of subplot i cant believe u2 didnt take this opportunity to include one of their songs in this moviefast forward after a 12hour flight and the girls arrive completely fresh in paris immediately a young man approaches them and wants to share a cab to save money how smart of the girls to accept his moneysaving offer next thing you know the girls get to the apartment and immediately tell the dude that theyre staying there alone didnt their parents tell them not to talk to strangers about this time i start apologizing to my husband about how incredibly stupid this movie is i even offered to see if we could get our money back my only hope was that the girl get kidnapped soon so that we could get to some more exciting parts of the movie thank goodness the kidnapping scene was minutes away and i admit that scene got my heart pumping if only the rest of the movie were that goodlest we leave any clichs unturned we now return to liam his dialog indicates hes flat broke but his daughters stepdad is rich and can send liam to paris on a private jet naturally mom and stepdad stay behind because thats what most parents would do when their daughter is kidnapped overseas into the female slave trade after his arrival in paris liam hooks up with an old cop friend dont you have any old cop friends in paris now what kind of french character should the cop be how about we name him jeanclaude and have him walk home carrying a baguette that way everyone will know hes french one thing about liams character he takes no prisoners he has no problem shooting a dude in the back of the head as he runs away pretty much everyone who gets in his way gets either a bullet or daim bramage from a blunt object given liams singleminded pursuit of his daughter even innocent people are at risk for example it should come as no surprise that liam would shoot a bad guys wife in the arm to get information from him my husband and i laughed heartily like we mightve done at that mall cop movie which i wish wed seen insteadmiraculously liam remains largely uninjured despite a good 100 people shooting at him even jason bourne shows some signs of wear from time to time but hes not rescuing his daughter from a polygamist sheik and therefore lacks liams bulletproof resolve and lest anyone worry that his daughter was robbed of her innocence we are told via an auctioneer that shes guaranteed pure whew ill spare you the heartwarming tale of the daughters rescue and homecoming too bad her pony didnt show up at the airport that wouldve been a perfect ending,reality
garbage clichd unrealistic predictable i just didnt buy it  just simplistic plodding and dull  looked like a made for tv movie to me and i like these types of movies as a rule i guess the guy next to me as we were walking out summed it up as he heard my buddy and i discussing the movie when he said maybe worst movie i have ever seenoh and when will movie makers get that the hand held camera thing does nothing for people except make them nauseous do they think that a shaky camera will make cause people to not notice that the movie sucks sorry  i noticed anyway save your money and go see something that wont insult your intelligence yecch,reality

and now producerwriter luc besson and director pierre morel present the comedy event of the year heres the pitch two spoiled obnoxious teenage girls from california go to france and get kidnapped by a group of albanians trafficking dumb tourists into sex slavery to the highest biddersand you guessed it one of those high bidders is a middle eastern sheik but oh yeah did i mention one of those girls fathers just happens to be a retired jack bauerstyle superspy whos about reign down a shtstorm on the streets of paris in order to rescue his idiot daughter and guess whatits liam neeson yes there is a bit of a novelty factor in watching the guy who played oskar schindler go against type and get crazy on these moronic dirtbags and gosh darn it liam does his best with the role i cant remember the last time a film was sold to the american public entirely on the sound of one mans voice reading dialog he alone makes the otherwise unbearable film watchable however lets be honest as much fun as it is to watch liam neeson outrun a speeding car or electrocute some guy or kill a dude with a broken bottle clint eastwoods gran torino was a far better and more refined example of grizzled old guy badassery and it was a hell of a lot funnier and fancy that had a moralwhat we have here in is tone deaf french filmmakers sticking their nose up at americans and spreading xenophobia abroad im pretty sure they thought there were making a slick black comedy that no american would see through had they manifested this with a harder edge or more overtly satirical tone they mightve been on to something instead we get a secondrate episode of 24 watered down by a pg13 rating that takes away any possibility of entertainment on even an exploitative levelbottom line dont be fooled by liam neesons voice he commanded our attention in the teaser trailers but this should be film not ,reality
theres only one force that took over the entire movie liam neeson hard for a person for his age to do such role but he did it perfectly i was at the edge of my seat throughout the movie the actions were so real kudos to the sound mixer everything was perfect and liam made it look so real i bet the audience was perplexed this was the 2nd action flick that i saw after in bruges and i have to admit that i liked this even better no offence to that movie well this movie also reminded me of one of my other favorite flick commando remember allmuscleman arniego watch this movie caution remember to take a seatbelt and tie it through the end of the movie coz itll take you on helluva adventure ride,reality
its really sad that such a good actor like liam neeson is in this mess for lack of a worse word this is a typical awfull movie that steven seagal has been doing for the last 1o years or so the movie also wasted a very interesting idea the plot of an exagent trying to rescue his daughter from white slaves traffickers is actually pretty good if they had put better screen writers this could have been a very crude strong and believable film  instead they want us to believe that 1 neeson is sort of a ramboterminator completely indestructible 2 the baddies are the worst shots ever seen in movie history  they miss even at point blank range 3 there are no police or law enforcer of any kind in paris since no one eve stops neeson of killing literally everyone that is in his path one of the worst action movies in many years dont waste your time and money with this trash,reality
this movie was not the work of experts but a group of random amateurs who saw too many steven seagal movies and wanted to cash in on prejudices held on some of these actors past successes the imdb score tricked me into thinking this was worth the time but let me give feedback appropriately by mentioning the best things first and then go on to the worst partsthe only good funny partwhen the protagonist contacts a previous cia contact that turns out to be a fraud he shoots the mans innocent wife in the arm in order to get information as my bro said she was depicted as a french housewife whose life held no value this was pure dark humor that got me laughing because this cutthroat abusive behavior is not the behavior you expect of someone supposedly excia but expect of a retired pimpthen the worst parts the disregard of all life forms that are not american it is as though this movie hopes to accomplish complete disregard for all human life forms outside the usa he kills so many people and ignores the suffering of so many girls that have the same age as his daughter that you end up hoping there will be some mention of these factors in the last minute of the movie nonetheless in the end all that matters is the safe return of the spoiled american brat nobody cared for the other girls used as prostitutes because they were not american a note to the writer this move plays out in france and this is not the matrix other life forms do existthe plot as there was none it was all predictable if you ever saw a steven seagal movie except most of those actually have some form of content the movie the innocence of m was a movie with a plot of a similar levelportrait of france this country known for its refined culture is portrayed as a poverty stricken third world country that happens to host the louvre and some museums this is confirmed by the protagonist never considering contacting authorities and instead decides to kill all criminals he meets himself the credibility excia yeah right for the sake of the usa i hope the cia has more intelligence like i said he was more like a retired pimp whos stash got busted and was out for revenge this movie does not attempt to have you believe 10 seconds of its story line its all fantasy of an overexcited steven seagal fan the acting after the first scene i hoped his daughter would just die because this spoiled brat cant act she sucked in lost and still does furthermore everything resembles a steven seagal movie the only good actors in this movie are possibly the french female addict he only helps because she is wearing his daughters jacket btw she gets discarded after the protagonist gets his information furthermore the protagonist was mediocre at acting he used the script as a bible and unfortunately his face only knows 3 expressions anger anxiety and satisfaction but 80 of the time he just portrayed an angry touristmy recommendation is if you have an iq above 45 this movie will not meet your expectations of a movie made by people with an iq above 20 all this movie tries to inspire is to randomly kill people while youre in a foreign country on vacation or looking for your spoiled slightly retarded daughter this piece of trash gives all americans a bad name and does not teach anybody anything save yourself the time money and breath it takes to deal with this product made by amateur american hollywood residents without a passport,reality
i read some of the reviews of this movie before i watched it and expected it to be good instead it was probably the worst movie i have ever seen not even liam neeson could rescue it from being complete rubbish it was riddled throughout with clichs and stereotypes along with nonstop fights shootings chases and virtually everyone being killed by neeson in his search for his kidnapped daughter it could have been a good story if some subtlety had been used in tracking down the villains but there was none and the ease with which he found them was laughable in addition the total lack of concern for any of the other girls was appalling the ending was especially pathetic suddenly the daughter after the nightmare experience she had gone through was back to being the allamerican happy teenager that she was at the start of the film totally unrealistic,reality
the spythriller film genre is a favorite of mine has been since i first saw connerys james bond in goldfinger as a young boy in my late teens i was introduced to jason bourne and my liking of the genre was decidedly solidifiedi like luc besson his leon is an alltime favorite of mine and the fifth element was a breath of fresh air that mixed elements scifi humor horror and suspense in a wonderfully wellbalanced and entertaining way not to mention that it had milla jovovich in itafter hearing almost nothing but heated enthusiasm for this movie i finally saw it last night honestly i wanted to fall in love with this film liam neeson is a splendid actor and ive liked nearly all of his efforts to date his character in this movie is an exspy whose dedication to his former career spelled a divorce for him and an estrangement from his now teenage daughter who he dearly loves of course the title of the film lets us know what the movie is about the movies plot elements are awfully tired as theyve been overused to agonizing redundancy in countless films but hey okay its supposed to be really good has liam neeson in it and after all its a spythriller right welli wont give any details away here suffice it to say that parts of this movie had me cheering and hyperadrenalized but conversely parts of it had me rolling my eyes as i sat through scenes that were laughably implausible unbelievably predictable and actingwise downright wooden there are no surprises in this movie while jason bourne was a badass spy that we expected to mess people up his character was complex and all three films in the bourne trilogy featured intelligent plot twists good acting and decent scripts the same cannot be said of this movie reveals some of the most pathetic acting annoying characters and mindless hollywood drivel ive seen in a long time butits entertaining to say the least actually if you can shut half of your brain down its quite good just dont expect anything you havent seen before the early scenes in which neeson seeks and gets delicious revenge are excellent yes but although he always destroys his enemies the freshness of his victories becomes absent before half the movie is over youll see why for the most part is a repetitive onedimensional and mindnumbingly unrealistic movie too bad with a little more ingenuity and allaround versatility it could have been great the bottom line is a movie that is both terribly good and yes terribly bad,reality
this movie sucks but how could one know 79 on imdbpr money spent on fake reviews rotten tomatoes 57 wtf the critics are bribed as well these days apparently see also rt rating of avatar but hey at least i learnt a lot while watching if you are one of the idiots rating 7 or above please note the sarcasm1 17 year old girls run around like toddlers 2 if you are about to be kidnapped do not lock the door do not call the police just hide under the bed and wait for it to happen if they cannot find you in the first instance please say something 3 if your daughter is kidnapped threaten to kill the kidnapper straight out of the negotiators handbook 4 it is not safe outside the us you cannot lock an apartment in paris especially one in a posh neighborhood codes at the entrance anyone luc besson must have spent some time in paris 5 women trafficker prefer rich tourists nobody notices their disappearances 6 if your stepfather is rich you can still save money by sharing a cab with a complete stranger overseas 7 be polite with a blond girl and she will want to go to bed with you 8 virgins are worth saving the others deserve to be raped and killed,reality
the exposition was jawdroppingly clunky critical moments were utterly unbelievable generally terribly written most disturbing is that the two main concepts that this movie delivered was a that torture is not only justified but yeah bring it on and b the secret services or intelligence agencies are noble just heroic and generally the good guys whereas history and the current global situation shows us clearly the opposite this is a cringingly obvious propaganda piece for the new world order and its torturing murdering servants really there is nothing more of interest in this trashy badlywritten clichd rubbish watch it only as a student of modern history interested in propaganda,reality
finds the daughter of excia agent liam neeson kidnapped in paris by albanians and held for sale into the white slave trade and details neesons efforts to save his daughter and her friendis a terrible movie liam neeson is a terrible fit for the aggrieved parent  former cia agent  action movie genre when people applauded i looked at don and said loud enough for people to hear you have to be kidding me some of those near us laughed nervously  after applauding mind youthe script was literally laughable at many points i can imagine the screenwriter sitting at home using some sort of ilifetype program  ihollywood script or some such  to assembly this dreck from stock story elements it is filled with clich after clich often delivered by neeson without a hint of urgency or passion his banter with his former cia colleagues and his exwife and daughter is conversely delivered with obviously false passion and good humor he reminded me of a superexcited infomercial audience member at pointsthere are many great hint sarcasm employed here bits of dialogue throughout the film i stifled my laughter at several points here however is the best exchangeneeson as bryan mills meets an old friend from french internal security when he announces his plans to retrieve his kidnapped daughter his french friend warns him not to tear down paris in his pursuiti will tear down the eiffel tower if i have to neeson replies again almost bloodlesslyliam neeson turned in an excellent performance in schindlers list as the morally confused yet ultimately upright oscar schindler i thought he was okay in the phantom menace and i blamed any failures on his part on the directing of george lucas who deserves the scorn of the entire world for that series of abortions plus his destruction of the indiana jones series in however neeson simply wasnt up to his usual standard i wonder if this was perhaps a paycheck movieall that being said i enjoyed myself because this entire movie was so ludicrous and laughable i later told a friend that it should be shown to film students as an example of how not to write a film further i learned some very valuable things1 jeeps cannot be hurt by any manmade weapon 2 nor can strung out incoherent prostitutes lying in the back seat 3 cia agents travel with their own medical drips needles etc to help bring addicts down so as to question them 4 albanians in france do not notice if when claiming to be a french agent you speak to them in slightlybritish accented english 5 you can leave france after committing multiple murders and other felonies with nary a whisperthere are other lessons contained therein of course but these are the ones that stood out in my mind,reality
its difficult to believe that any europeans were involved in the making of least of all someone reasonably smart like luc besson liam neesons character is clearly an overprotective dad but hes also someone whose cia past means that he knows how dangerous the world can be is he justified in his anxiety about letting his daughter travel to paris yes not damascus kinshasa or caracas  paris of course it is his daughter and her friend are barely out of the airport when theyre abducted by swarthy types clearly a daily occurrence at charles de gaulle and do these bad guys seek to ransom the clearly very wealthy young women mum famke jannsen and her new fella have got to be good for a few million no it makes better financial sense to get the prom queens addicted to heroine and sell them into the sex trade apparently eastern european women cost too much to transportclearly europe is also a place where venal corruption goes to the top plus its just a short walk from the middle east keep your daughters safe america fortunately foreign laws dont apply to us citizens so anyone even tangentially involved in the kidnapping is welcome to a bullet in the back problem solvedone of the most xenophobic films ive seen in a long time clearly intended to reinforce american distrust of europe and loathing of the east its moral compass is so absurdly rightwing it might persuade harry callahan to vote democrat,reality
this comment may contain copious spoilers unless you want to become a fat sheiks foot stool and sex slave in fact rule number 2 never ever step outside the house without your daddy unless he is liam neeson that is in which case you have no worries as hell kill everyone in his path to get you taking your singing lessons again also rule number 3 never talk to an albanian theyre all criminals and people traffickers who should be punished with a bit of the old electrolysis treatment i was half hoping right at the end just as liam was seeing his daughter safely into the car that she might get fatally run over by the airport baggage cart,reality
i watch it 3 times in the past few years and still enjoy itdont want to spoil anything so i will keep this simplei cant complaint on anything and that is something very good to say about a moviethe story is very original the main character is like james bond but at the same time the guy next door lets say a retired james bond but unlike james bond movies is more realistic is like all could happen in real life maybe a few exceptions but not a deal breakereven with a good story the action also by itself is enough to enjoy it that is why i can watch it many times and still enjoy it like i watch die hardyou should watch it if you like action movies like die hard my sister dont even like die hard and she like maybe because is even better than die hard more updated who knows but my point is that you might like even if you dont like die hard,reality
an absolutely brilliant film a really enjoyable film one of my favourites made me see oskar schindler in a different light for those that enjoyed this 2 is a good sequel but not as good as this one as many sequels arent neeson has also released other action films and more of him being a badaliam neeson is obviously the main star in this film and this has been the stepping stone for him to being cast in other action films his performance in batman begins in 2005 was good and i was disappointed that it didnt shoot off his actionfilm career but i am glad this has cant wait to see his film coming out in february nonstop nor see what humor role he has in anchorman 2 has anyone else seen that ricky gervais videocouldnt ask for a more actionpackedthrillridemorebada film one of the best out there,reality
a highly underrated film by critics where in the future when this film is a classic they will have to make up some excuse about why they didnt like it at the time this film may have been done before but just not in the way at all this film turned out to be if you havent seen this film and want to but dont want to know much about it then imagine a bondbourne film where the character has retired from his job and now a very protective father of his daughter and youve got the film is very intense and very fast paced and one of those rare films where it doesnt matter about the film length or how fast it gets into the actual story this movie is just brilliant because of how quick it does it grabs you at the first scene and its like you already know the main character brian mills its like hes part of you and you know exactly how he feels this is because of the excellent acting by liam neeson the film like i said is very fast paced there are about ten to fifteen minutes of you knowing the characters and the surroundings and then five minutes of an introduction to the quest brian mills heads on when his daughter is speaking to him on the phone and he hears her get kidnapped the rest of the film is so fast paced youd have to click the slow button to realise what is going on the movie is just brilliant in every way and like i said at the start highly underrated by critics and they will feel guilty of their reviews when this film turns into a classic which in my opinion already is the critics just havent realised it yet in fact i cant even say anything more about this film there are no words to describe it and its actually one of those rare films i give a 1010 but the only thing i can say is if you want to see this film then forget the bad reviews coming from mostly all critics and some public people just go see it yourself and i promise you if you liked the trailer then you will not be disappointed,reality
while watching i was reminded of several other lost child films and surprisingly the one which first came to mind was arnold schwarzeneggers commando specifically this movie is what that movie should have been like liam neeson outshines arnold with a witty and far more sympathetic and charismatic character portrayalthe films plot is simple but has enough twists and texture to make it into a fulfilling experience the film takes many turns and even goes on the verge of moral ambiguity but neesons charisma pulls the film through even its more preposterous segmentshowever its perhaps of the films overthetop nature why it will never reach the same classic and timeless status as flightplan or frantic the film stands out well for its relative grittiness but also suffers slightly from it the film is a pleasure to watch especially since it offers so many memorable moments and for once an appropriately uplifting closure,reality
this movie does one thing perfectly if provides pure thrill ride from 20 minutes into the movie until 1 minute before the end subject is hard to watch but important to be aware of it everything works60 minutes from the moment when they were abducted until the end were probably one of the fastest 60 minutes in my life and i really appreciated the feeling those minutes gave me  edge of my seat thrill ride i dont have anything to complain about this time frame maybe it could have been done with less rambo stuff for realism but nevertheless pure brilliancehowever i really disliked begging and the end too predictable clich after clich too mainstreambut all in all great stuff you dont want to miss this one,reality
in short is a typical modern fastpaced action film with lots of detailed violence and somewhat predictable story but its really well made and one of the best of its kindof course the whole concept and the fathers paranoia about europes unsafeness is stupid considering that europe in general is a safer place than the usa of course daddys sick paranoia proves right just about 5 minutes after her daughter lands at paris right and im not considering this a spoileractress maggie grace is supposed to look like a 17yearold im not buying it,reality
i knew nothing of this film i had seen b13 and almost all of luc bessons work and i think he is one of the best out there someone told me this film is written by besson and directed by b13 helmer pierre so i thought this would be just another mindless fun actioner  but good god was i wrong or what this is an amazing film and running at a pace of 93 minutes you wont even know when it started and finished and will leave you craving for some more the fight scenes are exhilarating the car chases are slick and the way in which neeson dishes out his own brand of justice is just plain super we had no romantic interconnections no boring humdrum or anything to loosen our grips on the tight narrativeeven then this aint your usual statham action film neeson is a great actor just check out the scene when he hears his daughter screaming while being kidnapped  and his lines after that just before the good luck i knew this film was gonna be kickass at that moment but i never expected so much our spy neeson doesnt trails he kills he knows how to get revenge and howa bloody brilliant action movie,reality
one of the best actionthriller movies in a fair while liam does a very good job as the lead and is very believable he does this genre very well and is able to show the right emotions when neededthere are some holes in the script but you should immerse yourself in the film and enjoy the ride the fact he was able to find the identity of a man by saying good luck is a little out there but he needs an entry point somewherethe film should scare female backpackers from going alone in all parts of the world which is good to see as way too may go missing never to be seen again its scary to think this stuff happens but it does and its good to see it documented,reality
one of my faves of the year why because it manages to perfect the difficult balance between plot performance and timing they are all at work here masterfully and in good measure i didnt expect much at first but i was happily surprised at neesons cool but deadly approach to his jobsome difficult subjects are broached in this film but they are handled very well the plot seems to burst into life at the right points characters are both believable and engaging emotionally one is held in a vice like grip throughout never really been a neeson fanboy but he nails it here i am going to watch it tonight again and yes its one of those that deserve a repeat visit cinema has a new hero watch out bourne,reality
this has got to be one of my favourite movies since the rock its tone is unapologetic and the action is hard hitting and extremely fast paced its been a long time since i saw bad guys being terminated so mercilessly and enjoyably liam neeson is one of those people whos an actor first and everything else second so this movie has emotion and a sense of purpose thats something most movies that rely on just action could never have because without a story to carry them they go flat when the action rests here there is a relentless drive to a definite end liams acting is such that you never forget that there is a driving purpose behind it alla note on the fighting since the bourne series theres been a to me welcome move towards using more realistic fighting systems in portraying a bit more realism i see that the keysi system liam learnt for batman begins didnt go to waste here its a great thing to see truly unconscionable bad guys being so brutally treated i guess thats the magic of the make believe world of movies you see things that you wish youd see but know will never ever happen in real lifethe only thing that would have made it a bit better for me was if it had a bit more blood in it from a fighting arts point of view i would also have liked some wider shots to better appreciate the technicalities of some of liams moves i was able to understand what he did almost all the time but to others the cuts may be a bit too choppy and distracting but really thats a small point that is just nitpicking,reality
and the character played by liam neeson keeps his word im reminded of another film on the subject of human slavery in our present era called lilja 4ever but has action and tight editing that goes beyondi recommend this film of breakneck action with tension to keep your heart pumping as you follow a mans singleminded purpose to rescue his child the action sequences are nasty and eminently effective in portraying the kind of skills neesons character needs to succeed and its believable too easily believable for our cynical modern worldto all those who worked on this film you did an amazing jobto all those children unrescued undocumented and abandoned by the world i pray you somehow find peace,reality
it being a miserable rainy monday morning i decided to take a half day off work and go to see not having heard anything about this movie i didnt really know what to expect what a letdown do not waste your time time to go see this rubbish luc blessons writing has reached a new low which i didnt think was possible after the transporter you would be forgiven if you forgot that the same writer gave us the wonderfully dark leon and equally sublime nikita now if illlegal sex trafficking isnt dark enough subject matter then it shouldnt of been approached in the blas way that it was i am very surprised with liam neeson for taking such a role how some eastern european terrorists could actually miss mr neeson yes all 6ft 4 while shooting machine guns defies beliefwith this said some of the fight sequences are well choreographed but be under no illusions bourne trilogy this aint the sequence of events is just implausible you cant but help laugh i think it will suit american audiences more than european with all its gunho lets beat the muslim terrorist rubbisha highly disappointing outing for what could of been a good twist on the action genre given the subject matter,reality
imdb is really good in telling a movie is crap most comments on various movies will prove that now we come to this movie for me its one of the best movies ive seen last year its got a good solid story good cast and lots of nicely captured action liam neeson is not your average action hero but he does a great job being onestory in short a girl goes to france and gets from her apartment while making a call with her dad who used to be a retired secret agent he doesnt waste any time and goes after her in francethe movie has no surprising plot turns and just goes on and on which in this case is a good thing some scenes may be found shocking cos of violence and drug useabuse personally i think a good balance has been found here and would like to rate it 810,reality
each time you see a lousy film you think nothing could possibly be worse until along comes something that blows the previous one out of the water for sheer awfulness this is true of up to pres it is the worst pile of junk ive had the misfortune to sit through in quite some time quite simply i am outraged that this should score so highly on imdb and that i should have been in by it liam neeeson goes through this looking like some badly made up corpse gaunt old features emphasized by an appalling hairdye job calculated to make him look younger and perversely emphasizing his age lousy script lousy acting the worst of which being the daughter who behaves like a demented 6 year old rather than a 17 year old asking to tour europe why would anyone allow an obviously backwardretarded girl to do this this film absolutely stinks  it is utter rubbish dozens of gangsters firing automatic weapons at one man and all missing the target etc the usual clichs in fact its so bad its like a parody only watch this if you are a particularly unsophisticatedimmature 15 year old boy because thats the only type of person who could possibly enjoy this garbage everyone has to pay their bills and liam neeson must have seen this as a way to pay his because my god he cant seriously have thought ive just got to play this role when the script landed on his mat trash that hits a new low for the braindead,reality
2008once the real plot kicks in and liam neeson goes ballistic in his very icy obsessed way the movie takes off too with good reason hes out to get his cute almost innocent teenage daughter out of truly horrific danger we feel for him and we dont mind a lot of collateral damage in his wake a lotbe prepared for lots of dead bodies including men all the deaths are men now that i think about it killed either gratuitously or with mindless vengeance neesons character excia man bryan mills has the particular skills that give bad guys nightmares and he is skilled in a way even matt damon would love just short of superhuman now theres a film neeson vs damon endless chases and almosthits totally breathlessi dont mean to make fun is terrific at its best the minute bryan mills lands in paris he is incredibly resourceful and tireless and the writing makes every encounter a match of wits and nerve and the editing makes every car chase truly dizzying we really root for this guy and cringe at the ugly really awful underworld he finds himself deep in and neeson is also terrific besides being believable as an angry father hes believable even as he pulls off the unbelievable feats of a super spy showing presence and that brooding charming depth he is known forthe core of the moviethe paris partis less than an hour in all and the other plot if you can call it that is pretty lame in fact the opening scenes almost seem thrown together either as an afterthought to give the movie some heart or as an edited down remnant because it clunks along and has a whole series of logical gaffes which arent worth listing dont let this stop you its as if when the girl and her friend arrive in the parisian flat director pierre morel suddenly shows up too morel in fact is a cinematographer at heart and that much is evident in the visual pizazz that keeps every scene popping this is his second feature and first in english and well probably see more of his work hopefully with a better writer in tow,reality

the plot is simple teenaged daughter of former spy is kidnapped while on a trip to france he goes and finds her not without killing maiming and generally beating the hell out of dozens of people in the processnow i could spend hours talking about the bad stuff in this movie all characters in this movie are onedimensional and predictable and it is no cinema master piece it is full of clichs and stereotypes some of which related to race or nationalities there are plenty of vengeful feelgood full of that evil sense of justice that evoke primal emotions basically every time the father beats up a bad guy to ensure he gets to his daughter so there a paragraph was enoughhaving said all that this is a great action movie the descent into paris underworld the easiness with which the hero of the movie moves into and out of it the notsooverthetop fight scenes and the overall sense of accomplishment in the end all make up for a terrific couple of hours,reality
ill be honest i didnt quite put this movie on my must watch list until i was invited for free to watch it with a friend and i have to admit im honestly into this movie first off its a movie that does not have a lot of special effects so really if you do catch it on dvd its not an entire loss also so dont worry if youre missing outthe story is really simple father is a former government agent who retired living away from his daughter and exwife daughter goes for a trip to paris and gets kidnapped away in a mishap that could have been very very easily avoided but i wont spoil it for you and reactivates himself to hunt down the people who did it and rescue his daughter in the processreal simple story so its up to liam neeson to keep your attention span active and in tune with things  and i have to admit he does a great job i recently played and completed fallout 3 a video game that he does voice acting in  as your characters father and really he has the magic to play the role of a father  assuring and for sure able to bail you out of situations even if it means risking his life you see that a lot in  from start to endaction wise i was told that luc besson is involved in this movie yet i dont honestly feel his magical presence in this one compared to his other movies but liam does a nice job of being quick to attack and get the upper hand before you could even say anything im convinced that he can go into the action genre from time to time  hes got that magic one personal comparison though  i did compare this movie to man on fire and it seems like between these 2 kidnap theme movies really takes a backseat to man on fire  but this doesnt mean its not worth a watch  its just my own 2 cents and my friend feels is a better movie between the 2otherwise just enjoy the movie,reality
on facebook there is an event coming up i believe in june which is called national man day which will be a day for all men everywhere to feel and act like men whatever that is if there are any screening rooms available for this kind of created event could be a good choice as a movie to screen its a preposterous action movie fantasy that has a good dosage of jason bourne and surprisingly and not offensively some conservative connotations in it yes conservative where else will we get a franceisevil tome that also includes a sexslave trade which apparently is based on real things going on in europe right now complete with deflowered girls the highest marker yes american girls go to france and you will be sold into the sex trade for albanians or whomever the immigrants are with the cando american government badass with one step removed from jack bauer and a penchant for torture when it suits bestsound not like your cup of manly killkickass tea then look away and read no more but if youre still with this well you know what youre in for sort of this is another vehicle by luc besson as writer and producer to use paris as a backdrop for a crazy plot designed to give whoever star it is usually jason statham a run for his money for the good of the entire audience as superviolent escapist fare the plot with liam neesons retired government agent who has a strength comparable to both jason bourne and batman having to go to france after his daughter is kidnapped along with a friend is of not much consequences as weve seen it in other molds and folds before sometimes in sleazy packages or straighttovideo deals one may wonder where chuck norris is when you need himbut the plot actually becomes a little more believable or at least acceptable because of or in support of the presence of liam neeson hes such an underrated presence today in movies popping up when a director has the right mind to use him yes he was even pretty good in phantom menace and in this case director morel and besson have here an action hero who shows weariness and real conflict on his face hes not the first person youd think to play brian but hes the right person for what he can bring to the part hes tough as nails but isnt chiseled or completely stonecold like daniel craig theres something else going on like hes thinking and makes us think with him as he crashes through glass and kicks and punches and shoots and strangles and bamboozles dozens of gangsters and baddies he helps make something of a wonderful contradiction believably unbelievable all the way through you know this guy can do these things because frankly he just canas my own mother god bless her said after seeing the movie it gives a good enema to the brain she meant that as a compliment i suppose,reality
im going to keep it short  some people find a lot of stupid details in this film and they nag about the loose morals of neesons character but so whatthe movie is really really exciting  it is one of the only films in a long time to give me a true sensation of excitement i felt like the little boy and the secret spy within me just woke up i just wanted to see more know more and experience more i think the only fault in the movie is that its only 93 minutes long i could have watched this all night longone thing about the action in this film  you can really feel the action a lot of movies have tons of action but they use it to the point of fatigue not this movie the violence feels real and the story will suck you inneeson is great  i love his charisma and voice the story is good and the action is nicely directed so forget too much criticism and just enjoy this thriller its definitely worth the money,reality
its a good action movie as long as you dont mind a storyline that demands complete suspension of disbelief goodness me how dangerous paris is  no young women can even get past the airport without becoming the instant target of kidnappers never mind that in reality girly would be in far more danger every time she goes downtown in the us her paranoid father is proved right within seconds of her arriving in yurp europenever mind that our hero is not above a little torture and shooting of innocent women innocent of all but marrying a baddie  dont worry love its only a flesh wound in order to make his pointnever mind that if your travelling companion had been raped and murdered and youd gone through a violent kidnap yourself the last thing youd probably feel like doing when you get home is meeting your pop idol for a jamming session no its just happy ever after and forget the friend,reality
so once again lliam neeson plays a tough guy role movie starts out hes a retired merc droppin a visit on his daughters birthday party he gets into a typical argument with his exwife she all what are you doing here you get her on the weekend and blah blah blah he doesnt hit her i dont know why but cmon is this how it is in real life dont broken up couples ever just act nice to each other so lliams daughter is a totally spoiled rich girl she gets a pony for her birthday right and then the following day she begs her daddy to fly her to europe and when he says hell think about it she cries and throws a ridiculous temper tantrum this little swear word just got a pony for her swear wording birthday so he struggles with the guilt of breaking his little ungrateful daughters heart and lets her take a trip to europe and then the best thing that could ever happen happens she gets kidnapped by a bunch of human traffickers cool so obviously lliam neeson beats up a million guys in some really cool fight sequences gets her back she overcomes her trauma and pursues her passion of becoming a famous pop singer by receiving vocal lessons from some super star bimbo yeah thats really the happy ending its the most shocking part this spoiled brat wasnt humbled but spoiled even more in the end suck,reality
this movie borders between the absurdly funny and tiresome while human trafficking is a very serious problem this movie uses the issue to propel people into unbelievable car chases see the movie ronin fight sequences that deliver a deadly blow in one karate chop and an action hero of the likes of liam neeson where he knocks out all of the bad guys in the room chuck norrisstyle seeing this movie in the theater you begin to get a taste of what is to come with previews of other movies before the feature starts each preview is more preposterous than the nextliam neeson plays an excia officer who is pulled back into service to retrieve his estranged seventeenyear old daughter who has been kidnapped while in europe following u2 on tour when he finally does retrieve her he pulls out an iv bag and hooks it up to her this scene prompted a grumpy old man behind me in the theater to say he just happened to have that in his back pocket nowhere do you find absurd behavior more prevalent than in soap operaswith all of the jumping kicking flying around and bullets where are the female actors have we not reached an age where women are also the action heroes in movies would it not have been interesting to see the mother an excia officer face down those bad guys she would have really let them have it so is this a movie about human trafficking or action adventure and why is it that all of the boys get to play with the cars and guns i think you will know the answers when you see this movie take note at the end of the movie of the short skinny bad guy dressed in a threepiece white designer suit sporting eyeliner because he is the real bada,reality
i was so pleasantly surprised to discover this movie i had little expectations but was blown awaythat scene where daddy is telling his frightened daughter you will be and how she must yell out anything identifying about the kidnappers was chillingthen what he told the kidnapper on the cellphone about having acquired certain skills over the years and how i will find you was incredibleusing a light saber is one thing but i never thought of liam as an action hero quite like this this movie was really good,reality
i pay 1299 a month so that i can go to the cinema and see as many films as i wish that said i wont waste my time and watch any rubbish so i usually use reviews and websites such as this one to evaluate whether a film is worth my valuable time a decent score for on imdb was countered by a one star review on empire stating that the film was a venomous little actioner that mistakes bile for adrenaline having now seen the film for myself i can only suggest the reviewer had arrived home after putting the family pet down only to discover his wife in bed with his brother best friend and a menagerie of farmyard animals or maybe the reviewer just doesnt dig action films i write that because if you like action films you are very likely to love this it has action scenes that rival almost feel borrowed from the bourne trilogy as bryan neeson pursues his daughter through the seedy criminal underworld in paris stopping at nothing to recover his daughter he leaves a lot of people on the floor in his efforts and it was slick quick and violent superb if you like the genre still good if you dont the film deals with some sensitive issues and will leave you thinking about them for a while after we do have a tendency to have our heads in the clouds and forget that truly horrible things are happening all over the world and people good and bad are being bought and sold difficult to believe on this evidence neeson is 56 what he most definitely is is a very talented and very versatile actor he moves from a caring father to a menacing deadly weapon in an extremely believable manner it is the best actionrevenge film i have seen in a long time sometimes you have to judge for yourself and not base your decisions on other peoples opinions i have empire to thank for that,reality
luc besson magnifique what can i say hein he wrote fifth element with bruce willis set in the far future and then he also did the messenger with mila jovovich set in the past looking at joan of arc this time luc handles human trafficking and removing certain stereotypes some may have of liam neeson of love actually and the first darkman filmneeson is bryan a former cia operative who so loved his daughter he went awol for her bday showed his devotion to her despite being punished with an antarctic assignmenthe chooses retirement in order to be near kim his daughter for her bday despite her mother resisting bryans attention this aloofness no doubt is to prove her devotion for the new rich husband in her golddigging life played to scintillation by exxmen famke jenssenwhen kim wished to go to paris bryans old warhorse alarms tingled and he ignored them at the pressure of his former spouse to show his daughter he was not uptight big mistake luckily bryan made sure kim carried a roaming mobile which was essential when she got abducted by albanian smugglers  all he had was the mp3 of their voices and he kept replaying to learn their voices and other cluesneesons calmness yet underscored with a leonine ferocity far blew away any previous notions of his playing a college professor type the technology used in the film to track down the abductors was amazing a perfect counterpoint to the interrogation methods used by bryan on marko the albanian ringleader in human traffickingtwo knitting needles jumper cables and house current  oh yes a gag too brrrr this is definitely a story to make you think twice about letting your kids go gallivanting off by themselves since much of this newold crime  also called white slavery has been happening for decades make sure teens do not blather all their travel details to complete strangers ok,reality
dont miss go and see this movie and youll understand how and why horrible things are present in our today world congratulations to luc besson and to the impressive actor liam neeson action is always there and this 93 minutes seems too short the scenario is well done even if you feel from the beginning that liam will save her daughter such kind of situation are hided to the people majority this movie is a excellent message and let you think afterward in deep all actors were excellent in and are also persuasive to show the real personality of the role meanwhile i was a little bit disappointed how easy liam escaped when he was catch before the end of the movie,reality
i decided to comment after seeing this get 80 here on imdb thats a sad commentary on something in society this movie can be summed up as geriatric jean claude ill also mention that if you want to produce unbelievable nonsense like this you should try to create characters the audience can actually care about to some degree the key point here though is that everything was as unlikely as possible the daughter just happens to be kidnapped by sex slave traders the father just happens to be some sort of black ops expert etc this really comes across as the fantasy or nightmare of a guy having a mid life crisis i suggest buying a red corvette instead but if you cant afford it i guess you can always rent if this is even a fair movie bronsons kinjite forbidden subjects should have cleaned up at the oscars i wont waste any more of my time on this,reality
the movie fulfills pretty much everything the genres should you get action and a thrill the plot and production are good yes there are some things where you start questioning the logic but its not too bad and for a movie this length i think totally acceptable to keep the plot goingi liked the skirmishfighting scenes every punch looks real and the sound department did a great job overall for everything in this movie same goes for cameraworth a watch ,reality
pierre morels is an action movie that ranks among the best of its generation despite the title sort of being predictable and giving the whole story away the movie focuses on a retired cia agent named bryan mills liam neeson who has an exwife named lenore famke janssen and a daughter named kim maggie grace in the opening scene of this movie we see mills go to his daughters birthday party and is there only for a short time all he really does is get there give his daughter a present but not without confrontation from his exwife and he says hello to her new husband casey jon gries then the next day we see bryan lenore and kim having lunch at a restaurant and kim asks him if she can go to paris france with her friend amanda katie cassidy at first he is reluctant but then after he is demanded to do it he gives in while still being reluctant to do it then we see kim get kidnapped and once bryan finds out about it he sets out to find who kidnapped her and send her back to her family and he will do anything to accomplish that which is what the tagline of the movie happens to give away but i wont spoil it beyond here in the movie liam neeson famke janssen and maggie grace gave such good performances in the movie but the only problem i had with it was that the movie could have had a better title in order to make it less of a predictable movie which made the film focus more on the plot elements than on the actual characters but it was suspenseful in some aspects this wasnt a great movie but it was good and entertaining but it also would have been better if it had hitchcockian like plot elements added to it but otherwise it worked as a short action movie,reality
the first half hour of this film is the set up its difficult which person is more detestable  neesons exwife for playing the part of the narcissistic condescending bword or the daughter for being the selfobsessed over the top annoying spoiled teenage brat you hope either or both get offed and quickly but it doesnt turn out that way because neeson cares about both of them including holding the candle for the ex for reasons that arent clearwhat follows is some action porn as the daughter gets and its time for neeson to spring to action with his special set of skills he does a very good job of playing the action hero with superior skills and also capable of making the bad guys miss every time including with their automatic weapons as poor as this film should be neeson somehow carries it the rest of the way which is about 50 minutes of sheer action and pretty fast paced fun some didnt like the political ploy of using the bad morals of the middle east to portray bear it or go to one of those countries and youll begin to accept the sad reality that things like this arent really that far fetched as crazy as that may seem and might be a little over the topoverall this gets all the stars for fun action the dialogue during the set up is laughable and painful but the last 50 minutes make it fun dont worry if you make dinner during the first thirty and then enjoy the best part this one is all neeson,reality
this movie filled my body with so much adrenaline i almost decided to sign up for a marathon after watching it i felt incredibly satisfied as i watched liam neeson tear up paris the plot is simple ex cia agent decides to take matter into own hands when his daughter is kidnapped by albanian traffickers by using his honed skills he does his utmost to track down the perpetrators and bring his daughter home this movie has the major action requirements covered lots of violence no mercy and adrenalineinfusing scenes liam neeson is a great actor and this movie adds to his repertoire 93 minutes is all it takes for your adrenaline meter to go from naught to max,reality
i saw this movie without much expectations without knowing who is neeson and all without reading any reviews  and voila it was very racy and made my dayit is an entirely different way of narrating a spys life although it isnt entirely original but it is fresh in screenplay which took off really fast within first 15 minutes or sothe biggest positive is liam neeson  he carries the movie on his shoulders although doing some unbelievable stunts one can engage in them as the movie shows the activities which actually happen in real world so it may not be entirely realisticcompletely new but it has an emotional impact on you for suremust watch great thriller movie i say one of the best but some loopholes couldve been avoidedi thoroughly enjoyed the movie,reality
liam neeson is currently enjoying an indian summer of stardom and its all thanks to this movie one he thought was going to go straight to dvdplot in a paragraph bryan mills liam neeson a retired cia agent goes on a rampage across europe and relies on his old skills to save his estranged daughter kate maggie grace who has been kidnapped while on a trip to paris of course its silly unrealistic and overly the top violent but i enjoyed a lot of it liam neeson is very good here somebody said to me why would someone like liam neeson wan to get himself involved in something as nasty and insane as that i disagree and is most of the reason the movie worksif it was a sly stallone or arnold schwarzenegger type of action hero cast as mills you would have expected the violent action scenes that followed the kidnapping with the hero coming out unscathed with neeson you never know what will happen and his certain set of skills speech would have appeared cheesy corny and predictable here its cold measured and utterly brilliant famka jenssen and holly valance are also here and both are ok,reality
i had been meaning to watch this movie for a while now so i was quite excited when i finally got to see itthe action in this film is excellent very fastpaced thrilling and frantic it genuinely made me excited there are some great shootouts melee fights and car chases however the plot was quite weak it was too fastpaced and had many farfetched elements if the film was longer the plot would probably have more room to stretch out thus increasing its quality however that may have a negative impact on the frequency of the action sequencesliam neesons performance was surprisingly good hes a very ruthless and determined man stopping at nothingoverall a pretty weak plot but outstanding action and a strong performance by neeson,reality
imagine having liam neeson as your sworn adversary imagine neeson being a seasoned bodyguard and well trained by the american government to track down people like you that dont want to be found imagine hes got nothing left to lose in his life but his daughter and that neeson doesnt care about anything but her now imagine you just kidnapped her good luck is a 2008 actioncrime drama directed by pierre morel that shows you exactly what happens to you when you kidnap brian mills read liam neesons seventeen yearold daughter played by maggie grace during her vacation abroad to paris with her nineteen yearold friend amanda played by katie cassidy this thrilling tale of a fathers complete and utter devotion to his daughter will captivate audiences as they witness his genius yet violent quest to rescue his daughter from human traffickersafter brian millis retires from his job as a cia agent doing bodyguard work he moves to california to be with his daughter kim who he barely saw when she was growing up now as a seventeen yearold kim and her mother lenore famke janssen convince millis to allow her out of the country for what he thinks is a multiple week stay in paris with kims friend amanda and amandas family from paris too late millis finds out that kims trip is actually a europewide tour of the band u2 shortly after arriving at the airport the two teens meet a friendly handsome man who finds out where they are staying and invites them to a party unfortunately for the girls there never is any party within fifteen minutes of getting to their cousins apartment who actually are away at the time a bunch of thugs break in and kidnap amanda and head for kim fortunately brian is on the phone with her at the time so he hears the whole thing and begins his trek to find his daughterliam neeson definitely plays his role well his character becomes this onetrack mind terminatorstyle character that stops at nothing to find his daughter the movie goes into great detail of explaining that she is the only aspect of life he cares for anymore so his focused and vengeant personality reflects this deep paternal care as he struggles to find his daughter deep in the heart of parisi really enjoyed this film it is definitely focused on an older crowd not only is violence a heavy emphasis the theme of a father caring this much about his daughter will definitely strike a chord in more parents than teens the premise of an excia using his skills to save his daughter is believable and is really cool too the action scenes are also very crisp each one shows neeson as a careful and calculated killer who is able to take down any man due to his cia training overall id rate a 910 while the scenery could have been better the plot and neesons character more than make up for this shortcoming,reality
the movie is about a father named brian whose daughter is kidnapped by a sex trafficking organization in europe it starts with brian shown as a single dad who has just recently quit his job as a cia agent to be closer to his daughter he goes to his daughters seventeenth birthday party at his exwifes husbands house the husband is extremely rich and gets her a horse overshadowing brians present of a karoke machine in his absence his daughter seems to have become very attached to material objects she plans to go on a tour of europe following around a rock band but lies to brian about it and says she is only going to france for vacation her father knows of the hazards of traveling internationally and is hesitant to let her go he initially says no and his daughter is by a sex trafficking organization the movie is about him tracking down the people who captured his daughter killing all of them and getting her back and it has and is one of my favorite movies that i have ever seen the action scenes with liam nesson are outstanding and the story is entertaining this movie kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time liam nesson seems to play the father role in many films and there is a reason he plays it extremely well he reminds me of my father slightly being a sinister and caring guy this helped me to have a deeper connection with the movie the action alone however is not the reason that is one of my favorite movies of all time the aspect of the movie that was especially evident was the devotion and dedication to his daughter that brian showed it proved to me that one man can really make a difference if he possess the skills and the work ethic to do so it also taught me the depth at which a man can love something brian truly showed that it is possible to love someone or something so much that they would go to the end of the world and back to save them brian went through some incredible hardships because he cared for his daughter and it is something that i envy and hope that my father would do the same for me it connects to a book i recently read half the sky and shows the difference between the importance of a daughter in america and the importance of girl children in third world countries the amount americans care about their own i think it was separates our country from the rest if i were to rate this movie out of 10 i would give it a 9,reality
gives a dark insight on the unfortunate reality that is human trafficking before watching i had a general idea that human trafficking was apparent in the world but not to this degree while watching this movie i became perplexed at the idea that any average person could potentially become abducted if they are not careful bryan is a father and excia agent his daughter kim is a rebellious teenager who wants to be a singer when she grows up when kim asks her father if she can go to paris to go museum hopping with her best friend amanda and her cousin bryan is extremely reluctant to let her go bryan understands the dangers of the world from his work experience however he eventually caves in and lets her go while they are at the airport bryan discovers that kim is actually going to paris to follow u2s european tour and he is even more alarmed upon kim and amandas arrival in paris they meet a handsome boy who offers to split the cost of a taxi with them because it is so expensive little do the girls know that this man would come back to abduct them in a short while after they settle in their apartment this was extremely interesting because everyone has an idea of human trafficking but no one really knows how it happens or how easy it is to be abducted while there are definitely people who are going to say oh i would never fall for that in the heat of the moment turning down a normal person who is seemingly trying to be friendly would be extremely difficultis a great movie for anyone looking for action interesting plot or if you just love to see liam neeson be awesome this movie really opened my eyes to the reality of human trafficking and how crazy the people are to be doing this to people drugs brainwashing and flat out hopelessness fuel the fire for the human traffickers in this movie and it leads to some extremely unfortunate situations after watching i can honestly say that i am genuinely more aware of the world because human trafficking is a very real thing girls are every hour of every day and it does a perfect job of portraying the heart wrenching emotions involved at every level of human trafficking and is definitely worth the watch,reality

liam neeson is one who i thought would never carry off such a good role in the genrei agree with most of the comments that it started of slow but it quickly lead to an interesting movienever too graphic in the violence but the movie continued along a pace that was enjoyable to watch the characters all of them were without a doubt interesting showing a seedier side to the moviei wont discuss the plot but read the synopsis  that gives an idea of what youre in forhighly recommended,reality
a retired cia agent travels across europe and relies on his old skills to save his estranged daughter who was kidnapped on a trip to paris to be sold into prostitutionits fun for about 15 minutes seeing neeson do james bond as daddy dangerous but the surprise wears off quicklythe action is engaging but rarely exciting the drama heftier but still far from convincingdont be in by these are critics aka the people who take movies too seriously was great in terms of action and storytelling with some interesting underlying themes and i greatly enjoyed it i almost couldnt wait to see how people enjoyed it and i got what i wanted until i saw how the critics reacted this is a movie unrealistic violence and un satisfaction doesnt make it a bad movie the movie sure had some plot holes but just a couple doesnt make the film bad critics rave films such as evil dead and some other films i didnt enjoy that much purely because they thought they were great in terms of artistic and cleverness well sorry some movies can be pardoned purely for what theyre made for pure entertainment sorry if im getting preachy and this is the only review i do bashing critics but sometimes they need to learn not everything is what they want on the other hand is highly recommendable its fastpaced and actionpacked never leaving the word boring in your mind throughout 910,reality
if you want to sit back and watch some real justice in a film is a truly refreshing and rewarding experience to view its back to the basics a ruthless believable to an extent at least hero kicking bad guy ass no gadgets no one liners just doing what needs to be done in fine style seeing a man fight to get his daughter back is so much more rewarding than watching someone try to save the world or something to that effect because a its believable and b because we can relate to it perhaps not directly but certainly to a larger extent than the world being in dangerliam neeson is in outstanding form carrying the movie from start to finish his slick tone mixed with well performed stunts result in the creation of a simply magnificent character i have no doubt daniel craig will be watching this performance a few times through before beginning work on the next bond flickthe movie is of course not without flaws it would of been nice to see one of the villains challenge neesons character fractionally more rather than just standing there like a lifeless dummy while neeson did as he pleased with them also the escape when he gets caught seemed far too straight forward and basic to be in the least bit satisfying there must have been a more stylish way to handle the escape than simply having him pull the pipe from the ceilingnevertheless certainly has a lot more things going for it than against it and this is why it is proving to be such a popular film im disappointed it took me this long to see it and ill say if you havent caught it yet and are perhaps on the fence as to whether to watch it have no second thoughts about seeing it you wont be let down and let us just hope no sequel is ever made this is without doubt a film that will be best left as is with nothing added to it,reality
we went up to the theatre at her behest i asked what she had thought about seeing was the first movie she mentioned i quickly kissed her after saying great minds think alike i had been intrigued by the films trailer i like good action movies and think liam neeson is a very competent actor liam neeson plays a retired preventor who has moved to los angeles to spend more time with his daughter his ultimate goal is to see if she will live with him while going to school he spent much of her childhood away from home doing things he cant discuss in polite company neesons character never goes into detail about exactly what he has done the only glimpse we get into his former life at the onset are bits and pieces of war stories some former colleagues share around a game of cards and at the dinner table the film starts slowly we are shown that bryan mills is a meticulous detailed man he lives modestly and quietly but then all deadly good guys do in the movies when offered the opportunity to earn a little extra income on a one night security job we see that mills neeson is a quickthinking and fast moving adversary who is very good at what he does or used to do his moonlighting provides him with an opportunity to provide a very unique gift to his daughter kim maggie grace whom he would do anything for before he has the chance to surprise her she surprises him by asking permission to travel outside of the us with a friend and go to paris bryan is very reluctant to let a 17 year old girl travel with her friend to paris unchaperoned he knows how dangerous the world can be from first hand experience after much consideration and belittling of his exwife famke janssen he agrees to let his daughter go with conditions as soon as the girls arrive in paris they are targeted by an overly friendly stranger for abduction during one of the films most harrowing moments bryan listens on the phone as his only daughter is kidnapped by strangers over 6000 miles away hey you told us half the movie  no i only told you about the first 20 minutes after that you and mills are offand running  after during her abduction bryan mills turns into an older jack bauer for those who understand this reference i can all but guarantee you are going to like this movie i liked this movie a lot not too deep but its an action movie that does not disappointwhat i liked  fastpaced believable action as i said he turns into jack bauer singleminded decisiveand deadly if you want to see the bad guys get better than they give youll be smiling and laughing while on the edge of your seat for most of the movie great acting by all involved every character is played well you dont go too deep into anyone even mills or his daughter but you are totally into the story credible mills is not superman he relies on friends his wits his experience and his training he overcomes setbacksall while a short clock is ticking almost none of it reminded me that i was watching a movie what i didnt like  its pg13 and i am going to guess it had to undergo some cuts to keep it from being rated r foul language violence although nothing graphic and its subject matter makes this one not for kids anywhere near 13 this is a movie about the real and disgusting world of human trafficking there is no nudity but there are several girls who appear to be teenagers in little more than lingerie fast cuts as i have stated before they keep making action movies like music videos there are a lot of jump cuts and shaky cameras especially during car chases that jolt you a little more than needed thumbs up my wife enjoyed it and so did i i mentioned that i saw it to a few people i worked with who as it turns out had also seen it and gave it high praise,reality
in the long line of espionagerougeagents genre you have varying qualities arguably one of the greatest may be the bourne trilogies which are in themselves films of very good caliber then you have the opposite end of the spectrum such as the clich crapfest that was salt manages to stand quite nicely amongst these films above all else due to the presence of liam neeson he plays a role we are familiar with but neeson never lets his audience down his acting keeps the emotional aspect of the film intact and fine i suppose famke janssen as well i also highly enjoyed oliver rabourdin in the film the movies obvious focus is action and it does this superbly there are many well choreographed fight scenes and believe it or not they stay well within the walls of realism for the most part the plot has a nice pace to it and the uglier side of reality is seen throughout the film as it displays the gruesome nightmare of the sex slave industryi recommend the extended version for more asskicking and definitely catch this one,reality
all ive got to say isliam neeson has still got itwith fast paced action sequences and a genius storyline does not fault on any aspects even more what makes this film so heartwrenching is its absolute plausibility that will make you think twice about sending your kids anywhere even out the front door liam neeson gives one of his best performances playing the role of bryan mills a retired cia agent on a stopatnothing rampage to find his kidnapped daughter kim maggie grace who is being sold into prostitution beautifully showcases the fatherdaughter relationship between neeson and graces characters and you cant help but lovingly sigh at the way bryon mills growls i dont know where you arebut if you dont let my daughter go i will find you i will kill you isnt that just beautifulthis film will have you past the edgeofyourseat stage and onto the floor until the very end,reality
much of what occurs in liam neeson thriller is incredibly implausible but with suspension of disbelief turned up to eleven the film proves to be an extremely satisfying viewing experiencea brutal action flick that effectively exploits that most basic of human emotions the desire to see the wicked punishedneeson stars as exspecial forces operative bryan mills who kicks seven shades of the proverbial out of the albanian human traffickers who are stupid enough to kidnap his teenage daughter kim maggie gracealthough the films star is well into his fifties neeson shows no sign of taking it easy in his old age kicking punching and blasting his way around paris with the energy and power of man 20 years his junior director pierre morel conducts all of this mayhem with style and doesnt skimp on the nastier stuff having mills mercilessly torture his victims for information kill without a moments hesitation and generally act like a total badassenough of a badass to make it easy to forgive the films sillier aspects75 out of 10 rounded up to 8 for imdb,reality
now let me be very clear about thisi am a superfreak fan of action thrillers n this movie sit right at the top of the lotit is action packed to the core n has a pretty good script as well which gives a humane n heartrendering account of the very burgeoning problem of human trafficking liam neeson  i must say has done a real fine jobhe has played the character with many shades in the most perfect manner which probably none of the the actors would fit into in such a sublime mannerhe is a caring fatherhas been a good servant for his countryn is the excia operative who is still pretty good at what he used to dohis composure to think with a clear head in even in darkest situations is what sets him apart n not to forget his superhuman effort in the process of freeing his daughter from the hands of a very highly connected human trafficking gangthe action sequences of the movie are pretty awesome n not over the top but believable to a greater extentthe city has been used as a good backdrop to the fast paced storyit is a very true to its genre of action thriller n will surely grant u what u want from a film of this genreand to round it off i am sure the movie can boast of the famous line let me entertain you,reality
ive seen a few films like this but none of them compares to this in anyway this is the best of its kindbryan mills liam neeson is a retired agent of the us government his daughter is kidnapped in france by smugglers and now all he wants is to get her back at any costthe story is simple the script is nice but its not the script that makes this movie good its the actors mainly liam neeson he plays this roll with the utmost ferocity and a willpower that will never give up the action is fast and furious flowing thru the backgrounds of the french enviorments this is one of those movie that i would recommend to anyone good acting good action good directing raw emotion from liam neeson 910,reality
according to movies paris is not safe anymore on the first day you get there first kidnappers took harrison fords wife in frantic now they took liam neesons daughter and her friend in the action thriller film where both girls will be sold as prostitutes by albanians slave traders but instead of a vulnerable doctor like the one presented in polanskis film our hero is a former cia agent with skillful tactics that goes to rescue his daughter from the evil among the favorable points of this film besides a great performance by neeson is the way this father manages to save his daughter and the techniques he uses to track her last steps after being kidnapped small things that makes a total difference like hearing the traders conversations on the phone or even asking his daughter before she was to mention a few characteristics of these people but this moment fails a little if one considers the impossibility of someone doing so since she was very distressed and how come these guys show up without wearing masks which would make impossible their recognition of course some of these things are pure exaggeration but as long as the film played with some tension nice action sequences and a solid drama involving human trafficking and all the desperation of the main character we are thrilled with a above the average flicka few things could be worked better or played more fairly and that is 1 the editing because we need to know who is beating who the fights are great neeson is very believable in doing all this and writers luc besson and robert mark kamen provided to the main character lots of combat with nagasu do a interesting and mixed martial art style but the director editor and the camera went all nuts and they wouldnt allow us to see precisely what was going on in key moments 2 the coldblooded character played by neeson and his coldness didnt work at some moments most notably where he shoots at a woman trying to discover where one of the traders were this was something surprisingly strange to see it didnt work so good and this kind of implacability works better in a bond film or a schwarzenegger type of film and resembles commando a little bit it is comprehensible in the context used for this film heres a desperate father trying to save his daughter in a short period of time he did way worst to the guys who took her but for some reason this was too strange and this woman wasnt even involved in the whole situation although her husband wasit might be an overdone and clichd picture but it has a lot of good things to show its well made well acted with a nice supporting cast with names like maggie grace famke janssen leland orser jon gries and xander berkeley and the action is great 910,reality
yes weve seen the paris scenery many times before with the likes of the french connection ronin and more recently the bourne identityfortunately we were saved the whole drivingthewrongway clich they often throw in there quite uselessly as the french and americans both drive on the wrong side of the road anywayyes i freely admit that takes a huge hunk of the slams and bangs from the aforementioned bourne identityand yes is iterative rather than innovative  liam neeson paying the bills rather than aching for any accoladesbut still i find to be an irresistible smashandgrapple feelgood movie up there with the surprisingly good walking tall  you really are rooting for bryan living every kick crack snap shot punch and grimacing withering body blowi have to wonder if kim played by maggie grace could have been any more irritating and any less convincing as a teenager probably notwhy did bryan neeson take the hair sample from the broken mirror ive seen this film three times now and i dont recall him making use of the sampleneeson does a connery and fails to hide his thick accent but scores points for at least tryingand the less said about the photo enhancement the better you cant catch a reflection of yourself straight on when youre taking a photograph of someone else at an angleall that aside i really like and so does my dad he being the litmus test for any movie because if my dad gets it the whole thing must be brimming over with win,reality
this is the first time i am writing a comment on imdb and thats because this movie has compelled me to do so this movie shows how a thriller should b paced but more than anything i loved the way liam neeson has portrayed the role of a protective father being a father myself i could feel the pain in his eyes he completely overshadows everything and everyone in this movie absolutely breathtaking another aspect of this movie that i loved is that it has its heart at the right place superb acting pacing and very believable storyline make this a must watch i am going for 1010 for this movie thats just blew me away,reality
i liked it this film is basically about a bournetype character who goes after his kidnapped daughter whose been for the sex slavery tradeit has the usual clichs  kidnapped tourists turned into drugged sex slaves  albanian gangsters  arab slavers  which panders to your xenophobic side and a super spy which kicks their asses how macho is that but hey it does have a big element of truth there the female sex slavery trade is alive and well and those groups do take a big part in it this truth may bother your liberal tendencies  deal with it its just as accurate as any of michael moore or al gores films  now that ive dumped on your lunch i thought the film pacing story was pretty good it probably wont win many academy awards which would be going to a film about a deafnblind mime but you wont be falling asleep and your girlfriend and daughters would probably be more careful when they go traveling ill give it 1010  an extra 3 because of films like history boys which was a totally horrible film,reality
this a really pursuable thriller where neeson destroys every bad man opposing him neeson plays a former central intelligence agency operative who sets about tracking down his teenage daughter after she is kidnapped by slave traders while traveling in europefrom the filmography view this movie is very amusing and fantastic with a good ideaseeing the movie some questions arises 1 how wonderful skilled neeson is that finds the albanian kidnappers quickly and more important 2 he has the right to kill all the bad men confronting him even the buyer of the slaves including her daughter 3 killing a lot of people in france he returns home without any problem and 4 all the people in france including the albanian mafia speak in englishtotally i strongly propose this movie to see to all,reality
first off i think that liam niesen was great in this movie i dont think that he was miscast at all the film begins with his estranged daughter begging for her father to sign a permission slip for her to go to paris shes underage so to make a long story short she lies to her dad about the truth of her little party vacation and well it gets her into a whirl of trouble once at the airport the girls are tricked then when they get back to the hotel thats when the fun starts kims friend is kidnapped and kim is shortly after that but not before she has a chance to call dear old dad to the rescue she gives him just enough information to go on before she is away he proceeds to go underground below the radar as a one man wrecking crew to find his daughter this movie has lots and lots of action good plot moves fairly quickly  pretty good action movie for anyone,reality
this movie is highly exciting definitely a watch if youre in the mood for some action i wouldnt call this movie entirely moving although if youre the type thats easily spooked and are female this movie could put you on edge for the rest of the night as it did one of my friends the action scenes i have to say were pretty believable except for this one car scene where the background got a little mixed up but overall very well done the lead actor i forget his name does a particularly great job with his role the scene from the trailers where he tells his daughter that theyre going to take her is pure thrill and the scene where he goes to the room where hes and puts on his detective hat is really cool and believable i definitely recommend this movie i gave it 910 because i only give 10s to movies that are not only well made but very moving which this one wasnt quite for me,reality
this is one of the best suspenseaction movies ive ever seen the actors all did an awesome job if you like action and suspense i promise this movie will keep you on the edge of your seat and at the end youll be begging for more the car chases the explosions and all the gun play and yes even special ops technology and plot twists youll never see coming did i mention the unique killings and torture treatments oh yes it is a good movie next to batman the dark knight its got my vote for best movie of 2008  2009 go see this movie or rent it now you will go buy it the next night i guarantee it liem nealson for best actor 2009 all the way i give this movie 10 a perfect score,reality
liam neeson kicks major ass in the fantastic action flick was the first film i saw in 2009 its the only film that ive bought somewhere other than movie gallery or blockbuster i bought it when it first came to dvd is a very awesome crowd pleaser thats far from disappointingis one of the best films of 2009 so far the best is harry potter and the halfblood prince but isnt far from there the plot retired cia agent bryan mills comes out of retirement to save his daughter in paris she was kidnapped by sex traffickers who take young teens drug them and turn them into prostitutes bryan will stop at nothing to find and kill these men is from writer luc besson who wrote films like the fifth element some of the transporter and the passable taxi is probably his best work yet is filled with spectacular action sequences and dozens of plausible moments liam neeson kicks many asses and i just cheer every time i also think its funny because the pricks who kidnapped his daughter deserve an ass whooping the film is nothing but entertainment and i loved ,reality
this show is fun and the action is so real that i was so much aback the pace is good and the humor is cool the movie depicted the love of a father where he will go all ways and means to rescue his beloved daughter child i think the movie is trying to depict that love story between a father and daughter it uses lots of cold humor and action to cover that loveydovey stuff we see in dramasi like every bit of the action and liam neeson although old has that charisma to pull this one off pretty well the ways the baddies are dealt with are with nononsense bang on their head no second chances and i liked that style of action because it leaves no room for the badguys who will overthrow the good at the later part of the storyi watched it with my colleague and they said its good its a show for all ages as well clean action packed and best of all its an alltime favorite repeatedly over and over again friends and colleagues said that this show is worth the money for the big screen,reality
the problem with a lot of actionthrillers is that the guy who is forced to step in and save the day does not have any experience thats why i am happy to report is here here liam neeson plays bryan mills an exfbi agent who is forced to use his skills to save his daughter kim maggie grace the film is about how bryan after much skepticism lets his daughter kim go to europe with her friend amanda katie cassidy just by the title it is needless to say bryan is right kim and amanda share a cab ride with a man named peter nicolas giraud only to figure out he is part of a large group that kidnaps women to sell them for prostitution now bryan is forced to step in and use his learned skills to kick some butt and save his daughter this is truly a great action film the acting is great the action fantastic and the movie is fastpaced and despite a slow beginning never skips a beat neeson is great here perfectly mixing sweetness and harshness to make one of the most surprisingly memorable movie character you also enjoy seeing neeson using nonviolent clever methods to save his daughter so if youre looking for a good time at the movies go see ,reality
ill bet neesons bryan mills character could beat the crap out of jason bourne talk about an overprotective father figure too bad most of the young ladies kidnapped for real in this world dont have a father like this guywith each film he makes liam neeson is becoming more and more likable in fact there has never been a part hes played that i wasnt totally comfortable with him being there except the time he played a kansas sheriff in some steve martin movie the name of it escapes me it wasnt a great film but certainly is it requires great and skillful moviemaking to present us so many unbelievable elements and still keep us begging for more neeson is a former cia agent who has to fly to paris on very short notice after his daughter and a friend are hostage moments after arriving on a vacation he was against the trip from the start but eventually he gave in to the pressure from bitchy exwife famke janssen after all her husband gave the girl some champion thoroughbred for her birthday and all neeson could afford was a tiny karaoke machine if he says no about this trip his daughter may never speak to him againneeson arrives in paris and just about tears the city apart looking for his daughter and her kidnappers not only a world class ass kicker this man is also very technically proficient and in no time has this coven of sleazy albanian immigrants on the run since the daughter is a virgin she is to be sold off to a wealthy sheik it is estimated that neeson has only 96 hours to find her can he do it as many people understand the film is not at all plausible and its makers must know this so instead of many thoughtprovoking scenes the film treats us to several fights car chases shootouts and whatever else keeps an action movie rolling the film touches on the dreary practice of the sex trade and even though the film is pg13 we get a good sense of how disgusting that world is neeson is exceptional as always a skillful boxer in his early days now he uses martial arts and makes them look good he like jason bourne can knock just about anyone out with a couple quick and perfectly placed shots to the head or neck this film was a huge box office hit but unfortunately for neeson his wife passed away in a terrible skiing accident about the time it was in theaters my condolences go out to him and also my congratulations on making a wonderful action film 9 of 10 starsthe hound,reality
this is a straightforward action movie for a guy who was already 55 when it was filmed liam comes across as pretty darn tough i credit the camera workediting and also the fight choreographer they make liam look welltrained and lethal  quick to kill without unnecessary effort for an older man he compares very well with the new james bond persona  nononsense gritty deadlythe plot could have used a few more minutes of run time to solidify with some more development there are too many convenient lucky breaks  like finding his daughters jacket recovering a witness who remembers a key location etc  the usual shortcomings one must be willing to overlook to enjoy this kind of filmbut on the whole it is a very satisfying movie with a high body count of easytoidentify bad guys loads of action  the obligatory fast car scenes but almost everything else involves killing lots of dead bad guys realistically done  blood as necessary but no gratuitous gore very watchable,reality
as i finally woke up to the sleeper action movie hit of the year i was by surprise on how immensely entertaining this narrative is sure it does incorporate various faux action tactics by the lead action character but you know what ill take it liam neeson stars as retired cia agent bryan mills who might be the best of the action heroes to arrive in the cinematic millennium its not so what mills can do is what he cannot do he is sharp cerebral dynamic skilled swift just to give you a few takes on his strengths mills cia training definitely comes in handy when his daughter kim maggie grace is what else on a paris vacation by an albanese gang for slave trade thereafter daddy mills puts on his vengeance suit and off to paris he goes to rescue his daughter and take down the malos does the mills prevail well i cant take that away from you by providing you the answer you are going to take it all in cinematic stride by watching director pierre morel excelled in orchestrating action sequences in with his rapid style sure no cia agent could realistically be as skilled as mills and sometimes his marvel proficiency seemed more illusory than authentic but we could say the same for die hard machismo john mcclane and many other infamous action heroes so we should all take it with a grain of salt and ask ourselves is this plain action movie fun i sure thought so i am glad the protagonist role was by veteran actor liam neeson he was to simply say it kick ass as mills will not capture everyone especially those nitpicking critics but i was sure in on this 90 minute action entertainment ride ok that was my last take for the compelling  excellent,reality
is an action movie which really does justice to the genreit avoids shallow hollywood excesses like ridiculous explosions expensive cars and halfnaked women and really focuses on creating a serious moving piece of cinema the premise itself is very simple and even conventional but it works bryan mills liam neeson a former secret service agent employs his highly developed set of skills to find and rescue his daughter kim maggie grace who has been kidnapped and sold into the albanian slave trade while on a visit to europethe films premise is set up in what feels like the first ten minutes of the movie and while the background story and character development seem rushed the intention is made clear the movie is about the events that followabout one mans unrelenting hunt both for his daughter and for revenge upon her kidnappersliam neeson is a perfect cast for the role of bryan mills he calm stern and almost dispassionate in the way he works bitterly vowing to find and kill the kidnappers it is clear from the outset that he is ruthlessly professional a legacy of his training as a government spy every move made by bryan mills is cold and calculated which means that the movie never drifts into clich shootouts where one man infiltrates some warehouse and manages to evade the bullets of countless attackers instead the movies writers respect the viewers intelligence and opt for a more inventive plot which revolves around bryan mills abilities and deadly efficiency another point to be made about the writing is thatdespite the one against hundreds oddsthe viewer never has to suspend their disbelief never did i find myself saying yeah right under my breath and for that matter neither did i find myself yelling at bryan mills or thinking how he could have done things differently the plot is very very believablecredit must also be given to the director pierre morel in this regard it comes as no surprise that the morel has worked mostly as a cinematographer as much of the action and fighting is realistic and almost palpable at times the camera angles the choreography and even the sound effects have a gritty arresting quality to them in a way that surpasses the bourne movies and much of the directing is something foreign to big screen action flickswhat accomplishes is the best kind of cinematic experience with refreshingly believable fight sequences a clever and engaging plot and some great acting from liam neeson while the movies subject may be lacking in originality it the best aspects of the action genre and reinvigorated them with a bold sense of realismwritten by anton for wwwovercrankednet,reality
liam neeson is a retired cia action man whose wife has abandoned him for a rich creep and the couple are spoiling his 17 yearold daughter and driving a wedge between him and the girl the girl has foolish spoilt brat rich friends and is persuaded by a featherhead named amanda to travel to paris with her which neeson tries to prevent but cannot as soon as the silly girls arrive they are spotted at the airport by albanian gangsters who provide girls for captive drugged prostitution and sell the prettiest into the white slave trade naturally the girls are kidnapped and neesons daughter being especially pretty is destined for the harem of one of those corrupt arab sheikhs we all love to hate this sheikh having a luxury boat docked at the quays of the seine in the heart of paris neeson moves into action mode rushes to paris knowing he has only 96 hours to save his daughter before she vanishes forever i have special skills he says and thats for sure he starts tearing paris apart kills lots of disgusting albanian gangsters cant somebody do that for real please and is generally unstoppable nor can we catch our breath what with all the emergencies chases fights murders and fantastic tension neeson is brilliant at this role giving us the impression he was born with an automatic in his hand and held his mother at gunpoint demanding his first suck this is a very very exciting movie it is also incredibly horrifying because the extended cut on the dvd shows all the young girls lying drugged on beds in rows with men queuing up to rape them after buying tickets alas i fear this all really goes on but without neesons to stop it the ultimate organiser of the highlevel sales of girls to sheikhs is a suave member of paris society who lives in a huge mansion with parties for hundreds of people but with kidnapped girls being sold at auction in the basement while unknowing socialites drink their champagne upstairs this theme must have come from cowriter luc besson who is well aware of the rotten state of much of the french power elite indeed french political and commercial corruption is an increasingly urgent theme in films made or written by french cinema makers these days as tell no one showed so powerfully see my review of ne le dit  personne you have to be strong to see the extended cut of this one,reality
okay i just watched the movie its so good imo except for one thing when the fat arab who were about to bang kim grabbed his man who was in charge of buying her at the boat this conversation went between both in arabic for sure so heres the translation of their exact words   whos this man what does he want  hes a dad he wants his daughter back and winked backwards in a blink heres my point how in the world did this guy know that bryan is kims daughter lol i dont want to be mrdidntyounotice neither do i mean to make it rather pointless yet i know arabic and i presume a lot of people dont so i just thought it wouldnt be bad to bring this to light,reality
for me this film was amazingi have read many reviews giving this a negative and all the negatives stem around the stereotypes what action film nowadays doesnt have stereotypes its as if any film has middle eastern or asian characters in it everyone shouts my god stereotype seriously lighten up its a film someone mentioned product placement of oringina when he give it to the girl for shock wow it was in shot for like 10 seconds what about all these films where all laptops used are from apple that was probably the only product placement in the film and tbh i didnt really noticeanyways this film is great neeson isnt what would come to mind as an action star but he performs great he is like bond but more realistic and less oooooooooh look at me you really need to see this film very entertaininganyone giving it less that 8 is silly  or just being negative about it because they are overly picky being overly intelligent,reality
we can negotibooommm  this is one brief movie so full of fights and action you end up feeling they left in every kickbutt scene and took out some of the dialogue ones which could have given this movie more depth but hey im not complaining nothing wrong with a good dose of buttkicking specially when its done this greatly by terrific actors and for reasons you end more than caring about sure everything goes just right for neeson in his quest it seems even rambo would have more trouble reaching his objectives and he definitely cant seem to be hit by any of the dozens of cars driving the opposite way or even by the hundreds of bullets shot at him but then again who cares  my only 3 real complaints 1 after substantially reducing paris population it seems hard to believe neeson would be allowed to simply return home like any tourist 2 who ended steering the boat when neeson took out every living soul on it 3 how did the sheik know exactly which of the 34 girls was neesons daughter  7909 another couple of additional complaints 4 liam neeson playing his recording while investigating in the apartment and listening to his daughter screaming out oh my god they took her  when in reality she yelled this out loud before neeson evern turned on his tape recorder and 5 neeson takes the camera card in order to investigate its contents and it is easy to notice that the photo one of the girls took of the other outside the airport prior to them both being photographed by the creep is not there,reality
matt damon in the bourne saga wants to be liam neeson when he grows up this is how its done liam neeson builds a coherent and human character very close to those weve seen in the bourne saga or series like 24 or burn notice not only his portrait of a paranoic ex spy is believable but his skills look real its like he had them in him for years which is something i really appreciate being a fan of realistic martial arts i must add here that matt damon did a great job there in his bourne movies yes and i loved brad pitt and eric bana at troy i really thank them for that effort and i pay gladly for the dvds of their movies because of thatsaid that the movie succeeds in creating a flow of emotion in the audience me sympathy and a bit of shame about a father who cant clearly keep the love of his daughter or his exwife fantastic and beautiful famke jansen she looks so beautiful when shes upset lucyly for him the situation will be that he will be able to use his only good skills to regain the love of his family drame ensues rage and fear and in the end an exhilarating sense of happiness and justice has been done feeling all of that in a common kind of movie but crafted in a clean nice way that takes you in from the first minute to the endliam neeson is great and i bet this movie will make some part of his audience that didnt know him much to gain lot of respect for his work,reality
liam neeson in an action role that makes steven seagal look sleepy and tired who wudda thunk it what a well made movie and a joy to ridei agree with the previous comments on this movie it is well paced the action is mostly all believable and once the fun begins you hardly get to catch your breathfamke janssen is perfect as the exwife you love to hate but besides a bubbly performance by maggie grace as daddys little girl this movie is all liam neeson now he has never really impressed me before in a movie but he gets kudos for his performance here it wasnt what i expected and i was pleasantly surprisedone thing that really impressed me was the lack of strong language and gratuitous sex if not for the violence this movie could be rated pg even then except for one scene which caused my wife to turn away the violence was tastefully done not needing gory effects to carry the film this just proves that a great action movie does not need vulgar language and unnecessary sexnudity to succeedbasically a mans 17 year old daughter is kidnapped by a sex slaveprostitution ring and he goes to get her all i can say is that they picked the wrong girl to snatch her dad is an exfederal agent who hasnt lost his touchif you dont go in expecting too much after all of this glowing praise i believe that you will be pleasantly surprised as well,reality
after watching the first 20 minutes or so of this film i seriously considered taking a walk as mindnumbingly silly and atrocious as it is i decided to wait in hopes of a single interesting thing to happen what you get at the beginning is a borderline obsessive father who only thinks about his 17 year old daughter a birthday party for said daughter who gets a freaking horse from her stepfather a horse an ungrateful exwife and a britney spears wannabethe daughter is the main reason this film is a turnoff i dont doubt that maggie grace may be an adequate actress but here she portrays such a dumb childish naive annoying 17 year old with the mind of a 12 year old that perhaps its the writing that is at fault just watch her run and jump clumsily with glee when she gets what she wants and you wont believe your eyes it wouldnt be a spoiler to say that the movie has a happy ending its implied in the tagline but i still found myself hoping for the worst for this pitiful spoiled brat when the film does start there are a few cool sequences involving liam neeson maintaining his cool as he breaks bones in search for his daughter however daniel craigs bond he is notfinally i use the term happy ending loosely sure the girl is rescued but what about the numerous others who are locked in the sextrade industry this film could have been so much more if it had portrayed some government initiative to bring it down rather than the rescue of just one truly obnoxious american girl,reality
if youve seen the trailer then there is little to be said about the plot because you know it  liam neesons 17 year old daughter in paris on vacation is kidnapped by albanian sexslave traders unfortunately for them neeson is a retired us government covert operative of some kind with skills and resources which enable him to pursue the kidnappers extract information and exact retributionthis is a good action thriller somewhat in the bourne mould with a solid and credible performance by neeson at its heart  the emotional stakes are clear throughout but neesons characters professionalism is completely in charge as long as it is necessary it is refreshing to see a protagonist doing what he has to do with utter ruthlessness with no gentlemanly pussyfooting aroundthere are some plot threads left untied literally in the case of a thread which he finds at the kidnap scene but then never pursues as far as i could see and there is some pretty wild variance in how easily he takes out the kidnappers but for all that the action never lets up and i thoroughly enjoyed it,reality
i cannot believe that this film achieved an average score of 8 out of 10 on imdb i was actually gob smacked and disturbed by this filmit seems to be a twisted modern day fable from hollywood which teaches rich teenage girls that leaving the shores of the usofa will result in becoming a drug addicted sex slave eventually sold to some arabs you must admire hollywoods ability to shoe horn arabs into being the bad guys at the endsome of the action scenes in this film were good if it wasnt for the vile under current then it would be be a passable bit of no brain action circa a 4 out of 10 but there is no way in the world that this is an 8 out of 10 film,reality
having hardly seen his wife now ex and daughter for the last decade or so due to his work bryan is now a former special agent who has his retirement early in order to move close to where his estranged family now live despite his better judgement he gives consent for his 17 yearold daughter to go to paris with a friend however all his paranoia is justified when his daughter calls him during an abduction by some unknown men using his contacts bryan learns of an albanian group specialising in kidnapping travelling young women into sex slavery and estimates he has 96 hours maximum before she is drugged beyond redemption and sold into prostitution calling on a lifetime of skills bryan goes to paris to track down those responsible and find his daughteri have not heard or read any reviews for this film when i went to see it but i imagine that many of them will have called this film a cross between death wish and the bourne films because that is what it happens to play like the death wise side of it makes it a little harder to enjoy but the bourne side makes it worth seeing the thin plot is where we have the death wise material as the nice retired man who loves his daughter turns out to have been correct that the world is a hideous place outside of the us whenever his daughter gets kidnapped with hours before she is transformed into a junkie and working for her hits joe goes to a paris where it appears that the louvre is the only building not fully of young women trafficked into sex and we never seen that so i have no proof fortunately rash violence will save the day ok so politically this is not the most pleasant pieces of work to be watching but aside from the first twenty minutes of setup some of which i could have done without the plot doesnt really matter and it becomes a race against time thrillerthis is where it does owe a great debt to bourne because the filming style the action the urgency and the fighting style are all very similar to the formulae used to good effect in that trilogy the camera never sits still the editing is fast and the soundeffects produce an audience reaction themselves of course it is very much derivative of bourne and not up to that high standard but it does still make for an engagingly violent thriller when it stops moving even for a second it sags and it doesnt seem to know how to link the scenes so many actions scenes fade to black and then into a slower scene setting up the next sequence but mostly it keeps the pace high and keeps moving this does not make it a great film though and it is quite a cynical affair in some regards however it is hard to fault it when it delivers such solid thrills as its main functionof some surprise to me was to see how effective neeson was in the lead channelling some of his crazed performance from darkman he is a tremendous force ripping through criminals and surprisingly convincing in the action scenes with fluid and natural motions helped by very good editing as well the rest of the cast dont matter so much but janssen berkeley and vallance are all odd finds in smaller roles while grace does her bit in regards being a thoughtless teenager and then in peril morels direction is effective even if it is easy to imagine that he has lots of paul greengrass films at home and had been studying them pretty closelyis not a brilliant film but if you accept it for what it is then it is an effective thriller driven by brutal but not gory violence which is justified by the family heart of the plot much like death wish did it is best to ignore the message within all this and just leave your brain off to enjoy the action which while not bourne level is still effective and enjoyable,reality
just a little bit more overthetop than damons jason bourne neeson here has gone the fullschwarzenegger from commando 1985once youre over that shock couldnt neeson have shot more people in love actually  that movie could really have been something this is a surprisingly good vigilante genre flick in the best cruel and bloodthirsty sensecant say im normally a fan of former cinematographersturneddirectors look at your jan de bonts dean semlers even barry sonnenfeld is pretty hit  miss but thanks go to pierre morel who has been patient enough to nurture the character moments between all the whambam that makes you want to buy into the whole hackneyed kidnaptrackdown and onemanrevengejuggernaut premise all over again the actors carry it off too  this is neesons movie of course but even the teenage daughter is played quite genuinely ie genuinely irritating these kids today i dont know and you can feel luc bessons touch in the jarring mix of the sweetly sadsensitivesentimental protagonist with an explosively violent side to his personality whats up with luc besson  did he only direct as a steppingstone to screen writing he can really smash a film like this home but i digressi enjoyed this film lots it was a free preview screening but looking back it would be well worth paying forcaution if youre french albanian or arabian prepare to be offended,reality
great use of the story premise plot devices and very believable build up the dialogue is precise and idiosyncratic to each character the characters are incredibly well fleshed out the acting is great liam neeson did this role incredibly everyone else doesnt have that much but at least they didnt ruin the film because of it the cinematography is excellent and the editing masterful action sequences are beautiful and deliberate the soundtrackaudio is specific but not deterring this movie reeks of leon or the professional or even ronin and will have that cult following who will rant about it for years specific details made me think of the professionalleon for example the sleepingsitting in the armchair by neeson and i was not surprised to learn it was written by luc besson director of the professionalleon i thought that many action films fail because of the lack of attention to detail but this is not the case for it is a must see for action fans,reality

sure to be any fathers required film viewing for their daughters i thought of mine the whole time i was watching this flick and i begrudgingly became extra aware of parents pov when they have to let go of their kids it really can be a bad crazy world out there and after watching youd want to have a dad like liam neesons character bryan millsbryan retired from the cia to get closer to his beloved daughter kim maggie grace who has just turned 17 kim lives with bryans exwife lenore famke janssen and asks permission from him to go to paris with a friend he reluctantly allows her and his worst fears come to life when she is kidnapped by an armenian white slavery ring bryan is forced to use his special set of skills to get his daughter back armed with only very few clues in only a few hours he has before she disappears foreverwritten by luc besson the fifth element the transporter series is the impressive hollywood directorial debut of cinematographer pierre morel he has loads of help from neeson though who is super believable transitioning from ultradoting dad to unstoppable force to reckon with if youre ever in trouble youd want to have him on your side when he says hes coming to get you you know he will especially when he quickly and efficiently handles anyone who gets in his way i would definitely like to see him taking on more roles like this one it was just as startling to see the beautiful janssen in a subdued mother role having been used to seeing her as the femme fatale or the superhero for the better part of her career while definitely pretty grace was miscast as kim not only is she a decade older than the character shes already famous as whiny shannon in lost while still whiny her acting was too affected perhaps trying to compensate for playing someone much younger she ran like a retard and her misplaced mannerisms distracted from the moviestill i found to be v entertaining needless to say dont take it so seriously it delivers on being violent ridiculous unbelievable fun so enjoy it,reality

this movie takes us back to the good old street justice days of movieswe all remember death wish and out for justice and not forgetting payback these movies gave us that raw and pure violence without any remorse or feeling just raw good old violence and who would have tough liam neeson to be the one pulling this off so generously well here my friends we have something so good its just to good to miss out on i sat on my couch eating chips and having some max while this killing machine of a man just took down one after another and it seemed it should never end to my satisfaction i might add i enjoyed the killing quite much the last time i had a blast like this were when i saw out for justice and under siedge maybe even bloodsport or death warrant these arent the acting standard one might hope for but non the less good old violent action at its best just like this good flick is so to stop babbling and answering the question at hand yes this is the movie you want to see and yes it will make you wanna take up karate again in the garage,reality
ive always liked liam neeson in movies but this one i cant blame him for the script or direction or stunts but i beg the question why liam hes far too old to be playing an action here but with the wig in place and a bit of plastic surgery on the face he passes for 60the violence in the movie is unspeakable and we are asked to suspend disbelief over and over again even against machine guns and machetes and liam all by his little old self kills em all every last one and hangs off buildings to get into hotel rooms that every one else has easy access toand he tortures readily being excia and drives in and out of impossible situationsarabs and albanians are all bad guys sex traffickers who speak english as liam does to everyone in parisand liam only cares about his daughter and not the other unfortunate girls who are also trafficked and she loses her best friend and is not traumatized one bitand her daddy leaves a trail of bodies and mayhem all through france and no one bats an eye and lets him return on a plane to la which is far far safer than parisi could go on but dont waste your time on this drivel1 out of 10,reality
you would think that if they were going to put out such a stinker that they would have at least changed the title of this moviei have no problem with the premise or the violence but i thought for one the acting on everyones part was horrible and so phony its certainly changed my opinion of liam neesom and im so confused why he chose to do thisalmost from the moment the movie started i was uncomfortable with the dialog it was forced and totally unrealisticwhen things really went south for me was when liam was the bodyguard at the pop concert and the barriers were broken down and all the fans starting rushing the star liam whisked her away but whats this someone already backstage is hiding in the curtains and jumps out and pulls a knife what the where on earth did that come from niam slaps the guy around and boom that little plot line is toast totally unbelievabletrust me this movie is pure garbage dont be fooled by the ratings here notice how theres almost no reviews with 5 or 6 stars its either 9 or 10 or 1 or 2 trust the 1s and 2s,reality
it is unfortunate that is automatically regarded as clichd by hearing its plot alone in a nutshell the daughter of an american secret agent is kidnapped and so he goes after her kidnappers sounds like a moviemadefortv doesnt it well its not the writing is excellent very tight it gets to the point really quickly it is obvious that they worked on the script a lot to ensure that nothing boring or redundant is left inside the rhythm of the plot picks up quickly and you dont want to stop watchingthe action scenes are filmed to perfection and they are all convincing and interesting the european set gives a kind of exotic vibe adding to the value of the moviefinally liam neeson is perfect for the role you might think that someone like bruce willis might be more cut out for this but neeson proves he is an excellent actor and his performance is truly enjoyabledo not miss out on it is one of the best of its kind,reality
this film has much going for it liam neeson is a credible leading man as bryan the retired special forces agent who is trying to rebuild his relationship with his daughter kim after his wife remarriedthe action is exciting relentlessand wellstagedlargely set in paris the locations are a welcome change from standard hollywood fare and are well handled by director morel and writer besson both native frenchmenthe big budget gives plenty of bangs for your buck or euro and the 90 odd minute running time flys by with a convincing story steeped in the revenge genre so often played out in westernsbut there is also much wrong with it which considering the acting talent and budget could have been put rightthe language issue is horribly fudgedsometimes french and albanian is sub titled sometimes it is not sometimes french characters speak in english sometimes they do not most comic is a scene in which neeson impersonates a french police officer to albanians in broad american englishthis unwillingness to immerse in the french culture creates other problemsbryan has apparent close connections with the french authorities which helps him through the plot no end but it seriously detracts from the stranger in a strange land dynamic which helps a tale like thisequally the girls once hardly appear again i would gladly have lost the unnecessary 4x4 chase shootout and explosions at the albanians camp for a view of the other sideequally the shoot outs both at the auction hotel and the sheikhs boat are preposterous and needlessly over the top the story would have been more effective for a bit of restraint not lessfinally the racial stereotyping is lazythe americans are good and wholesome the french corrupt albanians swarthy and evil arab sheikhs fat with exotic sexual demands although mainly set in paris rarely is there a french ambiance to proceedings or sense of place in sharp contrast to the recently released in bruges no reference at all is made to the fate that befalls his daughters travelling companionso an exciting enough film enjoyable enough in its own right which should have been a lot better,reality
the more often i see this film the better it gets and it was terrific the first time i saw it the acting is first rate with liam neeson perfectly cast and giving an outstanding performance as the exspy dad on a rampage to rescue his kidnapped daughter from euro sex merchants after the opening setup the action is nonstop and amply displays neesons training and an athletic skill that belies his latefifties age written by luc besson and robert mark kamen the dialog is crisp and compelling all in all a wonderful action film that has you pulling for the protagonist from beginning to end although many other reviewers cite the similarities to the bourne franchise they are probably too young to fully appreciate how closely the flow of the film parallels the death wish series particularly in the efficient and dispassionate manner in which neesons character dispatches the enemy to meet their maker overall a great movie you can watch again and again,reality
liam neeson is really fantastic in this as a hard man whos daughter maggie grace gets kidnapped while shes on holiday in europe liam really captures the acting in this brilliantly with him being an ex spy the interrogation of the men he knows has something to do with the capture of his daughter really have a bad time of it torture painful deaths and some very skillful overkills are among what liam neesons character offers he really goes all out in the search of his daughter which i think any man would try to do if they were in a similar problemthere really isnt much more to say on this its fairly straight forward but is very effective the high points of this movie is the smartness of neesons character and also the high octane action that goes with it everyone should see this awesome movie9610,reality
its been just too long waiting for an action thriller that will knock my socks off given too many bland attempts that left me wondering if the genre is too tired for my liking with nothing left to wow then comes the europa corp team of pierre morel directing a luc besson and robert mark kamen story and now ranks as one of my contemporary favourites for its simple story executed with so much style and gripping pace that youll be left breathless by the time the end credits rollthe trailer had one of the best monologues that im sure would have put many in the theatres and probably be representative of the film you have a stoic looking liam neeson as a father who tells the stranger at the end of the other line the conditions that the game will be played in with perhaps bluff calling against bluff only for the challenge and gauntlet to be thrown from then on its a nonstop adrenaline rush because this daddy happens to be a top excovert operative for the us government so the bad guys essentially have chosen a wrong opponent to play the game withthe story worked well in dipping into some familiar fears where daddys little girl kim maggie grace tells her dad lie after lie so as to cover up her tracks in wanting to do things she knows he would disapprove of such as in this case going on a tour of museums in paris supposedly rather than letting him know of her intent of being a groupie with friend amanda katie cassidy chasing u2 all over europe some may dismiss this fear as paranoia but i think that heightened sense of awareness is a by product occupational hazard and its always better to err on the side of caution for any parent who are confident of their kids conduct there is absolutely no guarantees that their kids friends would toe the same line and there are often those who are magnets for trouble due to their thrill seeking as is in this case where you see supposed safeguards to lower risks being systematically peeled awaywith his reluctant consent and lessons being thrown in on very simple survival tips that would even serve well in real life things still go wrong according to murphy and liam neesons brian has to race against time in finding a needle in the perennial haystack relying on contacts and skills built over the years in carrying out government missions of prevention to save masses now to put them into something more personal when addressing what could be any parents worst nightmare in having their daughters sold to the sex slave tradeactionwise morel employs a whole host of fights ranging from gun battles knives and the good ol fisticuffs with neeson employing some cool shinsai goshin kai moves for close quarter combats to take out opponents you might balk at how its probably another one man army movie with the hero ripping through the streets of paris but this borders close to the jason bourne movies in the way opponents are dispatched without remorse and without much bullshit its clinical as it is deadly just the way i suppose anyone would do so without the very hokey monologues that plague lesser films prior to each kill the action direction was top notch without resorting to cheap mtv styled quick cuts and had kept the shakycam syndrome at bay which in turn provided for a pure adrenaline rush for action junkies out therewell deserved its accolades and i say again one of the best action thrillers to have hit the screen of late after a number of bland peers i highly recommend this and its a shooin as a contender for top films of this year see if you can spot that sq plane flying overhead in a scene too,reality
only a week ago i complained they dont make good movies anymore ipman finally gave me a worthwhile experience a couple of days ago but today renews my faith in action movies againwriters luc besson and robert mark karem havent done it better together since they wrote the fifth element 12 years ago director pierre morel are new to me but his debut as director was in another luc besson written banlieue 13 and he has been involved as cinematographer in both the transporter and danny the dog which both are written by the bessonkarem duo to be honest luc besson havent been convincing to me in much he has done since his work in back in those days with leon and the fifth element but he is back now no doubt about itis very much mold in the same ways as the bourne trilogy the camera angles and the fighting style very much follows the way the bourne movies was done but here the main character are driven by his goal rather than spending half the time wondering whos the bad guys it makes for better action rather than the spy vs spy ways of bourne and liam neeson does a performance bruce willis john mcclane from the early die hard movies would be proud ofhe is the beenthereseenitall former ciaagent retired to spend more time close to his 17 year old daughter hes been seeing to little of because of his work his daughter now lives with the exwife and a stepfather and neeson does an excellent job giving life to the father on the sideline in the early stages of the movie a very common and realistic family way in these days and as the main plot of the movie revolves around girl trafficking it stays with another relevant problem of the darker side of life too many girls are victimized by stillit do take some time until the action unfolds but the time is well spent giving the audience an insight into the relationship between the family and into the main characters background and when it takes off the movie doesnt slow down until the end creditsi might have given my rating on the upper side of what it deserves but as an action movie i think it really deserve it if you watch it as the action entertaining it is it delivers in more ways than ive seen in a long long time maybe even not since die hard and thats about 21 years agohighly recommended 93 minutes,reality
director pierre morel has given us a solid winter movie experience with 2009 an actionthriller with plenty of character i went into this film expecting lots of action i got that action and morethe opening frames of this film are unquestionably canned sentiment this theme continues throughout the beginning of the movie but it isnt the generic stuff its the satisfying nostalgic kind a sort of cinematic chef boyardee if you will and not the cold straightoutofthecan collegiate sustenance but the lovingly warmed kind your mother always made you our hero bryan mills liam neeson is the kind of guy a lot of us thirtysomethings can really identify with he ekes out a retirees life in a cheap apartment to be close to his teenage daughter a lovely young thing who lives with the exwife and her new rich husband the relationship is strained since the ex lenore famke janssen hardly approves of bryans way of life even though hes given up the spy gameso heres a man who gets emasculated at every turn but willingly suffers it to build a relationship with daughter kim maggie grace her businessman stepfather more present in his white collar than bryan could ever be in his cia issue offers up an arabian horse to compete with bryans karaoke machinebut when young kim is abducted by slave traders in paris bryan earns his keep as the tension builds we see an agentturnedfather in his real element it isnt long before his buddies in the trade get him enough info to start the hunt and its here that the pace really starts movingbefore long bryans in france dealing out one erg after another of brutal justice as he tracks down his daughter now dont get me wrong its not all chases and fights well no thats a lie it is all chases and fights but not only are they perfectly filmed timed and acted but they do a terrific job of portraying the character now bryan mills isnt your usual good guy hes not your usual antihero either hell hes not even your usual jason bourne hes a father with years of combat and espionage experience and he holds nothing back in retrieving his daughter every scumbag who gets in his way pays an unmerciful but suitable price beautiful vicious martial arts not entirely unrealistic gunfights and a breakneck pace reveal a man willing to do anything for his daughterany father should be able to enjoy the seeing the beastly side of parental urges played out so artfully but theres more to it than that this is a movie thats also topical in a few ways the slave trade is very much alive in the modern world and could use some attention in it gets that exposure furthermore there are themes revolving around the broken family the general disdain of americans abroad and government corruptionthe acting in this film was on all counts even with the writing that is to say it was incredible only a single grammatical error and a fairly dull musical score detracted from my enjoyment i am pleased to give 8 of 10 points,reality
this movie was well made and really captivating both story wise and flow before watching the film i remembered seeing a preview for it and in it it showed how his daughter went to paris and then they spoke on the phone as her friend and she were being kidnapped the preview continued with the phone conversation that followed between liam neesons character brian and marko this scene happened early on in the movie and it was followed by a good hour of dramatic rescue activity and action scenes that showed brians fighting skill and his shooting and aiming abilities had a great cast liam neeson was awesome and played his role confidently using his natural suaveness to kick ass and beat the hell out of some albanians the rest of the cast played their roles as well one issue that shows up is the cars in the movie are mostly automatic and there is one which is kind of both but arent cars in france manual,reality
is it really that fast oh yes at an astonishing level achieves to manage a very quick rhythm with no deadmoments liam neeson is perfect to the job and gives this years james bond a knockoutpierre morels directing exploits the simplicity of the plot and creates a paced level to the movies environment the movie is always focused on the films quick ambient and action rejecting the few calm moments existingliam neeson is the man the action starts when bryans daughter is kidnapped and then what we have is a roller coasting ride liam neeson accomplishes whats expected of him and just kicksass by dismantling all the humantrafficking organization in france in only a few days or for us 93 minutes which gives an even faster sensationif you are in for adrenaline then this is the right movie for you if you want to see liam neeson in a badass character then this is also a movie for youis one of the best action movies 2008 has to offer and probably one of the best of the genre in years action lovers youll love this  810,reality
i had no idea about when i was stepping inside of the theatre liam is one of my favorite actors but since i see the movies poster and read his name on it i even didnt know that liam was in the leading role anyway after a few minutes later i started to focus on the film and the show started when the sweet daughter left the country with her best friend since bourne series honestly for a long time i did not watch such realistic fighting scenes this movie made me fully satisfied with its directing cast and atmosphere it was very serious hard and straight screenplay is simple but tempo makes you to forget about it once its dvd comes out i will definitely add it to my archive neeson was like a storm during the film he was very successful when we match his performance to his age as i mentioned movie just have a simple story but very watchable and entertaining go and get it,reality
the name sounds familiarity yes a famous tv series with the same name was there on aliens ufo etc but this movie has nothing to do with the tv series or aliensthe story is about a retired us spy bryan liam neeson who is overprotective of his daughter kim maggie grace even after cautious no from bryan kim decides for a trip to paris with her friend where both are kidnapped by a european gang of girl traffickers before they are sold bryan has 72 hours to rescue them what follows is a ruthless and clinical tracking by bryan in the streets of paris in the end bryan is able to save his daughter backliam neeson though a bit haggard with age brings immense amount of life to this role of us spy he is a pleasure to watch when he is at the job he knows and does best taking risks and always a step ahead of his enemies he is the heart and soul of this movie without him the movie would not have been as good as it is nowthe cinematographer turned director pierre morel does a fine job with his second venture this too like his first one banieule 13 is shot in paris the story is linear and is told with clarity the story builds up slowly but holds your interest till the very end the action sequences are shot immensely well and the fights of liam neeson reminded me of steven seagals style of martial artswith liam neeson not getting injured till the very end it was not necessary to show him getting injured during the last fight with a puny fellow anyways it is a good action movie to watchstars 65 out of 10,reality
this is trying to be a more emotionallygrounded version of the bourne identity movie franchise matt damons character is fighting for himself whereas liams character is fighting for his daughter i think this makes it all the more powerful on an emotional level you feel for liam the initial daughterfather plot line setup is a bit cheesy and painful 1superhappy airhead iloveyoudaddy daughter check 2annoying ex wife and uberrich stepfather check 3postdivorce fatherdaughter relationship issues checkbut its all excused because it serves the plot well as noted above still they couldve cut the airport and singer meetup closing scenes at the end i was so pumped up i was expecting the daughters car to be carjacked at the airportits littered with other clichs albanians arabs french lover etc and completely omits dealing with the other slave girls but at least it exposes a rather nasty business to the publicluc bessons style is omnipresent and he rightly didnt lay it too heavy on the aggravatingly ubercool action scenes like in revolver or transporter its just rightmemorable scenes telling his daughter to describe her kidnappers live threatening kidnapper marco on the phone shooting the french policemans wife construction site brothel slave auction getting marco to read good luckan adrenaline pumper of a movie i tell you,reality
maybe i expected more because its an issue i care a lot about or maybe i ought to avoid the action genre altogether but im appalled and shocked to see how many positive reviews are out about this film not to mention how many people suggested it to me after learning about my interest in the topicoverall this movie is ridiculously superficial and some of the worst actingwriting ive ever seen such a horrible way to simplify such a serious and complicated issue the writer had to have read a brief article about human trafficking and thought it was a great dramatic plot for a warmhearted happy ending action flick while it did highlight some basic facts about trafficking and addresses the idea that anyone even wealthy american girls can be vulnerable it does such an extreme injustice to actual victimssurvivors unfortunately a film that could have been effective in raising awareness about human trafficking seems to have only reinforced ideology that young girls fall victim to these sort of operations because of their stupidity and all they need is a big strong man to come save them while theyre still pure while her mother was extremely foolish in not taking any action to prepare her for the trip the plot suggests that the daughters desire for independence led to her demise succeeding in blaming the victim as we tend to do in these situationsthis movie could have so much better if they had created a situation where the daughter does everything right and still becomes a victim because of the extent of deception tactics used in this industry the film is only 93 minutes it could have easily been extended to develop the plot and create a more plausible context people who are trafficked are most often lured in by people they trust not just some cute random at the airport telling them about a party they should have ran with the plot of visiting museums and experiencing the culture of europe and had her fall in love with some dreamy french guy or take some awesome job offer that turns out to be a trap take out one of the 5 car chase scenes and actually create a story they could have done so much to create a strong female character who despite her age naivety and horrible situation can be resilient and inspirational to other young womenalthough the film did highlight typical experiences of trafficking victims such as forced drug use and repeated rape as well as the complications of police corruption they should have put a name or face to this experience rather than keeping the main character as the one whos somehow spared with her virginity still in tact days after her original kidnapping even if this were the case she would have been significantly traumatized due to beatings intimidation or simply witnessing whats happening to othersinstead of the happy ending with lots of smiles and getting to meet a famous pop star they should be addressing the after effects of extreme trauma even if they want to make it less intense for the pg13 rating they could at least acknowledge that even someone rescued early on might need some therapy or support and wont be smiling and jumping around when shes reunited with her family acting like phew glad thats over now i can get back to my fun life as a teenager and my future career as a pop singer,reality
i cant understand all those who say that this movie is like bourne or bond  okey the movie have some good action but never in my life have i seen something so bad and stupid when it comes to story writing  im not saying that trafficking doesnt exist in fact its a huge problem but come on man a 9 year old girl on crack and smack could do a better job as a storywriter than this and here is why 1 dont travel to europe cause you will just be kidnapped one hour after arriving 2 if do travel to europe then make sure your father is a 50 year old retired special agent equipped with a sony voice recorder and make sure his exwife have a private jet so he can be there fast3 the french police and the albania mafia are working together so dont even bather calling the police 4 in france there are brothels at construction sites5 you can steel a brand new vw car in just 2 min the old fashion way like in the 80s by putting a bended hanger or so down the window and then hot wire it6 beside a bible hotel rooms have a cabinet with saltwater solution tubes and injection syringes and drugs just waiting for you i case you need it7 dirty old arabic guys who are millionaires will sail in their own million dollar yacht strait into the canals of paris to just to buy girls for 100000 eu a pop because there is no risk doing so,reality

what can i say great movie one of the best i have seen for a long time probably at the same level of enjoyment with the bourne trilogy luc besson is one of my favorite action movie director and he knows how to keep you on your seat for the entire length of the movie neeson is playing one of his best action roles and the entire casting is there to support him to bad i didnt see it at the movies but even at the comfort of my own place on a dvd i was still glued to the screen imaculate storyline revenge is not a plate eaten cold but an action now and immediately the problem of watching such a good movie is that youll be judging everything else based on that and from the movies that ive watched lately i can assure you it will be some time until the next good one just great,reality
okay i put a 10 out of 10 as my rating more like a 95 out of 10 but whatever ive watched many many action movies and usually when i find one rated pg13 im always wishing it was r because of the material thats left out most of the time it feels pg13 and you cant believe anythings real in a feeling like that but this movie really pushed the boundaries of a pg13 rating with the violence and let me tell you im glad it did i know violence doesnt make a movie better but in this case it really adds to the intensity of liam neesons character which is dirty harry mixed with john mcclain and a little dash of jason statham in transporter mode its a very taut thriller with an interesting setting and story line filled with outlandish yet effective and very cool fightshootout sequences that only luc besson of the professional fame could bring to the screen i highly recommend this film to anyone wanting a good revenge thriller with an aging man who can still kick some serious butt,reality
written by luc besson whos responsible for just about every decent french action flick in the last decade and directed by pierre morel who also directed district 13 there was no real chance that wouldnt be a decent thriller its a lean mean movie pared down to the essential elements and while it would be wrong to go in thinking of this as an epic its very good for what it is is essentially a revenge film that never shies or veers away from the main narrative thrust which is that liam neeson must find his kidnapped daughter before shes sold by sex traffickersthe film is heavily influenced in both direction and style by the bourne movies which is no bad thing as those films are among my favourites theres a focus on realism throughout as well as a gritty edge that sees neeson taking no prisoners in his search for his missing girl neesons not everybodys first choice as an action hero but hes actually pretty good in the role  never for one moment do you not believe that hes capable of what he performs here hes one of the screens hardest good guys as of latei guess you might say the simple story is pretty predictable but the story is never the strong point in these films anyway criticism has been levelled against this movie claims of racism of it being another variant of the old americas good foreigners are bad xenophobia but these critics are looking too hard wants to be a straightforward action flick with plenty of thrills and spills and it achieves its aims admirably 2008 has been a pretty decent year for action flicks and this comes second to only rambo in terms of tension suspense and excitementthe action scenes are wellhandled in an overedited way similar to the ones youll find in bourne and bond these days neeson battles an absolute ton of bad guys in set pieces that happen so quickly theyre blinkandyoullmissem there are the requisite car chases shootouts and martial arts battles as well as explosions and torture it may not be art and it may not be original but i loved it anywaythe movie actually gets better and better as it progresses time is out to get to know the characters before plunging them into darkness and then the tension continues to ratchet up every few minutes until its at breaking point kudos to the filmmakers for not shying away from the violence which is strong throughout although the film never dwells on it a vein of black humour also helps immensely in this slickbutrough action gem,reality
was a riveting eyeopening film that i would recommend to a variety of viewers it had enough shootemup violence in it to appeal to most men and enough fatherdaughter love and an emotionally provoking subject to appeal to most women of course women can like action thrillers i know i do and men can appreciate emotional dramas but my point is the beauty of this movie is in the way it combines subgenres that are often unrelated the creators were genius in doing this and they were courageous in bringing to light the very touchy subject of human trafficking the directing and writing was impressive the story line and run time were perfect and the casting was spot on the writers and neeson very touchingly created a character that is both admirable and relatable excia agent bryan mills is driven by his love for his daughter and his willingness to do anything for her this love drives him to singlehandedly rescue his daughter after she is by sex traffickers during her trip to europe neeson beautifully portrayed mills tendency to range from rash to logical in such a situation neeson also very effectively communicated a fathers cold revenge and his willingness to eliminate anyone who stood in between him and his daughter overall neesons performance was absolutely stunningthankfully is a pretty accurate portrayal of trafficking it is set in europe where trafficking happens as often as it does in any other country on planet earth i appreciated that the creators chose a european country to combat the myth that trafficking only happens in thirdworld countries to impoverished young women overall the traffickers in this film are of all ethnicities which shows that pimps are not limited to being of a certain ethnic backgroundusually one whose men are considered to often objectify and dehumanize women however chose to use the kidnapping of two us teenagers as the traffickers method of capture which indirectly encourages another myth that the targeted group is middleupperclass attractive females in their late teens and that they are always kidnapped it is true that this scenario is not uncommon but unfortunately it doesnt do anything to educate the public in ways that they dont already knowwhen most people think of trafficking they think of the scenario that used rather than the fact that 50 of victims are boys the average age of girls is 12 years old and that most victims are coerced and from any ethnic or economical background rather than kidnapped the movie also includes an emphasis that the girls are put on drugs to keep them in their state though there is no mention of stockholm syndrome or other factors that force girls to stay mills daughter kim once found by her father willingly goes with him and runs to hug her stepfather when she gets off the plane back to los angeles the last five minutes of the film show her happy lively and confident sadly if kim was a real person she would probably be too druggedup to realize her father were rescuing her instead she would be in need of much therapy and healing in all areas of her life there is a contrast of vegasstyled prostitution trailer park trashy prostitution and streetwalking which informs viewers that trafficking happens in many places and involves many different types of people still is a very brave and quite effective portrayal of human trafficking fatherly love and family and criminal pursuit my hope is that this movie has and will continue to educate inspire and touch both men and women to take a stand against trafficking to love their families and to fight for what they know is right,reality

liam neeson is one of my all time favorite actors i have many of his movies i would like to have them all i even have krull which will be reviewed sometime in the futurethe actors in are some of my favorites as well famke jensen and maggie grace are just two of them i thought the acting by these two and neeson were phenomenal some of the best acting i have ever seenthe script was awesome the subject matter was pretty daring the action itself was great the only negative that i saw was when liam neeson was running but i cant fault him too much i dont run well either but enough of thati give 10 stars out of 10 from start to finish is just a great movieliking this movie as much as i did i have a hard time picking three of my favorites scenes but the three that pop into my mind right now are some of the best of the moviethe first scene is a difficult scene to watch its the scene where amanda katie cassidy and kim maggie grace are kidnapped from amandas cousins apartment in paris kim is talking on the phone with her father brian mills liam neeson she sees through a window that a couple of guys have grabbed amanda and she relays this to brian brian tells kim to go to the next room and hide under the bed brian talks to kim calmly and explains what is going to happen and what he wants her to do kim is but as she is being from the room she yells out things she sees when everything is quiet brian hears someone pick up the cell phone and hears breathing brian explains i dont know who you are i dont know what you want if you are looking for ransom i can tell you i dont have money but what i do have are very particular set of skills skills i have acquired over a very long career skills that make me a nightmare for people like you if you let my daughter go now thatll be the end of it i will not look for you i will not pursue you but if you dont i will look for i will find you and i will kill you the response is good luckwhat a great scene even if it was difficult to watchthe next scene i like is when brian finds out where the girls were to in order to get them hooked on drugs and turned into prostitutes he enters the house on the pretense that he is part of the local police force and he is now in charge of collecting the shakedown money for not putting a stop to illegal activities at the end of the conversation brian asks the five men in the room to translate a phrase he has on a piece of paper its in albanian the phrase is translated and said out loud by one of the men who says good luck at that moment brian realizes that that man was the one he talked to on the cell phone that his daughter had that is when he takes those five men out along with all the other members of the gang that are in the house unfortunately brian finds amanda in one of the upstairs rooms dead from an apparent drug overdose then he finds one of the men alive and tortures him by strapping him to a metal chair and hooking up what looks like jumper cables to the light switch and turns it on when brian gets the information he wants he turns the switch on and leaves it on walking out of the houseawesome sequence of scenes it shows that a father will do almost anything to find and protect his children that being said the sequence of scenes that lead to brian rescuing his daughter says that he will do everything possible to save kim that is an awesome sequencebrian finds out that his daughter is going to be sold because she is a virgin he finds out through a man he thought he was a friend that the man he needs is stclair and where to find him brian enters stclairs house and finds the auction rooms in the basement he gets one of the buys to buy his daughter in order to save her but brian gets captured and sentenced to death by stclair brian escapes and kills stclair he then follows after kim and her owners in order to rescue her he kills everyone on board the boat his daughter has been aboard when he finds kim she is being held at knife point by sheik raman nabil massad raman attempts to negotiate but brian is in no mood to negotiate so he puts a bullet through his foreheadthere are other scenes i could have talked about like when lenore famke jensen tries to browbeat brian into signing the permission form for kim to go to paris because she is under 18 or the scene when brian goes to his so called friend jeanclaude olivier rabourdin in paris by going to his apartment and shoots jeanclaudes wife in the arm or i could have described the scene where brian saves sheerah holly valance from some crazed fan who attempts to stab her after a concertluc besson and robert mark kamen wrote one hell of a great movie and director pierre morel did a phenomenal job creating one of my favorite movies,reality
this film was amazing liam neeson is as hard as nailshe kicked butt better than jason statham and bruce willis combined the story is pretty straight forward his daughter gets kidnapped and he has to go and save her yeah pretty easy to understand but the action within it is epic brutal and badassthis movie is definitely one of the best actionthrillers out there and i doubt it can be beaten by some of the greatest directors of all timeis one of those films that youll love to watch it is amazing1010,reality
this movie is an exciting ride from the moment bryans daughter kim is until the time he is reunited with her on the shahs boat bryan decides to take justice in and go around the system to get his kidnapped daughter back bryans character almost appears isolated because he really has no one to help him find his daughterthe way he wants to find her hes the only one who can find her although he is isolated by his method of justice he still manages to successfully find his daughter but not without significant casualties this is the one part that bothered me about the film there were many people injured and killed to find this mans daughter he felt like the sacrifice was worth it but was it were those individuals lives worth nothing i know that this is just a film but it did leave me with that question other than that i thoroughly enjoyed the film and it kept me entertained the whole time,reality
this is a very good actionthriller flick it currently holds a 79 rating at imdb which it certainly deserves the few people giving this a 1 or 2 star rating must be disgruntled french people who do not like to see the french government officials portrayed as corrupt bastards which they often are anywayi generally like liam neeson so the fact that he is in the movie kind of got the movie off to a good start already in this movie he plays a real bads ikicktheshtoutofanyonestandinginmyway former cia agent hunting down the despicable lowlife that kidnapped his daughter i really really liked the role he played in this movie he makes characters like bourne look like wussy even i was surprised when he actually shot the wife of the corrupt french government bastard to get him to talk that was just awesomethe movie is pretty much action all the way well it starts off laying the groundwork for the story and here liam neeson is indeed playing a fairly timid father that seems to be a bit out of his depth once he gets thrown into his right element he quickly casts of the sheeps fur and reveals the wolf sabretoothed underneaththis is really a textbook actionthriller movie a very enjoyable hour and a half indeed,reality
as it spawned a sequel as liam neeson helped to revive his career as he is now an action star who can really act he plays ex cia agent bryan mills as he wants to make up for the lost time he missed with his daughter on missionsplayed by a then 25year old maggie grace as her character kim was 17as kim lives with bryans ex wife and wealthy stepfather at first he is reluctant to have kim and her best friend go to europe on an u2 tour but only if she calls every hour or so does he reluctantly agreebut when she and her friend meets a stranger named peter who takes them to their hotel very little do they know that they will be kidnapped in a sex trafficking caseon the phone after kim and her friend are hence the title bryan decides to go to europe with the help of his ex and her new husband and his skills and that of his also friends that used to work in the cia to get kim and her friendreally very suspenseful and according to liam neeson the movie would had gone to dvd had it not gone into the theaters but it helped revive his career in the process,reality
i was extremely impressed i watched this for the first time a couple of weeks ago and stupidly after watching the 2nd of the films but it didnt ruin my experience im not an action fan but i have to say this movie really surprised me this is a really clever film bryan the main character is so clever he doesnt need all the gadgets and gizmos that bond and other action guys need to kill the bad guy he uses his brain and hes killing the bad guys for personal reasons rather than to save the country so this sets it apart from other films of this genre i was hooked from start to finish and i love that the film didnt feel long it flew bye i want it on dvd could watch it again and again it was excellent really well written and acted 1010 millions better than i ever ever expected it to be,reality
i have seen this movie like three times and i always think this is one of the best movies i have ever seenliam neeson is one of the best actors i have the change to seei like the way they handle all the action  the drama to find her missing daughter i recommend this movie to be watched and enjoy it because you wont be regreti love the part when is kim and liam said to the kidnappers i will find you and and i will kill you and they said good luck its so dramatic when kim see how her friend is kidnapped and she is so scared about what its coming to her in a few words you have to see it for your own,reality
what a rush this film is brilliant all the way through and you never get bored some scenes are really upsetting and disturbing it is possibly one of the most violent films ive seen the main plot was brilliant and different it had a very good and quite emotional last 5 minutes and it will leave you startled it is overall a brilliant film some elements are quite different to other films however as an action drama is worked very well im not always keen on drama action kind of films but this worked because it was also kind of a horror in some parts the sexual violence the prostitution and the main dialogue of that was sensational and also at times very upsetting just watch for yourself as this is a brilliant film dont be let down by negative reviews because it is one heck of a film,reality
liam neeson plays the lead role in this movie as a former cia operative who has to go back into action after his daughter gets abducted on a trip to parisin this movie liam neeson made himself into an action star with the best action movie since the bourne series ended there definitely needs to be some sequels made to continue on the brian mills character since theyre just starting to stratch the surface of this characterfrom going from one bad guy to another to get that much closer to finding his daughter in an unflinching manner is what makes this movie great,reality
i didnt have many expectations but the film was surprisingly good due mainly to liam neesons acting any other actor may not have brought the intelligence and ferocity of his character even though it was a short 93 minutes i thought emotionally it matched the movement of the plot of his character having only 96 hours to find his daughter sure there were lots of plot points where things just went his way and more things couldve been thrown in his way but either way i think i wouldve felt satisfied with the endingthis film is definitely luc bessons creation his sensibility is evident and reminisces of his other work transporter series kiss of the dragon the fifth element point of no return the professional etc well made movies with great movement economical with the acting and not saccharine,reality
dont waste your time on this 79 on imdb is a total joke the storyline is thinner than your average weekend movie liam neeson is acting is if he were clint eastwood that got stuck in a terrible script really this movie is really very very bad if you really want to waste some of your precious time on this be my guest but dont feel sorry after wards actually giving a movie a flat zero is not possible on imdb which is a shame this movie totally deserves it from the acting performances to the script the really funny thing is of course is that this joke of a movie got two sequels no less two yes two hollywood go home youre drunk,reality
2008 dir pierre morel  cast liam neeson maggie grace famke janssen katie cassidy xander berkeley standard revenge thriller regarding both the kidnapped daughter as well as the faceless villains that her spy father will take down starts out well with retired spy liam neeson discovering that her paris bound daughter has been kidnapped and he sets out to find her formula storytelling with mindless violence in toll directed by pierre morel with fine location work but that doesnt save this umpteenth death wish wannabe neeson holds his own as a father relying on his skill to find his daughter but it is his confidence in his ability that allow him to propel forward supporting cast is flat and might as well stayed home for all the good they are doing here maggie grace plays his daughter who gets to sit around and await her father to kick ass and rescue her famke janssen plays whining exwife whose thigh crushing villain in goldeneye would have came in awfully handy here katie cassidy plays daughters brain dead friend who is about as useless as a person can get without being considered mentally unstable xander berkeley also makes his presence known before realizing that this film is overrated and a career move for neeson only if anyone wishes to sit through a rerun of action clichs then this is your movie this is basically a lackluster revenge tale where the audience gets score 3   10,reality

ill start by saying that this is one of the best films that i have seen it is thoroughly enjoyable when it ended it was as if i had woken up time had just flown by and only the credits could bring me back to reality does the movie contain clichs yes does the movie have plot holes yes do either of those things matter not at allevery negative reviewer on this site is forgetting one thing this is an action movie it is not meant to say anything about other countries and their problems it is not supposed to show an in depth view of the sex trade and bryan is not in paris to save all of the girls who were none of the problems people are finding with the plot are significant enough for this movie to deserve a 1 star review is it possible for people to get offended by this movie and how it portrays europe and the middle east yes but it is possible in this globalized world for people to be offended by anything if they let it the people of the world are diverse and come from many different cultures and it is possible for anyone to take almost anything personalthere is no reason to get outraged by this it is a movie made for the purpose of keeping your eyes glued to the screen until the credits start rolling it is a movie made for suspense violence and revenge it was not made for indepth analysis by wouldbe professors of the internetall that must be asked of entertainment is that it serves its purpose this is quality entertainment because it manages to fit as many bad ass action filled and ruthlessly violent moments into the short 93 minutes it encompasses,reality
i have just watched this film on tv having made a point of missing it on the big screen  the awful trailer put me off it is one of the worst pretentious pieces of cinematic clap trap i have ever watched surely it is not trying to be a serious thriller the plot line is clichd and predictable the car chases likewise the dialogue excruciating it was like a third rate james bond film without the humour what ever was a well respected actor neilson doing getting involved in this crass feature does he really need the money it was as bad as the old rambo films from stallone but at least we got what we expected from them it seems that the film going public will watch anything today this idea had the potential to become a superb credible thriller but what did we get avoid,reality
in all the reviews i have read of this movie not one refers to its very clear and unmistakable debt to the searchers john fords much praised and sometimes justly maligned great western there is reference to commando and other movies all of which probably are similarly indebted to ford but has gone several steps further in an almost shot by shot recap of some of the scenes of the searchers granted there is no monument valley in the background but we have liam neeson grappling to have some sort of relationship with his daughter while at the same time trying to deal with his former wifes present husband this is a direct reflection of the more subtle relationship john wayne had with his brothers wife and his unstated but implied paternity of the girl kidnapped by the marauding indians the undercurrent of forced interracial sex in the searchers is reflected in the much more explicit sexual slavery of but the fathers desperate and unyielding search for his daughter is the same in both at the very end of where liam neesons character hands over his daughter to her mother and her mothers husband who then prepare to get in their car and driver away i expected neeson to cross his right hand over and grab his left elbow and then turn and walk off into the desert of his life that it didnt happen is a tribute to luc besson who probably thought he had pun intended the searchers theme about as far as it could go preferring instead to have a more hopeful ending the searchers continues to provide a basis for revenge and recovery stories probably because it was the first of its kind and dealt with basic themes of human connection sexual tension and ultimately the souldestroying poverty of being alone even after accomplishing a great rescue is just one more step in the long line of movies repeating these themes besson knew what he was doing and where he got his ideas im surprised no one else has worked it out as well,reality
i actually signed up to imdb after seeing this brutal film i turned to my companion at the end of this movie and said anyone associated with this movie should be removed from hollywood immediatelyrather than following the advice of the movie review in the new yorker i decided to favor the opinions of imdb and boy was i wrong the story is so contrived the acting so weak and the violence senseless that i would have figured that at least the majority of reviews would have reflected these sentimentsfurther to the violence liam neesons character was shockingly evil killing without remorse it was so violent that people actually let out sounds of shock during one killing what a waste of time and money,reality
you knowthose times when you are not ready for something and it kind of hits youlike a suckerpunch and you are like wtf well this movie was kinda similar to that but in a good almost awesome waymy friend lent me some of his newly purchased dvds so i could check out my new htsi started this flick and as one one of the imdb users has commented these were one of the fastest 93 minutes of my life sure it feels like commando 2008 without the muscles sure it isnt as good as the bourne moviessure it will anger people of some nationalities who will cry stereotype sure liam neesons accent breaks up sometimessure the plot sometimes may be unpalatable to somesure some will cry themselves hoarse about pg13 rating for a movie with torture scenes but the fact that the villains in the movie are human traffickers overwhelms the fact that these characters are peopleso to see their limbs beings broken their necks being snappedtheir faces being shot attheir appendages being impaled with nails and then tortured with electricityetc etc automatically becomes extremely enjoyable also the fact that the nearly sexagenarian mrliam neeson does all the asskicking in such an awesome manner it makes you wanna scream  that  up right there in the theater its like he looked at all the lameassed action roles that he had done so fardarkmanstar wars etc and thought the next time i get an action role im gonna rip that e up he is really effective for a vengeful character especially in a scene when he is talking over the phone with his daughter his rage seems to boil onto the screen so far the oldie action men had done only a vaguely satisfying in the past few years bruce willis stallone ford but liam blows them awaythe only few downers in this movie are the poorly directed gunfight scenes the contrived plot and some plot devices that seem unimportant or are left hanging like the popstar and the hair in the mirror fox seems to have dragged their feet over releasing this one but if you want to watch this excellent movie you should definitely not catch this one on 30th january,reality
excia operative bryan mills liam neeson lets his 17 year old virgin daughter kim maggie grace of lost fame travel to paris with her friend not knowing its to follow the band u2 when he gives his reluctant permission it seems that daddy does indeed know best as the girls are not in the city of lights too long before theyre abruptly abducted for nefarious purposes bryan is on the phone with kim at the time and upon hearing whats happening uses his cia training and prepares to go all jack bauer on their collective assesthe middle to late 2000s have been great for liam neeson with fantastic roles in batman begins seraphim falls and a memorable videogamed role in the superb fable 3 this film does nothing to change the mojo he currently possesses despite a slow start and a few action film clichs neeson is damn good in his role here and is quite the bad ass a lot of people were surprised im not one of those because i witnessed it in seraphim falls as well and he carries the movie himself as maggie grace just blew her role i cant even begin to tell you how famke janssen doesnt fare much better as bryans exwife yet both these parts were relatively small enough to casually dismiss this is liams movie through and throughmy grade b,reality

anyone here in the states if you need a break from the realities of a crashing stock market high unemployment or plunging housing prices then go see this movie it is absolutely a great escape for the 93 minutes that you will be enthralled in this movieimagine if you will any of the bourne movies and add in a the rampage of john creasy from man on fire and you will have exactly what this movie is an incredible blend that will keep you on the edge of your seat even though you know that within the next 2 or 3 minutes someone is about to be pushing up daisiesthis is truly a great movie and as soon as it shows up here in the theater come the end of the month ill gladly go and pay my money to watch this movietrust meyou wont be disappointed,reality
actually i never expected liam neeson to play the role of rambo but boy he is made for this stuff despite a clumsy start this flick turned into jamesbond from father of the bride within 15 minutes after that i lost track of time action was just too immersivebut director could have made it a bit more realistic instead of making liam neeson character a gunghoiwillkickyourballssuperspy some realism might have relieved mature moviegoers but thats just methis movie also touches a very sensitive issue of sexslave trade and a corrupt system which is facilitating all this but since girls dad was a bad ass superspy this issue was more or less sidelined which leaves some gaping holes in the storybut this movie is too good action flick to be missed do watch it ,reality
well what can i say i was recommended to watch this film and i wasnt let down what a great film im not really into the action type of films as they are all roughly the same storyline and the same outcome but i was pleasantly surprised with as it was not just your average action movie it was much more than that if you are looking to watch a great action film then look no further than it has everything you would want all thou the ending with the pop singer no one really cares about lol but i would definitely recommend this film its better than any of the transporters and to me its better than the bourne series give it a watch and you wont be let down,reality
i love to be surprised like this definitively a revelation real actors make the difference in any movie like liam neeson in hes really convincing and once an actor is making me believe the job is done great movie a must see in these days of teen stars and cgi superb acting by liam neeson scene after scene simply an acting lesson after another dont mind at all any unrealistic shot like i said hes making me believe it all the jobs done for me this movie reminds me of ronin fast good action and great acting youll be definitively entertained its really a joy to see directors and studios put effort in traditional filmmaking and remember that cgi is just another tool and not a purpose in itself,reality
i went into this film with low expectations after reading the review from empire it received a 1 star for all the wrong reasons in a nutshell it basically said that this film was nothing more than a bloodfest which believe me is quite far from the point of this movie the acting is fairly well done spy turned caring father is quite a hard role to fill the camera sound and lighting are also well done now despite what ive said of course there are flaws for example i think that the actionstoryline ratio was waving more in the favour of action the action was good but if you were to add more story it would make the film drag on quite a lot both story and action was good but i think morel may have focused more on the action rather than story all in all it was a rather good film underrated somewhat so dont listen to anyone bashing this movie,reality
is a brain blowing and breath taking movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat for two hours i is full of action adventure suspense and mystery the story is interesting and the plot about a former spy neeson relies on his old skills to save his estranged daughter grace who has been forced into the slave trade is convincing enough the cast is good liam neeson makes a powerful performance as a fatherformer spy who tries to saver his kidnapped daughter newcomer actress maggie grace was convincing enough and famke jansen as maggies mother was good in conclusion the movie is a good thriller with good rhythm that will keep you entertain,reality
excellent film the acting was superb i cant recall seeing any liam neeson movies but after watching his great performance in this film ill be sure to see any movies hes in in the future i found there to be one thing missing not sure if its a major thing neeson finds kims friend amanda dont want to spoil it and say where and how she was when he found her then obviously goes on to find his own daughter there was no curiosity out of kim at the end of the movie showing any interest of the whereabouts of her friend kim could have shown just a little interest but then again her life did just get saved from having to perform for money,reality
dont get in by sure its 79 on imdb and with liam neeson in it you may figure its going to be a cut above youd be wrong its the kind of film mel gibson would turn his nose up atfor a start its very broadly written neeson plays a dad estranged from his exwife  famke janssen who played a wonderful femme fetale in goldeneye all those years ago and is now content to play a desperate housewivesstyle mom the dialogue is all i really missed you dad i missed you too pumpkin rubbish exposition neeson meets his old mates they reminisce about how they went to beirut on a mission how he cried off with no warning to attend his daughters birthday clumsily signposting his past life as an action hero along with his dedication to his daughter though one also might also think this guy is pretty unreliable he might be a bit soft in the head to desert his matesand its that which kept me watching the thought there might be a subtext going on here that neeson might be a bit simple later neeson and his mates are security for a rock princess neeson asks her for career advice for his daughter just as shes about to sweep onto stage media types never like to dish out free advice to wannabe competitors at the best of times what kind of response is he likely to get he seems a bit retarded likewise his paranoid fears about his daughter going to paris but no were meant to admire himit gets worse and you begin to suspect its a metaphor for us foreign policy i can only imagine those giving this a high rating are americans loving the double whammy of the french and the arabs getting a kicking and incidentally you really dont get to see much of paris either if you were looking to rent it for that reason,reality
this movie is a bunch of clichs that is why i ticked the spoiler alert now there has to be at least ten lines in a review so i will develop on it divorced supercop saves childlike teen daughter from evil albanians in dark europe whereto the daughter left supported by the pathetic mother and her pathetic new husband who is pathetically rich five more lines to go sigh clich start he gave up his cia job to live closer to his daughter who lives in her new stepdads semicastle in california dad gives his daughter a cheap stereo the stepdad gives her a big horse the mother keeps the daughter away from dad evil and pathetic of course daughter goes to paris and gets abducted by albanians who pay off dirty parisian police  ie they are in cahoot dad goes after albanians and kill them all then kills the semihead of police and an arabian sheik and all his bodyguards dad takes the daughter home and introduces her to a rockstar so the daughter can also become a rockstart end of movie danielle steel probably inspired the script together with john woo,reality
i know i am going against the grain here since more reviews are very positive but saying that the plot if this movie is original is a stretch a daughter gets kidnapped and a superhero dad takes on the mafia  the corrupt foreign police department singlehandedly and against all odds and walks away with couple of minor scratches is hardly novel i always find it amusing that the mafia is able to penetrate a foreign country setup a lucrative illicit business and bribe all the right cops but cant deal with one over the hill superhero dont know if anybody else noticed this but all the action scenes were shot from close range which took away from the scenes there was a period of about 15 minutes when this movie became exciting and i thought ill get my moneys worth but it quickly unraveled and i was wondering where did it go wrong i would have liked this movie much more in my teenage years i guess i was expecting more from liam neeson,reality
i am serious here if you watch this film your precious time will be  you will have nothing but regretwhat made lian neeson join this project is money only nothing moreif you see the script of this film you will laugh its more ridiculous then a steven seagal moviei really like steven but he is making bad movies nowadays hope he brings something new but liam neeson is always my favorite ever since i saw him in batman begins 2005plus what is famke jansengoldeneye 1995 doing her shes is a fantastic actress now this bad film is added into her careerlook at the plot here its a good plot ruined by foolish elements thrown in the storyan ex cia guy goes to europe to save his beloved daughter she was kidnapped by some albanian thugsbrayanliam talks to kidnappers  speed jumps to paris like superman ok i get it its a movie but didnt we all see this type of films beforeclint eastwood made a film like that too i remember i wont compare this to other films because its a insultthe story was about the dude and his daughter so why the hell his wife and other guys are involved and where is the damn police in franceits a straight to dvd film gone theatrical id saythe cast is goodthe actions scenes are worse then wesley snipes movieif you like liam neeson and famke janseen then go ahead watch it otherwise stay awayits a bad film from start to end with a bad climaxmy rating is 110 one of the worst film of liam neeson so beware this film will cost you money and timeall nothing given,reality
the answer to this question depends on the level of political awareness and the political affiliation of the viewer if you are a neoconservative or if you dont care about politics then you might enjoy this film as a pretty good but not great action movie it is all there the fights car chases explosions the superhero etc but there is a difference between this movie and most other action movies at its core is not entertainment but a political message other action movies try to suspend reality and take the viewers mind away from the problems of the real world for a few hours the villains are interchangeable  someone has to be the villain after all  and events behavior and circumstances are so far removed from reality or the perception of reality that everyone knows that they are not meant to be authentichowever is like a recruitment video for the war on terror it reminded me of many propaganda films made during wwii to boost morale in which brave soldiers protect vulnerable nuns from the terrible enemy says dont believe the pacifistsappeasers in this case those who say that foreigners could be trusted and france is a civilized country it is ok to be paranoid and obsessed with security  nothing is more important  the foreigner is the enemy shed all moral inhibitions and be a killing machine torture is good dont think dont hesitate the world is out to get you,reality
i was really disappointed by this movie because of its very poor and simple story its not thrilling at all there is no time wasted introducing the characters it feels like you have 5 minutes time to see the museum of modern arts so this movie is basically a very brief introduction of dull characters with cheap  flat dialogs then lots of action by liam neeson followed by a brief and cheesy happy endthe good thing about this movie is the action part although its not particularly spectacular but liam neeson manages it very toughas the title of my review concludes the story only exists to give liam neeson a reason to get really mad at the bad guys in order to knock them out,reality
i checked imdb before getting me the bluray it said 79 wow so i was looking forward to watch a thrilling movie at home on a friday night but what did i get liam neeson recently made some poor decisions concerning the characters he represented on the screen i already thought he might be running out of money dumb stereotypes like the bitching exwife her new of course old and rich husband a retarded daughter of 17 who acts all the way like a 7 years old and the neeson character himself the excia torturer  killer but therefor ridiculously enough all loving and righteous are totally insulting each educated publics intelligence but even worse are all those cheap prejudices against people from the balkan states or arabia of course they are all criminals without exception and are invading countries that like to see themselves as the crown of civilization which is nothing less than sheer fascism following this perspective it is only logical and without a shadow of a doubt allowed to kill each and every of these parasites in the most violent ways which are all shown detailed to guarantee a most disgusting pleasure of course liam neeson being a deadly one man army with no scruples whatsoever kills an entire legion of these subhuman beings throughout the film which finally presents us the most predictable and sugarcoated happy end what have we been served a trigger happy superior white man who blows away all the low life crooks from evil countries where everybody has a darker skin and can never be anything nothing more than woman trafficking cockroaches that need to be squashed as they deserve it again this is only one thing fascism on screen quo vadis liam neeson,reality
have to say im personally surprised at the real high rating here for this one having read mainly positive reviews and noting some trust worthy comments from on line friends i certainly expected a far better picture than what i actually got one particular user on this site has called this film very original i just cant conspire to that at all its a tired old formula that merely adds a couple of new torture methods into the equation are people missing the fact that the whole picture is reliant on a ream of contrivances the kind that people scoff at when horror pictures not wanting to be serious get screamed down for there is also some pretty poor acting performances on show the usually reliable famke jansen looks lost when asked to show emotion maggie grace needs to go back to acting school whilst some of the french actors on show give french actors a bad namehowever the true saving grace in the movie outside of the afore mentioned slices of revenge fuelled torture sequences is liam neeson in the lead role of bryan mills charismatic and believable as a father hell bent on finding the one thing worthwhile that he has in his life its only here that luc besson  robert mark kamens uneven writing gets any sort of urgency to go with the tidily put together action sequences is an enjoyable film if within the context of its genre and for sure its subject matter of skin trafficking is a noteworthy plot but no one can surely deny it doesnt have a shallow core and honestly isnt giving anything new to a pretty stagnated formula 510,reality
this film is terrible is this seriously the best tripe that hollywood can create post bourne im sure bond is lying awake terrified of liam neesons american accent this is well up there with segal movies apart from under siege transporter and xxx somebody please create an action movie with realism plot and a character i actually care about because has about as much substance as lets saygreen streetcome on please your telling me anyone can listen to a man on the phone and triangulate the location of his village just from his accent because i sure couldnt tell where neesons accent was supposed to be from,reality
the seventeen yearold kim maggie grace is the pride and joy of her father the retired agent bryan mills liam neeson that left the secret service to stay near kim in california kim lives with her mother lenore famke janssen and her wealthy stepfather stuart xander berkeley after her birthday party she convinces the reluctant bryan to sign an authorization to travel to paris with her friend amanda katie cassidy when they arrive they share a cab with the stranger peter nicolas giraud and amanda tells to him that they are alone in paris when bryan succeeds in contacting his daughter she tells that criminals have just break in the apartment and bryan listens to the assault the girls are kidnapped by an albanese gang of human trafficking bryan promises in the phone to kill the kidnapper of his daughter and immediately travels to paris to find kim and chase the criminalsis the best action movie of the year and everything that i could expect from for example a 007 movie the plot is predictable and full of clichs of the genre with cars chase explosions and lots of shootouts but the story is highly entertaining and liam neeson is excellent in the role of a needy father and efficient agent i did not count how many bad guys bryan kills along the story but i hope to see this character back in the near future in another adventure my vote is eighttitle brazil busca implacvel implacable search,reality
a 79 stars rating on imdb are you fing kidding me thats higher than girl interrupted and vanilla sky though neither of those films have anything to do with but im just using them as an example of greatest movies ever was ok very enjoyable but non the less terribly and i mean terribly clichd and completely predictable from start to finish acting was horrible especially from famke janssen and the princess of clichs maggie grace wow that girl seriously cant act its impossible for her i think in every scene except the ones where shes druggedshes jumping around like a total moron to display a 17yearoldgirl type of behavior i guess in my opinion she fails miserably totally unconvincing liam was good as always though his lines were probably the most clichd thing about this whole movie now is not the time for dickmeasuring and other lines like that were justdumb now on the bright side there are some cool fast paced typical luc besson chasing and fighting sequences which were also clichd but still enjoyable my main point is people  stop overrating mediocre films period,reality
well it was quite fast moving and filled an hour and a half and i managed to watch it to the end so it cant be as bad as some ive seenbut a class film this was not  very predictable very clichd and no real suspense about what the final outcome would be totally implausible storyline had about as much tension as a cup of tea and none of the onedimensional characters were even remotely likable no not even the delectable liam neeson who came across as a bit of a bad ass wet fishi spent 399 on this dvd  199 would have been about right thats probably what someone will pay for it down the charity shop tomorrow,reality
liam neeson indeed does a lot for this movie not unusual role for him recall kingdom of heaven but perfect job the rest of movie unfortunately is satisfactory at best remember that we already have masterpiece with same plot and clichs  its man on fire and script of is just weak resemblance to this wonderful example of genre ok french director needed happyend  lets swallow happyend in french movie but another escapewhenyou arehangingonsteamtubeinhandcuffssurroundedbyguards is so nauseating beyond expression that i really felt sick drunk homeless imbecile would demonstrate more fantasy directing this movie than authors of such episodes anyway thanks again to neeson we have fairly solid piece of work which you can see 12 times and enjoy but some estrangement to forget about stupidity of plot really required for fastidious audience,reality
the plot to this movie is nicely set up its very predictable but that doesnt matter once the young woman is kidnapped and the terminator oops liam neeson gets involved it slowly descends into an atrocious succession of easy kills with the hero being shot at about 20000 times not a scratch of course and each of his shots taking someone out i thought this ended with bronson and death wish 56 i dont know how the government ever let this guy go he could wipe out a small country by himself then there is the physical toll dead people littering the streets and buildings there is no humanity to any of them many of the people neeson kills could well be just doing everyday jobs it seems a shame that so much money can be expended on stuff like this neeson is one of our best actors i hope he gets a few better offers,reality
this is a collection of clichs first with the archive film running in to daddys head then meet the angry exwife and rich step father that steal the daughter love the obvious kidnapping of the daughter in paris follows the reason sexual slavery market yes conducted by eastern europeans in this case albanians how convenient that daddy happens to be an ex government secret agent daddy flies to paris beats up a few thugs meets an old friend who converts into a new enemy daddy is like the bionic man because he runs faster than cars and can break pipes fixed to the ceiling and of course the final biding goes to the mean arabic sheik all villains get killed and the girl comes back home still a virgin i cant believe luc besson wrote that movie he used to have an edge this is pure crap i was bored all the way i guess i gave 3 for the poor editor that managed to keep the rhythm despite the overall ridiculous tone of the movie,reality
in liam neeson plays an overprotective father with a violent past whose paranoia is proved right when his daughter is snatched while on a trip to paris mere hours later he is on the ground in the french capital determined to find his daughter and punish those responsible what follows is a haphazard series of fights interrogations car chases more fights several smashed windpipes and an ending totally at odds with the film which preceded it the action should have been harsh and brutal and while it is sometimes effective it is crippled by being framed too close and by the pg13 rating who thought that a film dealing with violent revenge dozens of deaths torture and prostitution rings should be watched by people in their early teensis all the more disappointing given the talent behind the camera luc besson may not always come up with masterpieces when hes credited as a writer but he can usually be relied on to churn out something that is fast paced and fun unleashed the transporter etc likewise the director pierre morrell was last responsible for the ridiculous but exhilarating free running action of district 13 yet together they have managed to come up with one of the most underwhelming action films in recent memory as for neeson he handles the few emotional scenes with his usual impressive restraint and with his size and reach looks like he might actually pack quite a punch in real life but when the action pulls out a little and hes forced to run or throw himself through the air to avoid a hail of gunfire his 64 frame just looks unwieldy and slow  essentially a really big easy to hit target there are also endless moments where neeson suddenly appears behind another nondescript soontobecorpse which always made me wonder what magic massive closet he had found to hide himself in he is fine when hes hitting things and emoting but i think his career as an action star will be rather short lived i wanted to like it had potential as a gritty revenge film with the realistic action so popular since the advent of the bourne series neeson is always a likable lead and the besson pedigree with the french setting should have worked in its favour unfortunately the weakness of the story and random unmotivated nature of the violence is simply boring the potential wasted also shoots itself in the foot with its choice of subject matter by delving into the subject of kidnapping tourists for prostitution it appears as though initially morrell and besson have some moral lesson for their audience it soon becomes clear that they were merely looking for a backdrop for the action and the ugly stereotyping of the eastern european characters in the film is irresponsible even for a film of this type also for a film rated suitable for young people the lessons imparted by the hero are less than reassuring  if something bad happens to someone you love you really have no option but to kill dozens of people mercilessly until you reach some kind of resolution this is fundamentally at odds with the initial plot of the film as neeson is trying to leave his past behind in an attempt to reconnect with his teenaged daughter played with vapid gawkiness by maggie grace  proving her vacuous performance in lost was not an accident im not suggesting every film should have a blatant message of peace and love and theres no denying that nihilism can be cool but when it is to this level it has an effect on the overall coherence of the filmdisappointing and bland if this film was kidnapped in a foreign country id leave it there,reality
this movie has so many problems i dont even know where to begin the main character is supposed to be a hero when actually is the most corrupt and despicable person in the entire film his daughter is kidnapped so instead of going through the authorities he charges in ignoring any laws that get in his way and murdering people at will because he is supposed to be some kind of ex cia agent this is all glossed over as cool he also tortures someone to death with electricity basically the behavior portrayed in this film is exactly why the usa has lost almost all respect internationally they go out of their way to demonize eastern bloc immigrants as the ones responsible for human trafficking activities just to add in some xenophobia at the end of the film he saves his daughter but doesnt even bother to save any of the other of the women who were being sold dont waste your time on this film,reality
omg i am so sorry for the 90 minutes i wasted watching this horrible movie i read the plot i thought it might be good especially with liam neeson as leading characterwhen i first saw the 17 year old daughter running like a four year old and this keeps happening all along the movie i had my first doubts about the movie it keeps getting worsea father who happens to save the life of a famous singer who then offers to help his daughter become a singer too whata father who happens to be a kick ass former secret agent who runs around paris and kills everyone who was involved in the kidnapping of his daughter and her friend oh yes sureplus this poor girl is portrayed as an evil teenager who lied to everybody and so caused the kidnappingthe worst thing she dies  and the concerned dad of her friend just leaves her along with a bunch of other poor drugged raped girls but hey who cares they are not his daughters nobody mentions her again when the happy family is reunited at the end of the movie they are all laughing nothing about the poor girl and her family crapoh yes not to forget the french police let him leave the country without any problems after he killed a hell lot of people and shot an inspectors wife in the arm because her husband didnt want to cooperate which was totally according to local lawdont watch this movie unless you have some time to wastei really dont understand how anyone can give this movie more then maybe 3 stars as others said before me this movie is an example of horrible stereotypes poor liam neeson he lost some of my respect by taking a role in a movie this bad,reality
it would be easy to pick this movie apart and attack the clichs but thats the case with almost any film in the genre as a purely enjoyable ride it delivers nicelyi liked neeson in this role perhaps for the simple reason that he was an unlikely choice as for the rest the bad guys were really scummy and obvious the corrupt govt officials were even worsemovie makes no real commentary doesnt try to its a simple white hat vs black hats affair and on that level it works wonderfully the action scenes are well shot the locations are great oh and as a martial artist i must say that the fight scenes are surprisingly authenticits not going to win best movie but its a lot of fun,reality
to their credit the film makers dont disguise this film we know from this from the corniest least imaginative preview ever for a film with the hero taking the phone call and doing his right wing propaganda speech to his daughters kidnappersand make no mistake this is a right wing propaganda film for big business big brother big shots this isnt about a little guy fighting a system this is about dont mess with the big guy just like ransom the billionaires of this world need films like this to keep criminals from attacking the rich and films like this help ensure that criminals will continue to plague the poorvery predictable and about as self righteous as youd expect if youre a christian youll be turned off immediately since it extols the virtues of self righteous vengeance and mans lawstandard ho hum action scenes and comically laughable situations even a 5 year old kid would find this stupid210 which is very generous i admit,reality
this is a decent action flick that suffers from a few flaws first it is completely predictable  there is never any suspense about how its going to end or where the plot is going to go the plot in a nutshell is this exspecial forces type retires to lead a peaceful life then bad guys take his kid and he reverts to his onemanarmy previous life and pretty much kills everyone in his path to get his kid backwhich of course he doesthe fact that the action is absurd is ok since this is escapist fare  things like when bad guys shoot at the hero with machine guns they always miss but when the hero shoots back with one shot at a time he manages to kill everyone this i can stomach but the already thin pretense for why the hero starts killing everyone in the first place is really absurd what is it spoiler alert bad east european immigrants running a sex trade decide the best place to get new flesh is by capturing rich tourists in paris of all places apparently routinely kidnapping kids of rich and connected people  turning them into dopedup whores is the path of least resistancea lot of people compare this movie to the bourne series in terms of style i suppose theres some overlap but really the bourne movies are far more entertaining and have a more clever plot this movie is just entertaining nonsense,reality
wow talking about nonstop action this was the movie of the year to me as soon as it came out in theaters i knew i had to go see it as soon as possible just watching the previews over and over again made me want to watch it even more the plot and theme and storyline of the movie were fantastic i dont think that luc could of made this movie any better than it already is the whole entire cast played their roles perfect it didnt seem fake it seemed so reali can watch everyday if i didnt have a life but unfortunately i doi felt that when kim got kidnapped it was a slap in the face for her lenore lam tried to tell her but she wanted everything her way even though the movie was only 93 minutes long it didnt feel like it maybe because i was too into it one thing that i didnt like in the movie was famkes role i thought she was a irresponsible parent and way too selfish and bitter for no reason other than that i would totally recommend anyone to watch this movie its completely worth it i rate it a perfect ten,reality
i havent seen such a film at this scale in decades an adrenaline rush and such intensity at the max level such genius plot and action so you forget about time and space this is one of the movies that i will remember for years to come this movie deals with a very important issue of human trafficking  that is a real life problem on global scale also that values in life such as love is more important than money and the real truth in that also revealing the fact that karma is that simple nothing goes unpaid in this life think for a moment next time you consider a visit of a call girl it is you and i that can stop human trafficking by saying no as the last bricks think twice,reality
i saw this film at my friends homei didnt expect it to be a great start and i watched it as though expecting same ordinary dialogue and movie makingbut i was completely outthe scene where his daughter is kidnapped and he is talking to the kidnapper still makes my skin crawl and all the hairs to stand upthe facial reactions when he hears good luck through the phone is one of the most perfect timing by liam neelsonhe has made this film an incredible experience by portraying the fatthers desperate moments also hats of to the director and screenplay writeraltogether took out my breath and i still ask people to watch this movie,reality
in an age of wacky bullsht theres something reassuringly bad ass about the simple pleasures of a fathers wrath and a few deep chops to the throatso without any more introduction let us discuss despite all of the bruteforce action that this particular film offers it also offers us a rather surprisingly solid emotional core detailing a rather simple story line a father  liam neeson  who also happens to be a former cia agent who will stop at nothing and nobody to get back his daughter  maggie grace who has been kidnapped by a group of albanian sexslavers oh yeah and did i mention he pretty much singlehandily invades the country of france well there you gothe other pleasure of is seeing neeson bringing the noise and the bodies as the action hero though hes getting up there neeson is still a true physical presence the highlights of the film for me are simply seeing the dude use the skills that he has immersed over the decades on the eurotrash pieces of sht everyone is going to bring up the action sequences or the scene where he shoots his friends wife and then calls it a fleshwound and yet the scene that i loved the most is the one where neesons character goes to the temp agency and ends up hiring a translator,reality
if there is one actionthriller that is under the definition of underrated actionthrillers this is one that is certain to top the list liam neeson stars as bryan mills an excia paramilitary operative who has to track down a group of slave traders who take his daughter kimmaggie grace i wont give away too many details but i will say it is a strong film that blends action suspense and drama in a nicely concocted cocktail the support cast such as famke janssen xander berkeley katie cassidy and maggie grace all played their parts well the film was directed and written well and its a throwback to films like the bourne movies and the bond movies,reality
wow this is by far one of the greatest action flicks ever made it manages to be linear without being clich or predictable its actionfilled without being too gory or hard to follow it deals with very adult subject matter but is handled maturely and without being unnecessarily lascivious or distasteful the plot is thick and wonderfully progressive and doesnt rely on silly gimmicks to keep you interested morel really outdid himself on this one two thumbs up no way i threw my arms up in a v and cheered literally after batman begins who would have thought that liam neeson would get even better if you havent seen make it the next one one your list you will not be disappointed,reality
in a world of james bonds jason bournes and frank martins its hard for a little random exspy named brian mills to get some love on the surface his film seems a little formulaic and he seems a littlewellold however once we get into millss story and see how infinitely badass the wonderful liam neeson plays him youll probably be saying something along the lines of james who which follows mills as he pursues those responsible for kidnapping his daughter is a heart pounding thriller with a stupendous display of badassery from liam neeson it may have a plot thats sort of unbelievable but its one of the best action thrillers in yearswhy do critics dislike this movie is it because they have no ability to see beyond the obviously farfetched events of the movie is it because they take themselves too seriously and dont know how to have fun its probably both of those two reasons but i find peace in thinking that theyre complete idiots who dont know what theyre talking aboutsometimes the fact remains that is plain fun popcorn entertainment that doesnt resort to cheap explosions in looking for thrills it relies on the gritty closeups of the marvelous hand to hand combat and stylistic action liam neesons batman begins training certainly paid off herethe film is the brainchild of luc besson the mind behind the transporter films here he relies on a director that may be inexperienced as a director but one who also has more experience in shooting action on film than most pierre morel responsible for the photography in action films such as war unleashed and of course the transporter does a great job in choreographing some very good action sequences especially giving them some flavor when they end the film was not just pure action which was good as it also showed neesons character working as a spy and shows some intelligence in that aspectspeaking of neeson it appears that his days as the kind hearted mentor figure in films such as narnia and star wars are behind him his ruthless badass and perfectly natural performance makes the movie watchable and carries it from start to finish which isnt too long as the film clocks in at one hour and 45 minutes including previews neeson is a veteran and it really shows his performance goes deep and will excite the viewer in all ways maggie grace was also noteworthy as his daughter it was tough to recognize her without her blonde hairthis is probably the best example ive seen in awhile of how stupid and selfrighteous most film critics can be they fault for having events occur that arent entirely realistic do they recognize the film for being a great roller coaster ride that will leave most viewers happy pretty much my entire theater of 150 people seemed happy no its further proof that liam neeson is one of the best leading men around and that these critics really need to catch up with the times,reality
i saw this movie yesterday an i must say it is absolutely awful the story does not contain any surprises whatsoever the girl is kidnapped within 3 minutes of her arrival and her dad finds the one who did it within 3 minutes to followafter that he just goes ahead and kills pretty much everyone who he thinks is involved he never gets into troubleand then they go homeamazing how they let him fly home after he just shot the inspectors wife in her arm because the inspector refuses to cooperate and the fact that his daughters friend is dead doesnt seem to bother them either as long as his daughter is safe fantastic story too bad it was liam neeson who played this role it should have been steven seagal in stead,reality
there are so many things wrong with this movie on so many levels its hard to decide where to begin i watched it in its entirety only because of the car wreck mentality its terrible to see but you cant look away due to perverse curiosity so i kept wondering how much worse this movie could become i was dumbfounded to find average to good external reviews some perplexing plot holes are the bad guys grab the two screaming teenagers from the paris apt but evidently have the presence of mind to lock the doors behind them bryan had to break a window to get in also if bryan were desperate to find his daughter why not just kick in the front door aside from all the absurd fight and shootout scenes he dispatches 37 bad guys in total the ending had to be the lamest part of the flick the scene where he and his recently abducted drugged and traumatized daughter exit the airport she does the goofy teenage girl run to mommy with a big goofy grin on her face like she actually saw the whole u2 tour instead of barely escaping with her life lame so lame,reality
this film would have done much better just after 911 up until about 2003 when there was no shortage of scared americans running around that and freedom friesnow its reduced to pretty much what it is a tired succession of clichs you expect from a network tv movie of the week in addition its simply stupid they could have called it road rage fathers wet dream at least then it could have qualified as intelligent satireif you were to reverse this and a european country were to make a film about a european spys daughter coming to america to be kidnapped drugged and sold as a whore there would probably be national outrage and boycottsas for the acting liam carries the film but even he cant make up for silly situations and otherwise poor acting,reality
this is not the first time the imdb rating in no way represents the quality of the movie i really have doubts that so many people are that dumb so i guess the rating is manipulated the story well never seen so many clichs at one time after the first 15 minutes it gets ridiculous and every new scene enforces the feeling that the producers tried to make a persiflage of the understanding of life of many us peoples or imdb raters  this cant be serious is the mantra of that movie so if you want to know how bad old europe is and how good nice and brave the americans then go on and watch it if you dont regret it keep on rating 10,reality
doesnt claim to be anything more than it is  a kidnap thriller with a revengefueled father who has more than a few tricks up his sleeve maybe thats its saving grace if it had tried to suggest it was pushing any envelopes then anyone whod seen any 007 film or watched 24 would objectliam neeson does do a fantastic job in the role of superdad and the first moments when the tension kicks in are memorable  if a little clichd the action is fairly solid though no wow moment that sets it apart like the bourne identity the scenes are cut quickly so its often hard to tell whos hitting who and how hard the plot is mildly engaging but formulaic even the resourcefulness of neesons character is nothing more impressive than later seasons of 24all in all i felt a bit robbed coming out of it  its a big pile of soso having said that if you just want a mindless thriller for a first date and it doesnt matter if its particularly memorable you could go far worse,reality
the problem with this movie is singular an action movie needs to have good action sequences but the action sequences in this movie are dreadful it is difficult to say whether the directing is to blame because whatever may have been in the raw footage was chopped up like cole slaw by the time it reached the theater if you have ever seen a bad action film where the action is filmed too closely such that all you see are arms and legs flying across the screen and where the camera cuts are fast and quick to simulate real action then you know what this movie is in essence throughout the movie almost from start to finish the character played by liam neeson is involved in physical handtohand combat but you dont every actually see any of it i would estimate that during these sequences the average amount of time that any one camera angle remains in place is less than a full second chop chop chop these fools evidently believe that they can have the actors do everything in slow motion and then during the editing chop it all up in a way that makes it seem like real action well it just doesnt work this very trick in fact is the signature of a cheaply made action movie if a movie such as this does not have good action what else does it have in this case not much neeson never really shows much emotion and that makes it difficult to identify with him as he tries to rescue his daughter there isnt really anything that convinces us that he really cares about her other than the fact that he goes to save her even when she is first he does not show anger this was probably intentional but it was a bad decision because he comes across like a stick of wood come to think of it i dont recall neeson every showing emotion in any movie and on that basis i would have to say that he is not a good actor they could make a mask of him and let another actor wear it and then dub in his voice later and the effect would be much the same as for the story the movie that i was most reminded of as i sat there and waited for it to end was a charles bronson movie made in the late eighties titled kinjite forbidden subjectsbottom line an action movie needs to have good action sequences and the action sequences in this movie are very badly done you cannot get good action sequences by filming actors while they perform choreography in slow motion and then chop up the film later to hide the fact that they were in fact performing choreography in slow motion it just doesnt work this is a cheaply made inferior action movie,reality
bryan mills liam neeson has retired from his job and is trying to reconnect with his daughter kim maggie grace he is divorced from her mother lenore famke janssen and has basically been a ghost to her while she is growing up kim gets the chance to go to stay in paris for a few weeks with a friend but needs parental permission before leaving bryan reluctantly signs off but under many strict conditions including calling him when they arrive he finally gets a hold of her only to listen to her being kidnapped he vows to find her and use all of his skills to do itit may not sound like much but the trailer for looked interesting and sounded even better but after seeing this all occur in the first twenty minutes it leaves a lot to be desired for the next hourthe film action movie or not has virtually zero character development in my brief description i basically give away everything you learn about bryan and kim sure there is a throwaway bit about kims intentions in europe which are completely unrealistic in 2009 and vague proddings at what bryan used to do we obviously have an idea of the type of work he was in from the way he moves and these skills he speaks of early on but never anything that really furthers our knowledge of him it works in the way of him being a bit of an enigma to the audience and really surprising everyone with what he can do but it makes the film that much less believablethe story itself looks like it was just culled together from halfhearted movies previous and any form of surreal overly choreographed action genre picture from the last ten years no the matrix does not take a ripping here but anything featuring jet li jason statham and the like does hell i have not even seen banlieue 13 or district 13 as we better know it in north america and i know this movie is stealing from it even throws in some torture scenes just to leave no post911 stone untouched have action films gotten so stale that you can easily tell which pieces of other films got thrown into a blender to create this one is it really that hard to create something as unique or at least vaguely different like wanted iron man or even the dark knight even no country for old men has more interesting action scenes it just feels like we have seen it all before but the film tries to make it feel more original by throwing neeson an actor who has done such varied work in his career into the mixthe editing in a sense makes and breaks the film on one hand the film is never boring it moves at such a rapid rate that you may find standing up to leave even faster than you sat down sure the film adds in an entirely unneeded subplot about a popular singer holly valance and completely does away with kims friend amanda katie cassidey all too easily but the shell of a onedimensional point a to point b film that is left over is quite easy to just sit through without drifting off the film moves at such a hyperkinetic pace that it will leave you virtually no time to breathe or take anything in if you can even manage to see the majority of the action scenes as it is and with such a shoddily written plot that may work out in the filmmakers favouri think what it comes down to is that i just expect more from luc besson since the messenger the story of joan of arc he has done very little directing and has spent more time writing and looking at his writing credits it is easy to see where a lot of films since have gotten their sense of action but besson is stronger than that look no further than the fifth element nikita la femme nikita or one of my own favourite action movies lon the professional the man is a visualist who i imagine can write almost as well as he can direct thinking this why has fallen so far from these other three films yes element and nikita are nowhere near the brilliance of lon but they had a very genuine feel and style missing from almost every film besson has written since with exceptions to the heavily underrated danny the dog unleashed and even to a small point the transporter has he really lost the touch after so short a period of time neeson does what he can with what he is given read not much for such a vastly underdeveloped character he makes him work and feel human we feel his pain as he struggles to find his daughter and we can see the remote expressions he gives suggesting what this guy must have gone through in all his years it is his most subtle performance in years and he deserves credit for breathing such life into the character the movie rests on his shoulders and never once does he take it for granted i only wish he could have picked something better to act in the man is not going anywhere near an oscar with movies like thisthe supporting cast does what is needed and nothing more unfortunately again chalk it up to the film being an action moviei was vaguely intrigued by and if you do not expect much you will not be disappointed it has some nice action scenes and neeson makes you believe in his character if you go in looking for any brain or substance though you should keep on looking maybe rent lon instead410,reality
that film was obviously sponsored by the americans stay at home for your vacations league can you not come up with something more interesting than thatapparently my review is too short if i just leave it like that so what can i addstereotyped one dimensional implausible unbelievable poorly acted arty farty scenes stuck in to give it some sort of virtue that dont work plot holes like pot holes and a weirdo teenage actress to bootwhen the door opened at the end i wanted a big set albanian to blow the heros head off but hell no  this is hollywood for goodness sake,reality
this movie is a standard action movie until the very end it is mostly excitingfrom here on spoiler exists in order to explain the awful scorebut during his pursuit of his daughter he never stops to think about other unfortunate women captured by bad guys i waited until the end hey maybe they will tie that loose inhumane end i dunno with a newspaper headline or a tv news title or something but no besides of nothing happening they tie the loose end of a questionable singing career which was long forgotten and would not be missed at all this movie portraits a brave capable exagent who goes hunting bad guys who will harm his daughter saving other women is not even a side quest here by using such a grave theme in such a popcorn way this movie minimizes the problem of human trafficking and makes it look like the victims of it are expendable after all if they are not daughters of a dangerous and determined american agent,reality
they took his daughter he killed them all not one by one but all of them and at the same time hat pretty much sums up the film you can watch him escaping and killing bad guys for several minutes and yessome scenes can get you a bit excited since there are chasing and car chasing scenes shooting scenes all of hollywoods supershow but believe me youll know exactly how this will end there will not be even one slight surpriseliam neeson is as alwayscool and charming and gorgeous and hot but you can watch schindlers list instead again its your choice your time to waste your own way,reality
had the potential to be a really great action movie the premise really intrigued me as i love movies about revenge and retaliation people recalling on forgotten skills thank you sayid jarrah and movies starring tall british men what i liked was that liam neeson despite his gangly running was believable as a man capable of all the drastic measures we were witnessing i also liked that there were some truly unexpected instances of brutality an unwieldable tunnel vision is the only thing that is believable and acceptable when somebody is fighting for the life of their childbut man did i have some problems the first was in regards to the female characters now before certain male compadres try to tell me that im being a whiny feminist they should know that im relatively traditional myself and actually enjoy certain traditional malefemale roles and customs i will always appreciate a door opened an arm given or a jacket offered however the first thing that i did when i got home was to check and see if the writers of this were malethey wereit would be wrong of you to assume that i think that every male writer doesnt understand women and are all stuck in a medieval outlook on our gender as a whole but the three women in the film were exactly as follows1 the crone exwife 2 the tramp friend blond of course who causes all the trouble 3 the madonna daughter whose virginity is at stake as each minute passes byi know it happens and its part of the dna of many many action movies but im sorry one of these days well have to get past this if james bond is capable of evolving from onedimensional females anybody isthe dialog itself was pretty weak for example the daughter finally asks her father specifically what his job was im a preventer he says what do you prevent she asks wideeyed bad things from happening there was also a bbq with some old blackop buddies that was good for nothing else but disposing of expository information the best part of the film is a pretty decent speech delivered by a good actor which was done ten times better by mel gibson in ransom that everybody has already seen in the preview things go his way through 999 of the film pipes break at an opportune time mud splashes in an opportune place a reflection appears at an opportune angle i was starting to believe that neesons character was just incredibly lucky rather than exceptionally skilled especially since out of the ninety albanians he took out none of them even with machine guns could hit water if they fell out of a boattheres always an unspoken request for a suspension of belief when dealing with an action heros unbelievable luck if a movie is done well its something i will do gladly i just couldnt do it this time not with jason bourne still on the looseps over the years i have learned that there are certain times where i can tell that nobody wants to hear my honest opinion unless im about to agree with them tonight i sensed that this would be one of those times so when my male companions asked if i liked it i safely respond with my default answer i was entertained,reality
this movie is not completely perfect to rate it 1010 but i did rate it 1010 because i enjoyed every minute of it i watched this movie 2 times on my computer and tomorrow i am going to the cinema to watch it again many ppl comment on the movies weak plot its a movie and movie is all about entertaining anyway why being so strict and picking up on every mistake of it liam neeson is great as always theres no single second that i cant feel his pain when looking at him he let us feel the fear of losing the hidden pain when his daughter was away the relief when he realized his daughter was still safe well i am not sure i dont biased when commenting abt his performance since hes my fav actor and i always love his actingand therere some unspeakable reasons for me to love this movie so much i wish my father was bryan     the daughter in the movie dont know how to treasure her good father it made me mad hummmmm ,reality
excellent entertainment and an emotional relief despite the fact that practically all the elements are the recycled moves and takes from bond and bourne movies the difference is that love for a daughter  so genuinely performed by neeson and stagededited by morel and his crew  makes the watching experience so griping and charged although the supermans abilities are pretty unbelievable not unlike in the mentioned above other ones  you watch it with absorption and participation that makes you almost jittery with excitement and suspense thats another paradox  in a predictable in practically all the aspects film  suspense what a miracle creativity presents the other somewhat subtler line is relationship between brian and lenore charged with anger and regret  and back to anger his work vs his family life his regret and guilt for not being there for his wife and daughter as trivial as it might be  the line has been literally in the thousands of films  it creates the charge that propels the story development into a paradox of cookiecutter elements composing a quite uniquely emotional thriller,reality
while theres a select few moments that will earn a couple points just does not do enough to separate itself from the packbryan millis is a cia man kind of hes retired he regrets missing his daughter grow up rather he was fulfilling his past obligations and duties of working for his country now that hes retired cooking steaks and drinking beers with his buddies the biggest goal in his life is to reestablish and reconnect with his recently turned 17 year old daughterwhen bryan agrees with his exwife and makes a torturous decision to allow his daughter and her friend to travel across the globe alone to check out the museums in paris when she arrives if you did not already know by the title shes kidnapped pulled into the underground world of trafficking women slavery and prostitutionthis is where it turns into your typical story of  guy gets pied off uses all the tricks in the book and proceeds to take out incalculable amounts of protected and powerful people by himself he can do anything even obtain a full medical kit in just a cut of a scene then everything he was after is saved hes the hero and everyone forgets how he was the hole just an hour and a half agoas the writing behind the project showed a select few believable occurrences and original concepts the torture method the cab driver and the result of peter they were foreshadowed by lines of weak dialog and clich filled action and characters unnecessary flashbacks which where implemented to create added suspense in the audience did the complete opposite reshowing us action that just occurred does nothing but dim the suspense by showcasing more detail and its a way for the director and postproduction crew to attempt the overplayed flashback filled with bright lights and quick cuts that remind of pop music videos  developed for those in the crowd with attention disordersbut kudos to the director pierre morel for showcasing a variety of handheld action and fight sequences that were presented nearly perfect it was the highlight of direction and cinematography in this film but really the only plusthe sound  below average throwing in overthetop sound effects to compliment and better showcase the action just doesnt work yes liam nesson is a bad a but the sound of his punches should not replicate and make me think hulk smash this movie is one of the better flicks youll see during these months of the year its for the most part enjoyable if your an action buff like to see a one guy kick a and dont want to spend a lot of time asking logical questions  you will like it if your a kidnapper this will make you rethink and perhaps show you to better prepare for who you captureskip it wait for the rental c,reality
its been quite a while since ive seen such a god awful movie this movie jumps from clich to clich albanian mafia american lone hero to the rescue lecherous arabian sheiks  the list is endless after reading the title of the movie went to see this in a sneak preview and seeing the first 15 minutes of the movie you basically know from minute to minute how its going to play out absolutely no surprises anywhere the script must have been written in an hour i found it very very hard to feel any sympathy for any of the main characters its a shame to see liam neeson a fine actor in my opinion in such a horrible movie,reality
just got back from the theater caught a 5 1000 am cheapie  amc and thought this was a good movie with a good plot and action sequences albeit typical shoot em up how the hell did liam neeson not just get killed fashionliam neeson is a retired cia spook whose daughter lives with his exwife and her current husband who apparently is very very rich the movie begins with liam attending his daughters birthday party at her home which looks a lot like the villa borghese the daughter goes to paris with a friend and is kidnapped by some albanian mafia types to be sold into a prostitution ring the rest of the movie is liam opening up several jars of whoopass on the bad guys it was lucky for liam that the albanians were terrible shots they couldnt hit water if they fell off a boat i had fun and so will anyone who enjoys these types of action movies liam neeson was pretty much the movie everyone else were villains straight out of central casting judging from their ineptness they were graduates of dr evils henchman academygiven what else is currently playing this is definitely worth checking out,reality
for the first fifteen minutes or so you are convinced that is just going to be another runofthemill action movie albeit with a strange choice of action hero we meet bryan liam neeson who seems quite ordinary as he attempts to hold onto his relationship with the daughter maggie grace who lives with his exwife he takes a brief job as a bodyguard and we see a glimpse of something extraordinary about bryan when the girl he is protecting is attacked so far though the movie is pretty averagebut then his daughter is kidnapped in paris and thats when the entire movie moves up about five gearsalthough there are certain plot holes in the story if youre looking for something to satisfy your craving for action in the style of the bourne movies then youre going to forgive those and go along for the ride and what a ride it is once bryan arrives in paris the concerned father persona gives way to another a terrifying whirlwind of fury which will do anything to get back what was from him legs are broken faces destroyed rounds of gunfire are emptied into fleeing men and torture is employed if you thought a 56 year old liam neeson would be slower and less impressive than a 32 year old matt damon youd be dead wrongonce the main storyline of began i found my eyes glued to the screen you see neeson does two things here  firstly he completely sells the audience the fact that he is a father who will go to any lengths to get his daughter back alive you see the concern in his eyes when he learns who has her and you see the absolute unconditional love he has for her secondly he convinces you that he really does possess the particular set of skills he warns one of the kidnappers about youve seen neeson in many movies but youve never quite seen him like this the scene where he takes out an entire den of kidnappers at high speed by stabbing and shooting people before they barely have a chance to react is a particular highlightin summary is one of the best action movies of 2008 give it a chance and i think youll be pleasantly surprised at just how enjoyable it is,reality
with luc besson and liam neeson names involved i was excited to see how this would play out i was wildy disappointed the film took a predictable path and even though it was short i found myself wishing it would be over sooner from half way through i knew where it was going and there would be no pleasant plot surprisesneeson gives a decent performance with what he had to work with and is at times almost believable as an ex secret service worker its all ruined by his pitiful american accentthis movie does not draw empathy from the viewer and i cant see how anybody would care what the outcome is unless you have an unlimited movie pass  dont bother,reality
i just cant believe this rotten egg has gotten so many positive reviews it really is total rubbish you have to be quite numb to enjoy this nonsense realism here goes random guys can easily enter a megastars concert despite tight security and never mind motivation after all all it takes in the us is for the viewer to be a garden variety paranoid ignoramus to put a knife in some bimbo singer ask britneyprobably happens all the time later some bad guys can just walk into an apartment to kidnap some girls superhero neeson on the other hand has to enter one level below then has to climb to get to the apartment break window etc well i guess the director wants us to know hes a bit spiderman too or did he forget his lockpicking gear at home then when he gets the spotter at the airport killed he doesnt go for his phone which would lead him to the bad guys i should presume no lets do it the hard way so that we can show you hes proficient in operating a number of gadgets etc constructionworkers line up to pay for sex with drugged and kidnapped girls and nobody on site finds anything wrong with it quite everyday stuff in western europe right and the french interior ministry being in cahoots with the naughty albanians behind it all when neeson negotiate the ministrys end he gets his 20 from a little box all in all some few thousands of euros hello and wheres the police involvement on both sides of the atlantic to top it off neesons characters relationship with his daughter is bordering on the incestuous jesus you yanks have gotten so paranoid and ignorant its unbearable dont watch this pathetic excuse for a thriller youll catch something nasty,reality
well with so many good opinions about the movie and a good rate about 78 i think at first i was thinking that i have seen a different movie from the other people in the forum what i saw was a very mediocre one it was fast and actionorientated but nothing to think about 10 minutes after the end there was nothing left in my memory only unnecessary violence many slightly formulated racist references the bad people albanian and arabs mostly kidnapping the innocent virgin damsel what a crappy story improbable and unlikely to be true really why a gang of pimps have to kidnap a probably wealthy pair of girls to make them prostitutes they will probably bring troubles to them as they did so many dames as it happens in reality can be exploited from the poor countries in europe and they chose the american virgin what a crap i think that its shame to a great actor like liam neeson and a great director like luc besson to make movies like this one,reality
im astonished that anyone has found anything of value in this shootemup stinker just of few of the many idiocies strung together to form a plot ingrid the swedish supermodel steps out of the airport and agrees to get into a car with a short french guy named peter sure why not an american cia vet who can barely manage a merci beaucoup passes himself off as a member of french internal security puhleese the crooked french agent thinks he can persuade bryan to forget about his daughter and go back home with the promise of a first class plane ticket window seat daughter kim returns home to la looking like gidget who has maybe lost her cell phone on summer vacation despite the fact that she has just been abducted drugged imprisoned abused sold and come within millimeters of having her throat cut by the sheik of araby aieee the interesting question is why a film with these or any other qualities resonates so well with the public at any given moment,reality
this film is just awful i cant understand why directors keep recycling this disney idea that all husbands who get dumped for a richer man like to hang around and watch as their kid grows up famke janssen cant play anything but gold digger sharon stone types and plays the part of the snide ex wife most excellently liam was his usual self somewhat unrealistic role in an unrealistic film based on divorce lies ignorance and snide remarks about the past maggie grace simply in her element in this film while her acting was credible and realistic she just cant play any other role than the spoiled little ignorant brat but it suited this shallow film perfectly directorswriters often reach for the divorce plot in a sad means to add depth and meaning to each character in the film but all they do is recycle the mrs doubtfire theme oh look in this one mommy taught daughter how to lie with a smile right in her ex dads face how sweetplot add an ageing low budget actor to play daddy add spoiled clueless two faced child  children add gold digger wife full of smarmy snide comments get ex daddy to run about doing crazy unrealistic stuff for his ex family make the ex wife ignore it all and end the film without so much as a thank you oh and make sure wife gets last word in filmi saw this plot already 50 times and the actors seemed to be playing characters from other films  shows hence its getting an awful 1  10 vote the ending was seriously lacking any emotion value at all she walks off with her daughter without any recognition that all of trouble was her fault and without so much as a thank you to her ex who risk his life to correct her mistakes and save her daughter very sad film not in a good wayshame on you luc besson  pierre morel extra shame on you stick to low budget action films your films are exceptionally unrealistic rather like the plot of a comic book stop wasting my time,reality
the action scenes of this movie are terrific and enjoyable but they are in the service of some very nasty ideological messages sextrafficking is simply a displacement of americas paranoid war on terror in which the revenge plot gives the audience a fantasy solution to the mess of iraq and afghanistan the choice of albanian villains is cunning as it conveniently blurs the distinction between postcommunist and muslim threat and the choice of paris as a centre of white slavery and police collusion is patently a retaliation for french resistance to the neocon agenda and while the fact that the hero is also a father allows the audience to sympathise with his increasing desperation his daughter is clearly a symbol of americas elite social class in timehonoured fashion she is the virginal princess who has to be rescued from the clutches of immoral foreign eastern baddies the idea that sextraffickers would kidnap a rich american tourist for other purposes than ransom is laughable if we believe this movie george bushs taxcutting pampering of the rich has clearly failed to make americas upper middle classes feel secure better not step out of the country and lock up your millionaire daughters the only ones worth saving this is a backlash movie antifeminist it is no coincidence that the daughters travelling companion declares her promiscuous intentions before she is  this is propaganda for abstinence antiliberal good america v evil outside threats antibourne trilogy lets stop demonizing the cia  and socially exclusive if you thought the use of torture was indefensible this movie will set your mind at rest why are such invidious films made does it have anything to do with the corporate ownership of hollywood,reality
computer skills language skills math skills the unintentionally funny line that i heard on the tv screen of coming attractions at blockbuster made me want to rent this and see if that was just a onetime blunder nope it wasnt plausible in any way and reminded me rather of a violent lifetime movie and that isnt a complete euphemism i mean the casting and acting reminded me of lifetime i kept thinking why did liam neeson agree to do this didnt he learn from star wars the phantom menace i guess at the end of the day its all about paying the bills so you can live next month or maybe in his case the next year his daughter was way too old to be playing a convincing teenager the karaoke machine vs ponyforabirthday present is so playedout his friends dont look like anything bouncerssecurity dudes at all especially leland orser not to mention that theyre so wellmannered when theyre kicking back drinking and barbecuing no swearing or anything so farfetched about tracing the bad guys voice over a cell phone and shooting the french detectives wife are we still supposed to root for this guy he just shot an innocent woman is this to show us how tough and ruthless he is liam neeson is no bruce willis or steven seagal and im saying that because those guys are a helluva lot more convincing as action heroes than neeson but oh well i know theres an audience for this movie look how much gdamn money it madebrace yourself for a franchise,reality
is liam neesons last roar at being an action hero and when his daughter gets kidnapped by hairy albanians in paris neeson slips into the night with a vengeance directed by pierre morel and written by luc besson and robert mark kamen this is one piece of lazy filmmaking  heads up for what may be the worst opening first act of the year breezy entertainment for the 60orso minutes when neesons crusading paris and sniffs his daughters justice but this experience is mainly a big load of jack bauer envy and theres loads of unintentional laughs and tiresome frustrations throughout and i cant really see it as an enjoyable second watch and look out for famke janssen as neesons incredibly thankless exwife and maggie grace doing embarrassing overacting as daughter kim,reality
bryan mills is a former spy now working high profile security events hes divorced and still tries to find time for his teenage daughter kim she wants to go to france for a holiday he warns against it because of how dangerous europeans are eventually he gives in and allows her to go on condition she rings him every night off she goes and forgets to ring home bryan is worried but eventually gets her on the phone but while talking to her she sees her roommate being kidnapped by masked men inside their apartment thinking quickly bryan tells her what to do to describe everything she sees so that he can trace them if she is too sure enough they find her and bryan tells the kidnappers over the phone that he is going to find them and kill them all while watching this luc besson produced film i couldnt help but think of that line from pulp fiction when you positively have to kill every last motherfcker in the room  well get bryan mills hell do all the hard work for ya for he keeps his word he goes to europe and does kill every last motherfcker its a similar theme to bessons own film leon a deadly assassin killing everybody in sight but really is based on a very flimsy premise having said that it really does exactly what it says on the tin the problem with that is the film is very linear as he tracks down the kidnapperswhite slave traders each one is given short shrift theyre dead within seconds we never get to know any of the bad guys mills is never even in peril there is no rematch with a bad guy we only get to know them all very briefly if youre into brainless shoot em ups you wont be disappointed with this i enjoyed it myself on those levels to some extent but it is still quite a poor film neeson does make for a great hero though,reality
id have to say that i am very surprised with how high the user rating is for this movie so far i saw it last night and was not impressed at all the best way to sum up this movie is to say it is a slightly better steven seagal movieand i dont think that is much of a compliment it was too unbelievable even for an action movie never once did i believe liams character was in danger he could seemingly read minds was an expert in absolutely everything and had such intelligence that the cia was jealous he could be in a small room with five bad guys with guns but somehow is able to defeat them all without a scratch luckily for him the bad guys couldnt hit the broad side of a barn with their guns just ridiculous i gave it a 410 the stars i gave it came from decent acting by neeson and famke jannsen and good production value it did look good good special effects and cinematography skip this movie unless you are into jeanclaude or seagal movies,reality
picture these scenarios a robot from the future is sent back in time to kill the one responsible for the creation of the beings which are destroying the world in his own timea manyfaced secret agent kills more people over the course of half a century than anyone would bother counting including some supergeniuses ranging from dangerous to annoying to pathological journeying everywhere from the alps to spacea man who has no clue who he is turns out to be a supersoldier from a government project and decides to do everything he can to expose this diabolical setup in fact this very scenario happens multiple times to multiple mena farm kid comes home to see his guardians murdered and ultimately makes a giant hunk of metal explode saving the universethe moral to this story anyone complaining about plots holes and feasibility really needs to stop watching action moviesneeson does a stellar job portraying a man on a mission his motivation this time borders clich and unique because its not overused but not wholly original actually its somewhat reminiscent of man on fire his character doesnt develop throughout the movie except perhaps to become more and more assertive shooting a friends wife in the arm and threatening her life to get what he wants but its not particularly necessary to develop the theme of fatherhood given its inherent complexity the action was great the acting was pretty good across the board neeson was great imo and the direction was effectivei only have two major gripes1 nothing happened regarding the friend after she died in fact there was no followup about the trading ring at all i think there should have been some2 there were only about 2 minutes in which neeson appeared helpless while the action was great aesthetic is often built on tension and release his utter control over the situations he was in was great in the action hero way but for the sake of the story he should have been a little more challenged,reality
review is as near stupid as it is ridiculous its over the top poorly written which leaves for an unhealthy execution the story follows a former spy who relies on his old skills to save his estranged daughter who has been forced into the slave trade now you may think the story is worthwhile to tell but when sat watching this mess those thoughts scatter away quite quickly you may even want to consider leaving as wellnesseonkingdom of heaven is suited in an illjudged and indecent role that could possibly have bigger consequences for his career the vibe throughout the film is dreading and consistent as is the godawful direction of pierre morel who films out shots like they mean nothing for a good film to follow verdict a complete mess in all areas and should be avoided like the plague,reality
ive tried to watch the movie until the end but i couldnt the hero is just perfect he isnt a man he is a machine the history is an old clich the retired special agent from the cia trying to live a normal life he is a poor sad divorced lonely agent his wife left him new he is trying to recover daughters love the actress the daughter is older than the character pathetic when she runs around the airport like a kid the movie talks about an important subject human traffic but the way that the movie shows the subject is totally out of reality pure fantasy i like the main actor but definitively he isnt the new jason bourne,reality
but it seems not possible to give a 0 zeroso clich such bad a plot hollywood at its worst i strongly agree with all negative comments written and i just had to add one myself so people beware the deceptive rating this movie has its very likely all the 10 out of 10 stars are from people trying to fool others into watching just to avenge the sorrow for their own loss of time with this piece of cinematographic crap or having the iq of spalin fans this movie just triggers my rant reflexand besson what happened to this guy hard to believe it is the same person who gave us leon and nikitanot to speak of neeson did he need the money so bad was he on drugs when he signed up for this actso people of good taste dont waste your time on this oneps i just got a comment from a friend which will not change the rating of the movie but could shed a light however skewed on the motivation of a french guy to do this movie portray mainstream hollywood as seenperceived from an european perspective but do it in a way to fool mainstream us audiences and get away with the money  very subtle  and so much so that it works look at the ratings ,reality
normally i have no problem kicking back switching my brain off suspending my disbelief and having a great time enjoying a mindless action flick but this was too much one of the main problems is that this mindless action flick sees itself as a smart actionthrillerdrama ala man on fire which it most certainly is not if the movie had embraced its ridiculousness and not itself so seriously it could have been a decent at best popcorn movie liam neeson who i think is great in almost anything he does is completely miscast as a one man army punching and kicking his way through over 40 much younger fitter stronger men this is not bourne this is not bond and it most definitely is not man on fire this is a second rate pg13 rambo with watered down violence and the heavy themes sugarcoated beyond belief to protect the fragile minds of film goers brought up on the idea that things really arent that bad in the world and good will always defeat evil no matter how badly the odds are against them is typical by the numbers hollywood crap its bound to make a killing in the us but it deserves nothing more than to go straight to dvd,reality
this crap film is flawed from the beginningfirst off the daughter is a spoilt immature brat who acts and runs around like a retarded 5 year old so when she was kidnapped i couldnt of cared lessand come on she comes from a rich familydo we really care about her no her character is completely unlikeable and the only reason she was kidnapped was because she had to have it her way and go to crappy parisliam neesons acting is terrible completely flat and woodenand i cant believe the film ended like it did surely someone would come after him what about the other girls that were kidnapped couldnt he of exposed the kidnapping trade and helped them too instead he runs around trying to save his spoilt brat of a daughtertotally over rated movie give it a miss,reality
ok so liam neesons daughter gets kidnapped in paris and he runs amok killing hordes of gunslinging albanians looking for her what a load of tosh but so much worse than that is when i read a review from some impressionable youngster who finds this disturbing viewing and thinks that it represents some kind of reality i feel so angry that this kind of film gets funded  it totally misrepresents the whole issue of sextrafficking and presents it with the most godawful hollywood distorted american messed up morality and paranoia luc besson what the hell are you playing at this is cinema at its worst if you cant find better uses for your filmmaking funds then for gods sake give them to someone else with some intelligence some creative ideas and a sense of morality which isnt completely cockeyed and utter bullshit,reality
i shouldnt be writing a comment on this movie i dont typically go to action movies because car chases and fights just dont do it for me i want a good plot and twists or at least a very compelling story that either makes you laugh or makes you think about something worthwhile in life the story of this movie didnt seem to be the point to me they just had to have some vehicle to package the car chases and fights in so they came up with a basic almost trite father saves daughter storyline i guess this is what action packed thrillers are supposed to be like what worries me is that this is what people want to see scary,reality
this film is much alike to the bourne films including that the main character is a us secret agent who is very much alone as he takes on impossible numbers of heavily armed bad guys i would have rated it four stars except for a few glaring faults my initial reaction to this was that it was quite good but was a little heavy on the violence and bloodshed unlike bourne it seems like the main character in this film would rather kill or torture rather than talk his way out of situations  actually takes some joy in hearing people scream i am not sure how it got away with pg13 in the states  i actually think that the uks 15 rating was a little slack toothe violence begins with the agent entering france and ends with his departure that was a bit disturbing especially since when he returns people are acting as if life is back to normal and that nothing really happened inbetween there are a few other loose ends which the film glosses over poorly as wellthe film is almost written as an antibourne whereas bourne takes on the corrupt cia and battles against mostly us agents this film features a whos who of people that the us does not like the baddies include french eastern europeans and even arabs the way that the film portrays the french authorities in particular is pretty insulting,reality
the film is not without merit decent action sequences well acted by newsam the plot is weak the product placement is cringe worthy particularly the over use of disposable cameras i mean is it honestly within the realms of phesability that kodak disposable cameras will begin to sell again because they are shown in a forgettable action movie holly valance advising someone on how to have a career as a singer hmmmmm basically they have modernized commando chucked in a bit of borne u2 and other cool things to pacify the kids they try to give the film some credibility by involving sex trafficking but have fallen way short of achieving it on a more significant note the film does little to help american xenophobia it is borderline racist and unduly inflammatory to sum up i certainly would not advise paying to see the film but if youre on a long haul flight and have already watched the decent films that are on offer then maybe consider giving it a try other than that stick to bond or bornepeace,reality
i dont think ive seen much that could actually be described as better than i train and teach krav maga and my head instructor has been in situations that i will describe simply as similar the fight scenes show accurate handtohand combat including bryan mills ability to take on multiple opponents in quick succession the nearmiss accuracy of his opponents at such ranges is also accurate to someone not professionally trained unless theyve been in as many firefights as a childsoldier in the 3rd worldthe plot holes that some critics complain about are easily filled in by the fact that a trained spy or mercenary would easily have enough contacts to come across any information necessary to fill in the gaps of his knowledgethe plot was sound the fight scenes were superb the premise believable and one that actually occurs in real life,reality
fighting skills are perfect very good on filming and photography the details on how things are in real life to bring a more accurate argument is really good approach to the facts this job of investigation on how a sas special forces work how do they make deals and how do they communicate with the people involved is really close to realitythe film has a very good balance entertaining and not letting you out of the main story film is always very focus and also let you think what would be the next scenarioreason why i gave a 1010,reality
if a little more care had been over the plot this could have been an excellent movie integral and essential parts of the story are too rushed and contrived and require a huge if temporary suspension of beliefwhere it scores more highly is in realism during the action scenes with what would appear at least to be physically possible and well executed stunts neeson is throughly believable as the nononsense shoot first and ask questions later man you definitely dont want to make angry by kidnapping his daughter apart from the fact hes irish and playing an excia operative maybe they were short on american actors that week or maybe the cia had more involvement in ireland than they would admit toat least we get yet another movie where paris is torn up with car chases and explosions and the french are portrayed as corrupt and inefficient that alone makes me smile ,reality
this is an example of what i hope for every time i go to the theater to see a actionthriller the set up of characters and dangerous circumstances was perfect what is more compelling than the love of a good father for his daughter when the film started i didnt know anything about it so i had no expectations within the first half hour i was literally on the edge of my seat talk about engaging this movie sucked me in in the best possible way i felt for the dad i felt for the daughter and i cared deeply that the bad guys got their due this movies strength is not only in its fantastic story telling and fast pace action it is in its unrelenting heart you find yourself absolutely caring about what happens to the characters you feel their pain their fear and their determination dont miss this film it is also one of those rare films that is worth a second viewing masterful film making master story telling what a thrill ride,reality
i have a hard time watching without interpreting it through an american political filter let me show you what i meanis a film about american ideals innocence and virtue played by maggie grace who is betrayed by the always treacherous always swarthy french government after misly leaving the country and discarding american xenophobic wisdom the french allow her to be hijacked by albanian communists in order to be transformed into the liberal whorish ideals of europe for the ultimate purpose of being deflowered by a large fat arab muslim terrorist fortunately america played by liam neeson jumps in and handles the situation by blowing the brains out of many many people and implementing the use of advanced interrogation techniques on the evildoers the reckless gungho endsjustifythemeans american philosophy saves the day and american culture is rescued from the arab terroristafterwards the american ideals are back to the homeland and given the chance to fulfill the american dream by achieving superficial fame in hollywood the endstill a good movie though,reality
actually this movie made me write a review after a long time i had great expectation for this movie  from the feedbacks i received and imdb comments it didnt disappoint a bit story is about a cia agent finding his daughter after he is kidnapped in paris liam was tremendous the movie blows by 93 minutes went like 30 minutes the movie is fast paced with little room for acting the undertone was very strong in this movie trafficking and fatherdaughter relationship are the undertones strong yet very subtlealthough the character build up is not much you start to care for them worst thing abt the movie is acting expect liam everyone was horrible but really that doesnt matter for this movie they do ample jobi love jason bourne but bryan mills kicks jason bourne ass the movie delivers,reality
after meeting a cute guy in the airport a teenage girl proclaims im going to sleep with him to her best friend its in these opening moments that is very unnerving showing nave teenagers ready to cut loose from mom and dad only to discover that there is a darker side to the beauty of the international world yet this movie is an actioner from france filmmaker luc besson known more for escapist entertainment like the transporter and the professional so its safe to say the seriousness of it starts and ends with that this movie comes from a very real place but its pure popcorn the screenplay is by besson and writing partner robert mark kamen and cinematographer pierre morel makes his englishlanguage debut behind the camera and despite some things that go over the line it gets the job doneliam neeson stars as bryan mills who we can assume did some pretty shady blackop type things for the government now divorced and retired he finds himself competing for the attention of his daughter kim maggie grace with her new richer father xander berkeley while being constantly at odds with his exwife famke janssen against his better judgment he allows kim to go on a vacation with a friend to paris and as if he predicted it he receives a call from kim right as kidnappers are taking her friend and coming after her from piecing together the background noise he overhears he places them as an albanian group with their hand in drugs and the sex trade its up to him to fly to paris and put his particular set of skills to good use in order to save his daughterwhat follows is really a string of martial arts gun battles explosions and car chases the movie goes by in a brisk hour and 25 minutes and for the most part its a wellmade thriller with a good central performance from liam neeson its his show for most of the movie besson isnt interested in the heartbreak of the parents back home or what horrible things the girls being preyed on are suffering even the villains remain offscreen and onedimensional for most of the time unless neeson is beating the bloody crap out of them what besson and im sure the people looking to see this movie is interested in is an intimidating badass who knows how to kickass and take names without mercy and neeson covers that and more he also shows the sadness and finds the humanity in a man desperately trying to find his daughterwhat bothered me about this movie though is the torture angle i know the last thing your supposed to do is look for morality in whats basically a revenge fantasy but there are times when you just feel like mills goes too far electrocuting a man for the schere joy of watching him suffer or shooting an innocent woman in the arm so as to get information from someone else isnt entertaining or the stuff that makes him particularly rootable works in the same vain as out for justice and is for the most part a fairly thrilling revenge flick just sometimes it gets too carried away and crosses a line that you wish it knew not the cross,reality
i dont really agree with most of the comments posted for this movie and i may be an outcast for this but i must be clear on what i felt firstly the movie is way over hyped the billboards comparing it to bourne series but in reality it doesnt even touch the class of bournethe theme sadly brings no surprises similar to punishercommando etc with a well trained xmilitary man trying to rescue his daughter being kidnapped the main character liam nesson doesnt look very convincing as a slick killer with wrinkly face and dimensions of a man more fit to be working in a garden with his grandchildren rather than taking on trained militantswhat i did like about the movie was its fast pace and good direction which makes up for a feeble script and cast the movie has been intelligently grilled with no fancy stunts or hard to believe action sequences but with smart moves worth a one time watch,reality
the only reasons im reviewing this movie is its high rating on imdb 80 as of january 2009 and the fact that it was made in 2008 is definitely not worthy of that high rating as it is nothing special at all in fact this is just an old school action movie that could have been made in the 80s i was expecting arnie to show up at any minutein stead of schwarzenegger liam neeson is starring though he plays a specialagentwhateverkickerofasses whose daughter gets into the hands of evil albanians thats right evil albanians like in the 80s the bad guys are just from some little country the audience knows nothing about except that its probably populated by eviiiiiillll peopleanyway neeson i forget his characters name is that typical father that only exists in hollywood he totally loves his daughter kim and is always there for her but his exwife just wont acknowledge all his love and concern because of his absence in the past or whatever wifey has already found a new boyfriend a rich guy whos able to buy kim more expensive presents than neeson like a pony a pony for a 17 year oldgirl yeah you go make sense of itanyway when asked to agree that kim goes on a trip to paris over the summer neeson in all his special agenteducational wisdom rejects his allowance at first knowing that the world is a bad place and not one for a 17 year oldgirl and her 19 year oldfriend to travel however in the end kim and her mother bitch until neeson finally lets his daughter go oh boy had they better listened to good ol spy dad within the very first minutes in paris the girls get abducted of course and neeson has to go overseas to get them backis full of clichs from the wooden dialog to the depiction of teenagers 17 year olds who love ponies 19 year olds who have never had sex girls who are fans of u2 and holly valance at the same time up to a plot that just falls into place a little too neatly much too neatly the hero is a dad with superpowers bullets magically miss him while the ones coming from him hit their targets every time weve seen this before and better but its a concept that never gets old isnt it and well the movie is very entertaining it moves along quickly and the 90 minutes rush by in an instantis not quite as stupid as the transporter but then its not choreographed as stunningly either its just an old school action flick for anybody whos willing to turn off the old brain and watch oskar schindler kick some butt,reality
its one of the best movies i ever watched in this year it tells you what a real man should act what a father should act although in some point of views he is doing things against the law but if it was mei would do the same when anyone of your family is in dangerous and when you can not rely on the government you should action quickly and use all your skills to fight for them but of coursein real life most of us have no such skills as hisbut it doesnt matterthe choices you make do matter the movie has actions and gun fires but not bloody or too much violenceyour heart is following him all through the timereally a nice movie no wasting a single secondhope all of you like it,reality
i had interest in watching because director pierre morels previous film was banlieue 13which was a very competent action filmand did not disappoint meit may not be great but i cannot deny i had a very good time watching thisthe screenplay has some suspicious coincidencesbut its well structuredthe action scenes are perfectly done because they produce impact on the spectatorliam neeson was a very good choice for the main characterhe shows conviction and the necessary level of intensity the character needed to provoke interest in the spectatori had a very good time watching this film and i can easily recommend it if you are looking for an intense and entertaining action film,reality
this is one of the best films i have ever seen most defiantly this year at least liam neeson is as i hinted at in my summery the real dark night in this film he shows us the true side of a man pushed to breaking point which then leads to total destruction of the bad guys to this i add that the film batman begins which also stared liam neeson was in a sense owned by him it wasnt until i saw this film that i realized just how good he was in that film i have to admit i havent seen the dark night yet but im willing to lay down a few quid to say it isnt as good as the last batman and it isnt as good as there was only one bad point in this movie and that was when he takes out the spotter why all he had to do was let the blond be and he could have followed them to the crib where the girls were being kept that said he wasnt really at any point in the mood for messing aroundif you love batman then you will like this film if you liked batman begins and thought it was good because of the new batman christian bale or the new batmobile or new insight into the super hero known as bruce wayne i think you might be a little disappointed because it is clear from this movie liam neeson was the bad guy that made batman look good in begins i cant help but feel im going to watch the dark night and think about this filmto be honest i dont really need to sell this film to you the 75 should do that for you i do admit there are weak points in the movie but boy did the movie move along at a rapid entertaining pace good watch by the dvd go to the movies or download this movie you will watch it more than a few times,reality
let me just start by saying that this was the worst movie hands down that i have ever seen i gave this movie a generous 1 out of 10 because zero was not an option i have never rated a single movie in my life although this one just made me very angry i actually created an imdb account simply to write this reviewi am extremely upset with the administrative team of imdb for allowing such a high ranking for this film i dont think i can ever trust imdb ever again im not going to mention anything that happened in the movie because i wouldnt want to spoil it for the direct family members of the actors that have to watch this movie for common courtesy hence if youre not related to the actors do not watch this i have nothing against the actors liam neeson is just wonderful but this just simply made me angryok thats it,reality
how wonderful it would be if was a standard an average type film that all films today were measured by instead turns out to be a great film in comparison to the majority of the crap released these days thank you mr pierre morel for the breath of fresh airliam neeson adeptly portrays an excia operative who has retired in order to make up for lost time with his teenage daughter when while vacationing in paris she and her friend are abducted into the international sex trade neeson pulls all the stops and calls upon all his resources and skills in order to locate and save heris exciting in a quantum of solace james bond sort of way neeson proves once again his diversity as an actor bravo,reality
at some point man shall make a decision  keep watching nonsense movies where all good guys can blow a whole city up and nobody say a word where bad guys are usually morons who cant shoot also cant think foreseen and it seems the only reason they live is to be killed by the good guys etc or finally give this crap up as enough is enough even if believed is entertainment or by any chance youre american who seem to enjoy this type of movies mostso if you still enjoy mainstream movies go and watch it a big chance you may wake up all the sleeping doubts  why how and finally what for what are these movies made for of course for money but who will pay us back for 2 hours of our live purely wastedstay brainwashed or give wake up and eventually give it a breaki gave it 3 stars its far too much this movie deserves but unfortunately we got just 1 to 10 scale and bigger crap will appear sooner or later no doubt so i have to have something in the sleeve then,reality
since last year i have finally been able to watch many of the popular action movies hailed as some of the best ones ever made is another solid action movie that has soul and resonates well luc besson is really skilled at crafting powerful action stories and has not disappointed here liam neeson one of my favorite action stars is most well known for this movie its not a very long film and keeps you glued till the endhas a heartfelt story and further heartfelt performances a fathers pain longingness and rage liam neeson has captured it very well and there are a number of scenes where hell almost have you in tears you will root for him you will want him to win and this is where lies one of the biggest successes of the makersaction is one of the strongest aspects of the film as were given fights gunplay and chases which arent just well choreographed but also backed by strong emotions dialogues are great and you most probably would be knowing which ones i specifically mean here cinematography is well done editing is absolutely top notchis one of the finest gems of the french action cinema its absolutely worth a watch and im pretty sure that you too will have the same feeling once you finish watching it in case you havent watched it yet you can check it out on youtube its legally available for free at least here in india,reality
it looked okay but i didnt like the orangecyan tinge to most of the movie immersive and well placed sound design almost perfect i think i detected some dodgy dubbing this is shocking it reminded me of hostel 2005 but instead of intense gore there was a forced into prostitution theme there were moments of utter silliness where the story was boring and other moments where the story was stupid it did ramp up to full on excitement and shock shocking with one amazing action scene but overall flawed too much to fully enjoy,reality

liam neeson father of a slightly rebellious teen finds himself confronted by a parents worst nightmare his daughter has been abducted paris serves as the background for first rate action spiced with one of the worst scripts ive come across in years apparently europe is a den of iniquity where police the rich and famous and seedy albanians all connive to abduct innocent american girls not heeding parental advicethe film lacks local colour which is all but absent paris is depicted as if it were the capital of dagestan where nothing is as it should be and crime and treason lurk behind every cornerliam neeson is his usual concentrated solid self and makes the film worth while delivering a believable ex secret agent anything else is silly and forgettable liam beats up everything that crosses his path interspersed with a satisfying neck crunch here and therefans of neeson or blevel actiononly flicks will be rewarded anyone else abstain,reality

is without a doubt one of the coolest and most fast paced action thriller of all time enter bryan mills played terrifically by liam neeson an exgovernment spy and a man whos job costed him his family he lives alone seeking to make up lost time for his 17 year old daughter kim maggie grace when kim is granted with an opportunity to visit paris with a friend and needs bryans permission a reluctant bryan eventually agrees a day later he discovers that his daughter and her friend were by albanian human trafficking crime lords he has 96 hours to get her back or he will most likely never find his daughters whereabouts this is a fine example of how a simple idea can form into an thrilling film neeson truly kicks some fing ass as the truly ruthless and undeniably so damn cool role of the ex spy this is a fine debut by french director pierre morrel although the success doesnt continue see or dont see from paris with love and youll see what i mean the screenplay is by veteran luc besson leon la femme nikita and is filled with one liners to remember a ruthless action movie with awesome action sequencesquote bryan i dont know who you are i dont know what you want if you are looking for a ransom i can tell you i dont have money but what i do have is a very particular set of skills skills i have acquired over a very long career skills that make me a nightmare for people like you now if you let my daughter go thatll be the end of it i will not look for you i will not pursue you but if you dont i will look for you i will find you and i will kill you     marko good luckphone hangs up,reality
having seen the trailers for this film i was some what put off however was i glad i decided to watch it the film starts a little slowly and the main plot doesnt begin until around a third of the way in but after that it is amazing liam neesons ability to capture his character is second to none in this film the story was similar to that of man on fire i enjoyed both films just as much the plot is simple and keeps you focused on thrilling directing other films such as the bourne supremacy left you thinking what the hell just happened this film however is pure brilliance the cast was a surprisingly good combination but xander berkeleys character was a let down he had very few lines but he made a cold and useless impression other than that though a definite must see,reality
i have seen this film 4 times now and it still hits me the same way like the first time i saw it it starts of slow innocent and you sort of think where is this going to but when the action button gets pushed it does not let off i never really took to liam as an actor sure he has been solid in most films and seen him in some very mediocre films but this is his best performance by far and i am still surprised he filled this role so well i would have thought a much bigger hollywood caliber actor would have snapped this up when it was put out there as a script specially seeing that hollywood seems to produce crap and bad remakes for the last few years when it comes to action films if you are after an action flick with no real special effects just pure grit than this is for you great story great script solid acting make this one of my favorite bad guy ass kicking action films of all time 10 out of 10,reality
now this is how you make an action film the film takes time to build the characters and explain liam neesons position with his wife and daughter which for me makes the action scenes that follow all the more rewardingfome then on it is allout action the thing which sticks with me about this film is that this is exactly how any father would react in the same circumstances albeit probably not as professionally as neesonif you love action movies and havent seen this already make sure you do,reality
i was blown away by this without a doubt a movie you cannot afford to missfull of action and unbelievable thrills there isnt a moment throughout the whole movie where you arent hooked to the storylinethis movie is about father and former spy bryan mills liam neeson learning to let his daughter kim maggie grace grow up and start living her life by giving his permission to let her go to parisas he is aware of all the dangers and what horrible people are out there he is extremely hesitant about letting her go but says she can on certain conditionswhilst taking her to the airport he finds out she is going with her friend to follow a band travelling and is not at all impressed but still accepts and lets her go on the conditions one most important one is to call him when she landswhen she lands and goes to get into a cab kim and her friend amanda meet a french young man quite interested in getting to know them offers them invites to a party and not missing a beat kim accepts much to amandas disagreementwhen they arrive at the place they are staying the french man gets their address and leaves bryan is then home in america very concerned that kim has not contacted him to say they have landed he then calls her and asks out whats going on and thats where its all thrills from theremajor spoilers whilst on the phone to her father kim walks into another room amanda however is in the living room dancing to loud music blocking out any noise kim then enters the bathroom across from where amanda is and can see her through the windows suddenly she says men walk in and becomes very suspicious they then take amanda away and kim is petrified at this momentshe explains hysterically to bryan what she has just witnessed over the phone and he instructs her what to do she runs to another room and hides under the bed she is then told by her father that they are going to take her and there is nothing she can do to stop them but the one key thing he needs her to do is to shout out all descriptions of the men facial clothes nationality pretty much appearance while doing so she shouts and is dragged away with the mobile phone still under the bed bryan stays on the phone to see if there is anything else he can hear he then hears someone pick up the phone and says a few threatening words its quite a speech so i shall cut it a bit shorter i dont know who you are i dont know what you want if you let my daughter go that will be the end of it but if you dont i will look for you i will find you and i will kill you a foreign man then replies with good luck that good luck is the key thing throughout most of the film so take much notice of itif you are not gripped enough yet i suggest you go and rent the film yourself better yet buy it it is an amazing film that i have watched many times and purchased myself it doesnt get old it just gets better1010,reality
is one of the most fastpaced action thrillers ive seen in a long time its 93 minutes of nonstop action suspense and thrills as an exsecret agent rages through paris looking after his daughter kidnapped to be sold in the sex industryliam neeson shows that at the age of 57 he can surpass such characters as james bond and jason bourne as the best coolest deadliest action hero of modern cinemaartistically speaking is not a great movie the camera work and dialogue is unimpressive and the characters are as developed as they need to be to make the movie move on neesons characters has a wide range of skills that pass off as characterisation movement is the major force behind this movie its frantic pace never letting the viewer stop to think for a moment but whereas i would despise that in a movie like transformers some quality in makes me love itits undoubtedly the story that makes the difference whereas most summer action movies are huge stories about nothing is a smaller simpler even heartwarming story about a fathers love for his daughter we sympathise with his loss and rage and rejoice in the pain and destruction he inflicts upon the villainsthis is escapist cinema at its best i havent been this thrilled and havent cheered so much for a hero in such a long time i felt id never again experience the joy of watching a good guy triumph in a movie fortunately movies like keep getting made,reality
brilliant i like that the lead isnt your branded moviestar passes well for a concerned father it is fantastic that neither the new father nor the mother turned evil and undeserving of a good finish or did the script turn into a romance in the end glad the rescue was a success but i would have liked to see the star come away with even less injuries for a change and perhaps even reason for a sequel at least one of his buddies in the beginning could have assisted him along the way to make it more believable but bravo missed it on the big screen hired the flick im about to buy the disc cause its definitely a collectors item,reality
i remember in 1995 when goldeneye came out and it starred pierce brosnan as james bond 007 but before mr brosnan got the role liam nesson was approached by the producers to play 007 howeverpierce got the role in this film i see liam nesson as both james bond and jason bourne liam nesson is cruel cool cold and amazingly wonderful this is no doubt one of his best roles this film is all nessons the actionsequences are full of excitement very credible and recalls the bourne movies the action is so realistic plot is good and realistic but a tad predictablewatch it you wont regret it no doubt one of my favorite movies ever,reality

good movie in many respects  twists and turns and fastpaced drivenness keep you on the edge of your seat neeson was great as usual the actress cast as his daughter was too flighty and silly for my taste  i wouldnt let a hyperactive overemotional screamingprone teen go to europe either she acted like a tiny child without a thought anyway i like how the film opened up with neeson protesting the trip and also liked many of the mysteries along the way and his awkward but caring relationship with his silly daughterdont think they should have included neeson shooting the french police execs wifes arm though  seemed incongruent with the characters moral bent and history with her point about sacrificing a family member is not wellmade with faint apology afterward how is it that neeson is instigating showers of gunshots and never takes a hit until right before finding his daughter we dont even see him put on a bulletproof vest or see any reason to believe this at all and what happened to the girl he rescued in order to sober her up and ask about his daughter id like to see that thread sewn up as long as were dealing with as heavy a subject as sex trade  as long as were taking on the social blight why not some resolution to the system somehow at least a suggestion that theres a care beyond family a few regrettable points where the script missed and perhaps overly choppy camerawork  do we have to become dizzy to get his frantic emotions its too forced the ending is clapped on clich  why not show the difficulties they would obviously have leaving the country in the wake of the fathers bloodbath and some deeper wizened daughter how is is that through all this she doesnt even change yeah right more character development is a must overall a fine story and nicely made film with important subject matter and potential for more thoughtwhere have we seen this script before perhaps reworked in many scripts but especially from target from the 80s starring matt dillon as the rebellious teen and gene hackman as the former fbi father who surprises his son with his knowhow savvy and worldly connections when the motherwife is kidnapped all teens need their parents to be a brave rolemodel so this kind of film fulfills those fantasies plus a nod to social commentary on sex trade without sugarcoating makes this worth seeing,reality
was a great blend of action and drama the action scenes were not overly drawn out and silly while the drama comes from the intense and very realistic aspect of sex slaves it contained a great mixture of believable characters and situations the amount of violence drug usage and the reality that sex slave trade still exist may be too much for the average person to handle but action movies are always better when there is truth and validity i would recommend this movie to anyone who appreciates hard action with a serious plot however i would like to point out that there is one inaccuracy in the moviethere is no way that one man could kill that many albanians albanians really are hardcore and really are deep in the underworld all these movies that portray albanians as criminals are not farfetched nor are they clich its just completely silly to believe that anyone could take out that many albanians maybe if they were french or english i would believe it,reality

for a young american bryans carer has taught him paranoia he sees terrorists and perverts and all around bad guys everywhere especially over in the old europe besides that kim is a virgin and 17 two essential setups for the plot because giving his permission involves bryan in the trip and her being a virginwell see if your mind is paranoid enough to figure out what that means kim lies and begs and jumps up and down graces performance consists mostly of jumping acting terrified and comatose then jumping again when its all safely over bryan gives in reluctantly and signs a releasebut boy was bryan right the minute kim and her girlfriend arrive in paris theyre kidnapped it happens in the manner of modern movies when shes on her cellphone talking to bryan then he makes the speech that is repeated in the trailers in which he instructs her to hide under a bed and then get caught i guess she cant jump out the window the way he couldand soon does when he rushes over to paris to rescue kim and track down and onthespot execute the kidnappers how he finds out they are albanian slave traders and pimps and how he is in their lair threatening them in 24 hours or less is something you will more or less learn if you see the movie only more or less because its all a game really if a very violent one and the connective tissue of the plot is frequently missingis an excellent thrilling nonstop adrenalinepumping exhilarating movie starring the accomplished neeson its also a dumb unbelievable bigoted collection of disgustingly cruel scenes whose heavyhanded setups show utter contempt for the audiences intelligence that might seem what we deserve for going to such a film just because it stars a man who convincingly played oscar schindler and alfred kinsey rob roy and michael collins at fiftyseven and looking every minute of it he also might just be a bit old for dropping roomsfull of bloodthirsty albanians and heavily armed saudis jumping from building to building and outwitting the paris police force were he in real life actually to carry out such exploits in the few days during which all this happens if that matters this dubious aspect to the casting of the lead merely starts off the list of stunningly implausible details following the gospel according to daniel craig his image that is macho action stars dont have to be suave or good looking do they have to have the physical conditioning and stamina to make ultraphysical action plausible the makers of the bourne franchise movies think so thats why theyve wisely cast the very fit muscular and still young matt damon in the role but this is bad bourne very bad bourne unlike the bournes paul greenglass pierre morel proves to be an efficient but mechanical director with very little flairyoure not supposed to notice that casting incongruity neesons a bit old for an action star but hes still erect tall 64 actually and elegant he carries himself with cool confidence it all slides by fasttoo fast finally to remember much but the despicableness of the villains and the ruthless murderousness of the avenging cia agentdad pierre morel a french cameraman and cinematographer who broke into directing with the crackerjack bhollywoodish paris ghetto action flick district 13 banlieue 13 has teamed up again with euro shlockmeister luc besson made a good movie out of thiswell except for the dumb writing even in actioners writing is important note the interesting identity theme that unites the bourne stories and their inspired use of breakneck location shifts following the sxfree style of morels parkur sequences in 13 doesnt have a lot of stateoftheart fakery though its car chase scenes come early and often and totally without dramatic necessity mainly what damns the whole effort is that the storytelling in is crude and obvious and full of holes and the thinking is nastythis is a choice of which neeson ought to be ashamed and as we shall see if we watch through to the end it is another addition to jack shaheens book real bad arabs how hollywood vilifies a people because the albanians are scumbags but the absolutely most despicable villains are the arabs at the end who actually purchase the young virgins to indulge their vile sexist lusts but no matter bryan kills them ll every one he kills anybody who gets in his way too even just people whose cars he needs for a chase scene the mindless brutality of this film is well mindboggling and it all goes to reinforce jingoistic ideas that americans are at war with evil and more or less with all the rest of the world and anybody who gets in their way including the paris police force and all to protect our dumb naive spoiled teenage rich girl virgins,reality
a retired cia agent travels across europe and relies on his old skills to save his estranged daughter who has been kidnapped while on a trip to parisliam neeson fighting choreography sequences were fast paced an really made this film excitingwritten by luc besson robert mark kamen is a winning combomaggie grace did a fine job as well the critics really misted the point of this action  adventure mystery  suspense film  entertain me and that is exactly what does the movie was awesome and definitely a must see,reality
this review contains spoilersis an action thriller movie that premiered in 2008 the movie is directed by pierre morel and written by luc besson and robert mark kamen the movie stars liam neeson as a retired cia field operative named bryan mills bryan mills daughter is kidnapped by a sex trafficking ring in france which provokes bryan to find and rescue heris absolutely an engrossing thrill ride the movie has great action scenes especially at the pg13 rating the movie was assigned the movie moves at an incredibly quick pace for its 90 minute running time the movie has the hypercompetent bryan mills solve many mysteries off of a few clues that are given to him this can make for an interesting watch as so much of the movie has bryans thought process presented on the screen this makes for interesting scenes as bryan pieces things together from clues and observationsin addition to watching thrilling investigations the movie features exciting action scenes and chases the action scenes are not anything new in the genre however liam neesons performance and screen presence help elevate the movie this waythe movie features loads of action scenes these action scenes have a unique flavor to each of them in either setting or executionthe movie does have decent acting but it is mostly bland liam neeson is the exception here as he becomes a capable action movie star none of the other actors stand out this is more of a flaw on the writing and direction for focusing so much of it on bryan mills the other actors do not have too much to work with from the scriptthe writing can feel basic and the direction bland at times this is an action movie and not one that prioritizes depth in its writing the action is executed well and it really does show in the box office results this is a movie that is a nice surprise in the year of release the movie should be watched with a low amount of expectations and the audience will be pleasantly surprised as i wasi would recommend the movie is a solid action flickthree stars out of four stars for ,reality
i really enjoyed this movie neesons character bryan is a great hero who you cant help root for the plot is so very much flawed how can one man kill so many people and cause so much carnage in paris and get away with it but hey its a movie so why not the action sequences are great and its cool having an older hero my only real complaint is his daughter maggie grace who is an adult plays her character as if she is a 12 year old riding a pony and running like a demented schoolgirl its so wrong you actually want her to be and returned in a body bag by the end i always struggle also as to why his three special ops buddies dont actuslly help him either he could have done with some back up surely neeson makes this movie and it totally reinvented his career spawning many more classic action movies so i cant help but feel affection for this film,reality
31 january 2009 been there done thatdoesnt really offer much new in the way of action combining elements of ransom bourne identity even die hard however the action fighting scene and car chases arent quite as crisp as bourne nor the stakes quite as high as in die hard the storyline and the idea of what happens to liam neesons characters daughter has some potent impact his character has some creative mental stunts and the chain of events mostly articulate and reasonable even liam neesons escape from the bad guys wasnt quite believable losing the climatic impact the beginning relational issues seemed fairly generic and stereotypical and an overly expansive explanation was provided by the boys night in this above average actionthriller however just cant reach the power and intensity of its predecessors its mostly derivative 710,reality
why cant all movies be this good i was hooked from beginning to end well written and executed best action movie i have ever seen i love me some liam needon,reality
best popcorn action movie primarily because of the acting talents and physical presence of liam neeson,reality
blimey  first time i saw this i was so compelled i lost track of timereally caught the sense of desperation and a sense of hatred for the bad guysreminded me a little of man on fire equally excellent film but more fast pacedall acted very well and not much more to say other that it was a top joband then they film makers realised that and tried to make sequels and that kind of retrospectively spoiled it for me as a stand alone story it was great so they should have left it that wayalas i wont even bother with the series,reality
its about an exagent whose daughters life is in dange she was been kidnapped during a trip by a group of people who traffic young travellers with the purpose of getting money with them the main character brian has got seventy two hours or hell never find his daughters lifethe storyline was excellent and even more the acting which was incrediable the special effects were amaizing because all the scenes seemed to be real even though it is an action film it was really gripping tooi would recommend this film to everyone who likes action and a really great adventure if you feel bored this film definitely cheer you up,reality
is a very brutal film with a lot of action and combat sequences initially i thought the action was a bad move but apart from towards the end when it gets a bit silly is almost bourneesque and bondian in style and quality simple acting and a simple story carried out in a gritty way by neeson continue the excellence and apart from the very happy ending is a great film all round,reality
james bond may be synonymous with badassspyheroman but liam neesons brian mills while not having as cool a name still knows how to duke out with the best at least in movielandis a surprisingly entertaining action movie that managed to actually unsettle me with some of its themes  namely forced prostitution  and intrigue me with the way it sets up neesons character the way it doles out his essence with his extreme cautiousness and protectiveness of his daughter kim and his other particular skills that are showcased thoroughly throughout the filmbecause of this neesons character was one of s best features demonstrating what hes capable of but leaving enough of him in the shadows to keep you questioning who exactly he is or was after all the closest we get in terms of knowing what neeson did before he retired was that he was a preventer this mystery allows us to fill in the gaps of his character ourselves and imagine how he knows what he knows although his knowledge of torture techniques which he uses on marko gives us hints at his dark pastsome of the films other qualities are its action and occasionally its cinematography the action was fun very much so in fact and it wasnt just neeson shooting dudes there was a lot of variation which held my interest whether it be examining a crime scene outwitting french agents  switching cars and using a walkietalkie to speak into a phone to talk to jean claude his old french friend and colleague speaking of jean claude though the movie made me laugh out loud at one point  where hes walking home with a baguette in his hands a baguette just in case we somehow didnt realise he was frenchbut i digress the cinematography isok and as i said above its occasionally good with one or two really nice shots sprinkled in here and therei also appreciated the fact that the film didnt need to show captions onscreen to let us know where we were many many films are guilty of this but this film manages to accomplish this entirely through cinematic language and not onscreen text  which is commendablebut if it werent for neesons character some dark themes and moments its action some decent shots and its use of the language of filmthis film would be painfully generic with many major plot holessome of these plot plots include why would neesons daughter leave that map with where she was going in an open pocket of her suitcase if she didnt want her father to know they were traveling around europedid the documents that neeson signed that gave permission for kim to travel to paris say where she was traveling or was the location not specified otherwise why would he sign it surely hed pore over that document before even thinking of giving permissionhow come kims friend amanda is shown dead in that one scene and presumably neeson doesnt at least try to recover the body and shes just forgotten about by the end of the filmafter knocking out jean claude a former french intelligence agent how the hell does neeson manage to get home again without being arrested at the airport for attacking a former french intelligence agent or because jean claude was apparently corrupt did the good french cops excuse neesons multiple homicides because he exposed a major sex trafficking ringnot to mention the score is unimpressive and the shakycam could get really bad at timesso yeah the plot holes and the other issues mentioned above really limit this film being very highlyrated but for what its worth is still a fun action thriller with interesting moments and glimmers of cleverness here and there,reality
im very late to the reviewing party mostly because theres not a lot to say about it that hasnt already been said its a kick ass fun movie that showed us liam neeson in a new light however what i want to address is the reviews ive seen on this site and the offense people take to this film as a latin american i can definitively tell you yes americans are this stupid im only 32 and i never speak english when i leave the country never in my life because the minute they know you are american you are prey the first time i remember seeing this in a film was brokedown palace so its been happening a long time just know the reason stereotypes exist is because enough people fit them,reality
even though its fairly predictable film with a long string of coincidences is a refreshing vengeance movie every now and then its fun to see the good guy pummel the bad guys and come out completely unscathed so turn off your brain and enjoy seeing liam neeson play jack bauer,reality
garnered mixed to average reviews critically and still is looking at the reviews here a film that divides audiences can see both sides being one who was mixed to moderately liked the film it is interesting for being one of liam neesons first endeavours as an action hero and considering that the trailer was an intriguing one and neeson has always been very watchable and often very good the potential was thereas was said regarding 2011s unknown recently s potential wasnt fully lived up to enough of does work or at least to me it did not everybody will agree and thats fine by me but also from personal opinion what could have been a pretty good film turned out to be an above average but uneven one that could have done much more with what it had it entertains and intrigues but doesnt wow really liked the rawness and slickness of the way was shot and edited and the bleakness and grit of the rest of the production values suited the tone and genre perfectly its nicely scored not intrusive but having presence and the direction is solidthere is enough taut suspense and fun to keep one gripped and the violence is uncompromisingly brutal and leaves one biting the nails the sound effects are thrilling in authenticity and will leave one wincing in shock with it adding hugely to the harrowing effect of the action neeson is a very commanding presence on screen and there is energy to the directingit is a shame though that excepting maggie grace and famke janssen the rest of the cast fail to match him or engage being largely indifferent the script also doesnt excite descending into too much cheese and tedium and tending to lack clarity subtletydespite it being fun slick gritty and generally taut the story is far too predictable and gets far too farfetched and overthetop in the latter stages the violence while thrilling and well done on its own tends to overpower the basic drama of the story so things feel unbalanced the characters are pretty sketchyoverall above average but uneven and more a mixed to moderately liked sort of film 610 bethany cox,reality
this is one of the movie i liked to see again and again i liked the dialogue in which lian neeson said to kidnappers to find and kill them this is the movie one never leave in between so i suggest just enjoy it i have seen all the series of movies 2 and 3 also all are fantastic entertainment,reality
has been widely considered a great cinematic action film experience as it combines action and suspense and overall thrills from start to finish having seen the sequels before the original one can agree that the original does live up to the hype and is massively more concise and arguably the best film of the franchise liam neeson plays his role as one should and is convincing in the role as well as the supporting cast of the daughter played by maggie grace and his exwife played by famke janssen another great thing about is the length of the film as we have seen many action films drag on with little subplots we do not care for but with the film isnt too long and every piece of screen time is vital overall delivers on what it should as an intense and thrilling action piece of artas a rewatch 120318 remains a very filling and thought provoking entertaining ride full of twists and turns we can see as to why the original is considered the best in the trilogy,reality
wow what a visceral feeling this movie provoked there was a sense of foreboding when kim mills and her friend decided to head off to france and you know her father bryan liam neeson rebooted big time would be getting on the next plane to paris to sort things out and find kimsure the movie was violent but it had a meaning and you knew the bad guys deserved it big time and bryan deals it out in spades without any moral reservations i read that when liam signed on for this role he thought it would be a straight to videodvd release but he took it on to spend time in paris and brush up on his mixed martial arts he does not disappoint and the box office numbers did not disappointholly valance plays a key role in the intro and conclusion and its good shes doing well in her career i dont think holly is related to the late and great jack valance,reality
the series has been done to death memed out to glory and mined for market value a million times over since the first film came out way back in 2008 which has somewhat dimmed the charm of that original vehicle at least for some of us like how many times can liam neeson or his relatives be before even they as characters realize that it couldnt be happening and that theyre in a movie eventually the material unwittingly spoofs its origin in its need to repeat itself time and again thats not to say the first isnt enjoyable on its own in fact its quite the streamlined little dose of adrenaline that essentially coasts on some great pacing neat choreography and the endlessly watchable liam neeson whose career took a shot of nitrous to the heart after gamely stepping into the well worn shoes of the grizzled action hero this was him nimbly ducking through the genre boundaries that his career was in up til that point and the action thing fit him like a glove the film is at its best when it follows bryan mills neeson in action which thankfully is most of the time mills is an ex cia spook with some tactics that will seriously put a hurtin on you if you cross him in any way a gaggle of moronic bosnian human traffickers come under the receiving end of these tactics when they kidnap his vacationing daughter maggie grace looking suspiciously like shes a decade older than her character is supposed to be from paris and auctioning her off to rich raghead perverts this propels him into like an hour of non stop energetic ass kicking that is so fun to watch as he shoots stabs sprains and splatters his way through hordes of eastern european cannon fodder with not a second to spare for even the utterance of a single cheesy one liner hes assisted via bluetooth by his three ex agency barbecue buddies jon gries leland orser and david warshofsky and has a few encounters with his jaded ex wife famke janssen and thats about it but neeson sells the bare minimum as far as the genre goes with his effortless cool and stony formidable stature that springs into startlingly spry motion every time he has to dispatch a new troupe of slavic wise guys if only they didnt have to desecrate this little piece of lightning in a bottle with two sequels that dampen the momentum with cheap attempts at thrills i may still feel strongly about this one as i did when it first came out hopefully they quit while theyre ahead shirk the slimy dollar signs and let their first outing age in peace,reality
lion neeson as operative who would have thought about that he really nailed the role and its his performance made this moviehowever i see here a big missed chance a more subtle approach with less bodys and smaller armys to fight him would haven given it a bit more realistic touchand even there only few short gunfights they are sadly hollywood like unrealistic it would have been better to let him slip away from the factory instead of pumping his car full of bullets and leave all passengers unharmed even tough also rifles where hitting it there badlyalso instead of legions of bodys a more believable reaction by the other characters would be less painful to watch almost any other character here acted between odd and super duper stupid this is a shame because that movie had a potential to be a masterpiece its till above average specially for that genere but still,reality
remove liam neesons mindblowing performance this film would have been just another generic action thriller neeson completely defines this film and is exceedingly likable as a loving father who becomes a merciless killing machine when his daughter is kidnapped by human traffickers this may be typical save the kidnapped girl story but the way it gives edgeofseat thrills combined with welloiled action its becomes highly engaging the sharp dialogues with neesons deep voice add to the package who wouldnt like neesons i will find you and i will kill you dialogue and the action sequence when he finally finds the bad guys is simply mind blowing another of my favorite scenes is when he makes his old friend realize that he has been sitting on desk so long that he has forgotten the difference between a loaded and an empty gun the plot remains intensely focused on the fathers pursuit to find his daughter without floating into unnecessary subplots the only relevant and important characters where the father and daughter and their relation is well established in first 20 minutes giving room for the audience to invest their emotions the film also portrays the horrors of humantrafficking giving enough reason for rooting neesons character to find and kill all those bad guys with well choreographed action engaging soundtrack and slick camera work with powerpacked neeson is a ride not to be missed i have watched it 5 times now and it was exciting each time i still remember the first time i saw it about 4 years ago and how it totally blew my mindrating 45,reality
neeson plays an excia agent who wont stop until he has rescued his daughter who has been kidnapped while on holiday in the city of lights formulaic not to mention implausible but fun on one hand its a throwback to 80s action flicks while also appearing as an homage or tribute to them neeson does well with his antihero character and looks to be having fun with the role and the action and in paris great action scenes as neeson turns those responsible into swiss cheese or in a memorably painful looking scene electrocuting them even when they think they can escape him by jumping off a freeway overpass the film gives them and the audience a memorable twist splat,reality

so stars liam neeson as ex cia agent bryan mills aka the most over protective dad in the history of movies so the plot ultimately revolves around bryans daughter kim played by maggie grace going on holiday to france with her friend ruth and getting kidnapped by an albanian prostitution ring so in true spy movie fashion mills has to save his daughter although one thing i love about this movie is the fact mills gives the kidnappers a chance to give his daughter back it really shows that hes using going on a murderous rampage as a last resort but first off hes all give my daughter back i that will be the end of it i will not look for you but dont give her back and i will look for you i will find you and i will kill you and then the dudes just like good luck seriously the best part of the movie so as you can imagine the rest of the movie is just bryan doing anything and everything he can to get his daughter back when i say everything i mean it hell do anything from just plain shoot you in the face to leave you to die in a homemade electric chair i mean it gets rough my only gripe with the movie is the ending is soooo anticlimatic but other than that its a great movie which i recommend buying on bluray,reality
watching this movie made me mystified as the core plot of the film is based on kidnapping in paris i got so many beautiful memories when i lived in paris it is truly a safe city and have got a strong police presencehaving said that the film was very emotional and a thriller it is watchable but a 50 plus year old hero bringing down thugs with a single punch is somewhat doubtful however liam neeson as a father in this film makes a great screen presence one can overlook plot holes because of his acting and also his love for his daughtergo and watch this film because liam neeson will spellbound you with his on screen portraying of a father who can go to any lengths to save his daughter from kidnappers,reality
wow  i had already read reviews of this movie and with the writer being one of my favourite directors luc besson i just had to go see this movie as soon as possible neeson seems a bit pityful at the start but soon overturns that impression with a taste of his handywork after around ten minutes of the thrillerit was one of those films that i wanted to applause after the filmneeson was great and i cant wait to see the movie many more times a must watch movie for those who like see some good action  dialogue and action thrillers i would give it 810,reality
id heard of this movie but for some reason i had never got around to watching it until recently even though a friend of mine told me that it is full on i have even read some commentary on it about how the entire movie is basically liam neeson running around killing people okay im not sure if he kills everybody that he encounters he doesnt kill any of the french police however he does leave an awful lot of destruction in his wakethe thing with his character is that he is a former operative that once worked for the government though we are not given any specific details who has decided to retire to spend some more time with his family unfortunately he was a little too late because his wife had already left him for another man and his daughter with her however they are still in touch and since he is her biological father he is approached to sign a form to allow her to travel to europe to follow u2 aroundunfortunately for the two girls upon arriving in europe they are kidnapped by some albanians for use as sex slaves however since his daughter is a virgin she is worth a lot more so is shuffled off to be auctioned to the highest bidder however as is expected neeson learns about this pretty quickly namely when she is in the process of being kidnapped and travels directly to paris to attempt to trap these people down using what ever means necessary and leaving a trail of bodies behind himthe interesting thing that i noted about this movie is how it paints the united states as being a haven of safety despite the fact that they live in los angeles where as the rest of the world is an incredibly dangerous place look im sure that stuff like that is going on but i was a little dubious about whether these crooks would be targeting american girls especially ones from a wealthy background i am sure if such a thing were to happen the us embassy would be on it immediately these organisations are more likely to use girls from eastern european countries and ones that wouldnt come from a wealthy background it is also interesting how these guys get the girls addicted to heroin so that they are much more pliable and unaware of their situationhowever despite the fact that this is an unrealistic scenario it is still one of those movies that you turn your brain off and watch liam neeson go psycho as he storms through the parisian underworld searching for these guys who had the audacity to kidnap his daughter and effectively freeing all of the other girls as well though it is never all that clear what happened to his daughters friend  though it seems as if she was dead,reality
is a simple action movie about a family man with a particular set of skills who takes down a sex trafficking ring in order to rescue his daughter after she is kidnapped while on holiday in paris while this could have gone straight to the bargain bin what really sells this movie is liam neeson who brings a everyman quality to his role as bryan mills the production values by luc besson and director pierre morel are also worth noting with just enough emotional content to make the story relatable and a kinetic style that keeps things moving along at a good pace generally speaking everyone gives a decent performance but i thought that maggie grace was miscast as she doesnt look the part of a 17yearold girl and her acting is questionable at best storywise i did appreciate that the movie took time to establish characters and relationships before heading off into more standard action thriller territory but that being said it only taps into the basest of human emotions and tendencies only someone devoid of empathy wouldnt understand the sticky situation that the characters are put into still despite the rote nature of the setup it works and the latter twothirds of the movie rarely let up as far as the action is concerned it is wellshot for the most part pierre morel shoots the close quarters combat up close but the editing isnt so bad that you cant tell whos fighting who and the geography and shot compositions are decent if theres one complaint i have in this area is a nighttime car chase which was perhaps a bit too chaotically shotedited overall this is a decent timepasser that has enough story and thrills to keep you interested and the running time is only about 90 minutes so it never overstays its welcome,reality
a film that solidified liam neesons action star credentials and launched him into superstardom hearkens back to the good old days of action movies when action stars were unbeatable badasses the plots were comfortingly blacknwhite yet still gritty and the violence had purpose style and weight behind its pace is at the same time a source of much criticism as well as one of its greatest strengths the fact is that the story does contain a lot of happy coincidences that in the hands of a lesser director would have made the film superficial and unbelievable but because the pacing is so tight and because the film can flow from one breathtaking action scene to other without a pause you can ignore these serendipitiesand what action scenes those are they would be interesting being performed by pretty much anybody but theyre given an extra boost by neeson who can expertly sell both the anguished father and the retired badass aspects of his character his background in drama helps him to alleviate this above a mere shootemupis one of the best action movies of the 00s and an excellent movie to pick up if youre looking for intense action deeper characters and all around entertainment,reality
when this film was announced i was looking forward to seeing liam neeson in this role because i really like him and i believe it really suited him the plot of this film is pretty simple liam neeson is a retired spy and after his daughter is kidnapped by albanian sex traders he goes on a one man crusade to find her now as i said liam neeson is superb in this film with everything he does and he is one of the biggest bad asses ever in film on his one man crusade one thing that is extremely disappointing is the fact that there are no interesting side characters at all his daughter isnt interesting his ex wife isnt interesting his french colleague isnt interesting but the worst is that there isnt a real villain for neeson to face and that would have truly added to this film yes this films plot is basic but sometimes basic is good and the way the plot is shot and the way neesons performance emphasises it the plots simplicity is what makes it great the script is great with neeson having that now iconic monologue on the telephone and his whole dialogue is great and makes us feel for his character the style is unique and i really like it the quick shots make us feel like we are with neeson and the location of paris was a really good choice for the film this is a great film and i really want to see 2 now,reality

having your child away from you is one of if not the most horrific thing that could ever happen to a parent we would dread to think how we would react were this tragedy ever to befall us this is the situation liam neeson finds himself in in neeson plays an ex spy who begrudgingly allows his 17 year old daughter to travel to france with a friend his fears are confirmed when he finds out she has been abducted but rather than let the authorities handle it neeson takes matters into his own hands and pursues the captors to deliver his own brand of justiceyou would be forgiven for sneering at the idea of neeson as an action hero but he excels in the role and is clearly having a lot of fun with it despite the unsettling subject matter playing like a cross between james bond and jason bourne neesons take no prisoners style affords the viewer some immensely satisfying fistfights as he tears through the streets of paris in search of his daughter were it not for the disturbing subject matter involving human trafficking of underage girls could be described as a dumb fun action blockbuster but with the seedy undercurrent running throughout its hard to cheer too loudly despite the fact that a great number of despicable human beings get their just desserts the scene in which neeson hears his daughter being abducted over the phone is incredibly tense and unsettling but it does set up the viewer for the brutal retribution that followsthere are some shortcomings such as the failure to really explore the very real danger of human trafficking and the end is wrapped up a little too neatly and abruptly but these are minor quibbles which can be easily forgotten thanks to a great performance from neeson and excellent fight choreographya fast paced action movie which deals with a very serious issue in a rather glib and unfocused manner nevertheless there are some fantastic set pieces and neeson does a great job of generating sympathy in the viewer not bad for a guy who tortures someone by sticking electrified metal shards in their thighs,reality
an hour and a half of well executed masculine warrior fantasy for aging baby boomerswhich is to say its genius playing into the the need for revenge the need for men alienated from family and society to feel powerful and relevant is a guaranteed blockbuster it fits snugly into the tradition of rambo and die hard behind it but it replaces rambos wounded loner and die hards blue collar everyman with a bitter spook struggling with his impending irrelevance the only problem is is not as good as any of those movies early in the movie you realize that every character is two dimensional with the possible exception of a corrupt french officer and the only thing each set piece of action accomplishes is an inexorable march to the rescue of the heros daughter as soon as you realize this that this movie has no point other than showing liam neesen rescue his daughter after a bunch of well executed gun fights the movie losses all dramatic tensionthe worst part apart from liam neesons speech to the kidnapper thats shown in the movie trailer the are no good quotes or one linersjust rewatch die hard,reality
i like films involving luc besson as writer or director  think leon or 5th element bessons a loveorhate kind of guy this one i fell in love within the 90 minutes that should be reserved for this sort of action drama as opposed to the nowcommon 2 hours neeson besson et al serve up a taut film about a father who rescues his estranged daughter from sex kidnappers who grabbed her on a paris vacationthe first part of the movie does a very good job in 20 minutes of drawing the characters albeit stock the estranged husband and father the stepfather who seems to do everything better than dad the daughterfather bond that nonetheless persists strongly then we jump right inone of the best aspects of this film is that it takes you through the whole chain of command of sextrafficking operations first the contact a young guy who finds out where the girls live and that they are alone then the lowlevel kidnappers then higher bosses who run the pre selection and drug up the girls to get them subdued then higherlevel traders who take the best merchandise to satisfy rich men with a lust for virgins and finally the ultrarich sheik on a yacht who represents the toplevel predator in this disgusting food chainliam neeson disposes of all of them swiftly and painfully as the movie proceeds towards the final rescue of his daughter some girls dont make it others are lucky and neeson needs them for information this is true for a former french scurit honcho whose wife a personal friend neeson shoots in the leg to get the truth out of him both live when neeson gets what he wantsthe aggregate is as implausible as all such action flicks but until the last 15 minutes besson et al keep it fairly realistic unfortunately it finally descends into heroes surviving against machine gun spray fire implausible jumps from bridges heroes that should be in police custody at the end but mysteriously end up home without a scratch and such accoutrements of the action film these were not actually necessary for the plot so they are forgivable and i give it 810 a fun and fast evening,reality
is a very ferocious but fast and interesting movie  luc besson knows his trade and liam neeson is a sure great actor who can convince you in everything he does pity there is not so much of screen time was alloted to gorgeous famke janssen whos is impeccable sweet and deep as usual the plot is very simple there are no convoluted twists or impossibly hard to grasp details everything is very straight aggressive brutal plain and loud yes too brutal yes too bare well it is a part of plot here you do not ponder for hours trying to decipher twists and riddles such films as should be too maggie grace is nice she is very young sweet and sexy yet she has a long way to go to mature to play more demanding roles but here she does well and does it all right the movie is not for kids due to high level of rude violence and adult themes touched upon,reality
is a french thriller film produced by luc beesons eurocorp it premiered in france on february 27th 2008 and it premiered in the united states on january 30th 2009 the cast is pretty lackluster and even liam neeson was not all the well known or popular at the movies inception but launched his career into fast forward and he is nearly a household name and probably considered an a list actorthe movie opens with former united states central intelligence agency operative bryan mills neeson saving an international pop star from an attacker after her performance to repay bryan the pop star agrees to mentor his daughter kim in signing kim soon wants to travel to paris with her friend bryan in no way wants the girls to and travel alone but in order to try to be closer with his daughter and not upset her he agrees with his ex wife to let her go the arrive at the airport and unknowingly make friends with a scout for a kidnapping gang kim and her friend are and trafficked as sex slaves kim was on the phone with her dad as she was so the former cia operative springs right into action and gets to europe bryan begins hunting them down and eventually saves his daughter after she was sold to a wealthy sheikh due to her virgin statusthis plot obviously is very gripping as well as cold and chilling as it gives a pretty realistic look into the world of sex trafficking in eastern europe these young girls have their entire lives in front of them and have it all away and are defiled they are treated worse than dirt as man after man after man pays a few bucks to have their way with them and like it is said in the movieif they are not found within 96 hours you will never be able to find them again they also do not have a secret agent killing everyone that holds them captive and freeing them because in real life people cannot do that only in movies does that happen they is virtually no way of finding these girls in real life once they are i would recommend this movie to a mature audience that can handle intense action sequences and some disturbing topics of prostitution i give this movie an 8 out of 10 a 7 out of 10 for the story and a 9 out of 10 for the action,reality

pierre morel film   is a 2008 action movie  starring liam nesson as the main character  at the beginning of the movie  bryan mills  liam nesson  a former cia refused to let kim his 17 year old daughter travel to paris with her friend  amanda lenore his exwife  convinced him to let kim go  if he wanted to gain her love  he then approved to her  and what he didnt know was that she was planning a europe tour  at the first scene of the film i felt uninterested by the intro  as for me i think its the most important part of any film  it also does not highlights more on amandas personality  although she was a crucial part of the plot  as kim and amanda were kidnapped by groups who uses women for sexual pleasure and slavery  the film started to gain my attention and had me in suspense and eager to find out what will happen next what i liked most about the movie was its moral theme  people should risk and go beyond the limits for their beloved ones  it teaches us to always be there for our close people  and help them when they are in danger with whatever it takes from risks or limits we go above from a negative point of the movie plot was when bryan went into the building of the gangs as a french ambassador  and then he speaks in the english language with them instead of french  also  lenore showed no signs of worry to her daughter  and did not insist in traveling with the father to look for her kidnapped child instead of sitting home waiting  i recommend these to movie goers whom like fast action and incredible fighting scenes with a hint of unrealistic action that will not cease to keep you amazed  also  i recommend  man on fire  directed by tony scott and  speed  directed by jan de bont if you liked this movie,reality

released in the us in january 2009 is one kickaxx movie in fact its the best ive seen in a long timethe plot liam neeson plays a retired cia agent whose 17yearold daughter is abducted by albanian sexslavers while vacationing in paris neeson immediately flies to paris and utilizes all his skills to find his daughter and mercilessly punish anyone involved in the sextrade who gets in his wayplays out like a james bond flick but without the goofiness and boring parts once neeson gets on the trail of the sexslavers its nonstop suspense and action until the endwhat makes the film work so well is that like neesons character in the story the viewer is left totally outraged by the sexslavers abduction of his daughter hence youre passionately rooting for him throughout the rest of the flickits true that neeson is a veritable onemanarmy in the film but its presented in such a way that the viewer is able to suspend disbelief in other words it seems believable more than that you want it to be believable because you want him to get his daughter back and annihilate the scumbags besides neeson is realistically portrayed as a father ruthlessly driven and pulling no punches he has the emotional edge and determination that the slavers lack hes an unstoppable force pure and simplethe film addresses a scary subject  the sexslave trade this really happens i know of two beautiful young girls locally who have disappeared while vacationing abroad one was in cancun and the other in africa the parents and siblings are left devastated and scarred for life what happened to the girls no one knows but the sexslave trade is a very real possibility not to mention the natalee holloway case urine van der sloot confessed in an interview that he sold natalee for 10000 and a boat came and picked her up this would explain why no remains have been found although he later retracked the statements the strong possibility remains that natalee may have been sold into the sexslave tradethe moral of is simple anyone involved in the sexslave trade deserves nothing but instant and merciless obliteration from this plane of existenceincidentally i read roger eberts review before seeing the film and he gave it a mediocre 254 star rating nothing could be further from the truth pulls you in and and takes you on an enthralling thrill ride throughout its runtime not to mention its well made on every level but lets remember that ebert gave the overrated and pretentious no country for old men a perfect 44 rating unbelievablethe film was shot on location in france and runs a shortbutsweet hour and a halfgrade a,reality
like i said in my summary above overall i found quite exciting and well paced and well and suitably paced through the entire movie also even though it is flawed regarding some of the action which lacks enough strength to make truly exciting however some of the action was fun to watch fortunately my favorite scene from the film is where liam neeson is in his car and drives on the streets at a crazy absolute full speed after the boat on which his abducted daughter was embarked unto including the scene seconds before that where hes seen running after the kidnappers for such a long time while he was running he made me think of the terminator running after his prey in terminator 2 hahahahaha before tiring himself out and finding the car ive just been talking about when i say he made me think of the terminator dont think im saying that i didnt like to see him run for so long because of that i found it heroic to see him run run and run and i dont care if he makes me think of the terminator as long as i like to see him running and that it gives me the tension i want the car scene was the absolute best because you could feel the tension of the ride there and it was nonstop driving for what looked andor felt on scope like 5 minutes to me when i watched it or at least 5 minutes is the first thing that would come to my mind if i had to say how much in minutes or seconds time did the car ride feel andor looked because of the long time it took my favorite quote is i will tear down the eiffel tower if i have to because of the dialogue to which it connects to im not telling the dialogue in case of spoilers for those who havent seen the film for the family conflict it is well developed and fun to watch and hear how the characters father mother and daughter each behaves and reacts as a consequence of anothers action and there is also a strong performance from bryan millsexwife when she discovers news about her daughter being she performs perfectly and just the way you would expect a mother to behave when her childs been everyone is well cast my recommendation to you if youve never seen is far from being unmissable but you will nonetheless still find some good thrills to hang around with at least you have to just dont expect the action whenever it comes to involve your brain at a high rate,reality
is an action thriller film which features the recognized action star liam neeson as the father of maggie grace his 18 year old daughter who longs to travel to france encouraged by her mother famke janssen who is remarried to maggies stepfather xander berkely the start of the movie is set in america in 2009 until kim maggie grace travels to france where the remainder of the movie is set brian mills liam neeson is a former cia agent who is struggling to come to terms with his divorce and is trying to keep a good relationship with his daughter kim maggie grace kim is a teenager and wants to travel to france with a friend from school kims mom lenore famke janssen is encouraging this trip along with kims wealthy stepfather stuart xander berkely contrary to what brain believes to be best for his daughter after much convincing brian allows this trip to happen and gives kim a plethora of safety precautions in order to stay safe however upon kims arrival in france she and her friend take a taxi with a man who once he finds out where they are staying eventually comes back to kidnap them during the kidnapping kim is on the phone to brain and he knows exactly how to handle this situation kim is brought into the human trafficking industry and brian must bring back his previous cia training in order to make it to his daughter before it is too latea lot of this movie shows brian using his special training to get to what he wants his daughter kim the actions scenes keep the audience on their toes one scene in particular where the filmmaking was crucial was in one of the final scenes where brian comes face to face with a man who had purchased his daughter in order to reach this man brian had to have many violent fights the music was suspenseful and the sound effects made it seem extremely realistic the fast paced camera switch ups between the villains and brian also kept a high energy when brian finally made it to the man who was in control of his daughter the suspense is extremely high this energy is maintained by the suspenseful music and the gunshots exchanged in the fight was an action film that kept me guessing throughout the entirety of the movie it was refreshing to see an action movie that stayed true to the plot without being predictable and was also based upon true events usually i try to stay away from stereotypical action movies but this one definitely captured my interest kept me guessing and left me wanting more,reality
marking the dawn of a new era in liam neesons acting career by reinventing his image and establishing him as a capable  charismatic action film star is a purely generic action thriller thats filled with all the known elements of action filmmaking and has nothing new to offer but thanks to neesons stellar performance it still makes up for a damn good ridethe story of follows a retired cia agent named bryan mills whos trying to strengthen his relationship with his estranged daughter whos leaving for paris with her best friend but when both of them are kidnapped by human traffickers for sex slavery mills is compelled to go after the kidnappers and relies on his old skills to track them down before its too latecowritten by luc besson  directed by pierre morel wastes no time in setting up its plot and once it gets going it doesnt stop until the very end the direction is slick script is almost always focused on its lead character its moments of action definitely benefit from its kinetic camerawork while its tight editing makes sure that the narrative unfolds at a frenetic pacecoming to the performances is liam neesons show all the way for the actor returns to form in grand style and delivers a swashbuckling performance which despite being over thetop at several instances resonates a charm of its own for neeson is believable as both an merciless assassin  a protective father other than him however the supporting cast is dull  dont have much to contributeon an overall scale may not feature any moment that any action fanatic hasnt seen before but watching liam neeson beat everyone to a pulp is something that turns out to be refreshing  rewarding at the same time stylishly crafted fiercely paced  elevated to new heights by neesons impressive input is an unexpected surprise  an undeniable fun flick that lives up to its cult status definitely worth a shot,reality
well i dont really know what to say about this movie it was very different i can say that i got it on dvd recently and watched it the next day and enjoyed it very much i mean by different i dont mean it was bad but it was a little disturbing ill start out with the general comments like i almost always do liam neeson played a believable dad searching for his daughter and played the role very well interesting fact he was a dad he was close to the age of the man he was playing and thats where he got his motivation for the movie famke janssen did a great job as lenore the annoying pushy and not very likable mother of kim mills neesons daughter maggie grace did an astounding job as kim mills the girl that is abducted since those are the main characters all i can say is the acting by the rest of the actors is very good take my word for it the special effects and action scenes were also very well executed they were very real looking throughout the movie and added a high level of intensity to the film not that it needed it the whole film was intense and full of action but im talking about the scenes where there are tons of explosions on a high scale specific comments i will say now this movie is a stark realization of how disgusting the world truly is saying that because this really happens some people i knows greatest fear is exactly what happened in the movie i can say if this happened to me i would be deeply scarred for the rest of my life how about you pierre morel is that how you spell it did a wonderful job directing this movie and even better he doesnt speak any english making an american movie skills anyway if you are squeamish or easily disturbed do yourself a favor and not watch this movie if you arent and have a liking for great movies then go ahead and watch it i recommend it very strongly to you this was a great movie and will watch it again sometime and enjoy it again thanks for reading and check out some of my other reviews too,reality
in neeson proves himself a true action hero as he fights his way across europe to save his daughter in this action packed thriller i must admit i wasnt entirely sure how good the film would be id read a couple reviews but still wasnt sure about neeson taking ha ha the lead role as an action hero let me say now that all uncertainty is now well and truly gone is a truly excellent action thriller with neeson giving a great performance in a role i could best describe as james bond if he was retired with a family the action never lets up and is pushed forward by a more compelling motive than most films of its type as a father races to save his daughter stopping at nothing to get her back with certainty i can say that was a pleasant surprise and a most definite hit for me a hearty recommendation for a more unique action thriller then i have seen in a good while,reality
i gave this movie a 7 rating based upon bryan mills liam neeson and his die hard tactics alone at the beginning of this flick i was ready to pull the plug and call it a bust but im glad i hung in there still the only compelling part of this movie was bryan mills tenacity resourcefulness and ability to kick a the movie started very slow and uninteresting im well aware that movies need some character build up time but i found that i didnt like the characters when a spoiled girl with the help of her mother lies to trick her father into letting her go to paris with another equally young and naive girl only to be kidnapped we tend to say you make your bed you lie in it you reap what you sow is also applicable in other words all that was going through my head was far less deserving girls have gotten kidnapped and im supposed to care about you so to start i wasnt all that sympathetic nor was i moved to fully root for bryan mills to buck all oddsmy attitude soon changed it didnt change because i saw the purity and innocence of his daughter it changed once i began to see the sheer creepery or should i say creepness of the characters involved in the kidnapping then and only then did i want to see faces smashed pain inflicted and overall destruction i dont think it was liam neesons acting so much as it was the script that depicted bryan mills utter desperation and atallcosts willingness to get his daughter backthis movie was a cross between hostel and man on fire and it was still able to have a unique enough flare to separate it from those two a vigilante film done well is always good in my book,reality
the film star is all kinds of bad ass in this grim intense action flick which could be described as a very lean and very mean james bond type of film its so briskly paced and action packed that it clocks in at a very trim 91 minutes and it only runs an extra two minutes in the unrated extended cut if it does its job you wont be thinking about how implausible any of it might be  youll just be wolfing down the popcorn and having a high old timeneeson plays bryan mills a retired cia operative whos left the business to make up for lost time with his now teen aged daughter kim maggie grace she gets an opportunity to travel to europe and the protective cautious dad is dubious about the whole thing especially upon learning of the lack of parental figures on this trip of course hes proved right as the hapless girl is abducted by albanian human traffickers he gets his ass to paris and leaves a trail of death and destruction in his wake as he does everything he has to do to save his girlas long as one is looking for some undemanding nobrainer violent fun they can quite enjoy it definitely doesnt waste its time once its gets going it is a little slow to start as it establishes bryan trying to be a cool dad and making a living performing such duties as security for a pop star holly valance but when bryan gets moving the movie turns into a wild ride with plentiful scummy bad guys who cant die soon enough its also amusing to note how ruthless bryan can be the man doesnt care who he has to shoot in order to get what he wants some viewers may find the activities of the bad guys to be quite off putting especially considering the fact that they place a high value on virgins editing location work and photography are all well done and a good supporting cast including some familiar faces leland orser jon gries xander berkeley and the lovely as ever famke janssen as bryans ex wife all help to make this agreeable escapismas far as this kind of entertainment goes one could certainly do a lot worseseven out of 10,reality
i watched on a library dvd after watching earlier sets more of the scene of the retired cia agent trying to stay near his 17yr old daughter while being the exhusband and much poorer than the stepfather he has his daughters best interests at heart as other reviewers have noted watch the story unfold and dont think about the props and action scenes iaam is great and always finds the weapons technology and people just in time the location and action scenes are lovely as well as dark his buddies are helpful and funny the rescue scenes are physically brutal as well as the shooting particularly in the french agents house,reality

revolves around a retired spy whose daughter is kidnapped by a human trafficking ring in paris naturally he hops the first plane to paris in order to dole out some serious asskickingthe plot may be pretty contrived but that sort of deficiency probably wont make much difference to the kind of viewer that this film is aimed at as a revenge flick promising an abundance of action the film delivers on that promise though seasoned viewers have probably seen this sort of thing countless times alreadyliam neeson is pretty good here and handles the role better than i would have expected theres not really anything awardsworthy in his performance but thats mainly due to being limited by the material other than neeson only famke janssen really stands outpierre morels direction is in the current action flick mold and is solid as far as that goes gratuitous cutting doesnt detract from the flick except in the case of one chase scene the score is decent enough but unremarkablewhen it comes down to it is the sort of action movie that does its job well but takes no chances the films high rating 79 at the time of this writing suggests that there might be more to it but that isnt the case as far as im concerned nevertheless im sure that action fans will eat it up,reality
this was a welltold kidnapping story but the story has been told so many times i was really expecting a story with a twitch but it was all straight forward short version the girl goes to paris and get kidnapped her father happens to be retired special agent and gets back in action to find her ok you should see it it is packed with action both car chases fighting shootouts and the underdog winning in the end just dont expect to be challenged on the story line realistic view on trafficking and can be viewed as a way of raising attention to the problem but the they would never start to pick random girls of the airport would just cost to much attention,reality
6 out of 10 comes this close to being great it had an admittedly rocky start with liam neeson is trying to reconnect with his virginal 17 yearold teenage daughter in a way that seems just on this side of creepy dude get your own girlfriend really speaking of which swarthy bad guys who clearly have never heard of nancy grace are kidnapping rich american girls and making them drugged out street walkers or selling them for millions to arab sheiks based on whether they are virgins or not so excia estranged father liam neeson has 96 hours to find his daughter before she is gone forever deflowered and then burkaized apparently a fate worse than death you can almost hear the characters thinkingits as if charles bronson was guest starring in an ilsa the wicked warden film located in george c scotts hardcore and the entire enterprise was pg13 and yet the film still works two thirds through liam neeson is more than fine he is kicking ass on all cylinders its the bad guys that drop the ballfirst a rich french guy starts quoting the godfather its not personal its business for starters the quote isnt even in context he might as well have told the gun toting liam neeson may the force be with you for all the sense it makes second of all you cant quote the godfather without referencing the fact that you are quoting it in the first place any screenwriter who does that should be sleeping with the fishesthe second slap to the head is an arab sheik character that looked like he stepped out of a 1940s bugs bunny cartoon honestly i dont know where to begin on this silly stereotype why is he the film why does he have a knife to the white virgins throat who would oscar schindler shoot the last point seems important since the arab is basically a juden in a dress same large noses same aversion to pork same living in ghettos in europe orand having all the money same secret organizations paying off french politicians same affinity to despoiling white aryan virgins the more things change the more the stay the same i guess they didnt have the arab cook and eat a baby i guess they are holding that back for the sequel overt french xenophobia aside is a fun ride for most of the trip the dinner with his french policeman friend and frenchmans wife was a particular highlight and as i did mention liam neeson kicks ass,reality
contains very little plot gets kind of ridiculous at times and is quite predictable its also a fun fastpaced revenge movie with lots of good kinetic action sequences and unfolds at a brisk pace rarely drags and is never really boring its an exhilarating nonstop roller coaster ride of a movie that never lets uphas a european sensibility like other luc besson produced films have had in the past its basically a well shot glorified bfilm that is skillfully directed the movie should be appreciated this way and definitely should seen as seriousliam neeson adds much needed credibility to a film that a lesser actor couldnt bring,reality
very few action movies have a very strong emotional motive for the protagonist the protagonist of has a very strong emotional motive he is after all trying to save his kidnapped daughter from a sex trafficking gang the bad guys in are lets say  pretty bad they evoke no sympathy and it is a treat to see them smashed to pulp every blow every bullet every kick is slick fast and if i can say so  extremely enjoyable in it is fun to see someone really take on the bad guys and hand it to them in their own cointhe plot is pretty predictable bryansliam nesson daughter is kidnapped by an albanian sex trafficking gang in paris bryan a former cia agent goes on a no holds barred rescue mission to save his daughter all hell breaks loose that is for the bad guys the body count is pretty high  my guess is that it is more than 50 no prizes for predicting the finale  the bad guys pay dearly  real bad i must say the plot is not the highlight of the movie the acting is good liam nesson does a good job this is often exactly the kind of role tailor made for harrison ford but liam nesson does a neat job here i am not a big fan of flash editing but it seems to work well in this movie the action scenes like i said before are really good even though they are pretty violent i would give a movie like this a 6 out of 10 but i am inclined to give this movie a 8 just for sheer edge of seat engrossing action,reality
i repeat a very bad movie many people left before the end and those who remained sitting were laughing and applauding comic action scenes all long paris must be the capital of all albania mafia and there is only one american good guy to kill them and save his daughter every character is a parody the beautiful and innocent teenager the insensitive rich exwife corrupted cops tattooed bad boys etc luc besson did not understood yet that he can not make a good movie from a bad and ridiculous script he tells stories this absurd what for its also some kind of dj vu from his old action movies but with less budget maggie grace and famke janssen were probably just happy they had such small parts sorry for liamneeson who is a tremendous actor you people are warned it is a bad movie,reality
one of these days other countries will have a movie industry strong enough to rival hollywood then we will see movies about heroic dark skinned folk torturing and killing corrupt westerners how will that make us feel i wonder got to admit that this movie worried me even more reading that a few reviewers on here thought it a revealing glimpse of the sex industry rich tourists visiting france do not get kidnapped drugged and sold to arabs outside the pages of an especially dumb comic in reality women from impoverished countries are brought over here to be abused by westerners a horrible xenophobic movies used to justify the torture by the cia and simplify the international situation into good vs evildrop more bombs on the swine and their kids,reality
thanks for making a movie that is fun to watch enough slumdog enough art in the movies just make something that is entertaining this is it love the electric chair i think i will use that when i nab the graffiti clowns on my streetlololol sure would be fun liam did a great jobhis humble character was played to perfection sure there were holes in the plot and unrealistic action scenes so whatit had great action bad guys that were believable i really had fun watching it and didnt mind spending 20 today more of this and less of gay cowboys liberal tilted movies about presidents anti war movies etc the woman who played his ex wife was excellent and a hottie i would think we would see a lot more of her in the future this character played by liam can be around for a long time i hope hollywood is smart enough to make this character a yearly movie event,reality
just finished watching this superb film literally ten minutes agois probably this years most underrated film easily for a person whom enjoyed the dark knight wanted although after watching it for the second time i realised how stupid it actually was hellboy 2 and cloverfieldall movies which i thoroughly enjoyed and would say are probably in my top 100 fave of all timei had put off watching for a while purely because i hated maggie grace from lost but youll be glad to know her role although it is a main role it isnt really huge in appearances shes there at the start and shes there at the end personally overall i think she was actually a good actress in the film portrayed a young innocent girl quite well hell  even lied really well is basically about an ex marinemercanery liam neeson whom unreluctantly lets his 17 year old girl maggie grace and her friend who go to paris upon arriving to paris they are kidnapped by women trafficers whom kidnap women get them addicted to drugs and either make them prostitutes or sell them on to others the 17 year old girl makes a quick phone call to her father liam neeson screaming that she is being kidnapped the father gets a flight into paris to get her back using his mercanery experience he goes deep into the underworld of paris to look for clues and information to his daughters whereaboutsbut what makes so much better than wanted and etc its realistic and it shows the world a real problem the world is facing it isnt about a secret agent who goes against his governmentcountry to get revenge for a girl he knew for like ten minutes it isnt about a slack job office boy who becomes a lethal bullet bending assassin in twenty minutes it is a simple realistic movie that honestly takes you down into the shallowest darkest places of paris and shows you just how harsh the real world is it doesnt sugar coat it it doesnt americanize it by americanize i mean dumb it down go over the top or make it unbelievable  it simply shows the viewer just how lethal and scary the underworld can beanyone who enjoys a good action movie something with a compelling story will love this film it doesnt have any stupid over the top action scenes liam neeson doesnt have any outrageous gadgets he doesnt have super powers hes simply a father wants to find his daughter and to find her he is willing to do anything in the worldwatch this movie you will love it trust me1010,reality
i saw the trailer for this movie and really thought it would be great it was pretty good but fell into a few movie clichs and suffered from poor acting from most everyone but neelson this was especially true from all the scenes in paristhe acting and occasional plot hole aside this was a good action flick several reviews have pointed to the bourne movies and it does have that spy character who is ready for any situation unfortunately this movie doesnt get nearly as deep or even pretend to build characters instead this movie focuses on a father who just happens to as the trailer notes have a particular skill set that enables him to track down and deal with peoplethere is some exposure to sex trafficking but that only goes as deep as it needs to find his daughter i recommend this movie just dont pay 1200 to see it check out a matine or rent it,reality
i like good action movie and man this is one liam neeson one of the best hollywood actors once again shined in his role from the first scene till the last this movie has one thing that maybe a few movies have and thats edge of the seat action non stopits not like some other action movie whit bold plot and hundreds of bullets fired no this is intelligent movie in every aspectliam is terrific the way he handless the role i take a bow to him masterit deals with modern disease kidnapping of young people and selling them director did a great job he filmed it perfectly i recommend you this one you will not regret i didnt give 10 to almost not one movie but i had to give it to this one i am saying once again this is the movie,reality
it really is a completely badass well written perfectly paced excellently cast thrillerliam neeson much to many people surprise including mine is just as solid if not more in this role as daniel craig in casino royale or matt damon in the bourne filmsdefinitely worth checking out hope the studio gives this a wide release in january and the film gets its duesolid thriller high recommended i only watch a handful of action flicks a year because the majority are such crap but this one was damn good,reality
man that was amazing liam neeson in a movie like he had never be very good actionthriller combo a huge kick ass surprise a must see in every opinion now for real i never toughed that an actor like neeson can do something like this one of my favorite acting he made once was schindlers list and he is back again after years full of nothing special ok maybe star wars flick was there but it has nothing to do with this man here a new kind of neeson can we see there and i think everybody who likes action movies like the new bond and bourne says the same as iam holy sht that was super im waiting for the next project with mr spielberg lincoln too,reality
i just had an inkling as to what this would be about and nothing else so going to watch this was a total surprise and more watching holly valance who i had last seen in the australian tv soap neighbours all those years backa former spy who is separated from his wife allows his 17 year old daughter to go to paris with her friend believing that she is going to watch the group u2 performing in europe but soon finds out that shes been kidnappedstarring liam neeson maggie grace famke janssen and holly valance the movie is directed by pierre more and is written by luc besson and robert mark kamenbesides being a good action  thriller this also deals with what has been on the increase over the last few years and that is women trafficking through europe with organised gangs and also shows the internal sides of this with the use of drugs and how women are sold into prostitution off course there are other methods that the organised gangs have been known to use but this just shows how easy it is for them to trap women into this this is what pierre more has really highlighted extremely well and even goes on to show that this can happen in the most romantic city in the world paris it makes one think that about these women working they way they do what many consider to be the oldest profession in the world what is their original back ground and how they have managed to reach in cities such as the red light districts of amsterdam and other major cities as well as being sold to wealthy individualsthere are some very good action sequences and some are breath taking as well not to mention that use of sophisticated gadgets may make one remember a bit of james bondfilmed in france this does contain topic of sexual and drugs related nature as well as violence in relation to that and many may find some scenes rather distressing therefore watch out for parental advice or the certificate rating but never the less this is a movie that does contain good action and is worth watching,reality
and tackle someone and shoot themthis movie has a slightly slow start and you feel slightly sorry for liam neesons character as things with life just all seem to go against him only to soon after have his daughter kidnapped in france as part of the sex tradeneeson goes after her after what would frighten any parent hearing the kidnapping of his child whilst on the phone to her neeson stops at nothing to get her backthis is where the pace of the movie accelerates 10 fold it does not stop it just goes and goes you have a feeling of satisfaction as each person is killed by neeson knowing what they support thats what you want to happen to themthen towards the end liam jumps through a window to reach them because there is no other way you just wanna try it yourselfthe action in this movie is great the performances great especially by liam neeson i cant wait for this to come out on dvd definitely a great watch,reality
here comes a movie that will really move you and will keep you on the edge of your seats thats for sure it shows how a movie based on a simple plot could look like when played by a powerful performer liam neeson at the start of the movie it didnt seem that there will be much to watch but as the movie progresses you will not blink your eye for a second its a must watch and i bet it is far more better then the professional the movie was mostly filmed in france and the action sequences of the movie are well balanced and intense liams performance was worthy of its character and a lot more action then i think liam has ever done before way to go leam yet another great flick after man on fire,reality
liam neeson badass hell yeah he is believe it or not neeson stars in the best nonsuperhero action movie of the year this movie was the outofnowhere surprise of the year ive been hoping foras an exgovernment agent out to find and rescue his kidnapped daughter neesons character is like jason bourne and jack bauer combined except that this guy could take either of those two down in a heartbeat hes skilled intense and wont hesitate to take down anyone who stands between him and his daughterthis film opens in the us in september and its a shame that it is getting virtually no promotion neeson isnt the biggest box office draw much less as an action star but i urge everyone out there to give this a chance its a thrilling actiondrama that truly impressed me and its full of moments that make your jaw drop make you cheer and make you yell daaaaaaamn,reality
in an age where mainstream action heroes could do with a little oneon one time with a psychiatrist this hugely successful frenchamerican crossover brings back the ethics of a seagal or stallone  break an arm in three places first ask questions later whereas now i can look back at the 1980s action genre with a semi guiltridden smirk and amuse myself at the questionable politics takes itself very seriously trying to disguise its straighttodvd credentials as something cleaner more topical the topic is people trafficking but there are too many stubbly tattooed foreign bad guys to torture and kill for it to become anything profound he just wants his daughter backforced into retirement from the cia to be closer to his daughter kim maggie grace bryan mills liam neeson earns his money from security jobs with his fellow retirees his exwife lenore famke janssen is now shacked up with her millionaire husband and announces that kim wants to travel to paris with her fellow 17 year old friend mills having seen the evil in the world due to his job opposes the trip but eventually agrees under some strict guidelines naturally upon arrival kim and her friend are kidnapped while kim is on the phone to her father who takes various clues from the phone call to aid him on his quest to get her backthis was my second viewing of as i felt like i needed to watch it again after being perplexed by the almost universal praise this received from audiences i was amazed the first time around at the sheer audacity of the films racial stereotypes and the shakethecameraalot approach to the action scenes the second time i enjoyed it a lot more  but as a comedy there is simply too many plotholes and general laziness for it to be remotely seriously and the now infamous phone call scene spouting some classic lines when talking to the kidnapper  if youre looking for a ransom i can tell you i dont have any money but what i do have are a particular set of skills skills i have acquired over a very long career its almost too bad to comprehendwhat confused me most is the message behind this movie as it seems that mills overprotective almost racist in context of his views of any countries outside of america father is proved to be correct when kim gets kidnapped by some sleazy french people yes yes i know this was made by french people but even they are portrayed in a stereotypical manner with mills police contact um jeanclaude olivier rabourdin looking like hes stepped straight out of a jeanluc godard movie and is looking for his baguette beret and necklace of onions then theres the sleazy albanians smoking cigarettes in string vests and the sleazy middleeasterners including a grossly fat sheikh who looks like hes wandered off the set of the thief of bagdad of course the americans arent sleazy just spoilt and bullyinghow this is so highlypraised is beyond me as every aspect of the film is awful i could understand people warming to its cheddarcaked charm and quotable script this is not the time for dkmeasuring but other reviews ive read on imdb take this film seriously as if it was some kind of steppingstone in action cinema well its not its a steaming pile of unoriginal turd returning to an ohsosimple tale of revenge set in the modernworld of continental tension and american interference a minor pluspoint is neeson who gets through this surprisingly unscathed given the bilge he has to work with and manages to reinvent himself as an action star he went on to star in the grey and 2  both 2012 but i think ive finally understood the moral of this story and its one i can agree with  dont go to francewwwthewrathofblogblogspotcom,reality

if you are able to to suspend your disbelief for the duration of this film you may enjoy it otherwise youre highly likely as i did to spend the whole time shouting i just dont believe it a sampling of the episodes in this film that provoke disbelief although he has flown to france at little more than two hours notice the leeson character just happens to have brought a full drug detox kit with him  which comes in handyalthough he has supposedly been retired for some time he possesses credible false id as a french policeman he appears to be able to speak french well enough to pass as said policemanhe is able to drive at high speed the wrong way down a busy embankment road in the centre of paris without hitting any of the dozens of vehicles coming in the other directionhe kills maims or disables at least two dozen adversaries without up to the very end receiving as much as a flesh wound despite most of his opponents being heavily armed they cant hit him yet he always hits themand so oni just dont believe it,reality
its a real shame that an actor of liam neesoms talent cant be given better scripts the dialogue is hackneyed and the film just relies on action and fight scenes of the type seen in a thousand other moviesthis is exactly the sort of film steven segal would star in and the only thing stopping this going straight to dvd is the presence of mr neesomthis film could have been so much better if the director hadnt tried to pack so much in and only americans must believe that you can run up such an impressive body count and then just get a commercial flight back to the usathere are much better films dealing with eastern european gangsters and much better action films only watch this if you have time to waste,reality
i watched last night and even though nearly 20 hours have passed since then my blood is still pumping to my heart at a vastly increased speed thats how exciting and adrenalinrushing this brand new and brilliant frenchamerican coproduction is courtesy of the extremely gifted writers luc besson leon the fifth element and robert mark kramen the transporter the karate kid this is easily the most spectacular and nonstop exhilarating movie of the past five years or so even surpassing the high quality and intensity level of the bourne trilogy the newest die hard sequel and all movies starring jason statham the concept of covers the derivative formula of a rudimentary kidnapping movie but what truly matters here is the unceasing fastpaced violence and the testosteronepacked performance of liam neeson he stars as a retired spy for the us government who desperately tries to get in touch again with his estranged and heavily spoiled teenage daughter when the girl and a friend travel to paris against bryans will they promptly become abducted by an albanian network of drugs and network bryan has only 96 hours to save his girl but barely a clue where or how to start his investigation luckily enough bryan is a trained fighting specialist with connections all over the world is somewhat similar to roman polanskis late 80s thriller frantic story and settingwise but the speed and stunts are typically luc besson obviously this isnt the most plausible movie ever made but i dont even think youre even supposed to believe half of what you see just sit back and enjoy the ride is a smrgsbord of virulent car chases fistfights martial arts explosions sweet torturing methods and ultrarevolting bad guys fantastic stuff,reality
on thing that is a sure as the sun coming up tomorrow is that a film written by luc besson will be thrilling theres taxi 14 transporter 13 leon the professional and many more this is just another one of bessons magical films that will thrill you from start to finishdarkman himself liam neeson is magnificent as a father that will do anything for his daughter kim maggie grace when she is for the sex trade he springs into action that keeps you on the edge of your seat until the endi have seen some very good films about the sex trade mira sorvino in human trafficking and kevin kline in trade but neeson is at the top of the game in tracking though the muck of this business to get to the top we see all levels of the business on the way and we glimpse the dregs of humanity in the processrealistic car chases plenty of scum left on the floor and some very satisfying justice makes this the most incredible 93 minutes you can experience,reality
a previous comment was titled neeson is the vodka of james bonds martini truer words could not be spoken i cant think of any bond film that was more satisfying and i love bond the connery originalsis a superb action film with substance every scene will keep you riveted to your seat some of the scenes are literally breathtaking the screenplay was expertly written beautifully filmed and superbly editedlian neeson is in usual top form and was a perfect choice this is the same actor who gave us schindler and ethan frome i wont waste words on plot  other comments have already made that clearthe high votes for this very satisfying film are more than welldeserved one of the best ive seen in a while not to be missed,reality
so i see this new movie out an action flick with liam neesonhis daughter kidnapped hmmmhas potential its an inherently suspenseful situation i like liam work to date so yea ill go wished i hadnt to many issues with the plot without being a spoiler things like he has special buddies why arent they helping these bad guys obviously do this a lot so why the screw up with the friend lastly why no repercussions for the violence lastly and most negatively why the shakeycam i can not stand this technique of filming an action scene just because you can use this method doesnt mean its always a good idea in some places its ok but this director uses it for every scene is this a way to avoid hiring stunt men liams acting is on center stage and it is ok i was hoping for a bit more emotional turmoil or intensity the issues with the story and the poor directing choices left me unsatisfied 5plot7acting4dir6fx5 entertainment  54,reality
a movie has come out that kept me interested from beginning to end i did have my doubts about this movie but people if you like action that is realistic pure and honest then this is a must see the previews for this movie truly do not give you an insight on what the movie is about besides the fact that liam neeson plays a bad ass and his goal is to save his daughter but beyond that what his daughter has to go through herself is a movie within itselfthis movie stayed on my mind for a couple days and i applaud it for its brutal honesty i did not give it a 1010 because with every action movie there are a few slip ups of an unrealistic happening as that does happen twice in this movie with a very fast pace that you almost dont even have a chance to think about it,reality
just enough information about the characters and their relationship with each other is given to us before a this fast action packed story has you glued to the screen liam neesons character for me is a cross between jason bourne and frank castle he manages to make the roll more believable and human which gives more of a sense of what a parentspecial agent will do for their kid whos lifes in danger and the paybacks also catches you buy surprise when your expecting a little mercy towards the bgs neeson pulls off the fight scenes with ease and comes across as one super bad ass which isnt hard to imagine if you have scene batman begins michael collins or rob roy this film for me plays out like a joint of rob hoods style of minimal techno  unique no bs and straight to the point,reality
2008 is it better to evaluate a movie on whats good about it or is it better to judge a movie on whats bad about it if 23s of a movie are competently entertaining but another third shockingly dreadful does the good still outweigh the bad thats the issue with the new luc bessonpierre morrel liam neeson starring vehicle neeson plays bryan a former spyassassin of the government sort hes retired now living in california to be close to his daughter who lives with her mother and step father in a lavish mansion she wants to go to france with a friend and she needs her fathers permission hes hesitant but lets her go only to find out shes actually following u2 around adding to his nervousness of course hes right to be nervous as she is kidnapped immediately after settling into the city this occurs while hes on the phone with her which conveniently has been recorded so that his exassassin buddies can analyze the call pinpoint that the kidnappers speak albanian with an accent they can apparently narrow down to one village and then determine that the man speaking into the phone is named marco with this information he travels to paris to search out his daughter employing his mad skillswhile there he pieces together one by one who is behind it finds them finds where the girl has gone kills a lot of people and then well i wont spoil it but im sure you know where this is going the plot line in the picture is very very standard allow me to quote film critic jules brenner in his review of just calling this formulaic doesnt cover it the script should be credited to the computer software template that originated it now that is a gem of a soundbyte its also pretty much bang on besson never really takes any time to seriously look at a very serious subject its just a conduit through which he can insert standard action movie happenings just because a movie is made in europe doesnt mean its any less prone to hollywood clichsin describing the movie im realizing more than i did when i started writing how mediocre the actual story is in the film but for 23s of the movie you can kind of forget about that most of the time fact is the action sequences are quite well done and director morrel realizes that the key to keeping the audience from realizing just how predictable and substandard his story really is is to never give them a chance to think about it the film moves at breakneck speed and when the hunt is really on its quite entertainingliam neeson goes from totally unbelievable to mildly believable by the end of the movie he gives a good performance but sometimes hes a bit of a distraction question is he american or british here sometime he doesnt seem to speak with an accent others he clearly does all his ex assassin friends are american save for a french guy in france he lives in the us and his american wife refers to him sacrificing for the good of the country anyway thats irrelevantso thats whats good about now the bad well weve established that the plot originated from a standard action movie template its got the usual foreign baddies and fat cat arabs lusting for western virgins and for an underground human smuggling operation its surprisingly easy to find oh and of course the bad guys all have terrible aim while the good guys is dead on  but thats so old hat in any movie with a gun fight i probably just wasted 20 seconds typing this out so this is all forgivable given the success of the nonstop action in denying us the opportunity to reflect on the plot whats not forgivable is just how shockingly awful the first half hour of is how bad is it i dont even know if i can describe it things really go down hill when a bunch of cheery wildly unbelievable former assassins show up at neesons door with beer and chips and hotdogs for a bbq they chat nonchalantly about jobs in beirut and so on and so forth the effect can only be described as unintentionally hilarious or perhaps the most unbelievably miscalculated plot point since micky rooney played an asian in breakfast at tiffanisthen there is the daughter and her friend i dont know if theyre bad actors or just entirely at the mercy of the worst written characters ive ever seen in a film with such prestige for that matter i assume besson must have wrote in french then translated to english lost in translation is the only conception i have to explain such awful lines theyre there i can hear them its no word of a lie that i almost walked out after the opening third confused as to whether give half a star for sheer ineptitude or 5 for being the funniest comedy id seen in agesbut i stuck it out i guess im glad i did in the end yes i was entertained then i had the opening conundrum i was really almost ready to give a mild pass but now that ive come to the end of the review ive been given the time to reflect and is still dogmatically formulaic maybe if you dont think about it afterward youll be satisfied unfortunately for me i thought about it,reality
id like to say this before i start reviewing this movie i love action movies i really do i have no problem with campy stories or heroes singlehandedly defeating masses of villains plot holes or violation of physical laws are acceptable to me as long as i dont feel messed around with so while i have no problem with bourne or james bond movies is an entirely different caliberlet us imagine you were an experienced ex secret agent specialized in antiterrorism you still got excellent contacts to other agents now imagine your daughter was kidnapped by brutal human traffickers in a foreign country do you go alone without backup or do you alert some friends just in the case you know that you are killed and no one is left to save your daughter or something like thatnow lets imagine you identified a suspect do you ambush him in bright daylight and violently shove him into a public taxi and start to torture him in the backseat right in front of an international airport or do you at least follow him for a while so you might not draw not unwanted attention and easily gather more info about the suspect and his contactsfurthermore imagine you actually captured the last surviving bad guy after you killed all of his buddies which unfortunately makes his knowledge the only chance left to find your daughter do you torture him with subcutaneous electrodes and 110 volts of alternating current 9 volts from a battery can kill you when the current is applied subcutaneous coming right away from the power grid and risk to kill your only source of information do you kill said bad guy right after the first answer he gives you without verifying its truth would you repeat same procedure killing of your only source of information before verification of his statements if you answered all questions above with yes congrats you perfectly qualify for the cias anti terrorism branchthis movie is completely based on an ignorant close minded world view filled with exceptional examples of stupidity human traffickers go routinely after people right in front of the paris airport the classical super zoom image enhancement which is about as believable as outrunning a nuclear explosion is to a new level here a roadside automate does what the csi at least needs a computer lab for tries hard to look badass and clever but in truth it is so stupid its offensive,reality
i told you so would be an understatement for liam neesons character excia operative bryan mills in the film mills retires from his job to spend more time with his 17yearold daughter kim who now lives with her mother and wealthy stepfather kim plans to travel to paris and seeks her fathers permission but he is worried about her safety kims disappointment and the anger of his exwife convince mills to change his mindhowever almost as soon as kim arrives in paris she is kidnapped now mills is faced with his worst fear losing his daughter he uses the skills he learned from his job to track down her captorsdoes not have much of a storyline and what little plot it has is clichd and predictable nor does the film feature original developed characters the audience is forced to put up with the seemingly superhuman mills his spiteful exwife the naive spoiled kim and the inept bad guys consequently relies on action and some suspense to engage its viewers perhaps the best scene of the movie is kims kidnapping in which the element of suspense is executed very wellunfortunately the strengths of the film are negated by the ending which i can only describe as terrible there is a complete change in mood and there is no transition for the change to make sense the finale also leaves many loose ends and seems to question the audiences intelligence with the amount of liberties it takesbottom line expect a mildly entertaining action flick with onedimensional characters a dull script and a predictable plot,reality
if youve ever seen the stone merchant youll find that this movie has a similar message to show you its about the estranged main character everybody laughing behind his back trying to warn his beloved ones about the in his eyes apparent danger out there in the end every warning uttered turns out to be true and the unbelievers are at faultin the stone merchant it was about throwing mud at islam whereas just seem to encourage oldfashioned paranoia dont talk to strangers is the message and i loathe it what kind of life does that leave you withthe girl went to france for chrissakes not somalia is america really safer and not only does the fathers warning words come true they come true within the first 20 minutes after her plane lands i mean what are the odds makes me think the father hired the thugs just to make his pointthis plot is so obvious and unintelligent it effectively kills any other qualities the movie might have hadif you like the concept though watch man on fire it takes place in the right country for starters,reality
this movie from beginning to finish was excellent i didnt want it to end and that was the only bad part it was short i guess but the movie is so good that you cant help but love every minute of it liam gives bourne a run for his money and you cant help sorry for the redundancy for lack of a better word but root for him im going to enjoy watching the movie over and over and also getting it on dvd andor blu ray whichever comes out first lol at the beginning i did not know what to expect but i had already seen the teaser trailer so i figured it would be a movie i would want to watch i was not disappointed to say the least great casting wonderful acting and all the action that summer needs what more could one ask for lol i think i just found another new favorite actor in liam alongside nic cage loved it,reality
someday someone will have to explain to me why an actor who starred in and indeed received an academy award nomination for his performance in one of the greatest movies ever made a move that will be watched as long as movies are watched schindlers list would waste his time and very real talents appearing in this embarrassing collection of clichs and cheap thrills someday someone will have to explain that to methis has it all folks all the classic clichs young women who are brutally tortured physically and mentally because they thought about being bad girls differentlooking eastern europeans who exemplify the most degraded possible aspects of subhuman nature that has a long pedigree think m french police officers who are corrupt to the core endless scenes of violence and gunplay in which the hero is never hurt even against incredible odds but all his opponents get wasted eastern europeans cant shoot straight etc lots of peekaboo scenes of young women being prostituted in the most vile fashion not of course that any are not vile this movie has it all and used it all to play to the worst in anyone by the end  if you make it to the end  you will want to take several showersso then tell me why would liam neeson appear in this why,reality
its disappointing that films like this are still being madeeven more so that they then receive such fantastic reviews was steven seagal not available the unidentified shiekh and assoc baddies are straight out of team americaat one point i thought i actually heard them say akkadakkadakkamuhamadjihadbut i shouldnt focus on just one thing the entire film is laughable this is the ramblings of a studio looking for their version of bourne  throwing luc besson at the problem and hoping something good might fall outmissing the point of what the bourne film did at the time in reinventingreinvigorating the action film hero and making them believable  the only thing you can believe about is that noone was paying attention when making the film and those that were chose to ignore the fact and just take the chequei though liam neeson was a better actor than this but then i remembered he did make next of kin and darkman i guess liam is approaching his sixties now and needed to feel as virile and potent as he did when he made those two dreadful filmsthink michael douglas in the sentinel dont get me started on that onedont watch it tell everyone you know not to watch it if you see it at your local video store implore them to take them off the shelves,reality
the government of the united states of america still using the movies to increase the hatred between their people  muslims they gave a bad image about muslims to the public for a long time  they still doing this in a very smart way that normal american people will not see what behind the scene in this movie they put the bad guys from a muslim countries first albania who 70 of the population there are muslims then they put the rich buyer of the girl speak arabic who are more than 90 of arabs are muslims i just want to say that the cia plays really dirty games  they think they will win the game but those people never read the holy book of god quran allah swt god said in sorat al anfal they plot and plan and allah too plans but the best of planners is allah,reality
saw this last night and am amazed at the good reviews you know when a plot is so implausible the plot holes so glaring that youre literally yelling bullsht at the screen i was doing that every thirty secondsfirst this film is constructed completely from clichs ex secret agent tough guy liam neeson whose soft spot is his daughter check brittle ex wife who has left him for a generic rich guy check slutty blonde friend who leads angelic daughter astray check immigrant baddies running implausible whiteslavery prostitution ring check double crossing frenchman with worlds thickest french accent check arab baddies on a yacht check if youre guessing that the father pulls through the daughter ends up safe and still nauseatingly shallow the baddies end up dead and the slutty blonde friend dies yup thats about itstill it could have been good day 1 of 24 covers similar territory and is great but its not its terriblethe whole set up of the abduction doesnt really make sense at all yes sex trafficking exists yes it might be for prostitution yes there might even be albanian mobsters in paris involved in it but why the hell would they abduct clearly rich american girls for prostitution american girls with family who will miss them and enough clout to make a fuss about it more trouble than its worth easier to traffic eastern europeans they go to all of the trouble to abduct these american girls and promptly kill off slutty blonde with an od of drugs yeah right theyd be more careful with their investment the french authorities turn a blind eye to missing americans known to be abducted again i dont think so given that the whole thing ends with a white slave auction where annoying daughter sells for 500000 it would have made a lot more sense for liam neeson to just get rich stepdad to cough up that much or even double that offer them the money for ransom and save everyone a lot of trouble the action is trying to be bournelike in its roughness but its not good enough to pull it off its not clever its not believable because its all a straight line neeson gets one clue from a guy shoots him and that clue always pans out leads him to the next guy who gives him one clue then he shoots him next clue pans out etc there are no surprises and no particularly good fights this is not a great action movie its a bad action movie and an absolutely dire movie if you consider it as a wholetwo stars purely for neeson who does the best he can with the twodimensional characterisation,reality
yeah as much as im gonna get flamed for this i didnt enjoy this unrealistic boring excuse for an action movie one bit there were several scenes that were done well certain shots of paris but other than that this was pretty genericliam neeson tries his best but is obviously not working with good material so his skills seem pretty damn limited it amazes me that this movie is so popular 79 rating on imdb i kept looking at my watch waiting for it to end im giving it three stars just to be generous because the girl who played the daughter did a good jobthis couldve been better with its source material but come on at least try to make a good movie still this isnt as bad as many other movies ive seen,reality
an absurd premise from the getgo  that travel to europe is horrendously dangerous for pretty young american girls due to the unstoppable tactics of rampant white slavers and were specifically told that the eastern euro bad guys have switched from securing their product by luring pretty residents of the former soviet bloc to jobs that dont exist instead looking to slash transportation expenses by just grabbing girls as they arrive at heathrow airportnatalie holloway anyone what happens when just one pretty american girl disappears during foreign travel were supposed to believe the hue and cry from press around the world wouldnt offset the cost of a car trip from moldova i didnt buy liam neeson as the girls father for an instant and exposition is rarely as clumsy as is seen in with neesons former colleagues showing up to grill some beef and replay the good old days in beirut battling those stuffed shirts back at langley the conveniences amass quickly from the rich stepdad who can conveniently fly neeson to the scene and from there with neeson never taking a step that doesnt lead him directly to exactly the bad guys responsible for his supposed daughters disappearance and even to the very same locations shed traveled through just hours beforeoh and if you see a car chase taking place anywhere in the proximity of a bulldozer its shovel blade menacingly close as the vehicles whip nearby just what do you suppose will eventually happen to one of the bad guys fortunately when he cleverly plants a bug on one of those bad guys seconds later the guy is talking to his henchman about the missing girls location when neeson character gets home he should by a powerball lottery ticket because his good luck never falters the action kicks off with neeson confronting a mysterious knifewielding attacker pursuing an internationally known singing star what a lucky thing for the attacker that a security slipup allowed adoring crowds to flood backstage postconcert and that fleeing them happened to take the megastar running past the very spot where the dangerous man waited with his glinting knife blade neesons handling of this situation is the final piece to the puzzle that tells us hes every bit as sharp as he was back when he led an elite cia teamthe film is competently sometimes even prettily shot but the story stretched the bounds of credibility far beyond reason it does not ask for a suspension of belief  it requires dimwitted stupidity and while neeson appears up to  and perhaps even relishes the action aspects of a bruce willis role vindictive noholdsbarred cia killerdad the scripts efforts to set him up as such is amateurish in the extreme finally as alluded to earlier while the first 15 minutes show us neeson gazing with a smile at family photos of his daughter nothing in his performance with the young lady herself other than the tvcaliber dialogue leads us to suspect theyve even met before yeah she hugs him a lot and says oh daddy but i never bought it,reality

but not much else to recommend this film you know the genre  a tough guyoutsideronemanarmy rampages through assorted nests of vipers leaving large piles of bodies in his wake it was done by charles bronson steven seagal jean reno and an host of snarling kung fusters from taiwan the same writers luc besson and robert mark kamen used the same formula for the transporter filmsfor aficionados of the genre will probably be reasonably enjoyable  although the handtohand combat leaves something to be desired bodies fly backwards through the air when shot in a completely satisfying mannerliam neeson manages to make a onedimensional character almost twodimensional  well make that oneandahalf if its carnage youre looking for though this film certainly will do the trick,reality
this film is 94 minutes 85 minutes runs at 150mph and does not stop the best action in a long time most movies slow down in the middle and give you some sloppy mood music while the characters reflect or whatever this film moves and keeps moving you will find yourself making fists blood racing ducking each punch and screaming in the end your heart will be pounding and you will wish this adrenaline rush didnt have to stopyou start off feeling sorry for this retired xspyhit mangi you think liam neeson looks like anything but a tough guy he will surprise you my only problem with this film i cant believe his daughter would ever leave his side again after watching this film i would stay with liam neeson forever truly the best action film i have seen in a long time,reality
if you like 24 bourne movies oldboy or whatever movie you can mention thats action and revenge cannot compare to this gem of a movie no cgi was used to make this movie at all and well for the first time in a very long time you could actually enjoy the fight scenes without wondering who is who go and see it and youll be clinching your teeth thru all the moviethe plot is surprisingly good the direction is perfect and the acting is superb id love to see more of this movies in the theaters ,reality
this review youre reading is the best summaryreview a film can hope forjust go and see the film any more discussions about whether its this or that would spoil the experience this imdb minimum of 10 lines is forcing people to spoil the film people who visit imdb is normally just people who wants to know whether a movie is worth watching so all im saying here is god damn it stop reading this review and go watch it for those who are still reading i registered with imdb just so that i can write a review of this film its fan fcuking tastic emotion gripping edge of your seat i found myself clinching my teeth in some moment ,reality
this movie was recommended to me by a friend and lets just say i will never be taking his advice again the only way i could possibly describe this would be picture the bourne movies now remove the good cast excellent writing and budget its the likes of shootem upive never been a fan of pierre morel in fact i think he is a two bit talentless hack who needs to stop sharing his vision with the worldbut now im convinced the plot is predictable the action is boring and repetitive and the cast is not convincing the plot holes are many and very deep you can see liam neeson struggling with the role the entire movie and frankly i honestly hope his career recovers from because he really is better then thatlike the title says if you are 13 or entertained by shiny objects and the sound of wind whistling through your empty skullthis movie is for you,reality
sorry but this just wasnt good insulting to the audience at many times  my biggest gripe in movies i have no problem with the suspension of disbelief  i can easily believe heck thats why we go to the movies that old man neeson can take on 12 guys by himself but its the other parts that were just ridiculous too many to list here and too many spoilers but i almost left in the first 10 minutes and walked away at the end shocked that neeson was in such a poor movie save your time  the money is irrelevant its 175 hours with previews that youll never get back doesnt compare to a bourne or bond movie on any level,reality
it is enough to see ln playing the tough guy sometime but in this film he is way beyond of being in his roles somehow totally spaced out the guys that play albanians they are terrible their hardly speak albanian the customs of supposedly northern albania are so poorly presented a great indicator that director might have read somewhere in wikipedia that albanians are bad tribal guys and probably went about asking people about them and then thought he could make moviei am sure if i keep writing i waste my precious time moreover i might be giving credits to this utter rubbish my advice dont waste your money on this or the consecutive parts bleah,reality
this movie fails on so many levels i just watched this movie and i am very surprised with the good reviews it got this is exactly the kind of movie that makes non americans think of the americans as stupid and uneducated it just insults my intelligence as a viewer and after seeing positive reviews it diminishes my faith in general human intelligencedont get me wrong i dont think a movie has to be particularly consistent or realistic to be fun but this movie presents it self as something that could happen in the real world what i want to say is i dont mind seeing rambo shooting down a chopper with a bow and arrow on the contrary id expect that in a rambo movie and wouldve enjoyed it but this movie pretends to be plausible and it really sucks at thatthere are so many holes in the script that i dont know where to start first of all we have a retired and pretty old james bond kind of guy who during the movie kills more people then jackie chen then put all that in a very dangerous setting lets say paris for instance cause we all know that after bagdad its the unsafest city in the worldand then you have the infamous albanian mafia that doesnt know a better way to make money then to kidnap girls from developed western countries and turn them into prostitutes i sincerely doubt those guys ever had ideas like that they smuggle heroin and weapons which is much more profitable for them now i could be convinced some romanian gypsy or albanian girl was sold to work as a prostitute but even then it was more likely it was done by her relatives or someone she knew and its highly doubtful they would kidnap girls from elite paris neighborhoods in the middle of a dayalso its very interesting how they hook the girls they kidnap on heroin in a matter of hours and that all the girls in the brothel look like zombies on crack who would go to such a brothel when you have such great brothels all around europe obviously the makers of the movie havent been in any of the european brothels which i must say is a shame cause they wouldve had some fun and would have not wasted enormous amount of money to make such a bad movie next time go to germany switzerland netherland and visit some nice fkk it will save you the trouble and us the painwhats even more funny is that his daughters friend who was not a virgin got overdosedtotally counterproductive from the albanian mafiain the first 48 hours she was kidnapped and even if she didnt die she would have been destined for a career of a low life prostitute in the hands of the mafia while neesoms daughter which was a virgin would have been sold for half a million euros or dollars whatever no one would pay that kind of money for a kidnapped teen just to deflower her for god sakes ribery payed something like 2k for a 16 year old and she made a career after wards no but in this movie they have an auction for this girl and buyers came from all around the world like she is a nuclear missile its just so sadnow there is numerous number of other script flaws in this movie like when neeson pretends that he is a french policeman without speaking a word of french or when he saves some girl from a brothel and puts her on infusion which he happens to carry around with him to clean her from drugs cause he is a hobbyist doctor not to mention that in the end they just let him fly out of a country after he killed a few dozen men and shot a french policemans wifenow what bothers me most about this movie is not the inconsistencies its the main actor liam neeson i saw his name and have seen very good grades here on imdb and based on that i decided to watch this movie what a mistake note to myself dont just watch the scores read a few reviews next timeneeson is obviously a crafty actor and makes scenes look realistic which only adds to my annoyance with this film i used to think he was at least a decent actor and now i cant help wondering why did he shoot such a bad movie i would think that a guy of his reputation and age could choose a role and a movie he wants to play in i dunno maybe the money was to good but he certainly didnt need to make this moviehe is a mature actor that could be playing serious character roles instead he chooses to play superspy father figure medicine man ronin i just cant understand that shame on him btw sorry for any mistakes english is not my native language oh and i am also not french albanian iraqi or anything else that you might think had influence on this review,reality
the trailer for had me gripped i thought to myself this is what im talking about a gritty revenge thriller staring to impressive liam neeson when watching the trailer i was being reminded of the last two bourne films which i loved although i didnt see it at the cinema i was always wanting to watch it and when i did i felt very let downthe main problem is that the trailer showed a basic outline for the film a father who has a history with the special forces tries to find his kidnapped daughter in europe i was wondering when the film started what twists would occur and how intense the action would be well the trailer gave me the film there is no extension on the story other then liam neeson goes to paris and kills everyone who gets in his way of getting his daughter back that was it the best moments of action were wasted by too much use of the hand held camera meaning most the time i struggled to see what was going on neesons character is very boring and the film is completely dependent on the actionthe film does have entertaining moments but nothing special enough for me to recommend it most of my friends who like the film have praised its awareness of the sex trade industry in europe but it doesnt it just uses that as an excuse for the film to become more darker but nothing else for me personally the best revenge thriller to be released in the past few years is man on fire the film was brilliantly directed and had characters we genuinely felt for this film really does fall short of the mark when comparing it to man on firethere are entertaining set pieces and it is good to see liam neeson getting his hands dirty but it takes more then that to make a good thriller i understand that i am in a minority with having it been given a 79 vote on its imdb page but i feel let down by the film and that this type of film has been made before and been much better,reality
liam neeson has made so many movies in which hes miserable you would certainly think hed have the expression down by now and throughout even before the action starts he proves it like never before from the first frame his face is screwed into a look of discomfort you havent seen since john boehners last interviewtheres nothing to say about plot here  or character development logic or anything else new to the genre the movie is as generic and barebones as possible hero victim bad guys death it moves and thats good in an action movie but to say it moves is like saying glenn beck cries of course it moves its supposed tothe better question is whether its different from anything else youve seen in the last ten years that is since digital manipulation of editing special effects stunts and now apparently screen writing has become so prevalent the answer in my opinion is noits exactly the same with the popular new twist added that the hero is completely invincible he feels no pain has no emotions never gets injured is prepared for everything and can get out of any outlandish situation so not only is generic and sexist and xenophobic its also dull and very predictablewhich might explain mr neesons more incredibly pained on screen expression could he be picturing his foreseeable future in movies not as the brooding leading man of intelligent wellwritten pictures but as jason stathams new daddy,reality
french director and french writer luc bessonand this  take it as an adrenaline actionpacked movie and its great but the background story is offensive to say the least whatever happened to that famous frencheuropean subtlety  this movie manages to vilify albaniansarabs and french and make heroes out of cia operatives and the us in a way i thought only rambo could they probably wanted a action movie with a background moral message and they succeeded and while doing so managed to make a caricature out of a very complicated issue prostitution trafficking in europe on top of that to vilify arabs from an american point of view now when the us has 2 dubious wars in 2 arab countries  i gave 5 points for the childish enjoyment of seeing a good action revenge movie and took 5 points for a shameless use of serious issues hollywood please grow up,reality
is one of the best movies of 2008brilliant fast paced thriller with a terrific performance from liam neesonsuch short movie but nevertheless definitely worth watchingliam neeson has given his best herethe plot is that a father has to save his daughter who has been kidnapped  is being forced to slave tradea former spy neeson tries to save his daughteris he still goodyou have to watch it to see for yourselfi think only boondock saints is shorter timewise compared to this moviebut this is a great film to seejust the plot  the fast paced action is too goodis nothing much but 93 minutes of excellence,reality
i watched this film with a group of friends having noticed it on the shelf for a while at the store the packet proudly boasting extended harder cut and other such stuff about revenge brutality etcit wasnt what initially attracted me to the film more that i was interested to see what that would mean with liam neeson in the lead roll and a reputation to think off  as opposed to films such as hostel where the actors are less well known it turns out that the accuracy of the taglines was about all this film had going for itthe basic plot spoilers from now is that neeson is some kind of retired covert agent who loved his country more than his family leading his wife to leave him and take their daughter too though theyve managed to keep a relationship despite his wifes efforts daughter tells neeson one day she wants to go to france with her friend for a week alone hes massively against it but is eventually worn down and allows her to go  and then would you adam and eve it no sooner have the daughter and her friend gotten to france and put their bags down when some masked men break in and kidnap the pair of them typicalfortunately she was on the phone to daddy at the time and he soon whisks over to france to track them down and save the day using brutal violence and an incredible ability to dodge bulletsnow as a dumb action movie i could sit through that plot quite happily but the first issue comes with the reason for the kidnapping the girls are being into sex slavery to me this is a real and disturbing topic that should only feature when there is something real and relevant to be said about the situation yet in it is used purely for shock scenes along the unpleasant lines of films such as hostel and the route through this topic to its resolution becomes so absurd i found it insulting to the reality which god knows how many women have to suffer through it seemed very bad taste following that the other issues for me are more down to bad plotacting etcneeson  his character is the luckiest super spy the suspension of disbelief required to accept what he is capable off is ridiculous dodging bullets at point blank tracking down all those involved from a voice on the phone and sitting in an airport always picking the right doorpersonclue again when you have a man running round like the terminator it cheapens the reality of the situation his daughter and her friend are inhis family  neesons wife is the uber bitch his daughter is a 17 year old perfect innocent virgin  she still loves horses and wants to be a singer when she grows up she even still calls neesons character daddy and she runs like she got hit by a car see the airport scene the roles are played well enough but the characterisation is so clichd its painfulthe police  all useless and if not useless  in on it apparently kidnap is such a regular occurrence in paris they dont even bother investigating it any more good thing theres an american coming over to sort filthy old europe outthe gangsters  idiots the most painful scene being when they believe neeson whos character lets not forget is an american agent to be the french chief of police purely because he turns up at their door in a long coat with a business card still with an american accent and promptly begins to discuss rates for their operation you would have thought these criminals would know what the chief of police would look like especially when they tell neeson they met him just last week to arrange the polices cuttheres also the obligatory product placement of phones cars and other electricals but perhaps the biggest joke of this film is who they expect you to believe neesons daughter is the number one fan of holly valance yep holly valance perhaps the most tortuous scenes of all being neeson speaking to his daughter over the phone in hollys presence  youll never guess who im with yes really im in the room with her now  i know its incredibleso thats basically it were it not for the sex trafficking topic this film could be just a dumb clichd action movie but to treat such a subject so crassly and with nothing really to be said left a very bad taste in the mouth and at the end left me feeling very uncomfortable as if id been a part of something seedythis film was certainly not of the calibre i would expect of a respected actor such as liam neeson and having watched it i am surprised he agreed to the role i am also surprised by how highly this film is rated my guess being those ratings based on the action elements  which are fast paced exciting and intense  but for me could not make up for the negativesif you have seen this film you may also agree that there is no amount of times neesons character should be able to turn to his wife and scream i told you so that could be a 20 minute dvd extra on its own,reality
ok ok i know its an action flick an american james bond as it were and as long as that is all youre expecting it works  somewhat from my perspective it was disappointing because there was no depth in the plot nothing was unexpected moreover it was predictable i dont especially like happy endings and i was so hopeful this film would take a bad turn at the end and it could have had a really sinister twist  i wanted the girls stepfather to have ultimately been identified as a major cog in the human trafficking thing  but alas it did not making my disappointment a reality another quick thing the plot was so transparent in how it played to american political interests and fear mongering visavis mideast politics making the sheik the bad guy and neeson the american hero was so weak  im tired of all that kind of pandering in films,reality
any time i am about to see a film these days i check first on imdb its pretty much guaranteed that a film with over a 7 rating will be a well made film and anything 8 or above will most likely be a corker liam neeson is also a favorite actor of mine so i was really looking forward to seeing but in this case i think its way off the mark the film struck me as shallow and totally unbelievable i got the idea that whoever made the film had seen the bourne trilogy and was just looking for another reason to send a covert cia trained psychoassassinwithaheart on a stylish killing spree the personal side of the characters is so unbelievable that i found i started questioning the rest of the file for instance how could a man who could happily kill so many so coldly in one scene be such a soppy hug machine in the next its not even the kind of thing you stop to consider in bourne in summary id say watch bourne and give this one a miss,reality
neesons performance is the only thing that saved this movie from an even lower score it is so far fetched that it is a joke neesons daughter takes a trip to europe and despite being warned by her dad is kidnapped within hours of landing enter neeson to save the day armed with nothing more than a gun and a phone he travels to europe locates the criminals and saves his daughter all within a couple of days taking on a large violent crime organisation single handedly he shoots everyone and everything in site the so called criminals have obviously never had anything to shoot at because in hundreds of attempts some at an open target and at close range not one manages to hit the target neeson on the other hand is an expert never misses and kills them all this could have been so much better but is so over the top it is ridiculous if all you want from a movie is lots of action then you may enjoy this but if you want something more avoid it like the plague,reality
every week i meet with the same friends for a movie evening since many many years we stumbled over without much prior knowledge and were literally blown awayi was aware that mr neeson is able to express some serious action since rob roy and gangs of new yorkbut what he shows us in is probably one of the grimmest action protagonists i have ever witnessedit is a modern version of some old charles bronson flicks like the 1974 death wishlots of people compare it with bond or the bourne movies but i must say it is in a completely different leagueit has and that is most important believable top notch action kudos to anyone involved in the execution even though some scenes only last a few seconds it must have been a lot of work to get this on picture in such a perfect wayneeson does not fight the villains he literally steamrolls over them with remorseless determination aside from that it is loaded with little details in the script pushing this movies ahead of almost any competitionmovies like this will not cross your eyes often so go check it out,reality

luc besson produces a slam bang action thriller starring liam neesonneeson is a divorced dad who adores his daughter but cant provide for her like her new step dad since his security gig doesnt pay all that well when his daughter goes to france things take a turn for the worst as she ends up kidnapped this is bad news for the guys who took her since neeson was once an agent over seas and he doesnt play nicepure popcorn movie is a bit slow to start but once neesons daughter goes missing the film begins firing on all cylinders and its becomes really clear that neeson has a future playing bad ass action heroes its a violent take no prisoners ride as neeson single mindedly goes after his daughter and no one who gets in his way is safe no one this means its mean and nasty with a torture scene that well i didnt know liam had it in him i really liked this film a great deal it just winds it self up and goes like a rocket if the film has any flaws its that the movie sometimes moves on to the next thing a little too abruptly not that i truly mind but its the difference between being a seven out of ten and an eightif you like action movies see this film,reality
why did i trust the first 1000 votes and the good reviews about this movie first of all i think liam neeson does not fit in the role he is playing he is to perfect for his age that would be acceptable if the rest would be good enough to support his role or the movie at all the rest of the cast is often to clich or overdramatizing the movie is taped on cheap video and sometimes it looks like a tv movie or like filmed on my cellphone the cuts are often to fast or even misplaced to give the feeling of fast action the music oh boy oh boy i cant believe i spent money for this cheap crap i dont like comparing movies but this one reminds me somehow of chronenbergseastern promises which is a great movie with a similar topic why do some directors not watch and learn and who is still spending money for those productions but well i see there are still people who like that movie and thats ok i am just telling my opinion here but please dont confuse a movie you like with a great movie,reality
the movie is awesome you cannot blink once you just stay with your eyes wide open the hole time great script great actingliam neesons performance is indescribable emotive passionate action all the time i just cannot remember the last time i saw an addition of elements such as actionemotionfather and daughter relationship plus love true scenes with no undue things over it synchronized so perfectly those whom which will have the pleasure to watch this movie are going to have definitely a very pleasant time your family your girlfriend your friendsyou can invite anyone to see this masterpiece i doubt even one single person will not enjoy it congratulations luc besson  you keep rockin just one more thing  thank you,reality
when the daughter of a former cia agent gets abducted the guy gets to use all his skills to track her abductors down there are a few lines of story twisted through this but the main line stays the same quick sometimes crude actionit all starts when the daughter who is living with her mother asks her father to sign a paper that allows her to travel out of the us because she wants to see paris the guy is a bit reluctant because hes seen too much darkness on this planet during his days of work for the agency but he signs anyway and thus the story starts rollingand roll it does taking a few plot holes at a time it finds its way to the bottom of the rabbit hole pretty quickly and as things get more and more dirty the plot holes get deeperthe film isnt entirely bad but if they had listened to the call of reality a bit more often it would have been a lot better now it is just another film where some invincible angry human chases after a lot of bad guys and that really doesnt credit it as well as it might have beenanother irritation factor to this film is its short running length taking just under 90 minutes this feels a bit like a ripoff  having to buy full price for a film that rushes its way to its end doesnt make me happy6 out of 10 bad guys beaten to a pulp,reality
i knew this was a kidnap film and from the clips i saw it looked like a rather aggressive and violent film and i heard about how it became a surprise smash hit at the cinemas so i had to see why so many loved it so much basically bryan mills liam neeson is a former cia operative who retired to be closer to his daughter kim maggie grace who lives with her mother lenore goldeneyes famke janssen and wealthy stepfather stuart terminator 2 judgement days xander berkeley in california at kims seventeenth birthday party bryan buys her a karaoke machine because of her passion for singing but he gets upstaged when stuart buys her a horse coincidentally he saves threatened pop star sheerah holly valance grateful she agrees to tutor his aspiring daughter later his daughter asks his permission to go on a trip to paris with her friend amanda katie cassidy he is very protective but agrees as long as she takes an international working cell phone and calls him every day but they are actually following the band u2 during their european tour arriving in paris the girls meet friendly young french man peter nicolas giraud who offers them a cab ride and to a party in fact he is gathering information about them kim does what bryan told her to in calling him but she gets a shock while talking as she watches amanda being by intruders so on the phone her dad instructs her what to do hide in the next room under the bed knowing she will be kidnapped he also tells her to shout physical descriptions of the intruders which she does bryan tells lenore and stuart about kims kidnapping and meeting his former colleague sam leland orser he determines the men are albanian sex traffickers who abduct female tourists it is highly likely she will disappear and not be heard from again within 96 hours bryan travels to paris he finds the young man peter there but he chases him when trying to interrogate him and before he can catch and ask him any questions he is hit by an oncoming truck so hoping to find some clues he meets up with former french field agent jeanclaude pitrel olivier rabourdin who is slightly unhelpful but does direct him to an east european gang who prostitute women he finds a makeshift brothel and there is a girl wearing kims jacket so he fights off the guards and escapes with this girl and when she awakens she gives him a little information he can follow about the house she met his daughter in and there he confronts the thugs pretending to be from the government sent to renew a contract these thugs are tricked by bryan into saying certain things and he recognises the voice of marko from tropoj arben bajraktaraj as the man on the phone so he wounds him and kills the other men and restraining him he looks around the building at other kidnapped girls letting them free and he finds amanda who is dead from some sort of overdose making a makeshift electrocution chair he tortures marko to give him information about where his daughter is and he tells that kim is valuable as a virgin on the black market and was sold to auctioneer patrice st clair grard watkins and before he leaves he leaves the chair to electrocute the thug to death bryan tells what he knows to jeanclaude but deduces he is corrupt and he shoots jeanclaudes wife isabelle camille japy in the arm and threatens to kill her unless he is given st clairs address and when he goes to the mansion he finds an auction going on in the basement many girls are being offered to the numerous bidders and he is shocked when he sees kim is the last girl on offer and he forces a middle eastern bidder to purchase her but before she can be collected he is captured and tied up but he manages to get himself loose and kills the henchmen and before killing him he forces st clair to tell him where his daughter has been bryan dashes and finds a luxury yacht owned by raman the sheik nabil massad in a violent battle he kills the numerous guards aboard the sheik himself is in his boudoir holding kim with a knife to her throat but her father shoots him in the head and saves her kim and her father return to the united states safe and sound and are reunited with lenore and stuart and the ending sees bryan introducing his daughter to singer sheerah for her first singing lesson also starring jonathan gries as casey and david warshofsky as bernie neeson is a fantastic choice as the middleaged action hero with a particular set of skills who will stop at nothing to save his daughter it is all about him to be honest and the most memorable scene is him on the phone i dont know who you are i dont know what you want if you are looking for ransom i can tell you i dont have money but what i do have are a very particular set of skills skills i have acquired over a very long career skills that make me a nightmare for people like you if you let my daughter go now thatll be the end of it i will not look for you i will not pursue you but if you dont i will look for you i will find you and i will kill you with the villain responding good luck the story is really gritty and gripping as the exserviceman hero goes from place to place searching or clues in tracking down his daughter killing the bad guys along the way the violence he uses to dispense of the villains are violent and part of the fun an exciting and fantastically fun action drama good,reality
efficient and soulless borrowing a page from the jack bauer and jason bourne playbooks liam neeson exacts cool revenge throughout the paris underworld neeson plays former us secret agent bryan mills who is on a mission to track down and punish the men responsible for his daughters kidnapping his mission is equal parts payback and extraction one suspects that retired agent mills went on his mission as much for the opportunity to torture thugs as to get back his daughter kim played by maggie grace better known as shannon on lost bryan mills is always one step ahead of the bad guys much stronger faster and more knowledgeable than his competition he barely breaks a sweat he dispatches whole rooms of thugs with bloody economy given mills superiority and the frequent boss battles plays like a video game between bouts of fast mayhem we see cut scenes of pg13 torture and minimal exposition this is a jason statham vehicle starring liam neesongiven the minimal sense of peril the films kicks are found mostly in the dispatching of bad guys if you enjoy vicious headbutts stabbings and expert grappling youll find much to like bryan mills is a great deal like jason voorhesunstoppable and efficacious is an exercise in the current action style and this is disappointing coming from director pierre morel who gave us the offthewall alive ridiculous and outstanding action film district b13 possesses little of the joy and verve of b13 the palette of is also dull and straightforward morel does this one by the numbersthe best moment in occurs early on as mills wraps his daughters birthday gift with ocdlike attention to detail he carefully smooths down the paper and makes each fold sharp and distinct its a charming character moment quiet and human,reality
i would first like to say that this is a quite ok action movie if you are hangover from last night or just want to be entertained and doesnt want to thing about why things are happening it is a movie to recommend i have to admit that it did seem kind of strange to see liam neeson in a role better cut out for steven seagal or chuck norris but than again he is a real actor and i dont think he could have done the movie any worse except that it would be more funny the only thing that bothers a me a bit is that the whole plot takes place in a alternative and different europe nothing wrong with that really but it can make people like some of the other people writhing comments believe that this is how the world is it is not in any way like this and nothing of it could have happened in real life if you would like to see a movie about how human trafficking really is you should either see a documentary or a realistic movie like lilja 4ever just wanted to let people know,reality
fairly conventional and predictable but reasonably entertaining nevertheless good action sequences and solid acting by liam neeson,reality
there were many excellent aspects to the whole opening sequence up until he meets his ex at the birthday was a fine example of character exposition it told us that this man was a creature of habit that he was careful that he was a bit obsessive that it was his daughters birthday that he was nervous and eager to please his daughter with the gift that he was estranged from either his daughter or from a new family to which she belonged and that his wife obviously left him and can be an extremely jerky womannonetheless there were certain aspects of the writing which bothered me significantly as i watched and i couldnt help but write them down as it played many of these will only make sense if youve already seen it but perhaps its formulaic enough where that wont make any difference there are probably some minor spoilers in here to the less aware though so be warned here they are1 this super careful guy with skills didnt see fit to teach his daughter even the slightest common sense2 he doesnt use the cell phone he gave her as a tracking device3 when scumbags invade the apartment he tells her to go to a bedroom and hide under the bed really first of all thats the first place anyone would look for her secondly he should have tried to help her find a way to escape the apartment no man experienced in escaping villains in his right mind would give this advice4 he tells her to leave the phone behind instead of secreting it on her person so he could again use it to track her seriously its not that hard to do5 after he knocks out the french sleazy guys accomplice he doesnt shove him in the back of the car before pursuing the french sleazy guy6 he makes his face known to the albanian pimphooker that are in the trafficking chain7 he makes a commotion in the hooker den and gets himself in a bind instead of just quietly killing the john in the stall with his daughters jacket and discreetly sneaking the hooker out to question her8 he warns the villain on the phone of who he is so that he can no longer take them by surprise also making himself potentially vulnerable in the process9 he attacks the family of an old friend he finds out is a sleaze seriously even the old mafiosos know you dont attack the innocent members of someones family because thats crossing the line and means that anything is on the table he might as well have put a contract out on anyone he cared about for the future by doing something so careless and moronic10 allows himself to get knocked out and captured because hes too stupid to look before exiting a door11 escapes his captors through pure dumb luck this is the least stupid one just because its remotely plausible but that still doesnt excuse it as lazy writing12 his daughters line when he saves her is a surprised you came for me what kind of a  stupid line is that to write for such a moment i have a suggestion how about she says youre here and he replies ill always be here for you not perfect but a darned sight betteralso its not stupid per se but it seems unnecessary to have the vocal coach bit at the end the airport part had a purpose but didnt completely hit home they should have ended with a slice of the everyday life they had after it was all over to show what had been resolved in a lasting way that would have been a more satisfying conclusioni recently watched a much more strongly written international thriller named hopscotch if youre looking for something in this genre to watch see this one instead,reality
charles bronson  that is about all you can say about this movie the old 70 movies death wish and has one particular similarity  it is only worth seeing for the action and all the people the main character kills yes you can say this about a number of movies  however this one is build around some kind of a realistic setting  still this guy can go to paris and kill or get killed a few dozen people  including a few victim girls and then fly back to the states as nothing ever happenedworst is not even that it is too exaggerated that the main character is so paranoid and then all the paranoia becomes reality just after the girls leave the airport at least build up the story and make it just a bit realistic the whole paranoia thing is not even needed for the story and they have too many stories going on  eg the divorced and new rich husband so he kill some people and becomes the hero or the travel around europe thing why no the worst is that not only all this happens all the girls are turned into drug addicts and prostitutes within less than 48 hours the subject are harsh enough as is but here it is not treated very serious  the human trade is not depicted as a real issue it is just a setting for him to kill some people and rescue his daughter,reality
the only reason im giving 4 stars rather than one or two is the fact that admittedly its a wellexecuted action flick its been compared to movies like die hard and lethal weapon and indeed despite the excessive use of hand held jittery cameras that place it firmly in the 2000s it manages to create action scenes more coherent and flowing than almost any other movie made this decade this combined with the short runtime makes me believe that i might have liked it a lot at age 11 or 12 of course its not a movie that should be watched by a 12 year old kid and thats just one of the reasons i consider it one of the most poorly conceived movies ever madefans of often defend it against the critics by claiming that it isnt meant to be seriously  that its an escapist fantasy the fact is that its anything but rather than providing escape from reality its a movie that feeds on dangerous paranoia  the personal paranoia of overprotective suffocating parents and the collective paranoia of xenophobic patriots the movie reinforces the paranoid fantasy that everybody is after your children and they will suffer greatly if you ever let them leave your sight for even a moment that all foreigners are out to get you and that if you ever step out of the comfort zone of your precious us of a youll immediately be kidnapped and sold as a prostitute of course you can escape that fate but only if your dad is a former cia agent and proficient in various methods of murder and torture  the other victims arent that lucky as we can see that the loving father doesnt really give a damn about any of them or about his daughters good friend either honestly im really quite concerned about the effect this might have on people watching who have shades of notions of those fantasies alreadywhich leads me to the second big problem  that the subject matter that supplies the plot for this alleged escapist fantasy is very realistic very delicate and difficult and is glossed over and trivialized magnificently apparently we arent supposed to care that most of the victims of human trafficking arent american tourists with cellphones and cia dads to help them escape the protagonist doesnt really care either the movie suggests that human trafficking isnt really a problem really as long as we leave it to those primitive europeans and dont let our own children go to that filthy continent the truth is that human trafficking is a problem so global and so very real on a daytoday basis that the very fact that the movie tries to deal with it undermines any pretense to escapismcaters mainly to two groups  young teenagers wholl enjoy the action and the overall coolness and in the process may be lead to believe that this is a realistic representation and overprotective dads for whom it will reinforce their biggest nightmares and it may make their paranoia much more extreme in both cases the movie can do more harm than good the protagonist is so cool and impressive an admittedly strong performance from liam neeson that those viewers are likely to idolize him indeed the movie never asks us to question his morality and instead expects us to despise and villainize the more sensible mother whos actually showing some healthy respect and trust in her daughter and of course the stereotypically balding chubby and above all rich stepfather who seems like a pretty decent guy but whom were supposed to hate anyway because he doesnt share the biological dads psychosis and a wasted appearance by the wonderful xander berkeley a superb character actor who here has to play a completely characterless characterthese are just some of my complaints about how dangerous and illconceived the movie is im not even getting into the fact that its completely and ridiculously unrealistic and extremely poorly paced the daughter literally meets her kidnapper when shes stepping off the plane and is kidnapped about five minutes later i also wont go into the fact that while neesons character is ridiculously paranoid about his daughter going to the dark land of mordor france he shows no qualms whatsoever about leaving her alone with a christina aguileralike pop starlet who promises to get her into show business because theres no way that shell give his daughter drugs that her entourage will seduce her into decadent parties and orgies or that her agent will take advantage of her oh right i forgot theyre all americans that kinda stuff doesnt happen there,reality
what would it be like if your dad was jason bourne and you were an american teen with a stepfather with money to burn well youd go to europe get kidnapped by evil eastern europeans intent on pumping you full of heroin and prostituting you to rich asians however luckily your dad has been spending much of his career training for just such an event and since hes now retired and hes got time on his hands hell fly over to europe and using his network of intelligence operatives and ninja skills hell bludgeon his way through the opposition killing everyone in his path until he eventually finds you and returns you to an everso grateful mom and stepdad and they all live happily ever afterfirstly neeson is a terrible choice for an action hero the part was obviously made for bruce willis and you can almost hear the dialogue being delivered in a willisesque tone bessons writing has covered many bases but this is a generic paintbynumbers action thriller with hints of torture porn the basic story lacks any depth and the narrative is predictable the dialogue is dull and the cinematography is uninspiring the film just clunks through the motions expected of a high octane action film it pushes all those buttons which is probably why it receives such a high rating on imdb but it brings nothing new to the tabledull predictable and lacking any real depth just what the doctor ordered for those who like their films shallow and brainless,reality
from the action point of view there isnt much to add to other reviews its a brilliant movie displacing james bond and bourne and all the other action heroes its very well madeso i will only give a comment on a few things that some of you might want to know before you watch this film the movie is extremely violent and the use violence is never really questioned instead violence is accepted even if affecting innocents further the dark picture of europe france in particular is absurdly overdone ok its a dramatic element needed for the plot but you can really spoil a kids mind with these completely awkward ideasfor adults of course its a super cool movie enjoy,reality
i was hesitant about seeing this film because im a parent have a difficult time watching movies where children are kidnappedtortured etc as would most people parent or not anyway this movie is fantastic yes there are some things that could have been changed or bring up questions but for the main part of the movieit is so goodone thing i likedis that liams character is a nightmare for the bad guys unlike batman and other characters liams character has no problem leaving a trail of dead bad guys behind him as he moves along through the film trying to find and save his daughter i loved thatas a parent and a woman just getting rid of them after each bit of info is disclosed is fantastic saved the taxpayers money and at least slowed down the flow of bad guy deeds for a bit i would have liked to have known what happened to the girl liam removes from the disgusting brothel and also it would have been fun to see the wife of that french gov worker let him have it for being involved in the whole kidnappingprostitution ring whether he knew details or notwould have been nice for his life to crumble around him love this movieand didnt expect to at all one comment referred to bourne identity and they have some similar moments not script or anything but liam is so natural when he fightsit doesnt look set up or choreographed and matt damon is the same way in the bourne movies both actors are fantastic at making you think they are assassinsexspies etc the fighting looked real and natural and very impressive oh and the scene when he kills the disgusting sheik at the end woohoo i am so glad he just offed that repulsive man and no not repulsive because of weight or looksbut because of what he represented disgusting enjoy the movie,reality
the only reason this movie does not get a ten is the ending which i thought could have been better the very end when he has his daughter back absolutely superbly made and directed liam neeson is a superb actor and plays this part as good as anyonehe basically cuts a path of destruction through many many bad guys all who deserve an early demiseits done with style and righteousness which hasnt been done in a very long timewhat i like about the movie the most is the intention of the lead actor liam his sole purpose is to get his daughter back safely there is no posing for the camera or extra kill shots to emphasize the revenge he just wants to get his daughter and anything in his way gets it goodnot since the patriot has a movie of this type and quality been madeif you want an hour and a half of blazing action with non stop thrills done with class then this is for you,reality
there is a very serious crime most prevalent in europe which is daily spreading across the globe the crime is human trafficking and its tragic results can be seen on the evening news police often uncover the remains of missing victims days months and often years later it is estimated that 10000 victims are listed as missing kidnapped or murdered every year and includes beautiful women ignorant young girls and underage boys that is the basis for this film called   after retiring from the cia bryan mills liam neeson is government spy learns his precious daughter now 17 has been kidnapped and is on her way to being sold to wealthy sex merchants told he has 96 hours to find her mills puts his expertise to work and promises his adversaries he will learn who they are and eliminate them all his many hindrances include his exwife and her new but rich husband vowing to find and retrieve his daughter mills will leave no stone unturned or friendship undisturbed including his old french police friend stuart xander berkeley neeson is in find form and artistic element as he gives the surreal impression nothing will stop him until he succeeds love for his daughter morphs the aging spy into a fanatical lunatic turned juggernaut high speed chases and plenty of energetic physical action are the essence of this highly charged movie recommended for all neeson fans ,reality
this is addressed to the man who commented on  giving it one star and basically insulting everyone who got something out of the movie i understand there are times when the question  what has american come to should be asked however i do not think that it qualifies in this case the question should be however what has this world come to that stuff such as what was portrayed in this movie exists in real life now that is a valid question granted this movie had some holes it was not a documentary and therefore cannot be held to the same standards however ask yourself one thing did it cause you to be aware or meditate in any way shape or form about what happens in trafficking if so then the move did its job it may not have been an academy award winning movie but it brought an awareness and may have caused many to reflect about what happens not only in our own backyard but if you chose to travel outside of the us so sir with all due respect i dont think those that enjoyed the movie are the ones you should be examining  but rather yourself because heightened awareness should be the most important on affairs of social awareness  not whether or not neeson can deliver a good kick to the head,reality
i actually thought this would be just another action movieremembering neeson from his astounding role in schindlers list i was mesmerized by his capability of showing us what a father feels when his daughter is in dangerthe movie is just meant to keep your adrenaline level extremely high and puts you in a revengeful moodit got me to the point were i wished those pimpsmobsters would suffer a great amount of painand they didyesits that goodfinal wordsa very good action moviei havent seen one like this in a few months,reality
liam neeson has always stood up for whats right as oskar schindler as rob roy michael collins hell even as quigon jinn  but hes never been so badass about itin the european production neeson is bryan mills an excia operative  he calls himself a preventer of bad things with a very particular set of skills  whose 17yearold daughter kim maggie grace travels to france and is kidnapped by euro slave traders for mideastern royalty and superrich white men and mills comes to her rescue kicking arse taking names and leaving no prisonersin short utterly preposterous and utterly enjoyableand utterly euro written by the great luc besson and directed by pierre morel meaning there seems to be little or no stinking mpaa presence neeson can get away with shooting bad guys in the back without them drawing on him first torturing bad guys while describing how the us outsourced these techniques killing ruthlessly and callously in short stooping to the bad guys level to get the job done  rescue his daughterfamke janssen is the exwife underused xander berkeley is the exwifes rich new hubbie also underused ingenue maggie grace keeps reminding us of how much better kristen stewart wouldve fitted her role and leland orser is one of millss cia buddies  and hes not whining about anythingwith being such a hard satisfying ride i wouldnt be whining eitherreview by poffy the cucumber for poffys movie mania,reality
adverts for this film had me looking forward to at the very least a formulaic that cannot fail bad guys get their due by the hand of a righteous good guy vengeance is served somehow and all that overall the film delivers on its promiseit is not exemplary in its genre however i wish i could cite a title that really gives that satisfaction that is set up by the words i will find you and i will kill you a film or tv show that does that is a rare findto get that vigilante righteousness where you can applaud the protagonist for banging heads and killing everyone that crosses hisher path is a key issue it most often requires that the antagonist be really really bad to the point that that their crimes are so disturbing as to be unimaginable this is perhaps why i cannot name a more satisfying film i may have blocked it outperhaps die hard could be called into play here because i recall it was eminently satisfying and not too disturbing but die hard does not exactly fit into this genre it should not be a spoiler to say that kidnapping is an element of both but that alone would hardly describe either filmdoes not spend enough time on the guy that offered good luck you barely know who it is before it is gone from the story once you see it you will agree that this is no spoiler the film and the adverts did that already action sequences are implemented with more cuts than bristles on your toothbrushit is more convenient to have a series of action sequences filmed and then piece them together in an ineffective effort rather than choreograph them before the start this shortcut has plagued many an otherwise good film and is no exception see i just did that you have no idea what i am sayingi will now make it clear this movie is not all that great it was not bad i enjoyed it i watched it alone and was expecting to rewatch it with someone else once i could recommend it but i cannot i will not invest another 14000 heartbeats that would be required for a 2nd viewingevren buyruk from usa ,reality
like others here i had no expectations going in as i knew nothing about this movie what a pleasant surprise this is one of the best action movies ive seen in a long timesure the countless bullets thrown in neesons direction all fail to find their mark while his shots are deadeye accurate but hey this is a popcorn flick sit back and enjoy the show and i like how besson doesnt shy away about killing very bad guys a lot of movies have their protagonist go through ethical and moral contortions before taking a life no matter how much that life deserves to be neesons character has no such compunctions hes getting his daughter and god help anybody who gets in his way including old friendshighly recommendedordinarily i would not have given this movie 10 stars maybe 8 but i feel i need to compensate for the idiot who gave this movie one star,reality
there is no denying that does belong to the group of mediocre nobrainer action movies as a story it moves from point a to b to c with a lot of stylized violent action in between but all the same there is something very rewarding about it being a classic vendetta story of a father with a cia past finding his kidnapped daughter in a foreign country the movie becomes much more personal to watch than most other movies of the same caliber and a huge part of that if not entirely is thanks to liam neeson who plays the role with an emotional fervor only he can pull of similar to frantic 1988 in both nature and setting but with much more violence sets up a hopeless situation and brings the viewer along on a ride of revenge the only problem is we kind of already know where it ends,reality
i have to admit that i started watching this movie with my breath held lets face it liam neeson is not exactly known for bringing the action perhaps thats why i liked this so muchnot only does neeson deliver believable action but he damn near rocks your face offmy experience with neeson is fairly limited ill admit yeah he was in the new star wars flicks but i didnt much care for those and batman begins which was fine but he was pretty much absent from that and then theres nell well not discuss that long story short i always knew liam neeson as the guy who always looked like he was just about to start crying even when hes smiling needless to say i was more than a bit surprised when he breaks out into his badass alter ego for i would liken him in this flick to a slightly more aged jason bournehis action sequences are fluid and impressive but still very based in reality without a ton of flashthe supporting cast is also pretty good famke janssen is fine if just as cold and uncaring as she is in pretty much everything a postlost maggie grace does well as the daughter whos abducted ok all she really does is scream and cry but she fits the bill for the part i almost didnt recognize her since she comes across looking a lot younger even though it was made after she was killed off on lost all in all its really a shame this movie didnt ever to my knowledge see serious theater time its every bit as good as anything in theaters right and in many cases better its definitely worth your time im almost hoping neeson keeps this up even though im pretty sure he wont,reality
2008  12 out of 4 a former cia agent liam neeson has his world turned upside down after his daughter goes to paris for a vacation and gets kidnapped hes an expert of this type of thing and its going to take all his skills to locate her with the short amount of time he has if you wanted to pick this film apart you really could because its certainly far fetched and everything neeson can do here isnt really believable and what hes able to do isnt really believable with that said who in the hell cares even though the story isnt that believable theres no denying this is a first rate thriller that will have you biting your nails from the moment the daughter gets all the way till the end this movie has a simple story but neeson takes it to a whole new level and really makes this film seem plausible i mentioned it wasnt believable but this never comes through while youre watching the film because neeson is so wonderful in the film youre willing to go along with him on this journey no matter where it takes you the movie is extremely fast paced well made and delivers on all levels the action is first rate the suspense is topnotch and neeson performance is downright wonderful i cant think of an actor who would have been better in the role this is an action movie but with someone like neeson it just brings the film up several notches again you could pick apart how his character goes about doing things but just sit back and enjoy the ride the film is very stylish in terms of the cinematography and it also features a very good music score to pump up all the action in a lot of ways the film reminded me of another underrated gem and thats breakdown the 1997 thriller with kurt russell playing a man looking for his wife who seems to have vanished out of nowhere the two films deal with a simple kidnapping but both have a great actor to pull everything together so if you did enjoy this film youre highly recommended in checking out the other,reality
everyone here who hasnt seen the movie dont let yourself be persuaded by the ramblings of a few mentally challenged people you see i was one the people that listened i didnt watch the movie and rather smugly thought to myself that it was 93 mins of my life saved i was wrong very wrong qui gon gin goes through this movie kicking everyone and everythings head in and when it finishes not only do you feel as if your adrenal gland has been squeezed in a vice but you have a strange out of body compulsion to reenact every fight scencerealistically the only way this movie could have been any better is if there was a really hot sex scene with holly valance at the end  i checked the bonus features and there isnt even a deleted scene of said act  anyway dont make the same mistake as i almost did because i can guarantee you will regret not seeing wave after wave of niko wannabes getting wasted by just one ex jedi for the rest of your life,reality
is a taut action thriller starring the somewhat improbable liam neeson as the avenging heroneeson is somewhat of an everyman actor very believable in everyday hero roles that tom cruise and the like could never do it is this versatility that is his great strength as an actor  see his roles as jedi quigon jinn in star wars and the legendary irish hero michael collins in the film of the same name for further evidence of this but as brian mills the loving father and retired cia operative he brings a new intensity to the fore and the film is all the more satisfying for it brian has seen how the world works and wants to protect his daughter from it but after his daughter is kidnapped on a trip to paris brian must dust off his skills that have lain dormant in order to rescue his daughter and punish those responsibleafter taking a little too much time to set events in motion considering it is only a 90 minute film the pace and power accelerates rapidly and you find yourself slowly gripped by the singleminded intensity of exspy ben while you remain sure that the outcome is inevitable the method and projected body count remain in question and it is this that makes the film such an enthralling tale some good if not particularly spectacular setpieces keep the pace moving quickly while the vast range of special skills ben displays throughout the film ensure we never lose sight of who it is were dealing with the film wears its emotions on its sleeve giving the film a raw feel which all adds to the gutwrenching intensity as the plot thickens and more layers become apparent  including corruption within the gendarmes  you are left asking yourself how far would you go to rescue someone you love what lengths would you go to bens methods become morally ambiguous at best if not outright questionable but as we see more of the seedy underbelly of paris and how far it extends the slightly sour taste that has been growing from the we discover the truth behind his daughters abduction becomes quite uncomfortable the rather surprisingly high level of violence adds to this level of discomfort yet the violence never seems to feel gratuitousneeson is a man who can deliver quiet intensity like few others can but the fury he displays never seems to rise much above a whisper  no matter how much training a spy may get surely nothing could prepare someone for the kidnap of their daughter a slight increase in volume of emotions would have benefited somewhat meanwhile maggie grace as bens daughter has little to do other than look severely distressed and frightened while the villains are largely nameless and faceless the lack of a single clearly identifiable villain while ensuring the focus remains solely on bens search for his daughter dilutes the fury and vengeance factor somewhat however remains a riveting narrative unfettered by the convoluted machinations that frequently litter ciabased films by taking the spy out of the cia the story is free to focus on the actionbased thrills rather than the political ones and is all the better for it in fact with a sub90 minute runtime the audience is left feeling slightly shortchanged on plot and an additional twenty minutes to develop neesons character further maybe even displaying some bursts of uncontrolled rage at some point would not have harmed the movie in any waybe that as it may with tv series like alias having made the spy genre somewhat stale shows there is no substitute for seeing this kind of story as a fullblown action thriller on the big screen genuinely gripping,reality
wow first of all i have to say i like liam neeson very much as an actor but most movies i have seen he has played drama and sensible roles but this time he did the same as denzel washington did in man on fire he showed the hard side of himself the story itself is nothing really new a man this time actually a retired spy or secret agent divorced and alone wants to get his family together or at least wants to get up to his daughter and on a trip to paris with a good friend both his daughter and her friend get kidnappedi think what makes this movie special is the behavior of the father in this whole thing which comes from one of the best writers for good moviesluc besson on the one side he stays really calm for he already knows his daughter will be kidnapped in the next few minutes and on the other side this fury anger and also desperation with only one thing on his mindfinding his daughter somewhere in paristhis movie is really worth to watch,reality
i must say that hearing about liam neeson in a french action movie kinda filled me with hope of seeing something different that the usual bonds and i wasnt disappointedsurely this isnt a deep movie its pure adrenaline and the best part is that it doesnt try to pretend to be anything elseaside from this the movies does break some of the action hero stereotypes neeson doesnt see any innocents in his path he beats his way to his daughter the only one he protects in a way is his albanian translator but for example he shoots his former french contacts wife even though she had nothing to do with anythingneesons hero does the talking and he simply expects answers i loved the way he shot saintclair every time he tried to say anything except the answer he was expecting or how he shot the kidnapper before the guy had a chance to offer a settlement also his line to me it was always personal when saintclair explains it was only business  i waited ages for this line to shut up all the goodbad guys who claim their deed was just business who cares what it was to you to me its differentall in all the movie presets itself nicely the cinematography s ok no funny motion effects to make you throw up its functional and it deliversthe soundtrack is good a combination between classic rock and some orchestral sound that adds to some moments although not always in syncthe acting is better than average for this kind of movies though im sure everyone would agree that it doesnt take up a lot of talent still neeson brings in some extra valueplot holes nothing major the writers took care to make neeson an excia which accounts for his access to contacts intelligence and various equipments not to mention his martial arts skill and deadshot accuracyspeaking english in france is attributed to albanians being new to paris god knows thugs dont go to school for years to learn a new language before going somewherea couple of nags include neeson escaping the police after stealing the cab sure the other lane was packed but no police cars responded and came down his lane and escaping after being handcuffed to a pipe by loosening it clearly he had to escape but this is too close to deusexmachina for an otherwise decent action script and on top of that he escapes in one move although the pipe was clearly longer than his armspan which would have required him to take at least a step backall in all is a very nice surprise this year although if you want food for the brain and nagfree movie look elsewhere,reality
let me start this off by saying i adore liam neeson and all he does i really did like the action in this flick and i liked how it focused on forced prostitution rather than the typical wehaveyourchildnowpayusaransom plot im probably the only one who didnt feel too sorry for kim though the mother was also beyond irresponsiblemum lets let our alreadyspoiled 17 year old brat roam around europe following u2 on tour and lie to her father about it tell him youll be going to museums and such youll sound much more smart liam neeson finds out his daughter will not be staying in france you lied to memum she had to she couldnt tell you the truthliam neeson after telling kim a dozen times to call him once she lands doesnt get the phone call calls his exwifemum shes 17 and in parisgive her spaceso there you go dear mumsy now your daughter is kidnapped by weird albanians and some random arab shiek thats involved and whats moreshe is now in the process of being sold as a sex slave and you think your exhusband was smothering herand as for kims friend amanda that chick got what she deserved im gonna sleep with that french guy we just met 2 minutes ago because i hear the french are great in bed thats nice hun now you can sleep with all the guys you want now that youre being sold to themdont get me wrong forced prostitution is not something you can turn the other cheek about i just didnt feel attached to kim and amanda because i was too busy being angry at the fact that her and her mother lied to her father i was also too busy being angered that the mother seemed so damn careless i dont know about the rest of you folks but a good mother wouldnt consent right away to letting her underage daughter roam freely around europe without being concerned and being able to sleep comfortably at nightin conclusion liam neeson is an awesome superhero dad the action is great but i just dont feel attached or remorse for kim amanda and the thoughtless mother,reality
the recipe for bonds martini is as follows from the book written by ian flemming in 1953 casino royale 3 parts gordons gin and only one part vodkai would counter that neeson is the gin in bonds martinithere are many decent and well made movies about an american kickass hero archetype character goes over seas to deal death and destruction on the doers of evil most of the good movies give a valid motive based love or an unknown circumstance the bourne movies fit the latter of these motives and are very affective at staying on the edge and bringing you deeper into the movieis such a perfectly stepped vector of a storyline and maintaining relative believability it is hard to look away from the screenmy first real taste of liam was in darkman when i was 15 and he took a fantastical unbelievable character and gave it depth and even humor the choices liam has made in the roles he has on have given him such a range of characters that doing one of the more overdone general genres makes this movie special there are some questions i have in regards to how laim makes his parisian charge if i had access to friends that are in the business of security and international military experience i would bring them along for the ride liam decides to use them only sparinglyallows us to focus on liam alone in this mission impossible like moviei try to imagine another actor in liams rolelike steven seagal sylvester stallone arnie vin diesel and so on but liam is so far away from the the typical action hero and does such a better job than all these guysit comes down to great writing and directing pierre morel being the cinematographer for danny the dog and the transporter movies knows what works in these types of movies direct no bullshit dialog with a time line that brings the viewer along each level getting more intensedont stand in either of liam neesons or pierre morels way unless you are going to watch this movie there may never be another one like this one againat least not with liam neeson gaining years in itthe professional or leon is jean reno and is liam neeson everything in the sky has aligned to make a rare viewing experience of an over done genre enjoy this movie,reality
i never thought id think of quigon jinn as a badass but i liked be by surprise no pun intended when i write reviews im not much into describing the film and synopsis and all you dont need me for that just imdb that st this movie is all about bambambam thank you maamas in i am liam neesan i was a government fancypants you took my little girl i am gonna come to france and kickand or decapitate your albaniangirldruggingwhoring arses the endfor those of you who love the jeanclaude van damm but sorta wished he had a real asskicker inside of him and a certain set of skills that we all can kind of relate tosort ofin spirit this is a movie you will very much like be ready to suspend your disbelief and dont even come to me all like he just wrecked and killed 2 dozen people and dint even get in trouble for it deal forget it he will ram spikes thru your wrists connect jumpers to them and electrify your arse till they shut down the power for lack of payment awesome,reality
the movie has some bad points  somewhat cartoonish characters and plot speaking english when one shouldve been speaking french etchowever its still awesome its an action movie and i usually look for two things there good action and a believable explanation as to why its happening both bourne and bond movies fail in those respects whereas is successfuli didnt see anything superhuman about the protagonist yeah hes good at shooting handtohand and driving but thats it he took a lot of risks notably when his car gets shot up with an automatic 308 that couldve penetrated enough to kill him but theres nothing impossible about what hes doinga lot of people mention racial stereotypes  come on the movie is set in france which nationality do you want the corrupt cops to be brazilian and yeah its horrible how movie portraits the albanian mafia i mean theyve only been dominating drugslave trade in paris for the last ten years or so and people already start showing it in moviesso yes couldve been less clich as far as the story goes but that story is superbly presented,reality
liam neeson star in this movie about a father who find out that his 17 year old daughter was kidnapped while she was abroad what the kidnappers didnt know is that liam neeson has some amazing skills that he pick up while working for the government before he decided to retire using the skills that he attains from the government he tracks down the culprit that kidnapped his daughter and punish themi honestly did not believe that liam neeson can kick some ass but in this movie he certainly looked the part liam neeson is basically playing an older version of jason statham in this movie he goes around whacking everyone that is in his way and does it very convincinglymaggie grace plays his daughter even though maggie is older than what she potray on screen she doesnt look as if shes her age she looked very young in this movie and pull it off as a teenagerif you are looking for an action packed action movie then this is the movie for you,reality
i saw a few days agoi heard it was goodwhile it is not as good as everyone says it is its still a fairly good actionthriller in the vein of steven seagals filmsthere are a few similarities between this movie and seagals filmsat least his older onesthe acting especially from liam neeson is greatthe plot involves a father whos daughter  friend have been kidnapped in paris and forced into drugsprostitutionthe father is also an excia operativehe goes to paris and basically looks for his daughter while battling corruption and just fighting and killing peoplemay be a tad overrated but it is a good actionthriller,reality
i really liked this movie right from the start the main character is kinda like james bond mixed with steven seagal in terms of being kick ass i must admit i like watching movies like that sometimes the plot is interesting and fairly simple and keeps you on the edge of your seat i would have given this movie a 1010 because its a nonstop fast paced well made action movie but the last 3 minutes are really lame and i was a bit disappointed i hope you still want to watch it though just dont expect an ending that blows you away so doesnt quite deserve a 10 but this is an excellent movie for you if you liked james bond mission impossible bourne supremacy and the likes,reality
okay so before i even start this one lets go over all the quibbles shall we first and most noticeable is losts maggie grace allegedly playing a teenager we all know she probably was a little more mature than even her character on the infuriatingly obtuse abc hit but did we care then no we didnt so why all the fuss now the cast of the original 90210 were a bunch of collegeage or way past collegeage actors playing teens too and that was still a hit so to those nitpickers get a life alreadynext is the script dialogue thats less than cerebral check plot holes you could drive a mack truck through doublecheck that feel of trying to go after matt damons bourne franchise and steal some of its audience check check and check again but then this movie is coproduced by luc besson the professional the fifth element the last combat who wrote s script with robert mark kamen the karate kid and was directed by pierre morel the parkourinfused postapocalyptic thriller district b13 if you came to this party expecting bergmann or bunuel my friend you just walked into the wrong freakin partyonce youve adjusted your suspension of disbelief accordingly you will realize what the true pleasure of really is  and thats watching renowned oscarandtonynominated stage and screen actor liam neeson now close to 60 step into the same arena as damon jason statham daniel craig and his actionhero contemporary harrison ford and kick ass and take names with a panache that would make jack bauer beam with admiration at least thats what i enjoyed the most about it neeson plays former governmentoperativeturnedsecurityconsultant read bodyguard bryan mills long retired from the more active aspect of his trade he spends his time trying to maintain some facade of civility with his exwife lenore famke janssen doing well in yet another thankless role and her new rich gasbag of a husband xander berkeley ditto so he can still maintain close ties with the one thing in his life that matters his daughter kim gracewhen kim and her bff are allowed to take an illadvised european vacation that delivers them right into the clutches of some foreign baddies specializing in the sex slave trade mills gets to spring into action in what is the quintessential older mans fantasybecoming the superaction hero with mad fighting skills and endless resources that can be brought to bear in order to do whatever it takes to kill the bad guys and save the damselindistress  said damsel in this case being your teenage daughter yes theres plenty of accusations you can level at the further glorification of lawless violence anyone who thinks that neesons mills should be concerned about the rights of the criminals he obliterates is in for quite the profound shock the morethanobvious xenophobia almost all the bad guys are middle eastern or something very close to it the chauvinistic aspect of the story line moms willfulness is what sets the whole mess in motion when it turns out that father knew best after all the entire time but every action movie bessons especially carries aspects of all these concerns that having been said if im going to see a film like i am not going to search for signs of political correctness i want to see some greasy sleazy skeevy underworld types get their teeth and heads knocked in and in that respect this movie delivers and just like actors half his age doing it neeson looks spectacular as he moves and carries himself like the guy who can and will do whatever it takes to get the job doneespecially when that job is saving and bringing home his loved onesyes ive heard all the complaints but what i really want to know is when liams going to step into bryan mills shoes again with all due respect to kiefer sutherland maybe mills is what 24 needs on the day jack bauer is permanently retired from ctuor whats left of it,reality
having just returned from the theaters to see this movie i am happy to announce that although this film wasnt phenomenal i was indeed pleased with what i got liam neeson has always been able to pull through every role hes been given and this is no exception however i did always think ln was more fitted for a softer gentlemanly rolethe dangers that the protagonist of this film faces to save his daughter are very dark when it comes to realism his daughter has been abducted by an underground circuit of albanian crooks who abduct traveling girls drug them and sell them on the streets or in private auctions for prostitutionthe original score for this film is somewhat memorable as it delivers a certain unsettling effect almost as if its a warning for the obstacles to come which is a commendable attempt in the film worldsomething ive never really appreciated in movie advertisements is when they put an actor or actresses name in the posters top 3 names and then that same actor or actress is barely in the movie at all i basically call this the christopher lee  lotr  star wars iii effectall in all when it comes to thrills atmosphere and overall effect is not a terrible film but its not a great film it nets a perfect 5050 in my book i still recommend it to anyone who is looking for smooth action throughout the entire 93 minutes of this film,reality
one of the best action movies to come out in a while very good performance from liam neeson he delivers in all departments known mostly for a dramatic roles in this movie you will see a new action hero who is believable and kicks butt at the same time everybody please remember than this is a movie and of course some scenes are farfetched but all in all it is one hell of a ride you actually care about the character and how he is handling everything that is being thrown at him very important to watch the film from the beginning fastpaced and wall to wall action if you like action films do not hesitate to watch,reality
now first off let me warn you that this movie is pretty heavy the material in it family affairs prostitute affairs are pretty how to say touching to our hearts and in fact some people in the theater room were crying you know this movie might be pg13 but just the material in it deserves an r rating but anyways i saw this movie yesterday and frankly after all the crap i read in the newspaper on this movie i dont understand how such a good movie can get away with such low reviews time in this movie moves by really fast and i give an average of a stunt per minute to this movie this thing literally boosts your adrenaline and you are not bored a minute i even found it more entertaining than quantum of solace id give qos an 810 but i havent reviewed it yetstory bryan mills is a retired agent of the cia his 17year old daughter kim wants to go on a trip to paris with her friend amanda but he refuses after a few days of thinking he decides to let her go but as soon as she sets foot in france a few men of the european mob decide to kidnap them for women traffic mills goes to paris with one mission in mind finding his daughter liam neeson was fantastic in this movie and did a terrific job and the visual effects were pretty good also i will probably buy this movie as soon as it is released on dvdso is a good movie to watch its a refreshing thriller and will make the wait for watchmen or even xmen origins transformers 2 and terminator 4 seem a lot shorter,reality
what can i say every now and then you need a movie like this one where you can just sit back and enjoy the ride yes this was bourne without the thinkingbond without most of the gadgetsand the thinking yes the plot was simple basically it can be summed up like this man has someone he loves from him man then does anything and i mean anything to try and get said loved one back many many dead people later man gets loved one back thats about it but the action is almost nonstop once it gets going and i can honestly say that i was thoroughly entertained for most of this movie the first fifteen minutes and the last two i could have done without neeson is not as polished looking as matt damon hes not even as rugged or as tough looking as daniel craig but he plays this character in the way it was meant to be played hes the type of person you can believe inliterally when he says hes going to do something he does it and then some is this movie going to win any awards no is it going to be in many peoples top ten probably not but and nowadays this is pretty doggone important it will get you your ten bucks worth and thats more than can be said for most of the movies that get released this time of year,reality
when i first saw the poster and read the plot i said its like one of those action movies that are not really action but just dumb i had to see the movie because there was no other movie to see ive seen them all and it was a weekend and i may get bored just walking around the mall so i bought the ticket and sat on my seat as the story begins i was aback i mean the acting was convincing enough the story was true and believable the location well come on its paris and the action was not dumb action but that of moral and suspense i really was gripping on the edges of the seat and im not saying this metaphorically i recommend this as a must see for those who love actionsuspense and movies that are really a wow thx for reading,reality
youve seen the plot of before a former cia operatives daughter is kidnapped and is to be sold into a life of slavery and prostitution he immediately goes after the kidnapers the action takes us from los angeles to paris and back liam neeson is the operative and famke janssen is the exwife otherwise the cast is largely made up of an army of stuntmen all on hand to be mowed down by neeson in his quest to retrieve his daughter what makes the movie work are the incredible fight sequences which are plentiful and modeled on the fight sequences in the bourne supremacy since the movie is rated pg13 there is no blood to speak of but the violence feels real enough and neeson is believable as a killing machine who cannot be stopped or even slowed down no surprises plotwise and the story is told in strictly linear form but wow those fight scenes a french film written by luc besson movie buffs may be reminded of target with gene hackman and frantic with harrison ford,reality
from beginning to end this movie just comes out on top great development in neesons character from noting his attention to detail through his love for his daughter and understanding the lengths hed go you really get into his character and feel how he does during the whole ordeal he is instill wondering to yourself if you would go that far and succeed or fall short at the point of the shoot out and car chase in the construction sitepulse pounding i must say but other that that just the overall directing of the movie is great luc besson is great district b13 is a prime example of that and you cant have great acting with out great direction so overall i would have to say this is definitely a must see movie and one of the best acting and directing in a whilejohn,reality
this has been a great ride great over the top martial arts techniques terrific actorlead role and the story line doesnt even get in the way ones dont expect no poetry symbolism or metaphors just be prepared to get excited by the visual imagery and blown away by the total demolition of a bunch of bad guys hand to hand combat shootouts screaming girlies what more could you ask for if you just want to relax and forget rational thinkingi give it a 9 out of ten because it delivers without pretending to be something its not the focus lies on all the right things making it a worthy and strong portrayed action flick ready to be enjoyed by the masses,reality
after a slightly slow predictable scenesetting intro takes us on familiar territory but oh so well done the hand of besson is writ large across he was a writer for the film showing us paris as the dynamic backdrop for this movie of retribution its hard not compare it with harrison ford in frantic but liam neeson as the hard man is an intensely satisfying experience as he carves a swathe of death through the suburbs i found myself shaking watching it as the adrenaline kicked in and he shows that adrenaline rush in many scenes the acting of all concerned is believable and i never found myself questioning motives or behaviour the only reason i do not give this tenoutoften is the ease with which he rampages through paris without substantial police interference and the rather contrived final ending hollywood has to have a little cherry on top of the ice cream well worth seeing whether you are a boy or girl for a rush of juicy adrenaline,reality
take an average run of the mill actionrevenge plot throw in some over the top scenes with a bunch of one dimensional bad dudes and what do you have any of the typical stevenjean claudedolph films that have been created over the last two decades but cast liam as your ultimate bad ass and you have a whole new movie liam was rock solid and his performance was one to rememberive liked liam in several roles but never even imagined him in this type of out for revenge and bang your dead performance it was fantastic i rate an 8 in the hands of more expected actors like those listed above this would have been a 5 6 at bestitem of note this movie was pg13 and for the life of me i dont know how it was given this rating it should have been r especially due to an intense torture scene,reality
i have to describe this movie with the bourne movies as a frame of reference first of all this movie wouldnt work unless it was someone like liam nesson starring he is the movie the movie is focused on him kicking major donkey storywise this movie is very weak it plays off the stereotype that everyday thoughtless girls run to europe and get kidnapped and all manner of horrible things happen furthermore the parts of the movie that arent good guy v bad guy are borderline crap some of its bad acting but most of it is just mediocre directing and editing in those areas dont watch this movie expecting an awesome web of lies for a story its straightforward enough to be a video game now with all that said the action is quite epic the moves neeson pulls in many of these scenes even though theyre probably not actually neeson are on the level of jason bourne greatness if one simply wants to see a movie with thrilling action moments and intense sequences in between then this movie is a perfectly good use of 8 bucksbut personally if i really wanted to see it just because id go with the matine,reality
critics continue to be disengaged from the general public is a classic example overall the consensus among viewers is that is an enjoyable thriller with a slightly different twist on the agent taking on the baddies liam neeson is fun to watch and the pace move along nicely its one of thew few movies of a year of bad movies that leaves pleasant memories behindmind you i am a fan of the previous work done by this crew district b13 i found was a great movie with amazing action scenes having said that when i began i wasnt quite sure what to expect what ensued was a father in hot pursuit of his kidnapped daughter through the seedier side of france the movie preaches no message and makes no pretense that it is anything but a fun movie so why is it that critics cannot sit back and see what we see trust the viewers on this one if youre in the mood for a great action flick will be right up your alley if on the other hand you are a struggling artiste trying to glean the deep philosophical meanings of films produced by similar tortured artists you might want to take a pass,reality
synopsis bryan mills liam neeson retired from the cia as a black ops field agent so he could be close to and reconnect with his 17year old daughter kim maggie grace kim wants to go to paris with a friend but she must get her fathers permission to leave the country bryan knows how dangerous the world is and doesnt want her to go but he reluctantly gives his consent when she turns on her tears he gives her a cell phone and wants her to call him everyday after just arriving in paris kim is talking on the phone with her father when she sees that several men have broken into the apartment and have grabbed her friend bryan tells her to hide under the bed and when they grab her to yell out anything she can identify about the men bryan talks to one of the kidnappers and warns him to let his daughter go but if you dont i will look for you i will find you and i will kill you the kidnapper replies with good luck my comment the movie covers the topic of young women being kidnapped by albanian sex traffickers who hook them on drugs and sell them into prostitution using his cia contacts bryan learns that marco is the man he was talking to on the phone and that he only has a maximum of 96 hours to find kim before she is never heard from again bryan flies to paris and is in a race against time to find kim he uses all his skills to track her kidnappers down and when he finds one he extracts information and takes out his retribution liam neeson is the good guy who will not stop for anything to find his daughter you will love his character seeking revenge and feel for him while he is doing it the best line in the movie is the line when bryan is talking on the phone to marco because that is what any parent would want to say to any kidnapper there is nonstop action after bryan arrives in paris the hand to hand action is nicely done the story is straightforward with no plot twists and predictable but it doesnt matter it will hold your interest and enjoyable to watch him take out the bad guys 20th century fox run time 134 rated pg13 810,reality
this movie immediately caught my interest when i first saw the trailer and thankfully it was everything i thought it would bestars liam neeson as a retired cia operative desperately trying to rekindle his relationship with his estranged daughter so when she suddenly springs the idea of traveling to paris with one of her friends he very reluctantly allows her to go in an attempt to get her to take him back into her life before his daughter could see the eiffel tower neesons worst fears are realized and his daughter is kidnapped and dragged off only to leave a very determined liam neeson to recover herat 97 minutes this movie is short sweet and to the point initially i was worried if liam neeson may have been miscast as this is not usually the sort of roles we are used to seeing him in but he shows us a hardcore and welcomed side of his acting the action sequences are well done and well timed neeson is as resourceful as he is brutal in this role you see the determination of denzel washington from man on fire with the moves of jason bourne in neesons performance all in all a very entertaining movie and a welcomed change of pace from liam neeson,reality
i really enjoyed this movie seeing the previews originally i thought it was going to be a decent movie but in no way did i expect this quality not only is it consistent on the edge factor but it is thrilling on the eyes great cinematography combined with a thorough plot creates an exciting adventure one will talk about for dayswhen it first begins the plot quickly escalates and you get to see the bare essence of the film revealed in no way at all was there a boring moment to yawn upon instead it is filled with adrenaline reflex and just plain for lack of better explanation awesomeness i hope all enjoy the film as much as i did,reality
before i got this movie on dvd i had never heard of the director i wasnt even sure whether i should spend an hour and a half watching it my father convinced me otherwisedirected by pierre morel is the story of a fathers limitless love for his daughter bryan mills liam neeson is a strict colorless and reserved father who wants nothing other than his daughters love he is so desperate for her acceptance he allows her to take a vacation with her friend to paris even though he knows much too well the trouble she could encounter the situation is made even more irritating for bryan when he finds out paris isnt the only stop on his daughters listthe movie starts off a bit slow but quickly speeds up with bryans quest to avenge his daughters kidnapping youll soon find out bryan isnt the dull character he first appeared he is calm and clever tying together all the clues to find his daughter some of the stunts may seem over the top but are still believable and all action sequences are beautifully choreographed leaving you wondering what will he do nextis a film based on the human trafficking industry that asks every viewer the same question why arent we taking more action to crack down on this destructive industry many truths about our world are revealed in a movie that leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat,reality
is a typical action movie but it is pretty entertaining i wouldnt call this movie amazing or anything like that however it puts you on the edge of your seat its full of action mainly liam neeson beating the crap out of people in various ways and with a good right to do so the plot is a little hokey as i highly doubt the likeliness of certain situations present in the movie it is a movie though and we know it is not real so it has great entertainment value a typical style action plot and not too much character development is it the best action flick no but it is pretty good and has some nice beat downs not bad at all and worth the watch,reality
i normally dont go out for action flicks so i was sort of surprised by how picked me up on a wave and carried me pretty well through though with a few hiccups along the waybut in the end its just an action flick its pretty predictable stuff hence no danger of spoiling it to wit enormously talented security dude estranged from his family because of his line of work but still deeply loves his daughter shes kidnapped dad jumps into the frey saves his daughter end of story lots of entertaining sleuthing lots of kicking ass occasional serious breaches of believability dad tells daughter dont go to parisaccused of paranoiaand of course the daughter is promptly kidnapped by albanias only export to the west politicallycorrect gangsters hero faced with bursts of nearpointblank automatic gun fire is not hit he shoots a paris police bigwigs wife in the arm crashes many cars kills many people yet when the action is finished he hops on a plane with his daughter to fly back to the statessome great subtlety in handling and pacing but occasional firehose action sequences esp toward the end natch where you feared you were watching just another action flicki really do appreciate acting professionalism and liam neeson is an absolute wonder great actors can do anything and thats why liam gets the big bucksthe main reason i watched this was because i saw bessons name on it and he gave us such great toursdeforce i expected something like that and instead i got a quite tolerable action flick treatno moral complexity real whiteblack hat stuffquite good for the genre even if action flicks arent your bag you might want to try this one out to recalibrate your attitudes a little,reality
very surprised at how much i enjoyed this film i thought it was terrific it doesnt try to do too much or try and trick the viewer it is a very well crafted story of liam neeson kicking some ass good plot good action good casting a in my book hope you all go to see it this is the first time i can recall seeing liam in an action movie actually doing the majority of the action he didnt really fight much in batman begins and i thought he performed brilliantly famke janssen and i know i am probably butchering the spelling of these names also plays a great role any normal parent can consider the mother she plays as just a horrible mom letting your kids do whateverwhenever needless to say by the end of the movie i think she learned her lesson i even liked the smaller roles the other expreventers played their appearances were brief yet powerful and very well done hope you all feel the same way i did after seeing this it could be a surprise box office smash,reality
is not another stupid action thriller of b production with bad actors and low budget is what modern action thriller should look like written by luc besson directed by pierre morel and brilliantly acted by one and only liam neeson neeson brings completely new approach to his character and proves that you dont need to have tons of muscles to be an action star hes 56 remember he has the height style approach in one word hes cool above everything he is a great actor and he proves that once again i could go on and on talking about neeson but i want to say a few things about this movie following path of revenge besson takes us on a ride that is full of action and the whole story is told in beautiful simplicity it doesnt present nothing new but the way the whole movie was filmed with amazing action scenes some of them brutal like electricity torture and great actor in main role you gotta be satisfied with final outcome and yes you know that hes going to save everyone but then again seagal also saves everyone but 95 of his movies are stupid that is the magic of this movie cause besson didnt present anything new you just need to have passable script good young director be european and have good actor in main role all i can say just let liam neeson take you into ,reality
a satisfying addition to the revengeaction thriller genre its portrayal of violence is reminiscent of cronenbergs history of violence which is to say that every attack is decisive every punch bonecracking every trigger pulled multiple times without hesitation a ruggedly restrained liam neeson ties the whole package together nicely luc besson seems to have really hit his stride here with a newlyrealized economy of cinematic language this is a lean mean fighting film nothing flabby about it not a moment wasted although i agree with some of the comments other users have posted about maggie graces seeming misinterpretation of her characters age perhaps this was a directorial gaffe in terms of pure popcorn entertainment value and tight narrative adherence to its basic premise of personal justice the film deserves a 910,reality
this movie will satisfy those looking for thorough action gun fights slash h2h combats i liked it the plot is a lil weak no real message or moral to learn from unless you are albanian and have kidnapped liams daughter i liked it except for the instances where things occurred so conveniently for liams character eg the correct villain said good luck the 1st time around also it was so easy to analyze the phone call to exactly pin point the main kidnapper but the action and fight choreography was very very good liam looks and fits the profile for a highly talented deadly retired cia agent his combat moves were fluent like he had been doing it for years i was yearning for a good action flick with the same type of action forget storyline and plot twists as the bourne movies displayed his emotions and love for his daughter was very nicely conveyed and i was really aback when she is under the bed and he has to tell her that she will be kidnapped no lags just constant pursuit of his goal good for me,reality
i have been looking for some action this month and this piece satisfied me well enough there is a great job from the director and especially from the camera and cut although it misses some points to excellencethe main idea  retired james bond  bryan liam neeson saving his daughter in paris  is simple but efficient it provides all the action we need liam really stands out and outdoes himself the movie is not too long i would say just the right time it keeps you thrilled for the most of the scenes he is selfconfident sure of himself and desperate to find his kim this is the good part  believableon the other hand there was time when i thought how the hell could this happen  i mean some facts are not so convincing there is too much luck and accidents that favor bryan i just could not go with it in the end there is a little twist but this is not enough bryan always knows where to go and what to do and if he gets caught hanging bound waiting for execution he escapes the death miraculously but i guess this is just the way the movies are turned todaydespite this i think the movie is well worth watching its not disgusting but of course without some corpses would be no action and no fun enjoy the show ,reality
certainly given film is better than films with participation steven seagal the script writer possible to find a number of fine finds first of all it is a scene with abduction of the daughter talking at this time with the father and a scene in the house of the selling french head when his wife pays off for its sins yes it was fine basically it is a standard film it is necessary to give due to the director which did not begin to extend a film as a result it has turned out entertainment actors game except for the protagonist does not impressps i am sorry for the bad english,reality
this movie will have you at the edge of your seat from the moment of the kidnapping until the very end liam neeson plays a retired cia agent who is trying to build his relationship with his daughter who he absolutely adores but due to his job could hardly ever be there for her he reluctantly lets his 17 year old daughter go to paris with a friend and they get kidnapped by a well organized group of albanians who use them in slave trades from the moment the abduction takes place the action becomes nonstop and you wont find time to get your eyes off of the screen the tension and suspense just builds on up from that point on this movie follows the same formula man on fire did with liam neeson taking the place of denzel washington he makes sure no man involved in the kidnapping goes unpunished thanks to his jason bourne like skills speaking of bourne the editing scenes are just as great liam neeson oscar winner for shindlers list is back in form his serenity and calmness in the whole situation assures the audience he is going to get his daughter back screenwriter luc besson who also directed and wrote the cult movie leon the professional was one of the reasons i wanted to see this movie he did not disappoint me so far one of the top 5 movies ive seen in 2008,reality
is such an incredible movie with a terrific cast  a great storyline its has love tons of action intense moments it keeps you at the edge of your seat a film,reality
from start to finish it takes your breath awayno time to rest no time to get boredfast paced and out of the world action thriller,reality
2008 is an intense action movie starring liam neeson and the first installment in the franchise if you want to get as much out of it as possible there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watchings plot revolves around trafficking and unsurprisingly abduction other sensitive topics are also brought up such as prostitution all in all it creates a very dark and sometimes disturbing tone which some viewers can find repulsive nevertheless never exploits said subjects deeper than whats necessary although intense it is manageableis also a very violent film the fight scenes thanks to the contrasts from the relatively soft beginning and family interactions can have a very shocking and brutal approach blood is present but never in excessthere are two sequels to this movie which continues the established premises but doesnt contribute much more than additional runtime one could skip them and not miss out on much however if you find yourself a diehard fan of it could be of interest to at least watch the second installment and take it from theremy personal grade a rock solid 810 if you found this helpful check my profile for more reviews,reality
schindlers list turned liam neesom into a legend turned him into the baddest guy you dont want to  withthe story has enough interesting twists and surprises to keep you guessing but its liam neesons very believable acting that will draw you to follow every turns and dead end he leaves no prisoners and shows no mercy to get back his daughter an absolute adrenaline rush,reality
even though i knew liam neeson would rescue his daughter i was always on the edge of my seat the movie was thrilling and inventive and nothing like ive seen before in a rescue movie great plot twists too,reality
if you enjoy suspense mystery and liam neeson you will highly enjoy this movie,reality
just love this movielove every single bit of it its just a plain and simple action movie where the good guy does what we expect every good guy to dowin liam neeson was the perfect man to play this role great movie this is still my favourite out of the trilogy,reality
there is so much to learn from this movie not only is the plot really well developed but even though its a quite predictable and cliche movie came out in 2008 all the movies that followed just copied this but watching it in 2019 still makes it predictable the cinematography is excellent and everything fits perfectly into place even the music is good especially the end credit piano the dragster wave by nathalie mchalyghinzu oh and neeson does a really good job and his voice fits perfectly i just loved his voice with the script,reality
a fan of liam neeson and love this action movie after seeing 1cannot stop myself from watching 2 and 3 defo worth your time the love of the father to her daugther is beyond amazing and as well as what he did to look or find his daught3r in this movie you will witness how much parents love their kids and will do everything to protect them,reality
completely and utterly satisfying to see these scumbags getting their heads blown off it does highlight the lowest point of eastern european life its frightening to know that this kind of thing actually happens so yeah cheering on liam big style,reality
the plot was very simple but it was very intriguing along with good action scenes which mad the movie thrilling and entertaining for me i felt the story was well sequenced and had a good buildup to the end fight scene this movie shows that you dont need a big and complex plot to create a decent thrilling action movie,reality
i enjoyed it as a martial arts revenge movie full of irony or completely lacking any realism but the criticism that it bothers a real tragic topic in a careless way is legit,reality
this heartstopping revenge flick written by luc besson is easily liam neesons most memorable performance since his oscarnominated outing in schindlers list,reality
is a film that is a staple of action for the past decade and rightfully so it hits the right aspects just well enough i do not praise this as a excellent film but as a good onethe positives are simple a engaging story liam neeson and okish action my problems with the film comes from the supporting cast especially neesons daughter the action suffers from zoomed in shaky cam that is not awful or bad at all but not as good as it could beoverall an entertaining gripping at times film that anyone into action should see at least once,reality
wasnt super impressed i expected more since i heard so much hype i like liam but not really believable in this film,reality
i think this movie would have been much better with an r rating but as it is the action feels messy and not very well shot because is edited down to get that pg13 rating actually the story and the acting by liam neeson are the best parts of the movie and what makes it good in my opinion,reality
liam neeson has been my all time favorite actor in playing action movies so far i feel like he is so right and talented for playing as bryan mills in this movie although he is old we know that age is just a number but his skills on fighting is literally so good this movie involved so many elements that i can really learn from it such how parents taking care and willing to do anything for their children but its not just about that this movie give me conspiracy drama twist and turn epic dialogue and also a pleasing endingi dont know who you are i dont know what you want if you are looking for ransom i can tell you i dont have money but what i do have are a very particular set of skills skills i have acquired over a very long career skills that make me a nightmare for people like you if you let my daughter go now thatll be the end of it i will not look for you i will not pursue you but if you dont i will look for you i will find you and i will kill you  bryan mills,reality
liam neeson is already a great actor in general but in this movie he was transformed into an action star it was quite a gamble that certainly paid off this movie gives you everything that liam neeson has to offer and then some is an example of what i classify as a perfect movie everything from the story the acting the special effects the soundtrack and the setslocations all topnotch i remember going into the theater thinking eh it probably wont be anything special just another kidnap and rescue movie i was so happy to be proven wrong this is the movie that raised the bar for kidnappingandrescuing films its one of the fastest 90 minutes of your life when you watch it make sure you watch the unrated and uncut version nothing wrong with the pg13 version but its a little too choppy and cuts out all the good stuff the uncut version is far superior this is one of those movies with perfect utilization of the entire cast especially from liam neeson himself he has morphed himself into one of the best action stars of this generation thanks to this movie film studios should try this experiment too take actors who are known for doing drama films and try them out as action stars maybe well get another good movie like or another new action franchise in general the possibilities are endless of course i give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale which equates to 10 out of 10 imdb stars if you havent seen i will look for you i will find you and you know the rest the movie is seriously that good see it if you havent already i promise that you wont regret it,reality
the line is pretty much as powerful as the 1st saw when jigsaw rose at the end im usually not big on action movies specifically car chases but there are always exceptions is one of those liam neeson played that role,reality
is a movie that turned liam neesons career around for the better and turned him into an awesome badass in almost every movie that came afterbryan mills is such a wonderful character with so much grit so much hurt and so much determination all because of his love for his teenage daughter who is as the title suggests from himthere is also that now legendary scene where he talks to the kidnapper on the phone which is even featured on the posteri dont know who you are i dont know what you want if youre looking for ransom i can tell you i dont have money but what i do have are a very particular set of skills skills ive acquired over a very long career skills that make me a nightmare for people like you if you let my daughter go now thatll be the end of it i will not look for you i will not pursue you but if you dont i will look for you i will find you and i will kill youthis film even though its only 90 mins long really punches along with one thing happening after another with bryan brawling and shooting his way through the bad guys just to get his daughter back homea modern classic and so it should be,reality
one of the best and maybe the best movie can be rewatched at least once each year and wont get boring contains all elements of real life like emotions problems crimes facts realistic behavior extremely inspirational and motivational raises our awareness to real life problems like human trafficking and kidnapping as if movie was not acted but real happenings recorded secretly from real person except in few rare extreme occurrences this one is the best of the 3 sequels and if you wanna watch something similar i would recommend commuter 2018 by the same actor liam neeson,reality
i dont often take the time to write reviews about movies but i blinked twice and this one was over there will likely be a lot of complaints about stereotypes and the like but i highly recommend taking the movie for what it is and just enjoying what is given thinking too far into the plot wont gain you muchwhen it comes down to it liam neeson truly channeled a nonchalant inner bond and delivered the perfect character i feel like i gained happiness from this title i highly recommend watching it,reality
john mcclane on steroids isnt he ive never seen any of the films until this one the other day but im usually late to the party for most of these action flicks i dont pretend in the least to think anything i saw in the film even remotely resembles something that could actually happen so best thing is to leave your thinking cap behind and enjoy the ride the one scene i really thought was credibly done was when bryan mills liam neeson is speaking to his daughter kim maggie grace while shes hiding under the bed in the paris residence he tells her that shes going to be captive bam just like that no sugar coated everything will be alright because he knew it wouldnt be its about there though that all credibility ends as mills takes off on a whirlwind chase to hunt down the thugs who kidnapped his daughterthe thing that really gets me following any of these types of films is how no one even bothers to worry about the aftermath of all the mayhem car wrecks hotel rooms smashed dead bodies all over the place for a guy like mills and john mcclane its all in a days work once the objective is achieved and yet for any of these films that lead to a successful franchise the same bad luck befalls the action hero in a mind numbing disregard for the laws of probability ah well sometimes it can be fun to get ,reality
awesome thriller of a father who is a trained professional saving his daughter from kidnappersmust watch,reality
is set in 2008 this film is directed by pierre morel and the cast includes liam neeson bryan mills maggie grace kim and famke janssen lenore it is an action filmbryan is a retired agent who left the central intelligence agency to be near to his daughter kim in california kim lives with her mother lenore and her wealthy stepfather stuart kim manages to convince her reluctant father to allow her to travel to paris with her friend amanda when the girls arrived in paris they share a cab with a stranger amanda and her friend are kidnaped by the albanian gang of human traffickers then the father bryan must rescue the girlsthe film is full of emotional moment when the father find her daughter the colour in the photography is natural and spectacular it is a catchy tune as backing music the theme song is the weak its has a surprising endingthis film is well worth seeing it willtouch your heart and make you cheer for ordinary actors dont miss it ,reality
great storyline amazing action scenes a bit of mystery cant go wrong with this one,reality
just watched the movie todayn i know its now a old movie but truth be told its 1 if the bestest movies iv eva watched in my life,reality
this movie is one of the best action movies it has been one of the best movies i have seen if you like the kind of movies that has a lot of action and drama this is the perfect mix and you would enjoy it the movie grabs your attention 100 and you get involved about all the interesting and unexpected story sometimes the special effects can be a little bit over the top because in a extreme and dangerous situation the results always will be perfect but anyway you can see they put a lot of efford into this movie behind the scene that you would see when your are viewing the movie,reality
watched it for the 3 time in the 10 years hard to believe it has been that long that its been out it really does hold up as a pure action movie if youre looking for deep meaning or subverting your expectations look elsewherecasting neeson in this role must have been an odd choice at the time i mean oskar schindler is going to open a can of whoop ass on a bunch euros but i cant imagine the phone conversation that gets the plot rolling played by any of the more usual suspects cast in action roles the pacing is great the action sequences are pretty standard fare in the postbourne era revengerescue is a tried and true plot for an action movie paris is a visually interesting backdrop and the bad guys have no redeeming qualities so there is no need to feel guilty when they routinely get turned into pulpalso if you have a teen daughter by all means watch it with her not to scare her about going to europe but more to remind her to listen to dads wisdom and to scare her about strangers when going to europe,reality
wow this film i would class as a rare perfection brilliant fight scenes car chases and superb acting i feel liam neeson is at his best here ive always been a big fan of his but here he is definitely at his best the scenes of gathering information about bryan mills daughter is very well executed very clever ways were used in order to extract information and i liked that alot the only downside i can think of is that its to short and some scenes i think could have been stretched longer to give more actors a chance to show of their characters apart from that this is an absolute masterpiece watch it now,reality
a couple years after came out i was in my hotel room and decided to finally give a chance i was so impressed that when i got back home i went out and bought it if you havent seen it watch the unrated version more intense and better action scenes than the pg13 version of the film,reality
the dad knows how messed up it is overseas and couldntve tried harder to explain that to his wife and daughter who couldntve acted like more of jerks about being mad at him for not letting her go they act extremely naive and the wife whos already divorced him punches him below the belt calling him pathetic before leaving him high and dry at the restaurant when alls said and done he doesnt react realistically coldly toward them like he should hes way to soft why would the wife divorce him and get with some idiot instead whos as naive as she,reality
2008 is a pretty entertaining action film that features good acting all around if i had to sum up the basis of this movie in one sentence that would be it its not the best action film ive seen its just pretty good the movie has been overrated a 78 rating is just too high for this one its not worthy of a 78 imdb rating yes liam neeson is good in the starring role even if some of his acting is a little cheesy at times maggie grace is fine i honestly wasnt impressed by her performance but i didnt think she was bad and the rest of the cast is fine too the action is done very well if thats what youre looking for the movie will keep your attention 80 of the time i really dont know why the movie has been loved to the point it has been i just see it as another pretty good action movie to be honest its not all that different from the other action movies that regularly come out i do recommend the film if you like action if youd like something deeper than a regular action movie then i would say maybe keep looking i enjoyed it a fair amount but i wouldnt be all too hyped to watch it again 710,reality
this movie single handily solidified liam neeson as one of the best action leads in modern films he expertly handles the drama and intensity of the story as well as the phenomenal action sequences hes done action before this and after this but this is the only must see its a very rewatchable movie with unnecessary sequels just stick with the original,reality
a father who is on the phone with his daughter when she gets kidnapped why not  but when the father is a former agent of the american secret services played by a liam neeson without pity close to everything to find his daughter it becomes interesting throughout the film we focus on bryan during his fight against albanian pimps adhere to his fight his unorthodox methods even if he puts all paris to sack we are with him in his fight and we follow him in scenes of actions well done not too disproportionate just what it takes one of the reproaches i would make to this film is that it is a little too short for my taste i would probably have liked a few tens of minutes more this film deserves a 810 i was by the action,reality
that action hero image that liam neeson has cultivated over the last tenodd years is a wellearned one and as far as im concerned he did it without throwing a punch features a scene  you already know the one  in which neeson calmly lays out the consequences to his daughters kidnappers note read these words in his deep gravelly voice i dont know who you are i dont know what you want if you are looking for ransom i can tell you i dont have money but what i do have are a very particular set of skills skills i have acquired over a very long career skills that make me a nightmare for people like you if you let my daughter go now thatll be the end of it i will not look for you i will not pursue you but if you dont i will look for you i will find you and i will kill you if it were me on the other end of that phone id know damn well im headed for a gruesome end and pretty much fulfills that promise neeson moves from one set of bad guys to the next methodically laying waste to their scumbag ranks its a workmanlike campaign of torture and death whats disappointing is that the action scenes are a dizzying cuttoribbons affair a stark reminder that this is really your typical luc besson eurotrash its got that crucial emotional element and a perfectly cast lead actor but its never as good as that one phone call610,reality
when his daughter is kidnapped abroad an excia agent goes to extreme lengths to locate her in this fastpaced nonstop thrill ride whose box office success turned liam neeson into an action star neeson is indeed very good conveying heartfelt passion and longing for his child and much of the films success is due to his commanding performance the screenplay is certainly less spectacular full of so many absurd improbabilities and timing coincidences that any sense of realism soon evaporates there is also something quite hamfisted in how neeson spends the entire first twenty minutes worrying that something will happen to his daughter overseas at first he seems paranoid but then the film confirms his every suspicion in turn implying that all foreign places are really lurking with danger clunky and xenophobic as all this is though even more vexing is the body count with many men killed in neesons quest it is hard not to question whether the end justifies the means neeson even kills three or four men purely out of anger if they were standing in his way it might be one thing but neesons strategy of obtaining information then mercilessly killing comes off as a major character flaw that the filmmakers sadly have little interest in exploring deeply flawed as the film may be it is still enormously entertaining  even upon second viewing when one knows exactly what to expect the action scenes are very well spliced together and a sense of danger sublimely lingers in the air throughout as invincible as neeson seems he also always seems utterly vulnerable and the fact that he is much too old for the role actually works to his advantage,reality
this movie is simply brilliant it has wellfilmed action exciting and in some ways scary drama great performances great character development and catchphrases there isnt a a single problem i have with this movie on a scale from a to f this movie would get a a i just cant explain how much i love this movie sucks that the sequels were some of the worst movies ever made if you want to see a movie with great action acting direction drama and plot is the movie for you its just groundbreaking is a cinematic masterpiece that will be nominated for all the golden globes and oscars no but is it a good movie heck yes is a damn good movie which is why it gets 1010 and a a,reality
i love this movie ive seen it already a couple times and ive always loved it this time was no exception the plot of is exactly what youd expect from a movie with that title its about someone who gets in this case a mans daughter and the man brian goes after her its paced very well and all the reasons for coming to certain conclusions arent implied like in other movies ive seen like this but instead are obvious and explained everything has a reason for happening and it remains relatively simple throughout the characters are pretty good they arent horribly welldeveloped or anything but you know them pretty well by the end is super fun to watch the action scenes are great a lot better than others that ive seen they arent expertly choreographed or unrealistic or anything brian uses quite simple movements to attack his enemies while still maintaining a quite fluent and epic battle to watch it adds to the realism of the fight while not being boring to watch oftentimes the simpleness of his moves are quite humorous in how dispassionate and relentless they and he can be something that i noticed particularly about this movie as opposed to other movies is that brians character is pretty open about his old job all these movies about exhit men or exspies all feel the same the guy is running from his past but something comes up and he has to take action in brian still hangs out with his friends from his old job and its never completely stated what he did for a living exactly it leaves that part up to the audience most characters let on that they also knew what he was doing for work which once again isnt the norm in these kinds of movies typically overall is fantastic the plot is great the characters are good the action if great and its original it stands as one of the best action movies out there and its definitely different from others while still being loads of fun in the end id certainly recommend this movie to just about anyone looking for a good time at the movies,reality
72 out of 10somewhere deep beneath a tonne of hollywood clichs and mediocre writing is a really solid and entertaining action film while neeson is undeniably a force to be reckoned with each beat felt predictable to me and the dialogue was really quite bland and stock there were moments however where i saw the shadow of the film was trying to be a film rivaling action thrillers of the past decade for me it just didnt quite get there i can however appreciate what did for the genre and the role it played in similar more enjoyable films getting made,reality
this movie provides many things such as a great plot excellent action good cast and an amazing overall story i was very entertained while watching this movie and i never once lost interest liam neeson does not disappoint his voice and his skills make you truly believe that he certainly does have a great set of killing skills great action from beginning to end truly makes you reconsider letting your loved ones travel alone in the world all i could think of while watching this movie was if that was my daughter i would have zero clue on how to get her back i actually felt terrible for all those women who got tortured drugged and raped really makes you think how many girls have been separated from their family and loved ones in reality the amount of sad emotions and pain they would feel is just heart breaking really makes you feel the emotional pain and anger actual families in these circumstances encounter theres nothing out there better then a movie that actually makes you feel the emotional pain the characters go through,reality
this is pretty stellar actionrevenge movie with liam neeson perfect for what will become his goto genre the kickass take no prisoners action hero the movie is fun to watch moves at a quick pace and because the bad guys are so bad sex trade kidnappers you dont feel much remorse when they get knocked out maimed shot stabbed electrocuted dumped overboard or just plain killedneeson plays an ex cia agent who turns paris upside down after his teenage daughter is abducted by members of a sex trade gang ruthless in his quest he employs his very particular set of skills in tracking her down and its pretty awesomeon the negative side maggie grace is a bit too old to play the 15 year old party dress wearing boppy teenager and initially bryan seemed way too certifiably obsessed with her wellbeing the acting is solid though grace definitely does her bit to act underage and neeson is intense throughout along with some well choreographed fight scenes car chases shootouts torture sequences etc its a classic 122815,reality
the movie is about a man brian mills who is retired from the central intelligence agency and did so in order to spend more time with his daughter shortly into the movie bryans daughter kim travels to paris where she is abducted by a rich and powerful group who is discovered to be known for its sex trafficking operations the theme of the movie is pretty obvious but the directors do a good job with the progression of the film to make you feel as if there is a slim chance the brian may not make it in time to save kim the films theme is about brian who has a special background in the cia who is trying to get away from the fast and dangerous life that his job entailed but found himself in an unfortunate situation which does not allow that to happen a film with a similar theme is live free or die hard which is a part of the die hard series brians nemesis seems as if it is incapable of defeat and is always one step ahead however brian will do whatever it takes to accomplish the mission the audience is drawn close to the brian by using characteristics that go hand in hand with the ideal father figure characteristics such as a loving and gentle man who has the dangerous tenacity that any man would envy the kidnapping of his daughter kim triggered a chain of events that releases brians unrelenting force that is seemingly unstoppable no matter what comes his waythe angle and lighting of the phone call scene in combination with the intensity of brians voice gives you goose bumps the camera focuses on brians facial features which is draped in a sort of dark setting this gives you the feeling that brian is deep in thought and true to every word he speaks he answers the phone call sitting on the bed but as soon as he puts the phone to his ear he begins to stand up when brian stands up it give you the feeling that he is ready to take action against the person on the other side of the phone the camera subtly zooms in on brians face to give you an intimate moment with brian and the perpetrators a moment that makes you want to join forces and find kim when it comes to a child in distress the only thing that will stop brian would be death however death itself will have a tough match against a man on fire,reality
2008 directed by pierre morel was released in 2008 and emphasizes liam neesons fantastic action and great thrills as morel already showed in prior movies like district 13 and transporter unlike other action movies also contains parental love which is actually the starting point of the actionthe film is set in france where kimmaggie grace and her friend are traveling the action begins when kim is kidnapped by gangsters before being kidnapped she makes a phone call to her father bryanliam neeson who is a former secret agent when the gangsters find kim calling her father one of them takes her phone bryan threatens the gangsters to set his daughter free but they ignore him and just say good luck to him based on this phone call he tries to find them according to the specific tattoos which kim describes finally he finds the gangsters and tries to catch the man who kidnapped his daughter but the more clues he gets about where kim is the more he gets in troubleits very remarkable that the director portrays bryan as a rounded character to be more specific some scenes in which he kills gangsters portray him as a cruel man but some scenes which are related to his daughter portray him as an ordinary father of course considering the genre of this movie the best aspect of bryans appeal is his wonderful action which is shown when he fights with gangstersis full of fantastic action that will appeal to anyone who likes action and thrills also it may help young people understand their parents infinite love by seeing liam neesons devotion to his daughter therefore is absolutely worth watching and anyone who watches this movie wont be able to take their eyes off the screen until the movie ends,reality
may have been released back in 2008 but to be honest it is still one of the best actionthrillers thats been released within the last 20 years and the part of bryan mills is played superbly by liam neeson this isnt an overthetop actionthriller its not a cheesy actionthriller its also not an actionthriller that lacks in the story department either as so many can  and usually  do nope is one of the more rarer actionthrillers that delivers a decent story along with plenty of tense highpaced actionboth the story and film start out decently enough and continues at a steady enough pace instead of diving straight in with no backstory to anything it gradually builds as it goes on and only increases in tension  pace from the moment that mills daughter is kidnapped the build up to this moment alone was excellentthe suspense the way the scene was edited together and of course the i will find you speech delivered perfectly by neeson all of that doesnt just stop at that scene though as the rest of the movie is pieced together fantastically as the action  intensity both increaseneeson is perfect in the role as bryan mills and its like it was made for him this obviously isnt the 1st action film hes done but dont think hes played this type of role very often  if at all  but he slot right into it with no problems i learned that jeff bridges was offered the part before neeson no offence to bridges but i cant really picture him playing this kind of role and thankfully he dropped out paving the way for neeson even though shes not in it all that much famke janssen was good also and she has this knack for playing annoying women so perfectly which is how i found lenore to be in annoying and very naive especially when it came to her daughter the evil side of me wishes mills would have said i told you to lenore at the endis definitely a film that should be on everyones must see list,reality
i will find you 810 pierre morels action packed thriller seemed to be quite the attention grabber for a broad audience you will see some familiar faces on the screen such as liam neeson playing the father and former government agent bryan famke janssen as the mother lenor and maggie grace playing the innocent teenage daughter kim kims trip will give you a different outlook on france and some of the problems in the world that are so easily overlooked doesnt seem to be the most believable scenario but informs the audience of the arising issue with human trafficking and the societal normalization of prostitution it will have you sitting on the edge of your seat continuing to wonder what is in store for you next liam neeson bryan the father of a teenage girl maggie grace kim is a retired government agent he remains persistent while struggling to regain presence in his daughters life while on a trip in paris with her best friend kim is kidnapped and held for the pleasure of the slave traffickers with the only information bryan has from his daughters short phone call before getting he has less than four days to track his daughter down in europe and is willing to demolish anyone or anything that gets in his way in this film you will experience liam neeson tearing europe apart in horrific search of his daughter liam neesons character will grab your attention and hold it tight from start to finish the acting in this film is not only entertaining and respected but the actors truly portray their character while giving you a feel of what it would be like to be in their shoes with the little acting maggie grace kim had in the movie she did well playing the part of a seventeen year old who seemed to know more than everyone while being auctioned off to the slave trafficking buyers kim shows to be helpless hopeless and scared but yet becomes more aware of her horrible situation while experiencing the unbearable time kim becomes more mature and advanced with the world around her in this action thriller there are many fast moving scenes even though they keep you biting your nails they are at times hard to follow and very easy to become lost in with it being an action packed movie they should have aimed for better camera movement and viewing in the modern apartment during the kidnapping scene it becomes quite hard to follow as the editing and film choices were not the best while the action is never boring or tiring it is just sometimes hard to view solely because of the editing decisions and capturing of scenes although full of excitement it might also make you nauseous with the fast camera movements poor editing and quick scene changes morel brings a captivating sensation upon his viewers while watching this film you will leave with the opinion of a consistent dialogue a great choice of characters and a riveting yet distinctive storyline this film deserves great credit for delivering the misinterpreted facts and horror about sex trafficking to the audience not only does pierre morel leave you and everyone else feeling accomplished he keeps your thoughts in mind on every action scene i believe everyone should go out and see this movie if anything to become more educated on these bigger issues as liam neeson would say good luck to everyone this movie will be tough to beat,reality
a original emotional driven story that matches this action filmthe plot centers around bryan mills liam neeson a retired cia agent travels across europe and relies on his old skills to save his estranged daughterkim maggie grace who has been kidnapped while on a trip to pariswhat also makes the film well known is for bryans quote i dont know who you are i dont know what you want if you are looking for ransom i can tell you i dont have money but what i do have are a very particular set of skills skills i have acquired over a very long career skills that make me a nightmare for people like you if you let my daughter go now thatll be the end of it i will not look for you i will not pursue you but if you dont i will look for you i will find you and i will kill you that is quite a powerful threat to make in the movie and it goes to show how far a father would go for his daughter liam brings a level of pain to the action genre as his character proves to be a smart and deadly fighter the film not only feature intense moments of action but the emotional driven experiences is what drive the movie in this actionthriller the writers were doing something right for doing a action film that features a story where the emotions run high and have your nerves on highso this is a film you must watch because it is that goodi give an 9 out of 10,reality
i had heard a lot about this movie good and bad but finally decided to see it and see what all the fuss was about this film really puts the plot out there and puts a lot on the line trafficking prostitution agents weapons and a lot more what really made an impression was the fact that they were very explicit in showing how and what both when it came to the killings the torture but also the trafficking and the girls and drugs it was very brutal very fresh and very violentit also has a very unrealistic side with all the things that are very intense the probability of one man doing all this yes he is a former special agent but it doesnt seem all believable and when all is done he has maybe 50 lives but there are no repercussions no one comes after him no police no agency no nothingi loved it as a action movie and took it for what it is then it works out very well and is very intense etc,reality
i watched it yesterday and what to say about it its just awesome i never thought about the action was good and liam neeson was incredible and the story they got was very good and different the films duration was just over 90 minutes which i like and it was a perfect duration for this filmhe is now i gave him a batch of a action star i watched his thea team which was also a awesome movie but i never thought that he will be awesome in his alone presence toothe director has done a pretty good work with this film and luc besson has written a pretty good script and the acting was also enjoyableoverall a good action movie and pretty interesting ,reality

since hollywood cant just keep an exhilarating actionthriller by its self and has to make two sequels one exactly the same and the other not even apart of the continuous story to create a franchise it can be hard to enjoy the first film that was awesome liam neeson being known as an old badass may be a headshaker for some but i dig every bit of his pathetic toughguy dialogue and equipped fight skills being his most badass role involves him killing over forty evil sextraffickers who kidnap his daughter in paris sex traffickers were the perfect villains to tackle due to having an international relations type of plot with neesons character traveling all over fight after fight and shot after shot neeson delivers menacing facial expressions towards his enemies while constantly knocking down bad guys in his post cia career director pierre morel gets the fact that americans like big movie stars taking down bad guys without making us suffer through some fatherdaughter sap morel blends a mega human rights issue thats handled with awesome action punishing those cruel men who fill his screen neeson having a blast gives a ton of energy into his fun role only taking up 93 minutes is a smart thriller with package after package of action thats delivered in the finest form imaginable,reality
ok so i am probably the last person on earth to watch up until recently i simply havent had time to watch anything so this is new and fun for me on with the review you would have to live under a box to have not heard the line you dont know me but i possess a certain set of skills i will find you and i will kill you paraphrasing a bit but you get the gist but when i actually heard him say itoooohhhhhh man chills the storyline was ok it had a few holes that needed to be filled in it could have easily been accomplished during opening creditsa little stroll through a scrap book of his accomplishments whatever but one does get the story or so they think straight away liam was the perfect choice for the lead his laid back demeanor and easiness belies his skillset i was totally in and believed in his character the daughter although brief was cast well the scene where she is actually is excellentbut not because of her because of the calmness of her father the adventure that lay ahead wasnt disappointing the only thing i didnt care for was the sexual aspect i do not live in a bubble and know that sexual human trafficking exists my own daughter is involved with shutting it down but i dealt with it and moved along fast paced a little over the top in stunts but all in all a good movie left me wanting to immediately watch the sequel,reality
liam neeson is no stranger to thrillers and pierre morels was certainly one of those which highlighted neesons strength in the genrethe action is relentless and thoroughly engaging however with a lesser actor in neesons shoes would have struggled massively in fact the main reason is a good watch is due to the strength neeson has as the leading character  the action just cements the films solidity when neesons on screen daughter maggie grace is kidnapped by sex traffickers he is pushed to his limits in order to even have a sniff of finding his child its many flaws come with a thin plot line no twists of relevance various characters poorly fleshed out characters who are bland without much personality and a seemingly rushed ending after the crew appear to run out of script ideashowever for neesons strong commanding performance and an exhilarating feature length rollercoaster action frenzy you cant go far wrongrental from the local dvd shop popcorn from home bargainsjobs a good n as us more common british say,reality
in bryan mills liam neeson is a retiree and father who takes helicopter parenting to a whole new level mills comes across as an ordinary likable joe who likes to barbecue in the backyard with his pals except that he also harbors lethal ninja reflexes from his former job as a federal agent with a murky resumehes also been a bit abused by the system having undergone a divorce and having to feebly tolerate the endless whips and scorn of his conniving superficial exwife and constant financial humiliation before the disgustingly rich sockpuppet who replaced him as husband to his wife and as guardian of his daughter but they are living the high life now and mills is left behind like an obsolete relic a drag on the partybut then due largely in part to everyones failure to listen to his better sense of the world mills daughter is she is snatched away into oblivion by dark spirits thousands of miles away and an ocean apart so just how far does a fathers love go it all sounds a bit hackneyed even dated but nevertheless the movie rides neesons performance as the scrappy determined and shockingly brutal huntertracker who charges through all obstacles human physical societal or logical to rescue his daughter in spite of having been featured prominently in a number of action movies neeson looks like a doting daddy not a toughguy assassin and i think that is why these types of roles for him result in such appealing entertaining moviesis a fun actionpacked thriller in which miller efficiently delivers just dessert to all of the nasty fiends scuttling along the supply line leading to his daughter its a bit of a throwback to older revenge and justice fantasies in which white middleclass westerners lash out at swarthy ethnic people who are out to exploit and wring dry western civilization i can see why some would feel that the movie cultivates fear distrust and xenophobia im actually a bit impressed with how boldly the movie like miller dives headfirst into these thorny situations,reality
is a cult classic with a huge following and all this is due to its portrayal of a former cia who was ready to do anything to get back his kidnapped daughter the movies intense following is due to its violent nature portrayed by liam neeson as he was a james bond jason borne and rambo all rolled up into one chasing down a group of armenians and making them pay dearly for even thinking about taking his daughterthe film was so well received by audience that it raked in a high 200 million dollars from its 25 million dollars production cost luc besson was the man behind the direction and the writing of this cult classic and he was called back to come make the sequel 2 which was released in 2012the movie is about excia operative bryan mills liam neeson whose daughter gets kidnapped when she travels to paris to follow u2 during their european tour with only a picture of his daughter at the airport the voice of the man who took her bryan is racing against time to save his daughter before she is shipped out of the country and not seen againliam neesons performance in this movie is what is captivating his characters ability to keep calm and think his way through any situation is what makes bryan mills the wrong guy to mess with elements of jason borne he used every known way alive to track down these guys even shooting a friends wife just to get the man to talk he placed himself in danger numerous times but was able to find a way out at all times making him bond and ramboat the end of this movie you will be queuing up for seconds my favourite action scene is when bryan corned peter the man who leads the kidnappers to his daughter in a taxi in paris and starts to punch his ribs in giving him details of how his ribs and lungs may not survive another punch if peter doesnt give him all the information he wants to know here is a dvd that i couldnt help but owningmind you 2 was just same same with him and wife now and he just having to be bryan and he breaks free tracks down the guys again and messes them up 2 is just a speck in the dark compared to this grand masterwwwlagsreviewscom,reality
in this france thriller liam neeson plays a retired cia agent whos daughter gets kidnapped into prostitution in paris causing him to take action and locate his daughter by any means and that means killing anybody who steps in his pathhe trained batman changed the lives of 2000 jews and fought off a pack of wolves now hes back and more badass than ever despite his old age he still manages to impress us to no endi like to compare this film to bourne except while bourne is always on the defensive neeson in this is on the full on offense no mercy in this film everybody who doesnt help him locate his daughter gets it no joke its extremely fast paced and doesnt fool around gets right down to business no rush either just simply fast filmed fast editing fast dialog and fast and awesome action scenes most of the film consists of liam neeson killing interrogating or chasing someone the villains change from person to person as he simply follows around his daughters kidnappersalthough a truly simple story it still stays bright with the smartness of the character and his amazing skills but regardless it isnt very complex like bourne is but it really didnt need to why be needlessly complex just to waste pointless time and money its as simple as it gets plus a few parts are really intense making it feel complexif i had to argue one thing itd be that it was a little anti climactic kills everybody and rescues the daughter thats it yes he does get captured but escapes immediately then the daughter returns and is like bye dad thanks for saving my life not what she really says but basically even though that didnt bother me too much it was just something i noticed other than that simply brilliant no complicated subplots or characters doesnt ever drag just the plot the character and his mission thats all you will not find another film that does that i assure you definitely worth the watch just be careful with the sequel i heard it isnt as good,reality
there seems to be a trend in recent years for elderly action stars to revisit characters from their past be it the upcoming dine hard where a geriatric bruce willis is living a carefree life in a care free care home spoon fed all his meals until he realises generic terrorists are purposefully sabotaging meals on wheels or indiana and the quest for the adult nappies where harrison ford realises that having an irritating shia labeouf as your son isnt great when it comes to choosing a care homeanyway i digress turns this trope on its head in having the aged liam neeson only joining the action genre in his old age also manages to avoid all of the clichd plots that other action movies spew out such as an elite special forces soldiers daughter being kidnapped and him going on an international riproaring revenge rampage oh wait thats the entire plot when his daughter is kidnapped in france by eastern european sex traffickers neeson heads to paris to fk sht up for an hour and a half of course this being an american film the big bad must ultimately be brown so its lucky neesons im making no attempt to pretend i actually know his characters name daughter is being bought by a saudi sheikwhilst the plot is terrible and a soggy retread of die hard and other classic action films does provide some amazing action sequences and harrowing torture scenes neeson excels managing to be far better than the script should allow him to bewhilst not exactly an oscar winner manages to be great in its own right and its quotability and enjoyment factor lead to what has shown itself to be a cult classic and a great piece of pulp fiction,reality
i think its safe to say the only reason this film is good is because of liam neeson the guy really plays the role fantastically hes so freaking awesome however if it wasnt for sir neeson it would be an abomination i have to say maggie grace is probably one of the worst actors i have ever seen she always plays this annoying unlikeable in every film ive seen her in and shes the worst character in lost every actor including maggie just make the whole thing kinda cheesy then neeson owns everyone my only criticism is that they shouldve made the other characters more likable especially maggie i didnt care about her at all to be honest,reality
has surprised me in many different levels its fast paced exciting and in general just a very welltold story i gave it an eight because it managed to keep me glued to the screen throughout the whole time if you are looking for one of those movies where there is always something going on and no moments of utter boredom the this is for youhowever i do feel obliged to admit that if i were looking for a realistic movie this would not be it perhaps because it is rather short sometimes it seems as if there is too much  going on plus the main character whose role was beautifully played takes on a mission to singlehandedly get her daughter back from a bunch of mafiosi in paris like i said not the most realistic movie out thereneverthess within its short running time and within its genre its a very entertaining movie it is definitely worth watching it does not attempt to be what it cannot be like so many movies out there do nowadays with all their complex plots and overly thoughtout characters this is simply a very good movie,reality
this movie is the first movie that while watching i thought to myself wow this movie is really exciting the plot is actually pretty simple which shows that you do not need to have a really complicated plot with multiple twists to make a great action moviebesides the execution of the movie what stands out is that liam neesons performance of is absolutely amazing the ruthlessness that comes only with having something so important away was really conveyed in the actionspoilers my only gripe is that the ending may not have been as realistic as i expected as much as i am a sucker for happy endings it seems odd that he did not have to clean up or pay for what he did in paris all in all a great movie everything you would want in an awesome action movie that makes you attached on an emotional level,reality

i saw this movie at the stand of my dvd rental i had nothing to do that night so i decided to rent this movie just because liam neeson was in it i heard nothing about this movie before so i had no expectations whatsoever i have to say i was blown away with this movie the brilliance of the direction kept my heart pounding thirsty for more information about the development of the plot the action sequences were beautifully made with some parts kinda hastymade in editing but it was something neglect able because of the exquisite quality of the stunts liam neeson managed as always to capture his role so tightly that you could tell that he was actually made for the certain part and you actually knew that he would kill you by twisting his pinkie neeson is a great actor and always excels in what he does think of him as the opposite of nick cageall in all i give this movie a great 810 i loved the story the acting was brilliant the stunts were cool and it was a great production after all,reality

so the thing about liam neeson is he has a very special set of skills one of them being acting unfortunately he doesnt always choose the best movies well maybe financially was a good decision but i think he could do better is the story of a man in pursuit of his daughter who has been kidnapped to be used as a sex slave liam neeson plays the father an exsuper secret blah blah blah that can kick any ones ass and take a beating without it really showing as much as most people liked it i didnt see anything particularly remarkable in this film shaky action movie camera work and one liners dont always do it for me sure the movie had a certain amount of entertainment unfortunately due to the lighting you can barely see any of it which may be for the best because i would have gotten tired of seeing neeson using his special set of skills to slam eurothugs for two hours straight to me this movie is nothing new nothing innovative and not well executed enough to make up for its unoriginality,reality
what actually blew my mind about this movie was the public reaction to it not only does it have a high imdb rating but it seems to be the movie that people automatically link with liam neeson at least according to the recent graham norton show which would all imply that this was a great movie but not only was it bad it was so bad that me and my mate started laughing at the absurdity of it about halfway through it was not a complete waste of 90 mins though reading all the reviews written by people who hated it did provide at least 30 mins of solid laughs i am happy enough to ignore the stupidity of the daughter in the way she gets kidnapped as it sets up the film but from the get go liam neesons character was so wooden and robotic maybe it was the script the directing or the acting but it only got worse as he cuts a path of destruction through europe with a psychotic intent of getting his daughter back any way possible by the end its hard to pick who is the more evil liam neeson or the villains who make a habit of sexually enslaving women or maybe the person who wrote the unbelievably bad and stereotyped scripti want to give this the lowest rating possible but in the context of a pure action movie its above average and thats why i have compromised for a rating of 3 but please dont believe the hype it is not a bourne identity or casino royale those movies had the action coupled with some depth backed up by some good acting and that is why they were great this movie is lacking in everything but the action 3 stars,reality
i really liked this movie i must say i wasnt expecting too much of it yes liam neeson is trademark for good acting but the topic seemed too much clich prettynaivegirl being kidnapped  angry almighty father going through everyoneeverywhere to rescue her now i am really pleased to note how wrong i waseven though the aforesaid is the main engine of the film it is framed in the context of trafficking in women a very interesting and sad topic to watch these kind of business is rearising nowadays specially in europe and this movie is a good way to involve those who are not aware of its reality everyone of us have either a daughter a sister a cousin  unfortunately we have not neesons abilities otherwise everything would be easierthe movie is easy to watch and has a constant thrilling atmosphere that keeps you with both eyes on the screen it has some plot holes i must say but nothing so important and nothing that cant be explained with the of course he learned that while working as a spypreventor argumentplease go see it and if you dont like it contact me i will reimburse your money ,reality
trailers are often very more intense than the real thingno surprises here but even while bearing this in mind flicks can be disappointing regardless of their imdb ratingfor me this certainly was the case with you watch liam neeson as the desperate former ciaoperative bryan who is struggling with his divorce and an apparent custody issue that does not allow him to visit his daughter kim in personal his wife played by famke janssen is very reluctant to his approaches to get in touch with her especially at her birthday which is celebrated at the mansion of the obviously more fortunate new husband of his exwife knowing his daughter aspires to become a singer he buys her a karaoke machine which she gratefully accepts only to become even more enthusiastic as she finds out her stepfather bought her a horsekim and her friend amanda plan to go on a holiday to paris on the pretext of wanting to watch all the culture up there as she is still 17 she needs her fathers written permission being aware of the dangers of being alone in paris bryan is reluctant to gove his permission his exwife puts pressure on him as she believes he is overprotective of his daughter finally he signs but only under a few conditions such as calling him after her arrival and letting him know when theyve reached their apartmentat the airport however bryan finds out his daughters real plan is to follow u2s vertigo tour through europe once more his exwife insists he should let her go as many teens follow through such plansof course right after arrival things go awry kim and amanda meet a young man peter who asks if theyd like to share a cab as it is less costly he takes a few pictures from them and tells them there is a party that night also he finds out about their whereabouts amanda is enthusiastic about the party but kim is reluctant that same night mobsters break into the apartment kim watches while amanda is being kidnapped while on the phone with bryan bryan immediately turns on tapping equipment kims phone is grabbed by one of the mobsters bryan firmly explains that he has not enough money for any ransoms but has a considerate set of skill built up during a lifetime career and that he will find them and kill them if they do not release her daughter hes simply answered with good luck from a voice with an obvious foreign accentkims stepfather provides certain assets such as a business plane which allows bryan to fly to france unseen bryan uses his former connections but is warned as his rampage causes too many victims destined to find his daughter bryan ignores these warnings and finds himself in some pretty ugly places the chase is on and there you have your flick i found myself pretty much disappointed the martial arts skills that neeson shows are impressive however there are too many implausible events and characters neeson kills a lot of bad guys but also wound andor kills apparently innocent persons which makes his character difficult to accept the overly concerned and apparently sincere character he plays seems to have just too little to justify his actions other than being a missing girls father he turns into an unstoppable force with a thin red line between good and evil as his crusade leaves a lot of question marks on his behavior produced by luc besson i expected a wellcrafted action thriller and besson delivers however on the other hand it is only a few steps away from commando where it comes to plausibility,reality
liam neeson at his most intense when i first saw the trailers for this i thought great another cheaply written action flick but i was pleasantly surprised by the fast pace and enjoyabletowatch action i cant think of any complaints for this movie other than the fact that the plot was very if not maybe a little too quick if youre unaware that theyre gonna make an attempt at a sequel to this yes they are which i dont really get how you could but well just have to wait and see and one thing that neeson did well was showing his normal and average suburban act but soon after seeing that side showed his darker and stronger side as well as demonstrating some really cool fighting techniques that consist mainly of chops to the neck but on the whole  great achievement in modern thrillers,reality
just saw the movie in the sneak preview first of all this movie will get a lot of those people who will whine about everything that is not realistic really if you are one of those youll have a lot to whine about but if you can just enjoy a movie as its intended to be and you appreciate some action this movie is near perfect the main character is so pure and non complex finally an action movie that doesnt try to give some oddities to the characters to make them more interesting but just straightforward high speed action watching this movie was a great experience and i was surprised that i could enjoy an action movie this much my tip sit down enjoy the ride and dont moan about imperfections,reality
i love liam neeson in all his films so when i found this i watched it straight away after i watched it i felt happy and i loved itneeson is an ex cia agent who travels round europe searching for his daughter who has been its unoriginal but its good and neeson is great in it at times it can be far fetched but you just accept it neeson is a tough man in this film and hes brilliant also his great voice adds to his toughness in it you know whats going to happen but you want to see how its doneeveryone ive spoken to has all liked this film so it has to be good i have watched this film 4 times and it never gets old for me if you like neeson and action watch this film you wont regret it,reality
by maurice jones when it comes down to it i dont have any serious care for a film like this as its just pure entertainment and liam neeson as an action hero is understandably laughable but based on the enjoyed reaction it got from people around me and not being entirely opposed to mindless contrived mainstream entertainment i checked out in liam neeson plays an ex government protector who decides to retired in order to get closer to his teenage daughter whos mother remarried do to the fact of his constant absence in the past do to his job the ex protector soon finds out that his daughter wants to go away to paris for the summer asking his permission the ex protector immediately says no and warns her of the dangers of a teenage going out to paris as a tourist on a whim due to his experience being a government officer protecting the president he eventually lets his daughter go and low and behold something happens and his daughter is just as he predicted at this point the movie goes straight into a movie sequence that seems set for liam neeson to be an action hero a well narrating action hero which is immediately laughable as things get into gear outright fight scene after outright fight scene comes and comes as liam neesons character is in search for his daughter in paris although ridiculous it is interesting and empowering seeing liam neeson plow through villain after villain and become this jean claude vandammeesque ex protector reusing his past fight techniques liam neesons character is relentless in any way possible to get his daughter back which keeps the movie exciting but implausible and this lasts to the bitter end by the end you cant believe he went through all that but are humbled by the quick actingness of a father who loves his daughter and will do anything for heri liked for the excitement and the ridiculousness of liam neeson being an action hero but realizing in the end why liam neeson did this film as he is soft enough to play a believable caring father but also smart enough and quick enough to be a lean mean unstoppable killing machine,reality
i had relatively huge expectations about this movie based on its high imdb rating which was 79 out of 10 stars when i decided to see it in the end i was a bit disappointedis not really a bad movie on the contrary it is a quite enjoyable and interesting action thriller however it is full of improbable plot elements it is also a bit similar to denzel washingtons 2004 flick man on fire which i happened to see about a month earlier and which i did not really like because of excessive violence in the second half of the moviein there was a fairly huge amount of unnecessary violence towards the end of the movie although not as huge as in man on fire is also significantly shorter by comparison which is both good and bad its good because the huge amount of violence did not completely ruin the movie its bad because there could have certainly been a little bit more to say before the movie came to its predictable endliam neeson plays a former cia agent bryan mills who moves to california in order to be closer to his daughter kim who lives there with her mother and her rich stepfather bryan meets with a couple of his former colleagues and visits his daughter for her 17th birthday his colleagues ask him to help them out with the security of a pop star which happens to be quite convenient considering his daughters wish to become a singer especially after he saves the pop star from a maniacal attackernext kim wants her father to sign an agreement so she can go to paris with her friend amanda he reluctantly agrees and gives his daughter a cell phone so he can call her when she gets there in paris the two girls naively tell a stranger where they are going to stay kim then finally calls her father and sees amanda getting kidnapped she manages to tell him some details about the kidnappers before getting kidnapped herselfbryan travels to paris to find his daughter there begins a series of improbable events he immediately finds the same guy the girls led to their apartment and chases him around before watching him getting hit by a truck he also quickly finds the group of kidnappers and proceeds to kill them all in no timethere were some really sickening scenes such as the one where he shoots a gang member in the back or the one where he wounds his french colleagues wife after finding out that he was also involved with the bad guys the whole story about some rich sickos buying women at auctions was also very bizarreit was totally unbelievable how bryan introduced himself to the bad guys as a french agent in the middle of paris while speaking english at the same time and they were dumb enough to believe him not to mention the fact that he did not get arrested during his violent sprees in the first place and the ending in which he kills the big bosses and saves his daughter was totally predictabledespite that i can say that i mostly enjoyed the movie neeson was good in the lead while the antagonists were quite dumb and the kidnapped girls naiveness was a bit exaggerated there was a couple of very good action scenes although quite unbelievable and totally predictable the plot was also somewhat interesting,reality
i dont know who you are i dont know what you want if youre looking for a ransom i can tell you i dont have any money but what i do have are a very particular set of skills acquired over a very long career in the shadows skills that make me a nightmare for people like you if you let my daughter go now that will be the end of it i will not look for you i will not pursue you but if you dont i will look for you i will find you and i will kill you  liam neeson from that quote you can see what is a fastpaced action thriller with some of the most obvious lines in the history of the genre the entire experience is lightweight and mildly amusing its plot is pretty ordinary yet the films characters are mostly efficient it centers around liam neesons bryan mills a semiretired cia operative who worked in the field for many years which has led him to be aware overprotective and almost constantly paranoidvictim to his protectiveness is his daughter kim grace kim is bryans daughter from his first marriage that didnt go so well because of his frequent absence since his cia job is very demanding kim is a bright young girl who begs daddy for his signature so she can go to paris with her girlfriend to look at the museums aka u2 concerts reluctantly and after providing a plethora of conditions bryan signs the agreement and kim is off to paris its not long her and her friend are kidnapped by a group of albanian thugsbefore she is she calls her father who hears just enough information to make the effortless flight over to paris and to try and find her kidnappers of course bryan possesses an unprecedented amount of skills to conduct an operation of this magnitude for gods sake get this man a compass a map and a ticket to afghanistan so he can find osama bin laden and take down another terrorist operation the first half hour of the film was compelling interesting and on top of everything an action film should be on top of character development plot and suspense after about fortyfive minutes or so then becomes a slightly incomprehensible beatemup action film for the least demanding the camera moves quickly and the fast paced editing style seems like it can sometimes barely keep up with the madness thats unfoldingultimately the film is somewhat interesting but how it merited a pg13 rating is mindboggling to me its not graphic per se but the mpaa is notorious for overreacting to small little instances and subject matter the fact that this film can speak about drug addiction prostitution trafficking and boast the amount of language and violence as if it comes in a limitless quantity all with a pg13 rating further cements that if a film focuses primarily on violence the mpaa will continue to be very lenient on itsomething also must be said about liam neesons performance he possesses wit style pleasantness stress and anger all in a believable manner the film is essentially a one man show with neeson bringing as much life to the character going beyond what has already been provided the rest of the supporting cast is either rarely seen or killed off shortly after they make an appearanceis a fair action film motivated by the recurring action film themes fast paced sometimes unbelievable blows to every part of the body and nonstop twists and turns of the camera neeson manages to lift the film off its feet in terms of giving an efficient performance but the film feels generic and suffers from the sameness we are so used to in action films today its not bad but its aftertaste is an underwhelming one at beststarring liam neeson maggie grace leland orser jon gries david warshofsky katie cassidy holly valance and famke janssen directed by pierre morel,reality
i personally enjoyed this movie great action film which centers on a fathers pursuit of his daughter who has been abducted by sex traffickers while on a trip to parishowever although i enjoyed the movie especially its acting and its pace i didnt really see much that wasnt entirely new and inventive i was thinking about being more of a modern version of the 1979 movie hardcore being combined with the talents of liam neeson from nolans batman movie i didnt think this is a deep movie but another of luc bessons action films not unlike the fifth element leon and his scripted transporter movies the first of which was directed by morel sidenote i am a fan of besson hence the higher rating so i am slightly biased in my rating here many may find this movie just another runofthemill action movie but it showcases neeson well showing a rough poised individual and a sweet misunderstood fatherex husband a great companion piece to hardcore if you want to cross analyze 2 movies for a paper8 of 10  e,reality
first we can all identify a formula movie kids movies lifetime network movies man cave dvd shelf movies this is one of the latter its not long on intellect or plot development but what it does it does well one subtle difference beyond the bad guys not being able to shoot straight and the bad guys being just wasteem and dont worry about bullets bad is neesons character isnt necessarily good to a tee hes not horrible but there are times when he pushes into moral ambivalence territoryit had a nice pace and got to its points and got them out of the way without trying to stretch it into a movie trying to be more important than it is the acting is fair to good but it is so fast paced that there isnt a whole lot of time to care other than neeson no other character has more than twenty lines of dialogdont know if its a movie that needs to be on that man cave shelf but is worth more than one viewing im on the edge whether ill get a copy or not but i will watch it again ill have to wait and see if it is niggling me to watch again and again and deserves a spot next to die hardspoilers  there are a few groaners which is why im on the edge like neeson is a super bad ass for 34ths of the movie and somehow lets himself get conked on the head and himself also when he is at the baddies mercy a couple of loose bolts help out nicely  were a safety inspection away from having a short and unsatisfying conclusion but one certainly can nitpick die hard as well a decent way to spend an hour and a half,reality
when i completed the bourne series with its final venture the bourne ultimatum i felt it was one of the most riotous ride of my whole life and then there was pierre morels which just made me fly bryan mills made jason bourne look like a kid a profligate piece of movie with gruesome action sequences which is powerful enough to drive anybody right from the edge of his seat right into the screen bryan is an excia whose daughter gets kidnapped in paris he gets to know from his resources that he has only 96 hours before his daughter disappears completely the only thing he relies on are his extraordinary combating skills and his inner belief that he will see his daughter again soon after his arrival in paris he resorts to involution and implacability in the process of locating his daughter an iniquitous action flick with brilliant camerawork and superb fight choreography an actionthriller does not get better than this a must watch for every movie goer who loves action mechanism you will surely forget about bond after watching this,reality
you know it they kidnapped raped or killed sometimes the three together his daughter his wife his pet whatever what does matter though is that within a maximum of 20 or 25 minutes of the movies start all hell breaks loooooose the mix this time includes the thrilling search for the kidnapped girl by the vengeful father with the shoot um up solution if death wish remade the count of monte cristo as urban merciless father commando put the onemanarmy to it here he has a little of everything added to a touch of james bond an exsecret agent disguises europe streets some gadgets and the outcome of that is fine action thrillerthe best about it is surely the succession of the story the way that father gets back his daughter from scratch wins the whole movie the worst about it is the editing and the violencethe editing gives no chance for anything to get out the comics case i only hated it at the ends fight where it was like being in a fast train and nothing is clearly seen just noisiness all the way then a suddenly successful hero  the matter of the lead as a killing machine bothered me not because we have a wonderful actor this time since the movie is dead set on wonderful thrill and action scenes not drama but simply because 1 hes unbeatable which means boooring 2 he even cant be hurt as if hes wearing invisible bodys armor  3 he kills everybody in front of him being rambo in the city i feel happy for liam nieson in his late fifties and hes making hit action movies all in hollywood try to name 10 stars who still work in action movies nowadays while being above 55  what i dont feel so happy about it is being too fast and too furious however i always ask myself if the hero in any action killed numerous persons 35 as in here or 236 as in rambo 4 one year earlier then how many persons the audience wants to kill to make the producers of that do so  apparently the feel of relief lately has become something increasingly harsh and bloody so with grossing six times its budget you must comprehend its not the movie its the world which were living thats 2 fast 2 furious ,reality

the only reason i downgraded it two stars is that the director was too cute on many of his choices grainy footage or flashback scenes or quick cuts so from a merely technical viewpoint it was a headache for me but the story wonderful the actors i am a liam neeson fan even next of kin which is a sad sad movie so i was happy to see him in this movie the plot easy to follow and easy to be excited there are plenty of twists and turns and not as many red herrings as i thought there would be red herrings you know where the director throws in a possible good guy that becomes the bad guy or the bad guy that winds up being the good guy or some other silly plot device the director stayed away from these gave us the outline of the story and followed liam as he chases down the bad guys nice and simple the way an actionthriller should be,reality

okay1st of all this is an action movie no ifs ands or buts so given that you have to ask is the action awesome are the plot holes bearable are the bad guys bad enough and is the good guy kickass enough the answer to most of these questions is yes liam neeson plays an exciasuper spy whos sacrificed his family for his career after retiring all he wants to do is be with his daughter who has just turned 17 she however wants to travel europe coincidently of course his daughter gets kidnapped by human traffickers the first day which sets neeson on a gun busting daughter hunt all over paris some people might think this film is a bit too racist but i think it evens out the blame of human trafficking evenly among westerners and nonwesterners the soft side of the film is a bit cheesy but doesnt go to the point where it makes the film unbearable thankfully this film is badass if you dont like action films then dont watch it but as far as action films go this is definitely one of the best in awhile i think die hard 4 live free or die hard is very neck and neck with this film so if you liked that movie youll probably like this one except theres not really explosions in but theres definitely plenty of bullet holes side note i feel bad famke janssen has to do these roles where shes the brokencrankysnarky woman in a bad marriage seems like thats her niche referring to the wackness,reality
except for the paris scenes theres almost nothing new here liam neeson is an ideal choice for his role fortunately he doesnt overdo it i dont mind unoriginal movies as long as they entertain and unlike most hostage pictures we dont see the kidnapped person again until the very end another original aspect of the movie is when a couple of kidnapped victims including the one played by maggie grace are being sold i also didnt find the kidnappers to be especially evil but that doesnt detract from how good the movie is mostly the movie is just liam neeson beating the crap out of the bad guys and him and them shooting at one another out of ,reality
i wouldnt want to be an albanian in paris after this movie i found the failure of this films dialogue to distinguish between albanian and the rellepent sex traffickers who have the nessons exspecial ops characters daughter who looks nowhere near 17 irresponsible at best especially with its vigilante storyline imagine if there was a film where americans was constantly used to refer to pedophiles kazakhstan got off lightly with boratotherwise its a simple adrenaline fueleding throat punching bottle brandishing rampage neesons accent is pretty ropey but paradoxically he preforms well as the likable yet lethal dad lending weight and unexpected muscle to this dark revenge romp the two better films which kidnaps are the brooding eastern promises and the fantastic paris set tell no onefrom which s first half hour of paced drama is borrowed from before the real fun begins,reality
how far would you go to save someone you loved would you fly to another country would you risk starting international warfare in order to get answers would you search whorehouse after whorehouse would you single handedly take down at least eight armed men with no weapon of your own if you answered no to any of these questions then you are obviously not liam neeson but thats ok because in liam neeson borders on absolute sociopath he plays bryan mills an exspy and divorce with a seventeen year old daughter named kim when kim travels to france with a friend bryan takes every precaution to make sure her trip is safe but it isnt good enough because kim and her friend are kidnapped upon their arrival and subsequently sold to slavery in prostitution this sets off a chain of events fueled by bryans rage and his frightening bloodlust for revenge he utilizes all of his skills from his past profession to track down his daughters kidnappers and enact his violent revenge on all of them before he gets his daughter backthe highlight of this film is undoubtedly liam neeson he plays his role to perfection or at least as perfect as this character can get dont get me wrong hes a very fun character but not as human as you would think hes fueled by revenge and incessant determination to get his daughter back but he does it all with a cold and robotic tone i would much rather see this personality than one where he breaks down and cries every ten minutes though and it really is fun to watch him go through all the brutal steps to track down his daughter the man never misses a beat while on the hunt or in the heat of battle the action of the film is executed very well and it is downright awesome and neeson delivers all of his dialouge with a brilliant stone cold sincerityi say that the action is awesome and it is but it is pretty damn silly at times this is sort of what i expected from this film being that it is your typical fast paced action thriller to some extent but i will say that no matter how ridiculous the action gets it is all shot very well i always say that there is a lot to be said for a film with action sequences where you can tell what is going on is thankfully one of those films it is intense and in your face but not obnoxiously shaky thats not something that can be said about many films these daysthe storyline in doesnt have much to offer but you sort of have to let that go lets face it isnt trying to be a movie with a deep and intricate political noir thriller plot line it is the story of a man searching for his daughter doing whatever he has to do and going wherever he has to go to get the job done does just about as much as it can do with this simple storyline and the most i can really say is at least it never gets boring nothing about this movie ever gets boring in fact i have to commend it for being so consistently fun and action packed granted its only and hour and a half and had it been any longer i probably would have gotten tired of it and this review would have ended up being much more negativeis definitely a cool film theres not a whole lot to it but it is a really exciting film its got plenty of issues but you kind of just have to put all that behind yourself and take this simple brutal and intense action film for what it is this is a great film for an hour and a half of escapist entertainment plain and simple,reality
in this thriller liam neilson plays bryan mills a former cia agent who is not too pleased when his seventeenyearold daughter kim tells him she wishes to go to paris with a friend his ex wife believes he is just being paranoid and eventually he lets her go when his daughter and her friend get there a friendly local gives them a lift to where they are staying to save on the cab fare of course he isnt really friendly he is acting as a spotter for a group of albanians who are kidnapping young travellers to force them into prostitution while kim is on the phone to her father the kidnappers strike there is nothing he can do to stop her being but he isnt going to sit at home and do nothing he flies to paris and quickly starts tracking down the kidnappers working his way up the chain killing and torturing the various kidnappers as he goes the closer he gets to kim the more dangerous it gets and the more people get killedthis thriller had lots of exciting action and liam neilson put in a decent performance as mills the viewer does have to put their brain in neutral and suspend disbelief though as he quickly finds the trail of the kidnappers and works his way up the chain without getting badly hurt in the process or getting arrested for all the deaths he causes despite the authorities knowing what he is doing if you are looking for something deep and meaningful id give this a miss but you could do a lot worse if you are just seeking an hour and a half of mindless action,reality
what do you expect from a movie claiming they took his daughter hell take their livesnow weather you accept liam neeson as the harbinger of death is up to you for me he seems out of place but i also need to say that he gives a particular touch to the movie which probably isnt too badotherwise is an entertaining vengeance flick with a more realistic approach to martial arts krav maga as far as im concerned and some slightly unconventional features liam neeson shooting an innocent woman in the kneecap would be a profound example resulting a more original product then were used toa good subject for renting id say 510,reality
i generally like liam neesons movies very much and in he does not disappoint he plays bryan mills  a father and exsecurity agent of some kind  whose daughter is kidnapped by human traffickers while visiting paris and who is about to be sold into sexual slavery bryan finds out about it perhaps a bit too easily  he happens to be talking to his daughter on the phone from la when the kidnappers take her and immediately heads off to paris to find hertheres nothing confusing or complicated about the story its a straightforward account of bryans search for his daughter it has pretty much everything youd want in an action movie including hand to hand combat gunfights and car chases and once the kidnapping takes place it pretty much is nonstop action one of the problems i found with this was that  in spite of the action  it all did seem rather to easy bryan is told from the start that in dealing with this type of activity he has about 96 hours to find his daughter before she disappears forever to meet that deadline everything does fall into place rather too easily and theres the always present unbelievability of the fact that no matter how many bad guys bryan is up against he always comes out on top they can take many shots at him  even when he doesnt seem to be covered  and do no damage while one shot from bryan is all thats needed perhaps bryan comes across too much as a superhero sort that aspect of unbelievability aside and i concede that its necessary to make this kind of movie the story is plausible unfortunately young girls do get kidnapped and forced into prostitution or sex slavery of various kinds that aspect of the story especially as bryan comes across young girls drugged up and helpless  and who he cant take the time to rescue because he needs to find his own daughter is actually quite disturbing this is a good fastpaced movie that tends to get stronger as it moves along,reality
bryan mills liam neeson is a divorced former special ops with a beautiful young daughter kim maggie grace his career caused him to become detached from his family but now retired he seeks to at least reconcile himself with his next of kin this plan hits upon a snag when kim begs him to allow her to go to europe all by herself to rediscover the old continent bryan being an old paranoid secret service freak projects a bleak and dire vision of the dangers awaiting young pretty girls abroad unfortunately for common sense and realism bryan turns out to be right as kim gets kidnapped by the albanian female slave trade upon arrival bryan quickly decides to revert to what he does best killing and causing havocthe whole movie is spectacularly awesome but only if you do your best to ignore the lame and rather ridiculous intro and outro of the thrilling rollercoaster americans being kidnapped for slave trade with the knowledge and acceptance of french secret service of all the cinematography bull i have been ever sold but than again the plot always seemed just to serve as an excuse to the action and the intriguing character of bryan mills liam neeson is absolutely brilliant as a tough exsecret service plus he does the best acting job in actionmovie living memory with a face full of emotion and anger you never doubt in his unwaning bloody convictionan additional bonus was the idea behind the lead character himself  a ruthless coldblooded extremely goalorientated killingmachine unlike many other heroes portrayed in cinema this one has one sole goal  save his daughter everything else is either collateral damage or  in the best case scenario  an opportune bonus saving another girl killing bad guys and so on even when saving a drugged out girl forced into prostitution his ulterior motive was not being a good guy but extracting information from the victim that may aide his cause bryan mills is basically ruthless and essentially devoid of higher morality albeit with a code of honour that puts him head and heels above the perpetratorsnot to mention the absolutely scintillating adrenaline channelling chases fights and shootouts which have a brutal inyourface sense of realism to them the movie does wander into the unbelievable zone quite often but even then in manages to punch you in the gut unlike all the modern cgi fight sequencesall in all a welcome addition to the action genre and probably one of the most entertaining movies i have seen in a while i dare you to try and fall asleep to this one,reality
the admirable plot synopsis provided needs no further description of the plot and the action liam neeson surely must have been attracted by the very serious themes in the script primarily written by luc besson in the modern genre of very fast action rough tough and clinically effective a la besson the moral and political themes remind one however of the great era of hollywoods major films which contained under the surface of a passionate story very strong moral and political themes that influenced generations not only in the west but also in the middle and far east today some of these major themes in the film which concern us deeply but need more attention in seeing the film but need to be repeated in future films are   parentalguidance responsibility and protection of our children tv is full of failures of parents to accept fully what all this means  young peoples gullibility in search of exciting experiences which can have grave consequences for parents and friends  the growing threat of immigration with criminal intent as the film is made in europe it is the increasing influx of mafia like organisations from east europe  the ever prevailant corruption in political circles  the ever prevailant demand for vengeance preferred to due process of law despite the great increase in the proportion of the population with higher education the film is worth seeing several times to absorb all these issues liam neeson is to be honored for promoting them,reality
uses a a triedandtested formula of blending good action sequences with a good enough lead decent performances to back and good direction and cinematography this formula guarantees you a hit true its not going to win you any awards or critical acclaim but if you do those things well enough it cant wrong and was among the most downloaded movies of 2008 that was all down to liam nessonwho plays an excia agent whos daughter maggie grace has been kidnapped while in france liam nesson puts in a sterling performance brimming with intensity and a desperation to find his daughter the rest of the cast puts in an okay performance in truth they didnt really have much to do another thing that set this movie apart was its sheer pace the 93 minutes went in a whirlwind liam nesson did everything directly and quickly and it went perfectly with the short duration of the movie and the entire feel of it the action sequences were goodoverall it was solid entertainment an ideal movie for watching with your guy friends worth watching 710,reality
they are skopians they are albanians we will make new clothes out of their skins  greek soldiers chant 2010would make an excellent satire imagine it as a delirious right wing fantasy about the dangers of exiting the protective arm of american exceptionalism our hero an ex cia agent who will stop at nothing to rescue his 17 year old daughter who has recently been sold into white slaverydaddy must therefore go rogue slipping undercover one last time in order to save his little girl from the evils of both new europe and a muslimalbanian cartel as our film progresses our hero will dispatch with bad guys with ruthless efficiency using his billion dollar cia training to totally dominate all who stand in his way think of him as dick cheney with a black belt in karate daddy unconcerned about anything other than his own daughter other young women have been captured by the albanians let the foreign scum take care of their own but who will play our dick cheney character well why not liam neeson jedi knight and merciful saviour of the jews he can add gravity and sadness to this role a kinder gentler version of clint eastwood another actor who injected believability into reactionary and xenophobic pictureshow do we get audiences to take our film seriously simple flood all its trailers with statistics and facts about global immigration human trafficking and sex crimes make the film seem important topical and relevant then treat your suckered audience to good ole west vs the world paranoia super dad protecting his privilege from the barbarian horde whilst ignoring the very issues our marketing campaign feigned interest inbut why waste time and money making a satire of this film just pop a laugh track over and watch liam neeson do a bad charles bronson impersonation610  see a history of violence and eastern promsies for a dissection of this films very mentality,reality
okay the plot is unbelievable neesan is the absolute perfect former intelligence agentspywhatever his daughter is for purposes i wont go into in paris and he will go to any means to get her backthe bad guys are all caricatures  not fully developed  rich elites who can buy whatever they want and those will sell whatever because there is a market for it theres a lot of violence neesan is a perfect shot perfect at handtohand combat perfect car chase driver  you know from the start that he will get his daughter back still it is very satisfying when the good guy wins and the bad guys get what they deserve,reality
to be completely honest the only reason that i even considered watching this movie is liam neeson his incredible talent was woefully underused in american moviesbut then everybodys talent gets a short shrift when idiots run the industry even the plot of this flick is clich ridden heros family is in peril and he singlehandedly destroys all the evil enemies with little or no damage to himselfand then a surprise  is not going to win awards for originality its forte is unusually gritty and ruthless heroon avenge of a sociopath and the seedy sordid atmosphere that grabs the viewer by the throat and doesnt let go till the end entertaining but disturbing thriller its nice to be surprised,reality
i have seen lots of action movies yeah all of steven seagals too to this date i liked bourne trilogy die hard 1 transporter 1 as best action movies and also casino royal where daniel craig kicks ass as james bond this movie is amongst all those best ones i mentioned story is different than them and i think in action revenge and clarity of mind liam neeson kicks major ass non stop action with thriller mixed in i saw him in other movies but never got impressed he looks older but full of energy now he looks like an action star to me i am looking forward to 2 now,reality
this is one of the more enjoyable thrillers for quite some time there is a good human element and story there is a lot of action but because the way it is directed it never seems too violent you feel on leesons side for most of the killing and shooting pace and directing are excellentas usual they have to stereotype ethnic minorities and wealthy foreigners as villains but its a small flaw in the moviemaggie grace is a bit large and ungainly looking and acts a bit silly and gushy for a 17 year old but i guess she wouldnt be in that position if she had been more sensible its a bit hard to believe she would be worth so many euros to anyonea good warning for teens abroad too,reality
it is what it is a shootemup action thriller story what story more shootings please and throw in some big explosions too you know what youre getting into with a movie of this genre movies such as these are never destined to be remembered as as any kind of classic cinema but if done right they can be thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable and is done right helped immeasurably by the strong performance of liam neeson in the starring role the movie is able to deliver exactly what it promised it would clocking in at just over 90 minutes its a tight wellpaced thrill ride you get plenty of great action and really thats all youre looking for out of a movie such as thisneeson plays recently retired cia agent bryan mills who has settled in southern california to be close to his teenage daughter kim who is now living with her mother and wealthy stepfather after her parents divorce the movie starts a little slowly as we set up the family dynamics but things pick up in a hurry bryan reluctantly agrees to allow kim and a friend to go to paris upon arriving in france it takes the girls approximately fifteen minutes give or take to get themselves kidnapped destined to be sold into sex slavery luckily for kim her daddy dearest has a very particular set of skills those skills will be put to the test as the clock starts ticking and bryan faces a race against time to save his daughterand so bryan arrives in paris where he becomes a one man wrecking crew the dead bodies start piling up he really is making quite a mess but nothing will stand in his way as focused as a laser beam he will do whatever is necessary to bring his little girl home as in all movies of this sort our hero is helped by the fact the bad guys are really stupid and really really bad shots apparently these guys havent put in much time at the shooting range at times it all does get a bit silly as our lone ranger dispatches villain after villain extricating himself from any sticky situation with the greatest of ease but you really only notice that if you stop and think about it dont think just watch and enjoy take the movie for what it is its exciting its entertaining it is exactly what you would want a movie of this genre to be full credit to neeson upon whose shoulders the movie almost entirely rests his performance is superb hes a great hero who you identify with and root for all the way its a simple story one man determined to save one girl neeson carries that story so well if only all the other girls who were had a father like bryan mills,reality
i love this movie the concept the meaning sort of and the acting was amazing ive seen about half of all the james bond movies not one of them comes close to this when he said he was in the fbi ive never even heard of someone who was this good at kicking asses james bond is cool and all but when you take away his gun or his gadgets or car thats usually when he gets captured or one of his other agents rescued him bryan didnt even need a gun and he took out multiple people who had guns like when he was captured and was handcuffed to the pipe he took out five or six guys with guns while he used his hands and was handcuffed my favorite scene would probably be when he finally can get his daughter back and the fat guy is holding her with a knife to her throat and he knew exactly when to shoot him when he started to talk dont know what he was saying he was speaking in a different language and he shot him and he finally got his daughter back sure the movie does seem a little unrealistic because he took down like a hundred guys like they were air but its a movie and movies are supposed to be unrealistic what would have been cool is if the stepdad was the behind all of it and bryan had one final battle but it was still good bryan is like a ninth degree blackbelt in martial arts james bond and john rambo combined together,reality
this is based upon the extended harder cut so this is bourne with the whole its personal thing that we got enough of in the 90s does it sound like this did not need to be made to anyone else then theres how this is just yet another 24 type herowho completely lacks vulnerability eliminating any sense of danger who remains utterly invincible as he kills tortureswhich as not enough people realize can lead to the victim lying or agreeing to whatever allegations are made against them think about the witch trials and doesnt negotiate with bad guys the thing is entirely black and white simplistic with obvious plot holes that they expect us to ignore on account of this being supposed to move fast enough to prevent us from thinking about it if it wasnt this dumb or this relentlessly misogynistic maybe itd have worked i didnt care for the superficial offensive stereotypes either this is my first exposure to this director and i guess it wont necessarily be the last i do hope that he doesnt always go for flashy overstylizing granted theres not a ton of it still its quite gratuitous the action and chasing is intense and excitingwith wellchoreographed fights and shootings at its best and there is tension in this editing and cinematography arent badno greengrass shakycam i like that they have them speaking the correct nonenglish languages the acting is convincing bottom line will it keep your adrenaline pumping fiercely for 90 minutes well if you arent too bothered by the layer of stupid that permeates it pretty much yes you want something good to watch thats about the people trade go for the miniseries human trafficking it is infinitely more compelling and credible there is a lot of brutal violence and a little disturbing andor sexual content in this the dvdthat i got for a seventh of the price for a brandnew film on that format comes with an average 18 minute behindthescenes featurettepartly in french but subtitled a three minute storyboard comparison and a trailer for this as well as for a handful of other movies i recommend this to fans of this kind of thing 710,reality
overall an entertaining film and definitely worth watching liam neeson as always is excellent in the nature of the story the rest of the cast are somewhat incidental although all demonstrate passable performances the story is fundamentally good if largely predictable and holds the viewersattention however the plausibility in some of the details is questionable to say the least during the course of the film neesons character singlehandedly eliminates at least two dozen of the bad guys incurring barely a scratch in the process and all his shots apparently on target while hundreds of rounds are fired at him from the other side all of which are miraculously offtarget difficult to say more without giving it away  but enjoyable nonetheless,reality
is one of the more pleasurable films regarding the subject of abduction and revenge to come out in recent years and this may sound kind of morbid but its pleasurable in terms of the way that violence is projected the violence is stunning cruel hairraising and may turn knots in your stomach and the movie does not shy from showing fullblast views of it to the audience so why does this add up to a pleasurable film simply because these acts of violence and torture are conducted not on innocents often but upon some of the most sick twisted and morally reprehensible villains that weve seen in a motion picture in a long time we dont really come to know these villains very well and we really dont want to because of what we do see of them is truly horrible and its a pleasure to see vigilante justice being acted upon themthe vigilante is played by the great liam neeson one of the most underrated and talented actors of modern times neeson gives what may be his best performance since schindlers list as a former cia agent known as a preventer who reluctantly allows his estranged daughter maggie grace to travel to paris with a friend for vacation neeson being reasonably overprotective manages to make a phone call with his daughter while shes in france just at the moment when albanian terrorists kidnap her armed with nothing but his skills and a little insight as to the men hes dealing with neeson goes to paris and begins to track down everybody responsible for the kidnapping in a heartpounding race to save his daughter from being trafficked into prostitution and never foundthis is a very sensitive and relevant subject and the movie plays on it with sincerity and authenticity i mentioned earlier in my review that we dont really come to know these villains the albanian terrorists and yet thats a positive element the reason what we do see of them is enough to know that these are some of the most despicable villains of recent cinema years  obviously because theyre based on reallife scumbags from various parts of the world  and all we really want is to see them being killed off brutally and mercilessly in a lot of thrillers of the past i really didnt care what became of the villains whether they died or went to jail or even got off scot free but here i was rooting every second of the way for them to get what was coming to them and that is the core strength of the picture the plot of a man trying to rescue his estranged daughter is not really new but the fact that its built around such a solid foundation for a taut germane thriller makes it workis a very wellmade film beautifully shot with deliberately gray and grim cinematography that gives it a harrowing and troubled atmosphere acting is superb liam neeson shells out yet another terrific performance as the former preventer desperate to save his daughter from a fate worse than the brutal deaths hes about to deliver the other key performance is the film is by maggie grace grace at the time was i believe 25 when making the film and yet she plays the 17yearold with astonishing conviction these are two very good modern performers and partly because of the script but more because of their performances i bought them as human beings and related to them most other characters in the film come and go but thats alright the movie is about a father hoping to rekindle his relationship with his daughter and finding himself with the greatest challenge yet saving her lifeis a great film but it was treated with some disrespect before being released i had some quirks on my note list after seeing the movie for the first time mostly about the action scenes i found it a little tiresome how neeson could hit all of his enemies with the first shot and that sometimes hed shoot them once and when they hit the ground we could see 23 bullet holes in their chest other scenes seemed a little lacking as if there was more to them i tell you now thats because there was while the theatrical release of is strong the extended edition available on dvd is superior very little new footage but extended moments of violence that completes the picture adds competence to the action scenes and makes many gritty scenes even grittier bottom line both versions are quite good but the extended edition is the one to see,reality
the daughter on an excia agent is touring europe with u2 well that idea ends quickly when she is abducted in paris by the albanian mafia who want to get her hooked on drugs and sell her as a prostitute to the highest bidder but they picked the wrong daughter to mess with okay let me just say first of all that i do not know how this film got such high esteem from the voters yes its awesome but critically its pretty cheesy the acting is nothing special and the situations are impossible anyone who has any basic understanding of technology or intelligence gathering is going to slam their head into the wallbut if you ignore that and just sit back and let the film take you youre going to be amused liam neeson kicks butt and shoots his way through paris doing everything he can to rescue his daughter because for gosh sakes he loves the little spoiled brat and anyone who has ever loved will understand exactly how he feels even if they dont have the resources necessary to kick as much bootyim not one who watches a lot of bond or bourne or action flicks in general but i loved this one i hear rumor of a 2 and im pretty excited about that if it comes to a theater near me i may be there on opening night,reality
liam neeson takes up the role of action hero in a rollercoaster ride filled with rage revenge chases and fight scenes neesons character bryan mills has left the cia or some generic secret agent government type body in favour of less demanding security detail jobs you see he wants time to reestablish bonds with his estranged daughter while simultaneously trying to negotiate the minefield of exwives their new rich husbands and all the social foux pas that come with the territory but in normal family life bryan mills is an utter failure if only there was some way for him to prove his loveand thats about as far as the background plot goes because as soon as status and role is firmly establish then bam were into global conspiracy slave trade drugs and sex of course mills was worried about allowing his 17 year old daughter out into the big bad world especially when shes traveling to a land as nefarious as europe its a wonder that a man such as mills knowing what he does of the world would allow her to follow a band as iniquitous as u2 across several different countries but in an attempt to placate a nagging exwife and win favour with a wayward daughter he eases on his own rules against his better judgment just so long as she remembers to check in by phoning sure it is no wonder then that she only steps off the plane when already she is being eyed up and targeted by international kidnappers as everyone knows that an american girl would fetch top dollar on the slave market what they didnt count on though was daddyof course the scheming conniving slutty friend that arranged accommodation and even invited boys over to the apartment must die as a matter of moral imperative but not before a long procrastinated death oding from drugs forced upon her by her captives too harsh no not for the hollywood code sure the daughter still may be alive and mills dedicates thirty seconds of his movie to demonstrate how her harrowing death has effected him thats enough to keep us in hope for the daughter yet get our blood lust turned up to eleven daddys angryokay so im being a little sarcastic with the storyline but by building a plot which basically feeds upon a parents worst fears it defies certain plausibility for example the fact that the same gang would be audacious enough to return to the same airport 24 hours later which gives mills his first lead really does take the biscuit are we really to believe that the foreign police forces appetite towards chasing down international slavering gangs is so apathetic but then again if like me you have that magic switch in your brain that allows you to overlook the implausibility of plot elements and accept a world where a parents worst fears are bound to come true and mills uncompromising world view will always prove right then this movie can be a lot of fun once neeson has the rage turned on the rest of the movie is just one continuous highoctane release its unrelenting it really is it becomes a visual collage of bone braking crippling shooting jumping thumping bad guys indeed whether the bad guys are dirty stubbly and wearing a black leather jacket or clean shaven and looking sharp in a tux one thing is guaranteed they will always hold a sneer and look smarmy that we really dont mind how high the body count runs indeed these guys are so typically bad its a pleasure to watch the pile of bones rise i think neeson may have stolen the crown off mel gibson ransom braveheart madmax as being the angriestsullen tough guys on screen,reality
liam neeson plays a retired cia agent whose former career has made him all paranoid especially when it comes to worrying about his 17yearold daughters well being when daddys little girl asks him to sign a consent form so she may travel to paris with her scatterbrained girlfriend they actually are lying and want to follow a rock band all around the map its with grave reservations that he eventually complies once the girls arrive at their destination its only mere minutes before dads worst fears are confirmed and theyre by foreign bad guys to be drugged and sold as sex slaves its theorized that neeson has only 96 hours to find and rescue his daughter before she becomes completely untraceable as a fan of james bond i understand that many spy and action movies require accepting a lot of things that just arent realistic thats the fun of these types of films but the contrived ease and lightning speed with which neeson is able to arrive at the precise locations and track down and identify the specific criminals here just struck me as totally unbelievable and clich liams fun to watch and hes got some pretty cool lines ready for his daughters captors but in addition to the bythenumbers approach to the material theres a lot of handheld and shaky camera craziness to distract those viewers who dislike such an approach go watch hardcore 1979 with george c scott instead  out of ,reality
proves one thing beyond doubt that even the cheapest schlock can sparkle in the right hands sparkles about the word too because there is less to than a bonfire night sparkler fizz fizz fizz then thats it is nonsense but directed and acted at such a frenetic pace that you really dont have much time to reflect on anything except to wonder what might be coming next the plot  i use the word loosely  stinks dad out to rescue his daughter but as dad happens to be a former cia operative with an impressive array of technical and martial arts skills the film gets a certain dimension liam neeson is dad and does the action hero spiel rather well being rather the craggy sort lends him a credibility which is utterly spurious but which last as long as the film and that is all thats needed this is an action movie and nothing else and it does not pretend to be anything else it could have been atrociously bad but its not its very wellmade so the gaping plot holes  an example an american tho neeson is irish but lets let that pass pretends he is a corrupt french cop and when he confronts a gang of ruthless albanian thugs they all speak english  dont rankle in the slightest lots of car chases lots of gunplay lots of fighting lots of cleverness with all kinds of gadgets  what else good a boy want well quite a bit more actually but isnt that kind of film it is what it is and basta cosi so it deserves and extra mark for honesty dont look to closely just enjoy the chase,reality
liam neeson proves he can play the action hero as well s anyone in this action thrillerhe plays the father of a 17year old who has been kidnapped while in pariswith very little to go onhe races against time to find her kidnappers and save herohand he has a very particular set of skillsin shortthey messed with the wrong guywhat follows are some very intense fight sceneswhich are very well choreographedbut this is not just an action moviethere are certainly some dramatic moments and the movie is tinged with sadnessas some of the events in the movie mirror realityof course being a hollywood movieyou pretty much know how it will endalthough it didnt end completely the way i thought it wouldall in all a very entertaining moviethat also makes you thinkfor meis an 810,reality
going into this film i couldnt help but be a little pessimistic liam neeson didnt really seem like the good guy type and the plot seemed summed up in the trailer well it turns out i was right about one of those liam neeson actually did surprise me and many others im sure with his role in this movie and had all of us feeling what he feels and gave us the same motivation that you knew drove him maybe not with armbreaking fervor but we could feel it nonetheless and even though the plot is summed up in the trailer i found myself liking it it seemed refreshing to have such a simple plot bad guy takes good guys daughter good guy gets ticked and goes to take her back it seems like too many movies these days stretch its arms to grab viewers with a shock factor by throwing in irrelevant and often stupid twistscoughcough orphan you dont have to worry about any stupid or irrelevant surprises with this one you are watching the movie that you paid forthe only things i can say against it is that it was hard to make out how the daughter really felt about her father other than just loving him and it seemed to be wrapped up too quickly i would have preferred a less rushed ending but as far as the whole of the movie goes go watch it it is well worth it maybe not the best movie of the year but definitely one of the most well donei give it an 8,reality
is a trashy pulpy throwaway thriller in every sense of each of those words and terms it is a film that thrives on making the lead come across as down and as out as possible one that thrives on making the people around him both good and evil come across as instantly and intensely dislikable as possible and one that really thrives on rapid cause and effect action which desperately tries to stay as realistic as possible but very much has its mind on the notion of escapism as it panders to a crowd the film is a shameless action movie a revenge film a tale in which the women exist purely to be either rescued act like complete wenches towards their exhusbands or get all excited at the prospect of a ride on a cute four legged animal and yet there is a certain pleasure to be had out of it a certain dumb but familiar sense of siding with the one likable character the entire film possesses and just willing him on with a big smile on your facei have an odd relationship with luc besson anything hes written and made himself from what ive seen ive to as a writer with view to produce his works been ordinary to just plain stupid at best is a slight exception a piece that more resembles what 1985 action movie commando mightve looked like had someone like donald westlake written it it sees liam neeson play a divorced man from a marriage that saw him father a daughter but essential to the plot he is an excia operative now working relatively small time as a bodyguard with some buddies from the government years his name is bryan mills neeson although at one point during the opening in a jovial exchange with a past comrades he is referred to as rambo in what is another link to past reaganistic driven action filmmaking of the 1980s on top of the already mentioned commando the fact he is referred to rambo so early on produces slight smiles as you witness what transpiresthe inclusion of a friendly character very early on whom mentions rambo assures me that knows its place knows what it is and by the end is hoping were not taking it all so seriously as to despise the film as we watch on with our brows furrowed and our tongues entrenched within our cheeks bryans isolation from his daughter the antagonism he gets from his exwife and the fact she has a new partner anyway is enough to make you think he might just go nuts and wipe everyone out at a vomitinducing overly fluffy birthday party very early on what mills needs is his own noir fuelled franchise with shady and fleshed out gangsters a past tragedy driving the bitter cynical and somewhat ruthless lead antihero whom isnt afraid to shoot first ask questions later nor ask the questions first and then leave the poor guy to suffer whilst bound to a chairthen again we get some of that in a film that crosses its wires all too often but gives us an experience we enjoy without ever taking too seriously but are immersed enough to feel the threat helplessness and desperation most characters go through after going to paris with a friend kim mills grace is swiped from her apartment along with friend amanda in a ruthlessly efficient sequence that makes elite hunting and their eastern europe set upcomeoperation look amateur after no help from anyone bryan takes it on himself to go after her and recover her thus kickstarting a blooddrenched trip to europe where people will payinterestingly is listed on the imdb under its country subheading as a french film and its view of france is a lessthandesirable one i was reminded of the 2006 venezuealan film express kidnapping which looked at the frightening and harsh realities of what might happen if youre not careful on the streets of caracas in rather than integrate an individual city in this case paris into the story as it supports the basis of the study writer besson and director pierre morel cop out and somewhat disappointingly use albanians as a means of getting across the antagonism all this does is tell us that yes this may happen in a nation as developed as france but if it does itll be down to those immigrants whom have come over and set up their own operationsdoesnt hit particularly soar but what else can you say about a film that unashamedly i hope uses that laugh out loud instance in which the hero sits at a caf reads a newspaper and then reveals to us that he wasnt actually reading it as much as he was spying on a suspected enemy it recalls that glorious moment in one of nick parks early wallace and gromit shorts in which the everalert mutt of the title acts like he is reading a paper but is actually stalking a suspicious character all played out under a banner that blurs the lines between what we take seriously and what we find amusing by way of pastiche the film is a bizarre blend of often hard hitting material revolving around torture sexual slavery and shootings unfolded under an umbrella of the guilty pleasure and the idea were watching liam neeson in the lead role but dont let that sound like its a complete load of nonsense because it carries a certain watchability about it something that you dont often get the chance to say about action films these days,reality
lets seeits a big budget movie so it has to be based on a comic of some kind no well then a book maybe not that either sequel then perhaps a remake wow wrong again well then it has to repeatedly rip off something else wow am i dreaming is probably the first bigbudget action movie that is neither based on anything else or ripped off another movie or a tv show given how tired i am of comic books and other media being turned into movies i would have been more than willing to look the other way for having stolen bits from other movies but no pierre morels 2008 film is completely original i guess it helps that it was cowritten by luc besson an actionfilm director but never mind its a pity it wasnt betterokay fine is actually pretty good its unpredictable and it doesnt follow a strict formula more importantly it kept my attention but it didnt get my adrenaline pumping which is the main reason why a person would see a movie like thisbryan mills liam neeson is an excia guy who retired to spend more time with his daughter kim maggie grace unfortunately his wife lenore famke janssen divorced him soon after now retired bryan has nothing better to do than to protect pop superstars holly valance and drive his exwife and daughter nuts with his paranoid views on what the world is really like but kim and her friend are kidnapped while on a european vacation bryan sets out to find her and woe betide anyone who gets in his wayis a revenge thriller and a investigative thriller mixed into one no im not giving anything away by nature these movies are violent and brutal and this one is no different there are two words that explain why was given a pg13 rating instead of the rrating it deserves studio clout i guess the corruption of the mpaa helps but i think thats the same thingthat being said has some things going for it liam neeson is one of the better working actors out there today and although neeson is known for his protagonistic roles he has no problem tackling the role of a man who has no qualms about killing anyone who gets in his way unfortunately hes the lone good performance i think part of the problem is that we dont care about kims fate part of the reason why is that shes played by maggie grace whos pretty bad at 26 shes too old for the part although she tries to capture the same mannerisms and energy of the someone the same age unfortunately this makes her look ridiculous im wondering why famke janssen took her role shes a respected actress but she doesnt have anything to do the bad guys arent vicious enough either which is another knock downcinematographer turned director pierre morel has been given his first big chance at directing a major film his first credit district 13 was not widely seen in the united states and he doesnt screw it up he uses the shaky cam technique something that i generally hate but overall he does it well usually it works although there are times when it makes things confusingalthough lacks the visceral thrill that makes these kinds of movies work its still worth a viewing and you might like it a lot better than i did the person i watched it with loved it,reality
a former spy bryan mills liam neeson travels to paris where her daughter kim maggie grace has been kidnapped and forced into the slave trade using his set of spy skills he tears down the city to find her before its too late2008 is written by luc besson and robert mark kamen and directed by the formers protg pierre morel the film has the same kind of besson vibe in it that there is also in the other projects hes been involved with and the film in that sense feels very homey and safe to sit through the theme and plot of the movie on the other hand are far from homey or safe the plot though is very thin and clichd especially in the beginning and the characters are very narrow and one sided but the films not really about neither one of those aspects its all about the thrilling atmosphere and liam neeson kicking some serious buttliam neeson is great in the leading role and hes the best the film has to offer if it had been some one else than him in the role i probably wouldnt have been interested about the film hes convincing as an aged former spy beyond his best years but still more than capable in killing and torturing people hes not a good guy just a troubled father who goes as far as its required to find what hes looking for the supporting cast does a decent job but the film lives with neesons performancepierre morel does ok job directing the flick along with neesons great performance the film has a nice fast pacing and the action is well filmed and brutal enough to fit the bleak situation the characters have to facethis is liam neesons show whether you like it or not theres no question about that so it helps if you like the guy it may be tough if you dont because the films assets are very much limited and liam being the biggest one in that bunch 34,reality
i knew this would be good when i saw luc bessons name in the credits for those who dont know he wrote and directed la femme nikita one of the great violent entertainments of all time i enjoyed imagine the daughter of a 50yearold jason bourne being kidnapped and the pure shitstorm which would descend upon the perpetrators and youll have a pretty good handle on this story as others have mentioned the plot is simplicity itself liam neeson is going to get his daughter back and no thing or individual will prevent that there is of course the usual need for suspension of disbeliefin the first gunfight our hero has inconsistent marksmanship aboard the yacht at the end its one bullet one killbut hey thats film making viewers whose expectations are within the revenge mission scope of this film will enjoy it thoroughly anyone looking for social depth or complex character development will be disappointed,reality
we have seen nesson basically act very nice and soft in his other movies and i have no doubt that he can act well in that type however us viewers forgot that liam nesson is on the top 10 list in hollywood of actors that can act as characters who you do not want to mess around within this film nesson plays an exagent we do not get much detail of what he does for a living so exagent is as far as we know about him his daughter wants to go to paris with her friend and at first nessons character did not feel comfortable of letting her daughter go but after being guilted by his ungrateful and spoiled exwife he lets his daughter go the two girls go to paris develop the stupidity to tell a french man which hotel they are staying at and which floor they are on and well you know happens they are and thrown into the slave trade no big surprisebut what you got to realize about this movie is that it is very realistic in that regard there are many girls that have done this mistakes even boys have done this mistake and having a background like that in the movie makes it more believable and less like a steven segal actionflickand the great thing in this film is that nessons character is really cool about it throughout the whole film he is not stressing a bit because he has a lot of selfesteem and selfworth he knows that he is guy who can kick ass and beat the living daylight out of men he does not like the character does not have a single doubt in his mind that he will never see his daughter again in the film tells the enemy look give me my daughter and i will not have to mess you up if you do the opposite then i will kill you the action scenes are fantastic and awesome to watch and the thing is that all the action scenes are actually more realistic than your average action scene because it is not stylized at all nesson just kicks their ass kills them and leave them and he moves on to another criminal entourage to do the same thing that is real fighting because fights between people do not last long they pretty much end after ten seconds or soand you can not complain about liam nesson playing the main role because he acted well for this part at the same time of being calm and quiet he is also very relentless and coercible with his fighting i could not ask for any better of an actor to play this rolemy only problem with this movie is that it is too short but then again if it were longer i probably complain about it being too long but i have not seen the directors cut of so i want to be able to obtain that version and see some more action scenesif you really like action movies this is the movie for you even if it is not stylized like some james bond film you will definitely be entertained just do not watch it with your daughter i give this movie a low 8,reality
ive been relatively disappointed with the state of action movies for the past couple of years they seem to have been relying more and more heavily on perversely complex plots overdone cgi and contemporary gimmicks like shaky cam while missing the simple point of exciting the audience but not gets it just rightthose over 25 might recall that almost a quarter decade ago schwarzenegger still in his fun prime  not yet his shameful republican deficit years starred in commando as john matrix  an almost superhuman allout goodguy who must rescue his daughter from the forces of evil that have abducted her what follows is an unbelievable violent and fun guilty pleasure for the viewer it occurred to me while watching that this movie is really just an updated version of commando  a little more realistic in terms of plot perhaps but no less fun for itneeson is a superhero in this film untouchable and unbeatable its supremely satisfying to see the simplistic badguys get their violent comeuppance in various gruesome ways dare i say its truly refreshing to see a return to the good old action basics that have been so apparently absent in recent years,reality
wow if only i had a dad like thatthat was the words silently spoken out of the minds of thousands of moviegoers walking out of the viewing of an allout action film straight out of the minds of director peirre morelthe movie is a plotless killing machine and had never been anymore fun then this the movie starts off with divorced dad bryan mills living as an exagent and always keeping an eye on his daughter as she leaves for paris everything is fine until her abduction into the real world begins rushing to paris to save her from the sex predators who have her mills begins an extreme killingouting leaving a mess wherever he goes like a highway chase a constructionsite shootout and a bedroomfight sure the action is fake unrealistic and very dumb but it doesnt matter as long as the film stays true to its self which isnt hard to considering the only thing the movie relies on is some funny lines some good action and nothing more but if you look beyond this the film really does have a good sense to it almost like a mystery as bryan goes from a whorebidding to a cruise ship and all around paris looking for what he lost a good film by all means and even more then that a classic for mills personality ability to shoot a married woman without even flinching will strike the minds of viewers for ages and revealed the true fear of the outside world that had never been covered until now so now matter how you like youre action films bauer fan or bourne fan jones fan or john mclain fan is a great action thriller and a real surprise for anyone who wants to see an unrealistic version of a po father so forget yippie ki yay i will find you and i will kill you,reality
luc besson writes the kinds of movies i enjoy watching not all of his but movies like nikita messenger and leon are some of my favorites he cowrote this movie and it is a good one not surprisingly it goes back to a city he knows well parisliam neeson is a mostly retired bryan mills we dont exactly know what he did before retirement but in conversations with his 3 buddies and when we see him defend a young singer when he is hired for one gig as a bodyguard we know he has skills most 50ish men dont havewe also find out that he has been mostly absent in the growingup years of his 17yearold daughter but he has moved to southern california to be close enough to be in her lifefamke janssen is bryans exwife lenore she is now married to a wealthy man who has made life easy for her and the daughterwith that as background the story starts when the daughter requests to go to paris to stay with a friends relatives and spend a lot of time visiting paris museums and libraries but because she is a minor both parents have to approve of her traveling out of the country bryan is very reluctant he has seen enough to know it is dangerous for naive teen girls to be traveling alone add to that a deception  the girls really had a multicity european trip planned to follow around their favorite rock group in a musical tour lenore knew this but withheld that from bryanafter a scene bryan with grave reservations agreed to let his daughter go but only if she would call him as soon as she arrived and each day to assure him she was ok as soon as the two girls got to paris things started to go bad and bryan had to press himself into actioni like this movie because it is a classic matching of wits of a determined good guy bryan against the criminal element plus it is long enough at 90 minutes to tell the story but still short enough to never get boring i highly recommend itspoilers follow there is an albanian criminal element operating in paris to nab pretty young girls and sell them into sexual slavery they employ young men to attract the attention of targets by offering to share a cab ride from the airport this lets them know where the girls are staying so that a trained team can come in and kidnap the girls which is what happens here made easier by the adult relatives being in spain details they share with the young man but bryan is on the phone with his daughter when the kidnappers arrive and he is able via tape recording to get important clues plus a brief conversation where he tells the kidnapper that if he doesnt release the teens right away he would be tracked down and killed good luck says the crook and these two words enable bryan to know when he met him facetoface bryan is very good at what he does he finds the girls kills all the crooks eventually and even in the process exposes some police payola activity which ends up giving him his free pass to leave france,reality
fastpaced well shot suspenseful and action packed pierre morels shot mostly on the streets of paris is both refreshing and entertaining its been a while since i last saw such an exiting and energetic thriller morels direction is wonderful while there is something hollywoodish about it theres also a nonhollywood feel the chase scenes and action sequences are superbly executed the story may have its share of plot holes but there is plenty more to enjoy the chilling theme of trafficking women is well infused into the story even though its not fully developed but then again this is an action film liam neeson may seem like an unconventional choice but proves that he can singlehandedly carry an action film he does a good job in the action scenes and brings depth to bryan making him both relatable and likable maggie grace shows the potential of a great actress as she delivers a sincere performance famke janssen is good in her part overall is an energydriven thrill ride there is not one single boring moments even the quieter scenes in the beginning between bryan and his daughter and his friends is fun to watch highly recommended,reality
bryan mills is a retired cia operative whose seventeenyearold daughter is kidnapped by a bunch of albanian whiteslave traffickers the moment she arrives in paris instantly mills launches into secret agent mode utilizing all the tricksofthetrade he picked up during his years in the service to singlehandedly track down his daughter and bring her abductors to justice clearly james bond has nothing on this guyas action thrillers go is considerably less plausible than most which is saying a great deal filled as it is with preposterous coincidences and feats of superhuman dexterity but director pierre morel does know how to get the adrenaline pumping  which lets face it is all one really asks for from a highoctane popcorn movie such as this oneto make the movie more relatable for the audience screenwriters luc besson and robert mark kamen have concocted a rather dreadful scenario in which mills has quit his job and moved to california so he will be able to spend more time with his daughter only to find that he now has to compete with her gazillionaire step daddy for her attention and affection but all that malarkey is done away with in the early stages and  good news for action fans  once the movie hits the throttle it never lets upthe european tourism industry is bound to take something of a hit with this film  and seriously all of this just to get some rich guys laid dont they have just regular old callgirls in paris anymore  but the commercial success of the movie has been nothing less than a godsend for liam neesons career and pocketbookwith a new action hero is born,reality
i think myself very generous when rating movies not that this was a bad one in fact on the action level it was very entertaining and exciting even though anyone could have predicted the end the plot is very linear video gamelike meaning that the guy beat out a bunch of bad guys and gets to the final boss who evidently is of the almost same power the character development in itself is nearly absent the stunts and the overall superiority of the main character to his surrounding are pretty farfetched and unreal considering that there would be no way a guy of his age or shape adding to that that he has his retreat could do heck even arnold or bruce lee could not that  past that if you are looking for another james bond movie minus the stupid romance and long emotional scenes then this is a movie for you the acting is pretty actionlike good although the 17 year old daughter is clearly not seventeen i mean her friend looks younger than her at least its not worse than one tree hill which i totally despise also i do not like the fact that once again the american are portrayed as good while the other races are simply badanyhow the movie is fluid and very interesting to watch,reality
as the title of this movie suggests a mans daughter who is vacationing in paris gets kidnapped and kept in an undisclosed location the girls father an exspy knows the situation and he eventually decides to head out to paris and search for his daughter and it all gradually picks up from there until it leads you to the great climaxwhat makes this movie so good is because it is so believable you know that this could just as easily be a nonfiction documentary as it could be fiction these types of things happen all the time and this movie really digs into the detailsliam neeson does a superb job playing the toughasnails father who will stop at nothing to find his daughter the rest of the acting is okay but liam neeson is the only true standout of this movieby the time the father eventually finds his daughter you are truly tied into the story and you want him to free her the brutal things he does to the kidnapper really make you wonder if someone took your child wouldnt you do the same thing when you watch this you need to put yourself in the characters shoes because thats how you get the most out of this film,reality
the first half hour is not auspicious by the numbers dialog and easy cheese plot points leland orser as the oversympathetic friend again xander berkeley wasted in a nothing role again and why does that xman chick with the exotic name keep getting work not a very interesting performer except in made i feel for neeson losing his pretty talented wife and his viable career in the same decade but maybe this ones some solace for him pretty good box office doing good on video but he sucks in it again wooden and not credible ive never believed him except in that woody allen movie minute 30something and im about to turn it offthen he gets to paris suddenly this is a good movie good fights especially quigon getting pulled out of a cab by the heels and conking his head on the curb when he smacks his face on that sidewalk i sit up im interested not out of blood lust but because somethings happening the movie is moving for the first time the situations are now not quite as stock i decide to give it another five minuteswhich turns into the next hour nonstop violence in the bmovie mode exciting and cheap and nasty and occasionally surprising just in the depths its willing to go in investing its heros need yes its silly this guy is the terminator for no reason thats well enough explained in the story hes the guy the phrase one man army was invented for but this is a wishfulfillment fantasy and for a solid hour its a very persuasive one,reality
if you liked the bourne trilogy and the recent bond filmnot quantum of solace which sucks but casino royale which rocksthen you will dig this movie it promises thrills and chills and drive and action it deliversit contains one serious flaw however which will annoy some but considering that imdb users gave it an 810 rating it is clear that most wont care about the flaw wont notice it or will simply like the movie so much that they will rationalize the complications it creates away without acknowledging that no rationalization however imaginative can make them go away the remainder of the film and particularly the ending as they stand simply wont support such a huge suspension of beliefthe problem goes to plausibility logic and it really bugs me usually such a honker of a problem would spoil the whole film for me yet i still like it a lot i give it a 7 out of 10 with the flaw and an 8 out of 10 without it    that is to say removing it would subtract nothing from the story and thats whats really weird about it not being removed before the movie was releasedremoving the flaw and the sequences attached to it would have required shooting two or three other sequences in their place but this wouldnt have injured the rest of the film at all no other changes would have been required just a swap the rest is finehence the problem is just as glaringly obvious as its solution is simplehow the screen writer and the director could miss it and still be capable of producing an otherwise brilliant and riveting action flick is mysterious even assuming that the screen writer and director are idiot savants or brilliant drug addicts how did the film editor miss it oh well there it is a really good action movie just the samethe only thing that really makes any sense as the rest of the film cannot be a brilliant accident is that the filmmakers started out with one idea realized it didnt add up in the editing room after the last take and after the players were released that sometimes happens so you throw up a few sets recall the pertinent players and fix it budget other commitments who knowsfor those who havent seen it i wont divulge anymore about the film except to say that the problem involves the inclusion of a certain utterly unnecessary characterthe french internal security agent cut him out and all of the complications stuffed inside his baggage disappearbut check it out its well worth the aggravation its a great ride a thrilling popcorn flick with a vengeance,reality
adverts for this film had me looking forward to at the very least a formulaic that cannot fail bad guys get their due by the hand of a righteous good guy vengeance is served somehow and all that overall the film delivers on its promiseit is not exemplary in its genre however i wish i could cite a title that really gives that satisfaction that is set up by the words i will find you and i will kill you a film or tv show that does that is a rare findto get that vigilante righteousness where you can applaud the protagonist for banging heads and killing everyone that crosses hisher path is a key issue it most often requires that the antagonist be really really bad to the point that that their crimes are so disturbing as to be unimaginable this is perhaps why i cannot name a more satisfying film i may have blocked it outperhaps die hard could be called into play here because i recall it was eminently satisfying and not too disturbing but die hard does not exactly fit into this genre it should not be a spoiler to say that kidnapping is an element of both but that alone would hardly describe either filmdoes not spend enough time on the guy that offered good luck you barely know who it is before it is gone from the story once you see it you will agree that this is no spoiler the film and the adverts did that already action sequences are implemented with more cuts than bristles on your toothbrushit is more convenient to have a series of action sequences filmed and then piece them together in an ineffective effort rather than choreograph them before the start this shortcut has plagued many an otherwise good film and is no exception see i just did that you have no idea what i am sayingi will now make it clear this movie is not all that great it was not bad i enjoyed it i watched it alone and was expecting to rewatch it with someone else once i could recommend it but i cannot i will not invest another 14000 heartbeats that would be required for a 2nd viewing,reality

indeed this movie has its flaws particularly some of the scenes in the last twenty minutes people have complained that these scenes were too unrealistic and i recognize that criticism what those critics need to understand is simply that this movie is only an hour and a half and at least an hour of it was very realistic if this movie was two hours long then i could really identify with those criticsanyways the particularly objectionable scene in the movie is when he jumps onto the boat from a bridge and proceeds to disable twenty or so men with little resistance liam neilson didnt even get shot at once in that scene regardless it was over quicklymoving on to the things that are good about this movie i was really quite impressed by how liam neilson did that urban climbing to reach into the scene of the crime it really draws you into the movie into the movie in the beginning and then it is nonstop action and it is much more realistic then most action movies liam neilson is quite simply awesome and he really helped make this movie what it issome people say that this movie is propoganda for the new world order or something similar because liam neilson tortures people to find his daughter most people who watch this movie would eventually recognize that what liam neilson has done is not worth it and they wont come out thinking torture is a great idea i mean even the police were after him for how he destroyed countless pieces of property and he stole peoples carsif anything you realize that liam neilson in this movie really likes to torture and kill people after all they were suggesting that was what his profession was and that is what he was doing every single day because he liked it the only question is why the heck did he retire he seemed like he would still be good at his old jobif anything you will come out of this movie thinking that fathers should be more protective of their daughters until they get a husband and i can speak from experience in saying that that is a good idea,reality
former govt spy bryan neeson reluctantly lets his daughter kim grace go to paris only to find out she has been upon landing by a gang specializing in prostitution he flies to paris to find herthe pace of this movie and the caring win hands down it is fast but not so fast you dont know what is going on and we care as well we want bryan to find his daughter no matter what it takes and there is no political correctness in here as witnessed by the torture scene for a movie to get us to care so much in the beginning is unusual indeed and a compliment to neeson and grace as both exhibited exceptional chemistry this was perhaps the fastest hour and a half i have experienced in a long time he knows his window of getting her back is small as each obstacle rose up it was like i was pushing bryan to get it over with quickly and on the next path to finding his daughter it was almost interactive in that way cool and when he gets captured he what and about to be killed i really didnt see a way out but i really believe sitting on the edge of the chair looking for an edge helped somewhat hmmmmthere was one flaw i saw there you go ruining it now and that was when the french detective pulled a gun on bryan not knowing the bullets had been removed any pro can tell if the gun is loaded with a clip of live bullets and holding a gun with a clip with no bullets its not as heavy everyone knows that hmmm but hey this is the movies all in all an excellent thriller the entire cast performed well you know what is going to happen and you enjoy every fast ny minute of it violence yes sex no nudity no language no,reality
the movie is about a retired spy brian played by liam neeson the plot of the movie is pretty straightforward so if you are watching this movie to see something fresh i am afraid that the only thing fresh that you are going to see in this movie are the faces yes it is like an old story in perhaps a different location with a different cast and a slightly different way of looking at things brian is a retired spy who used to protect the country from international enemies by doing certain operations and so on the cost that he has had to pay in order to do this job is that he has not been able to spend time with his family and is estranged from his daughter he is now retired in hopes of making up for the lost time time and now of course he does security provision assignments for local concerts and showsone fine day the daughter chooses to go to paris and since she is a minor she needs her fathers permission having seen the world daddy is all too concerned but finally lets go and as any seasoned movie goer can guess even though he might know nothing about the plot of the movie he can guess that something is about to happen to the daughter and it does no points for guessing that she gets kidnapped conveniently letting her father listen to the voice of the kidnapper since the kidnapping happens while she talks to her father and in then we see nonrealism at its best he guesses the kidnapper his origin his possible hideouts and regions of operation he goes to paris he kicks ass and he tracks down the guys and gets back his daughter plenty of gun action and it is pretty straight the spies are suppose to be good with guns but how good are they with their hands my god they move so fast that the cameramen cannot capture a single punch on the screen for those who might have accidentally read my one or two other reviews i have always been someone who complained about the camera being moved too fast to capture a punch i hate such photography i want to see a punch delivered i want to feel for a moment the strength of the hero as he lands a punch on his opponent this movie denied me thatthe action flows smoothly in the movie the direction is about okay the movie is never realistic a major complaint i have about the movie is that i do not feel any love between the father and the daughter of course they are supposed to be estranged but still overall on the emotional front there is nothing much that the movie delivers it is a pure action movie and it portrays action at the cost of everything else  including realism and emotion the only emotion that finds strength is the brutal anger of the hero as he unleashes hell on the streets of parisoverall a mindless flick worth watching if an escape from reality is what you are looking for,reality
very entertaining action flick with liam in rambo mode as a divorced father who goes after his daughter who is kidnapped by human slave traders in paris supposedly liams character was some type of commando in his earlier days and has deadly skills hand to hand combat and espionage he uses his old commando buddies resources to help track down the kidnappers and boy does he leaving a trail of dead bodies he does eventually find her in an explosive climax if you dont think about certain plot holes you will really enjoy the movie the main plot holes i saw were  how does he know people in french security its never explained just implied they worked together before he also fakes a french director or securities id  how does he do that and how does he find out that someone on the inside of french security is involved in the selling of young girls including his old french security buddy these are a few as well as shooting the wife of the traitor security buddy and beating him up  never explains how he wraps that up or gets out of the country with his daughter and what happens to the others the daughters girlfriend he finds dead most likely of drug overdose yet he just leaves her there and no one asks about her anyway  i enjoyed it and usually you will find plot holes in any kind of spy thriller enjoy,reality
read others comments for plot details about the movie just a few observations here about the movie that are not quite as obvious but speak to the writers and directors attention to detail  or lack thereofwatch and rewatch very carefully the scene where bryan is wrapping kims birthday present his meticulousness bordering on compulsiveness gives insight into his careful measured character a nice bonus is a splitsecond where he flashes the trademarked goofy shouldershrugging facial expression of a young harrison ford from his star wars and raiders daysalthough others have remarked about how maggie grace is too old to be playing 17year old kim i thought she was spot on in her portrayal of the energetic giddiness and mercurial emotions and actions of a teenager watch her carefullythe writers used a nice tiein linking kims birthday presents from her 5th birthday party and her current 17th birthday partyliam neesons kind of bedraggled posture and slightly bewildered look early in the film were nice bodily character clues to the illatease he was feeling as an estranged father trying to make up for lost timeit was also a nice deliberate touch to give him an oldschool disposable thumbwind kodak film camera showing how he is a step behind in the real world now that he has retired from his cia operative dayssheerah also does nicely in her vulnerable downtoearth scene thanking bryan in the hotel roomi wondered if it was a deliberate cinematic flashback injoke when the sheik on the boat is first seen and he is reminiscent of jabba the hutt not only in reclining appearance but also in circumstanceinteresting to note that the major car chase scenes in paris were with audis and not french carsthere was a nicelydone shot of bryans reflection and kims face in her car window near the endi didnt even recognize xander berkeley until i saw his name in the credits its been a long time since season 2 of 24a few pet peeveswhy is it that the bad guys can shoot out the drivers window almost point blank and not inflict any damage on the good guy driverwhy do the prop guys never load suitcases with anything to make their weight and handling more believable ie when bryan drops kim at the airportwhy couldnt the end credits actually mention who played the main characters in the film like they did for all the secondary roles,reality
i use the phrase guilty as charged because this movie doesnt pretend to be something its not the trailers portrayed exactly what the movie became and didnt make the mistake of falsely hyping it up the entire movie is perfectly summed up in the trailers with leams characters cell phone call dont quote this by the way typing this by memory i dont know who you are and if youre looking for ransom i can tell you i dont have any money but what i do have is a very specific set of skills that i have acquired over a very long career a set of skills that make me a nightmare for people like you if you return my daughter now that will be the end of it i will not pursue you but if you dont i will hunt you i will find you and i will kill youand thats exactly what happensi was excited when i first saw these previews before most other people  in a theater watching another movie entirely i made it a mission to find this movie buy it and watch it and it was worth the new release priceits a basic premise a divorced retired man whos had a vague and somewhat unexplained past job a minor complaint right here he calls himself a preventer and judging from his first job in the movie ive come to assume he works as some type of security agent for the government they should have clarified this better anyway its an interesting premise and reveals that hes not a remarkable superhero hes a man with a broken family but has a happy daughter regardless that loves him anyway i liked thisit doesnt take terribly long to get through the introductions which is good because some of it seemed a bit forced for example when bryans leam warbuddies come for a barbecue and start spouting their past adventures now i dont know what government agents talk about casually but knowing how the job is i dont see it very realistic to talk about things like thatnow i love me some characterdevelopment but the first ten minutes or so fell pretty flat fortunately it gave you the barebones storyline and continues onward to the daughter being captured rather and bryan immediately gets to work with impressive and realistic to me anyway resourcefulness including speed as one of his friends inform him he has 92 hours before never seeing her again third complaint the time limit mentioning seemed very unnecessary and near the end it wasnt a fastpaced race against time it felt like he had plenty of iteverything else was great im a huge fan of the bourne movies and this felt like that to a lesser extent not a lot of evading was happening but bryan constantly blew a hole through this particular slavery organizationnot much else to say my first paragraph of this review really sums up all my thoughts,reality
go to the cinema or get the dvd and see the movie if you like action packed thrillers this movie is for you as another reviewer said it will be the fastest 93 minutes you have had in a long while i loved every minute of itlike most great movies the plot is clean and spare the bad guys have messed with the wrong girl daddy loves his little girl he is coming to get her and too bad for anybody including former friends who stand in the way that said i want to pick some nitsfirst so far as i know liam neeson is a nice guy who loves his family is kind to animals works hard and deserves whatever success he can get i am glad is a winner for him but the movie offers a couple of scenes where a really good actor could have delivered an oscarwinning performance and neeson does not measure upfor instance bryan mills neeson is a man who knows the world and the evils it contains when he hears on the phone his little girl screaming as she is being brutally kidnapped into sex slavery nb this is really not a spoiler since this scene is in all the trailers neeson could have shown us something more than a deadpan face that passes for steely resolve where was the horror the pain the anguish another scene is when mills discovers the brothel full of kidnapped girls they are innocent things just like his own daughter imprisoned by thugs and drugs and practically sold by the pound like so much meat yes mills is on a mission to rescue his own daughter but does he not have an ounce of sympathy for these forsaken girls who are the daughters of other fathers and mothers it is true that he kills a number of the albanian sex slavers but it is not at all clear that he is doing it out of sympathy for these other girls or only because they are slowing him down in his mission to rescue his own daughter as i said i think neeson could have done more and it would have been much the better for him and for the moviemy second nit is language one mark of a really great movie is when the english speak english the french speak french the germans speak german etc in a couple of scenes had neeson spoken in french i think the movie would have really sparkled too bad about thatfinally there is maggie grace who plays the daughter kim she is a beautiful woman and i wish her only success but not for a moment did i believe she was 17 yrs old which she is not from paris to hollywood pierre morel could not find an actress who looks 17 really to me this is an inexplicable casting error maybe morel used the same guy who cast viggo mortensen as aragorn so this is not the only such mistake but damn talk about unforced errorsbut for these unforced errors i think could have been oscar winning material we will just have to settle for a rollicking good movie,reality
this movie was a nonstop thrill ride the intensity was off the scaleim not a huge nitpicker when it comes to movies so keep that in mind but i really enjoyed other reviewers whined about liam neesons character bryan and how he didnt rescue the other kidnapped soon to be prostitute girls but that wasnt his goalhis single minded drive to rescue his daughter was exactly how a man trying to find his child should be we all know our children come first and any good parent would do all they could to get them backi know most of us dont have government training and elite martial art skills but these were second to his ruthless drive to complete his missioni give this movie 910 for extreme awesomeness it was everything id hoped it would be,reality
is an action movie that stands out not because of great writing or directing but because it is an enjoyable film that shows that pure entertainment still works today one doesnt need a best movie nomination hanging over a movie for it to be enjoyable or a budget of over one hundred million dollars reminds us that the basic plots and action scenes can still work to entertain and create a plot that can stand on its ownbryan mills liam neeson is a retired cia agent who finds that his most difficult mission is to stay a part of his distant daughters life kim maggie grace is a spoiled teenage girl whose mother lenore famke janssen does her best to not only shelter her but also keep bryan out of her life bryan himself knows this but patiently waits for the time when he can be there for kim in order to make up for the lost years he spent around the world her 17th birthday is a chance to do that but also reminds him that kim belongs to a world where he has no place despite his hopeskims trip to paris is a dream vacation that will let her see europe however when she is kidnapped by a gang of albanians bryan discovers that his old skills are needed once more as he hunts down those responsible for her daughters disappearance lenore herself pleads for bryan to bring their daughter back and that is he swears he will do it is then that he discovers a secret that is traced by to a friend and a corruption with the french governmentbryan spends most of the movie searching paris and destroying the albanians who kidnapped not only his daughter but other girls who are later sold into slavery one can argue that some of the skills used by bryan are not realistic and that the action scenes are clichd what stands out perhaps most of all is bryans use of voice technology to identify one specific albanian which forces us to ask if the cia is really that powerful to track and identify even a minor criminal however in comparison to bond or the bourne movies with their over the top technology is there really a difference liam neeson is a convincing agent and shows that he is still one of the top actors maggie grace was not as believable as a 17 year old but she played her small part of being a kidnapped daughter well for what its worth is a movie that remind us that good movies still exist aside from major releases and that one doesnt need an original concept to entertain810,reality

life can be mysterious as i left paris for a visit to my family i read during the trip the council of europe coe issue about the new convention against human trafficking greta in the evening i picked the sin city story called hell and back and i was surprised to see that it was about the same criminal activity today as i got up for breakfast i turn on the satellite mosaic and among all the screens i noticed someone looking like famke jansen i picked the channel and it was indeed her with liam neeson her exhusband they said farewell to their daughter leaving for  paris  as american movies about france are my weakness i just went on watching as the daughter was abducted i was indeed i couldnt switch it off until i know her final fate then a great thriller started with an excellent liam sure he can inspire some security and courage its funny to notice how his character and frank millers wallace are close the two are hardboiled terribly lethal and for achieving their rescue discover a modern criminality as coe states this activity is hard to notice makes a lot of money which explains it has become the great deal of criminals today it was a great eyesopener for me all the more than the action happens in my city for example the car chase in which he drives full speed against the traffic is the same place when i got stuck with my bike and unable to cross the road with too many cars so if the movie was a good moment the only problem was maybe his denial its great to have a superman as father but for all the people who havent one the story would be different for example liam is too focused about his daughter that it isnt clear if he took the opportunity to save the other girls by the way finally its a pity this movie is just action or adrenalin and forgets the real tragedy it would have been great in the closing credits to have lines about the number of cases of unresolved disappearances just to have a definitive picture about this terrible drama,reality
remember that arnold movie called commando when some bad guy took his daughter and then well died its just like that but with liam neeson and it is set in paristhe question i ask myself when i see movies like these is how real could that be and i am not talking about how likely it is to casually kill or otherwise incapacitate tens of people and getting away with it but how likely it is to gather data torture or threaten with death or torture to get more data and so on until you get to the top of the human trafficking system in a very short time i understand the need for due process and everything but hell liam neesons character took out a complete human flesh network from the bottom up in a few days and i liked that so how likely is itbottom line pure action flick with a expected good performance from mr neeson my only concern is how can the offspring of a cool liam neeson and sexy famke janssen result in the annoying maggie grace ,reality
liam neeson has certainly on his share of commanding  varied roles in filmsfrom supporting check out his work on the bountyto his lead work in michael collins a film with a script cowritten with luc besson is another shining example ironicallya frenchunited states coproductionis a film that fared far better in europe than it has done over here and also sadly neeson is a retired mercenarywho is taking some pretty crappy end of the stickunder the table jobs security work for a trendy pop starpatterned obviously after brittney spearsminus the attitudefor example his life is thrown into a quandary when his 17 year old daughter is kidnapped in paris by a crime syndicate from eastern europewho captures attractive young women touristsdrugged  forced into prostitution our hero takes the first flight to france  opens up a can of whup ass on the baddies does he find his darling daughter this is a high calibersuspenseful thriller that will have you glued to your seat there is talk that the european cut of this film is a bit longer than the one being distributed in the usperhaps when it finds release on dvdthe extra few minutes will be included despite the fact that this film carries a pg13 rating by the goons at the mpaait has some salty languagelurid sexual  drug referencesand a high body countydue to some fairly graphic violence that would have landed it an rsome years back perhaps the american distributors slipped a nicethick package of money under the door at the mpaa to buy themselves the pg13 rating,reality

is a great story about a man who will stop at nothing to get his kidnapped daughter back just rented this movie tonight and thought it was amazing the story line is great and liam neeson is amazing portraying his character as a desperate father searching for his daughter what intrigued me most about this movie is how welldeveloped the story line is and how after every scene it left me wanting more oh and of course hence the title liam neeson completely destroys anyone and everyone that comes his way i was not expecting this much action when i first rented this movie but man was i surprised this movie is actionpacked heartpounding emotional and all the aspects a good movie should have i strongly recommend this movie to anyone who just feels like watching a good movie this is a must see,reality
there was a solid enough suspense story to this film but it was the action that was unexpected and exciting there was very little or very unobtrusive digital special effects which is so rare nowadays there was plenty of quick fights with guns hands knives and other handy equipment a lot of macgyver moments some car chases and cool spy stuff i wouldnt say it always kept you guessing but there were plenty of gasps and more than enough interesting bits throughout i think what really impressed me is that there were real actorsstuntmen on film moving about no digital enhancement needed and it looked great i saw this at the drivein after wolverine and that was full of poorly finished computer effects and overdone fight scenes that ruined the movie this was a perfect contrast and a better film,reality
there is only one good reason to like this movie and that is the always watchable liam neeson like what he did with the abysmal phantom menace neeson makes this viewable i could easily see this with someone else jean claude van damme in the lead as a direct to tape feature when you look at in that way it deflates like a popped balloon it all feels like warmed up bourne leftovers the worst part may be the condescending human trafficking angle which reminds me of stuff like brokedown palace or fear this movie could find its way onto lifetime for a heavy rotation the best scene is in the trailer when his daughter is kidnapped and liams character throws down the gauntlet for that one moment the movie is alive and you are with it,reality
i would have never thought of liam neeson as an action movie hero but he really pulls it off in this one not only is there a lot of action but theres also a suspenseful plot that will keep you interested the story is of an excia agent brian mills neeson whose daughter travels to paris with her best friend who are both kidnapped mills uses all the skills he acquired in his job to travel to paris to rescue her and man does he tear it up if you dont like blood and violence this probably isnt the movie for you but i think any action movie fans will like this as much as any other while there is a lot of violence it doesnt seem like theres violence in this movie just for violences sake true mills does shoot and rough up people it seems he doesnt really need to but i think it is just part of his character 8 stars and id watch it again,reality
when i started watching this flick i didnt knew what was in store for me the initial 15 minutes of this movie deceived me into a family drama with the kid mad about going on a trip to france and her dad as usual reluctant about her lone travel with her friend but this dad aint a commoner nor is the dark secrets of the dangers lurking out there for the young women being alonebrian mills liam neeson is a former spy and knows the risk of sending her daughter to france he do let her go after giving her a detailed advice ie what to do and what not to do but as expected her daughter runs into trouble and is kidnapped by eastern european traffickers but these goons arent a part of a small module their circle is much bigger and much stronger and yes their activities are under guard of an secret services agent who happens to be brians former colleague brian mills just have 96 hours to protect her beloved before she is lost forever as a sex slave will he be able to find her what are the clues he have in store with himis packed to the core with mind blowing action sequences thoroughly mixed together with an equally gripping screenplay and storyline it has everything that a thriller movie requires car chases fistfights shootouts stabbing etc and these elements often reminded me of the bourne series while on play perhaps was the only movie that i have ever seen being the closest to the jason bourne series on its thrill meterthe 93 minutes of this movie were very absorbing perhaps they were the fastest of my life   is a total entertainer its very thrilling to watch but there was one niggling element in the movie that was the background score it was pretty bland and unimpressive perhaps it was the only flaw of the movieliam neeson is damn cool in his acting and dialogue delivery it was his first movie for me and i was totally surprised by his incredible performance hats off to liam overall it was a kickass stuff its a much watch for everybody i am awaiting its theater release in india and mind you i would be the first person to book my tickets at the movie hall mudit soodhttpmuditsoodinfoarticles,reality
the acting from everybody was great awesome actions sequences too a few were quick and hard to concentrate on but you got the general idea that liam neeson was kicking butt the entire movie the short scene with jon gries uncle riconapolean dynamite caught a lot of people in the theater of guard over all i would recommend this dynamic movie to most people however the scenes of how the girls were turned over to the sex slave trade were pretty hard to watch as they went into a lot of detail the idea of putting a price tag on a human being is a horrible thing and this movie did a great job of showing just how horrible it is great movie,reality
well this film provided good entertainment for about 90 minutes the story is well written and the acting is very good even the small roles the movie was not predictable as many others of its genre i must say that the filming and cinematic effects are also goodafter seeing the film i was left with a feeling of completion and not one of those annoying open endings the acting as i mentioned was very good the fact that the film has so many small roles the acting by these characters are quite decent truly one of the better action movies to be made by the hollywood modelborgeht,reality
there are many implausibilities in evidence here but in order to get an action pic to crank you have to throw reality out the window reality and long pieces of action just dont go together the average shootout lasts a couple of seconds the average car chase doesnt involve massive amounts of collateral damage pierre morels thriller traces the kidnapping of liam neesons daughter neeson who has a shady background in international espionage has a trick or two up his sleeve when it comes to dealing with bad guys naturally he uses all those tricks to maim chop break and burn the kidnappers thats the movie it works because morel shoots the action clearly there isnt much breathing room and the violence is lovingly staged some familysize contrivances ruin some of the enjoyment but the experience is relatively entertaining neeson has a great time killing and torturing those who done him wrong,reality
liam neeson one of the best talented veteran actors gives a surprisingly good performance in this film i never thought that neeson could be so impressive in an action movie up until now here he demonstrates a mastery of brutal action combat but also showing his softer side with one of the best line delivery in the entire film and with tight direction and class by the hands of luc besson its true that there are some clichs in the film but it never overshadows the overall product it also shows a brief glimpse of the human trafficking trade thats very seldom seem or even reported about in todays news and its that aspect that i applaud the filmmakers for i was a little letdown that the film doesnt dig too deeper into neesons character and the human trafficking trade so hopefully well see a directors cut in the future but for what its worth this film is a blast and overall its nice to see neeson in a role we havent seem him in before,reality
i saw last night and must admit it is highly entertaining and recommendable albeit one shouldnt expect much political correctness its interesting this movie came out post bush because it reminded me a lot about the glourious 80s where good was good and bad was bad in fact the film takes up so many dusty clichs from 80s action flicks that it seems highly inspired by movies like missing in action or any death wish  filmamerica is the save haven in this film where everything is alright but former cia man mills neeson gets alert when his young daughter wants to travel to europe the most dangerous place on earth if you think by comparing the us with the average mideuropean crime rate this must be a joke youre easily wronged by the fact that mills daughter is kidnapped quicker upon her paris arrival than the can say libert after that youre hardly surprised by a frenchman bringing home a baguette at night and unshaved albanians always having a beer can and a cigarette handy but if you can live with these black and white stereotypes you will see a highly entertaining movie and will also accept that even after all the debates about secret ciaprisons its ok if mills tortures a bad guy to deathbesides these reactionary spillovers is fun to watch with neeson who might seem miscast in a bmovie is once again proving that he is still at the height of his career delivering a solid steven seagal variation  including acting skillsthe fact that it was directed and written by french filmmakers with an irish lead makes this bearable otherwise the pro american message would be too offensive but so it seems like a solid homage to the action films of the reagan years with a wink if you just had a bad day this film is the right one to cheer you up,reality
this movie has pretty much caught everyone by surprise as it was released months later in north america in low key after being released in europe in 2008there are few things that made this movie really enjoyable and stand above the rest of hollywoods action flicks the lead actor liam neeson has such a overwhelming presence on screen he commands attention and respect with such authenticity contrast to other younger hollywood pretty boys hes what you would call a real man in this case he a father whos on a mission to bring back his daughter from the hands of smugglers hes confident extremely motivated skillful and brutally straight to the point the no nonsense take on screenplay directing and acting has really impacted me like a punch right on the nose theres no fancy bullet time tricks and high flying kicks every hit is simple effective and cut right to the bonebeing directed and written by europeans also gives us a different perspective in portraying the european underground crime world the underlying tone was pretty dark and desperate pit the lone liam neeson against the world of evil the grittiness of the reality helps intensify the emotion and make the bloody revenge more satisfying this is not guy ritchies british crime drama which was trifled with smart mouthing and comical coincidences this is life or death all or nothing bring back home my daughter or die without ever seeing her again on top of all these this movie also has a break neck pacing it draws you in right from the start and wont let go it could be one of those rare movies that can be just as entertaining watching it the second timego watch this movie and have a good time,reality
uses the fear every parent has when their child leaves the protection of home for most of us this fear is misplaced but occasionally it is justified this simple premise is used with effect in this entertaining film liam neeson is a convincing action hero even though he is middle aged the plot is complicated enough to ring true but not so complicated as to interfere with the pace of the story that said i think it could have been a better movie if there had been more of neesons character what does the character do when confronted with such lawlessness its got to be more complicated to deal with intransigent ill will than is depicted in this film i think this could have been mined for a more complex character study while maintaining the taught plot of the movie this is one of my pet peeves about film making its always plot v character why does it have to be eitheror,reality

i just saw this movie yesterday and i must say that i was not disappointed at all the acting was good the action sequences were just amazing it was short and i didnt really like the ending all that well but now i see they couldnt of done anything else after the end so i guess i got what i asked forliam nelson was tremendous in the movie i personally thought that the ex wife could of treated him a little better in the story but thats just me also the husband could of too they could of made a better use of kims friend amanda i would of liked to see them both get out alive but nope all in all i got my moneys worth i loved the movie it was defiantly worth 625,reality
bryan mills a retired cia operative needs to set about tracking down his teenage daughter kim after she and her friend are kidnapped by slave traders while traveling in parisi must say now this is an audience pleaser the chances an average movie goer like you is going to not like this movie is very slim with a mix of the jason bourne movies casino royale and live free or die hard i found it entertaining as hell and the first kinetic fantastic action movie this year who wouldve known liam neeson could play an action hero at this agethe movie starts off really well i almost teared up seeing the authentic fatherdaughter relationship im just a sucker for those things minutes later the action starts and the action in here is a little above par but not as good as you would think the car chases arent that great but overall theyre mindless enough for you not to care some scenes are just brutal though and one might think how this movie got away with a pg13 ratingliam neeson as said earlier does a great job as the next jason bourne looking for revenge the directing job is pretty good too along with the editing overall theres nothing else to say will it entertain you hell yes is this an amazing film no but it shouldnt matter,reality
my husband and i saw this movie tonight  very enjoyable fastpaced actionpacked somewhat violent but you cheer liam neeson on as he takes on all the bad guysliam neeson is perfect in his role the daughter is also great the exwife very unlovablethis movie takes you into the seedy side of an international problem that is unspeakably sad like the bourne movies neeson dodges every bullet but its an exciting movie and 90 minutes goes by unbelievably fastwe really liked this movie and were glad we saw it,reality
liam neeson is not the first actor who springs to mind when you think of movie action heroes for a start hes 56 years old but why should that get in the way  look at harrison ford  the difference is bryan mills is no indiana jones hes one guy you dont ps off and for very good reason is 24 meets the bourne identity it stars liam neeson as bryan mills a retired american spy whose daughter kim maggie grace from lost is kidnapped in paris while hes on the phone to her from los angeles the kidnappers come on the line and mills tries to warn them what theyre letting themselves in fori dont know who you are if youre looking for ransom i dont have money but what i do have are a very particular set of skills acquired over a very long career in the shadows skills that make me a nightmare for people like you if you let my daughter go now that will be the end of it but if you dont i will look for you i will find you and i will kill you but do they listen do they merdenow   really is a film that you have to turn of the logic side of your brain before you go into the cinema if you do that then your in for one hell of ride  its action all the way and quite brutal action at times too neeson manages to kicks the butts of men half his age but somehow it works he comes away from situations without a scratch while his enemies suffer thanks to his us military training if i had to criticise this film for anything its not for the fact that its ridiculously far fetched or the script is a little stiff its because of the way neesons character reacts when his daughter say shes going on holiday to europe to watch u2  you would think that she just told her dad she was of to beirut to join hezbollah your much more likely to get into trouble in the big cities of the us than in places like paris or london personally i would have been more concerned that my daughter was listening to crap like u2but who am i to criticise as predictably daddy is proved right when she is whisked off by some nasty dark skinned europeans before shes even unpacked how have i survived all this time living and working in londonthat criticism aside i really enjoyed its pure adrenaline packed entertainment and maybe we do have a new competitor to rival the three bs  bond  bourne  bauer i wouldnt say no to another portion of bryan mills and his no nonsense approach to lifegood funis released in the us on january 30th 20098 out of 10,reality

went to the movie theater to see a nice action and suspense movie even i fulfilled my expectations i can say that this bessons movie has an interesting content of real matters themes such as prostitution slavery and drugs are seen with a sharp and accurate eye by the french movie maker entertaining and well narrated fine but not spectacular actings by neeson grace and kansan this film leads us to one of my favorites leon or the professional interpreted by amazing actors such as the frenchman jean reno and a little but gorgeous girl called natalie portman however i found that an ungodly character was missing such us stansfield amazingly interpreted by gary oldman in that excellent movie also i like the music i would like to know about the music producer,reality
first off a word of warning for the moviesnobs who like inflating their egos by sneering at action films suspension of disbelief is a prerequisite herethat out of the way and assuming the viewer possesses enough intelligence to judge a film for what it is will thrill shock and most probably disturb the hell out of you with its roller coaster ride of emotional appeals and horrific situations of which we can all empathize withthat being said the one thing you are most likely to experience with this movie is satisfaction neesons character does a fine job of being the rambo youd imagine yourself to be if anything gruesome happened to one of your loved ones,reality
theres nothing much to say about this film that i can think of but i thought was great it had that kind of same look to the bourne films but this film was probably way better than the first two bourne films dont know about ultimanium cause i havent seen it yetso overall is a really good action thriller flick if you havent seen it yet then what the hell are you waiting for score 810 455 a 72,reality

this is one of the leave your brain at home movies stupid american hero all world is bad except americansnothing new in this movie no logic in the movie very bad acting and not good fabricationas bad as 10000bc storynot advised to waste 130 on such movie does not worth the money i spent forthe story here is duplicated in many other movies nothing new many things that do not make sense in this movie bad acting and the actors are not fit for their roles,reality
liam neeson stars as a former spy who relies on his old skills to save his estranged daughter who has been forced into the slave tradeyawn there have been better films made which deal with a similar theme on the sordid human trafficking or missing persons theme for instance the george c scott 1979 film hardcore the michael caine 1979 film ashanti which similarly dealt with modern day slavery and roman polanskis 1988 frantic sadly is not one of the better films it is in fact awful liam neesonwho despite his excellent acting abilities cannot make a good film let alone an original film its all been there and been done beforefor instance it seems that this film shamefully rips off the famous chase scene from french connection ii and even the aforementioned boat climax from ashanti the usual frenetic bourne identity style of moviemaking is ever present in this film one unfortunately with the horrible trend to please the censors also has alternate versions which no doubt are bloodier seedier whatever but the editors scissors cant save this disaster of a film,reality
sunny deol i owe you an apologywhen i saw you in gadar single handedly fighting the entire pakistani army i thought gadar did not deserve that much praise and money as it earned until i saw spoilers  is a hollywoods reply to bollywood the basic premise is same  get a loved one of weaker sex captured by bad guys then have our hero go overseas fight the enemies and bring back the girl add to it some mushy crap like a divorced father a daughter who dumps a cheap gift by biological father over an expensive gift given by step dad a teenager who has the latest phone but still is old fashioned enough to have a map in her bag with the journey route clearly marked on the map carelessly stashed in the bag so that dad can find itthe entire movie is just an exercise to show the superhero antics of a middle aged liam neeson who is intelligent than the entire paris police crew the enemies are stupid enough to trust a french police officer who speaks impeccable english with an american accent if it is not the russians these time it is the albanians and arabs who are the bad guy the hero breaks all the traffic rules to reach the target and yet not one police officer is able to catch himso if can earn 8 stars on imdb and generate millions of dollars in box office revenue why not gadar if liam neeson can why cant sunny deolsorry again sunny,reality
a complete xenophobic clown boat i was prepared to see something actiony and fairly ok but this went off the cliff from the start to begin with have no preconceptions of any kind of good cinematography soundtrack acting script character preparation plot changes or anything that will stir the pot in this one no imagination seems to have gone into this film and thats another huge blow against luc besson who actually cowrote this mess where liam neeson goes on and on to kill murder and maim people just to get hold of his daughter there are a few other aspects here foreigners are bad kidnapping is bad killing anybody to get hold of your kidnapped child is ok this film has just interrupted the thinking process completely ive got no qualms of watching braindead films but when it comes to the point where you question the ethics that the film itself brings to life as theres just too much hypocrisy its just zany fawk this go watch some other action crap its most likely a lot better than this,reality
i was very glad to see a large number of well written negative reviews about this really bad movieafter watching this movie and seeing a very good actor play a scene where the hero tortures someone to death leaves the room after turning the electricity on and watching scene after scene of gratuitous violence played out in segal or stallonelike comic book style i had to visit imdb to see what the reviews werei like good action movies bourne series for example those good movies have nothing to do with this movielesson when evaluating imdb movie reviews start with the i hated it reviews and see if they make sense in this case they mostly did so i have nothing to add other than to emphasize how having the good guy torture someone to death just strikes me as bizarre shoot the bastard ok i almost turned off the movie i had rented after that scene but decided to continue watching perhaps as a lesson to self to ask myself what is it about comicbook like violence that draws me draws all of us to some movie plotsyes the age old good defeats evil theme can work it did not in this case at all,reality
how bad holey moley where does one start well how about the apparent message dont let you kids go to europe its full of sleazy furrner flesh traffickers and corrupt cops lets then go on to the characterisation including the bitchy exwife and the stupid and gormless daughter and her even more gormless best friend not to mention liam neesons uptight obsessive onenote performance which as you are aware of his characters background and skills from the start offers nothing in the way of growth or surprises just added violence and for the violence ive no problem with violence i like a bit of action but the fight scenes reminded me of latter day steve siegal with two protagonists happyslapping each other and a car chase in a quarry a neat idea which is basically almost identical white cars driving at speed and neeson inexplicably coming out on top oh and throw in those sleazy and totally inept furrners who fire multiple shots at neeson completely missing only for him to step out from behind a door frame and take them down with one or two wellplaced shots  i mean police squad took the micky out of that one thirty years ago and the less said about the escape from peril scenario which adds up to a and with one bound he was free trick that died out in the republic cliffhanging serials of the 40s the better best of all though has to be the scene in which liam neeson penetrates the enemy lair in paris by pretending to be a french detective and manages to fool them by not speaking any french at all or knowing anything about their setup good points to be fair a surprisingly nonclichd turn by xander berkeley as a notatall smug and slimy stepfather and a really refreshing one from gerard watkins as one of the many mr bigs neesom meets after so many swarthy and unshaven villains the light and civillised touch he brought to his role was a revelation and to him went the best line of the film kill him quietly ive got guestsbut otherwise lord almighty what a clichd bunch of pants up next kenneth branagh remakes death wish,reality
i have just spent 93 minutes watching the most one dimensional film i have seen for many years thank god i didnt actually pay to see it it is so full of clich as to make me wonder whether or not it had been written by a computer program i can only imagine that liam neeson needed the moneypolanskis frantic has a similar plot and location and is a far superior product whatever you think of the mans moralsnoble estranged father rich stepfather spoiled daughter corrupt french policeman albanian gangsters saudi mr big car chases gun battles  they are all in there together with the revelation that charles de gaulle airport is the world centre for white slavinghaving said that with its cardboard characters and puerile plot this subbond action fest reminded me of the saturday morning serials when i was a child every episode ended with a certain death cliffhanger always resolved in about 30 seconds with an action sequence from which the hero emerged without a hair out of place,reality
sometimes you see a movie which is so bad that the only thing left to do is to laugh at the ridiculous scenes youre confronted withunfortunately was bad i mean really bad but i just could not see the fun in it maybe it was the script which had no sense of direction or pace maybe it was the fact that albanians were building their headquarters in paris i just could not stop thinking about all these people that gave this movie an 8 or higherprobably is the worst movie i have seen this year i am going to watch walle tomorrow thats why i am not going to spend anymore more words on this pathetic excuse for a movie,reality
overall i walked away from with a feeling of satisfaction the action was pleasing it had its thrilling moments and i always seem to be a sucker for watching really bad people get whats coming to them from someone operating outside societys rules it turns out more clever than i thought it would be if you like these things in a movie check it outbut beware the road leading to this acceptable action romp paradise is one paved with terrible writing campy dialog and onedimensional character developmentthe first 45 minutes of this film are really hard to sit through the film is called just get to the takin already the setup is completely unnecessary and poorly poorly executed as an audience we can just assume that a father would want his daughter back we dont need the background drama that he never gets to spend time with her and has revolved every ounce of his life to being in hers the way this came across by the way left me feeling unclean and disturbed the point being there is no reason for a movie called to be unbalanced like this everyone who bought a ticket knows exactly whats in store for them and the fun is not going to begin until we see some kidnappin happen they could have just as easily started the movie off with the abduction scene from the trailer and given everyone some more thrills we know that a father is going to do what he can to get his daughter backalso this movie participated in a strange phenomenon ive been realizing recently film with a videocassette look scenes of the movie particularly action scenes have a grainy distortion all over looking a lot like it would if i was watching it off of a vcr cassette that had already faithfully served me at repeatedly recording the simpsons a few dozen times very distracting and really why mess with the beautiful high definition picture of film,reality
liam neeson stars as a retired cia agent whose daughter gets kidnapped by some bad guys in paris and he has 96 hours to save her first good news liam neeson is a very good actor now the bad news 1 recently action films have terrible editing why do filmmakers think action sequences are more exciting with choppy editing see quantum of solace and the second bourne film this film follows in that lousy tradition the editing served to confuse rather than enlighten 2 some serious lapses in logic in the film reminded me of 1970s action tv shows a la starsky and hutch some examples when neeson chases the bad guy up the ramp at the airport and causes a traffic jam no drivers leave their car to see whats happening when neeson brings a girl back to his hotel room he somehow acquired medicine plastic tubing an iv a syringe to help her get better did he have these medical supplies stuffed down his pants did he stop and buy them when neeson confronts the bad guys he gives one of them a card that says good luck in albanian and asks the guy to translate it howd neeson know that that was the guy he spoke to on the phone i dont know how some folks thought this was a good film but it wasnt except for the acting not really worth seeing,reality
cut away the first 15 minutes or so that establish why the main protagonist is getting involved in the first place and you have a nice sequence of violent scenes involving one for the sick people that dig the saw series that do entertain alrightproblem is that these first 15 or 20 minutes are so blatantly duck and cover cheapass american propagandasucking up to the culture of fear without any tongue in cheek whatsoever that you feel so bloody insulted that it totally ruins the bangboombang of the rest of the moviehavent been so annoyed by a movie for quite some time and that comes from a guy who sat through the whole of indepence day in a theater,reality
what a kick ass movie this was liam neeson by rights is an excellent hero in my book from various movies in the past including rob roy this was his best by far and quite a martial artist too in fact this was exhilarating to watch beginning to end to have a father who goes to his daughters rescue in such a way that no one stands in his path not even so called friends from his life who would not help him a ex secret preventer who uses methods to stop evil he gets the results he needs with no mercy shown to him his daughter means everything and if scummy vile no good human traders get their just desserts then so be it though in short comings it was sad to see his little girl see the world for what it really is at seventeen it can obviously be a nightmare but to have a father rescue his girl and to see her staring back into his eyes was all worth it in the end because not only was he a preventer he will always be a super hero to his little girl bravo luc besson and robert kamen and hats off to pierre morel,reality
wow this movie completely blew me out of the water liam neeson decides to take the reigns of a action movie at his age and delivers nothing but gold me and my friends went to go watch this movie and we thought it would be a half decent action flick we were shocked to discover how good this movie really is if your looking for a great film to see during the next couple weeks give this movie a shot it isnt a deep thought provoking film its big its loud and its awesome you can quote about half of this movie back and forth with friends for days afterwords because the scenes are so bad also for lost fans out there who miss shannon maggie grace makes a nice supporting character that you do end up caring for in the film which helps you root for liam neeson even more is the new bourne movie check it out,reality
i just got back from seeing this movie and all i can say is wow what an adventure this movie provided the suspense and action was nonstop and perfectly executed liam neeson whom im not used to seeing in a full on action movie was perfect in this role you could see the hurt on his face in certain scenes as well as the importance of a situation and the love for his daughter ive always liked him and felt he was a great actor but he was off the hook in this movie i dont want to give away any of the plot so all i will say is this is one of the best movies i have ever seen and if you havent seen it yet get out there and see it because it packs a wallop and is a very fun and satisfying movie to see,reality
one of the best thrillers that came out in the last yearsliam neeson is very good in his role as a loving father and merciless killer at the same time he wasnt playing an ice cold killer but rather an professional agent who is also emotional and stumbles sometimes but wont fall like james bond recently does in his movieshe plays an agent whos daughter got kidnapped by the albanian sextraffickers mafia to rescue her he gets trough to the inner circles of the organization and kills each and every one getting in his way good cam and sound and unexpected moments make this one a sure shot youll be at the edge of your seat  must see ,reality
i love this movie i cant even begin to say how much i love this movie first of all the actors they picked are phenomenal liam neeson maggie grace femke janssenthe movie is about a young girl kim maggie grace who just had her 17th birthday her friend amanda katie cassidy invites her to spend the week in paris at her cousins apartmenther dad bryan liam neeson who previous worked for the government as what he states was a protector is skeptical about her going to paris alone with her friendeventually her father says yes and allows her to go with the exception that she must call him when she lands and every night before bedonce she arrives in paris while waiting in line for a taxi kim  amanda are greeted by a young man named peter nicolas giraud who asks them where theyre from he eventually asks them to share a taxi as the taxis in paris are so expensive amanda takes leadership and says yesthey arrive at her cousins apartment and peter invites the two to a party which amanda says yes to also revealing to peter and the unaware kim that her cousins are actually in spain and theyre home aloneonce they get settled in the apartment kim confronts her friend about her cousins not being home but doesnt seem to make that big a deal out of the situationlater her father calls her and while on the phone with him in the washroom she witnesses her friend amanda being abducted by 3 or 4 meneventually kim gets abducted too and the film follows her father who travels to paris doing everything necessary to get his daughter backlike my other reviews i wont go into great detail about how the movie plays out or ends as its up for you to watch but its defiantly worth going to see or buying,reality
the plot is one that has not to my knowledge been explored before it highlights one of the most poignantly exquisite pains possible from a mans perspective and a resolution which would be life satisfying the performance by neeson was keenly done and brought me into the story it was realistic enough in terms of physics and violence trivia that satisfied me the only potential need for imagination comes from the existence of the types of crime portrayed and the almost unassailable fighting prowess by neeson i have to leave this with the comment that neeson has been changed in my views to an equal of any action star and from a childhood in the late 80s through mid nighties i idolized the genre and have been shaped by it,reality
finally an american film that tell the truth about the albanian crimes even though there is no serbian victims shown here this movie demonstrates the crimes albanians committed to people much of this resembles of what is going on on kosovo to the serbian minority that used to be a majority but due to these and worse crimes committed by the albanian terrorists serbs have left everything they had and then you wonder why this movie came out when bush has a few left in the office kosovos road to independence was through terrorizing nonalbanians kosovo is serbian always was and always will be,reality
this movie never stops it is a relentless film about a father determined not to loose his daughter in the opening this is in the form of quitting his job and life to be closed to her and her new family however it is when she becomes the victim of some very bad guys overseas that his determination becomes raw for all to see definitely a violent movie along the lines of a history of violence and charles bronsons death wish series liam neeson kicks butt and takes numbers through the entire movie and riding on audience empathy for his situation spares no one unlike many kidnap movies where the fatherturnedrescuer is usually a regular man driven to extraordinary circumstances here is an extraordinary man driven to an ordinary life that gets pulled back into what he does best killing bad guys in this sense the movie really rides the same wave as a history of violence and if you like either one of them you are likely to like the other unlike a history however this film feels faster and reaches deeper into your guts like some other person said the fastest 93 minutes youll spend,reality
ive just finished watching what i consider the most unpretentious action film ive seen this decade the plot was tremendously well written no glitches at all it grabs the viewer from start to finish in an amazing web of events at the same time feeling so natural youre introduced to a lot of violent scenes but theres a sense of beauty to every one of them like a skull crushing dance sometimes theres problem when youre dealing with some socially saddening subjects but in this case the whole human trafficking subject is treated in a very realistic way no overdramatisation i was shocked in an extremely good way to find a liam neeson so powerful yet so humble i know its kind of impossible but i would seriously rather see an oscar going to him than a lot of so called actors that have received the honor all n all a great experience,reality
when you watch a relatively unknown movie which suddenly gets you off guard is considered in my books as the best movies i have ever seen and is one of its kind this movie focus on a retired spy who chose his job before his life comes home to get closure with his daughter and when his estranged daughter gets kidnapped and forced into slave trade his old skills kicks in and there begins the story and the rest of the movie becomes a tribute to its genre the key element of the movie is its lead liam nessonbryan mills who established his credential as a serious actor from movies like schindlers list batman begins and gangs of new york dawns a role thats tailormade for action stars like jason statham and just kills it his character is so well structured thanks to the brilliant mind of writer luc besson who gave such classics as leon taxi and transporter series his screenplay moves at a pace where you cant turn back and ask yourself whether the events taking place are possible that is the strength on which this movie rides its further polished when its given in the hands of a director made a cult action classic district b13 who just nails it shot after shot if your ever wanted an action film that would blow your mind off this is it and i guarantee you its worth your time,reality
no spoiler could ever spoil the suspense in this movie i was blown away by this movie this movie is a mix of james bond and jason bourne with more drama and thrill liam neeson plays a classic retired cia agent whos been around the block and around the world while becoming more and more distant from his daughter who he now tries to devote as much time to as possiblethe story is that his daughter gos to paris with her friend and they get kidnapped by albanian human traffickers who plan to use and sell them to their unique clientle its up to neeson to pull out his bag of spy skills and open up his can of whoopass to get his daughter back and punish the thugs responsible which he does with the utmost frightening and merciless panacheliam neesons performance is expected a great actor always delivers and neeson topped my expectations hell look sad and weak in one scene then look bloodthirsty and yearning for vengeance in the nextonly thing about the moviewhich in one way is good and another way bad is that its very short i wanted more but regardless it kept me on the edge of my seat till the last minute sort of like phonebooth 2002 lots of suspense and terrifyingly cold dialogue in a little more than 80 minutesbottom line great movie worth more than one watch and super entertaining1010,reality
i was surprised at how good this movie isthe action is fine the plot is a bit simplistic as action movie plots tend to be but very suspenseful and satisfyingthere isnt an inch of fat anywhere on this story after a short moderatelypaced setup this movie accelerates until it goes at one million miles an hour and it never lets up until the very endthe action is jasonbourne style but so well done that its almost better than in the bourne movies the bad guys are so bad you want them decimated electrocuted blown away and punched into submission so bad  and you wont be disappointedand yet somehow the story never loses its emotional impact it never veers into the ridiculous the boring or the overly dramatic the dialogue is awesome in its simplicity and effectivenessliam neeson is very impressive  who knew he was an action hero steven segal can only dream of a performance like thisluc besson wrote this story and  miraculously  it seems there were no studio executives to mess with ittotally awesome,reality
where do i start short version quantum of solace aint got s on real talkthe extended summary ive never felt compelled to rate a movie let alone write a review but this movie is first class entertainment i almost didnt watch the movie because liam neeson doing an action pic  i couldnt even think of it but i gave him the benefit of doubt and he literally kept me on the edge of my seat the whole timein retrospective  liam neeson was the perfect choice to play bryan the no nonsense overprotective controlfreak excia preventer but given what bryan mustve seen and preveted it makes perfect sensethe movie introduces bryan as a retired cia agent who wants to reconcile with his daughter after divorcing her mother having seen arguably the scum of the earth he becomes overprotective of his only daughter who lives with her mom and her new rich stepdad so when his daughter wants to take off for vacation in paris her father is reluctant to sign the permission it doesnt take long for her and her best friend to get into trouble in paris  theyll get kidnapped the very first day in france as fate wants it daddy is on the phone when the 2 girls get by the albanian mob bryan having not lost his instincts keeps it composed and tells the kidnapper via phone  to either let his girl go or be killed when he finds him the mobster  not knowing what kinda trouble he will be in  tells him good luck using his old contacts bryan is informed that he only has a 96hr window to find his daughter or never see her again so he takes off to paris  and to make a long story short releases havoc in paris and a huge body count while uncovering a human trafficking organisationconclusion  could be jason bournes father,reality
now dont get me wrong nothing awful in the titlethe main character in this film is what every father and by somewhat logical deduction every man would like to see himself as it is a bit like steven segal but without the pointless violence and the beer bellythe violence has a point heresuperbly directed action flick it dispensed with characters and story very fast and got on with what every testosteronefilled male was waiting for lots of great action the action is much better portrayed than in the bourne films its a sort of a crossover between them and the segalbruce lee films with a dash on ronin on topmust see for any manboy more then 12 years oldif only they had cast a real actor instead of the muppet that liam is this might have had a 10,reality
neeson is awesome in this movie famke janssen provides the eyecandy hot great plot keeps you interested all the way through the movie a must in a movie of this nature is a believable storyline and in my opinion this is perfect a father loses his daughter to the bad guys kicks ass and takes names gets his daughter back but doesnt get back with the estranged wife which would have been predictable at the end each character is supplied with sufficient background information so that it doesnt seem as though john doe from lanew yorklondon has just on and defeated the entire world neeson convinces the audience that he can and will do whatever it takes to rescue his daughter brilliance although i in my opinion doubt it will get an oscar because the movie is not about world peace or some other random political rambling great work by liam neeson and fairly new director pierre morel great casting great direction in all a great movie miss it at your peril,reality
first of all let me start by saying that those of you who thought the dark knight was a great action flick then you obviously do not know much of what a real action flick means and those of you do not think that was an entertaining film well you do not know the meaning of entertainment you would probably end up giving a boring depressing film like bridge to terabithia or the thin red line which both had no base no path and no justified ending a 10 star rating on the grounds of being depressingly entertaining but would probably give terminator 2 judgment day a one star based on an unrealistic plot excessive violence and entertainingis a brilliant movie from the start the movie character development was well crafted as it gives you an insight of what the characters nature are like this was typified with liam neesons character bryan who killed people as a profession prior to retirement but deep down inside there was humanity inside of him he loved his daughter greatly and regrets of not spending much time with her while she was growing up but furthermore it depicted the length a parent will go in order to ensure the safety of their child regardless of whether the child is an adult or notthe action side of was of high class the fight scenes were well choreographed and it gave a sense of bourne identity type of edge to it luc besson and robert mark kamen who are the writers for did a great job with the script it was a fast paced film with suspense action thrills touch of humour but most important of all a realistic plot sure some areas within the film seemed far fetched like shooting the police chiefs wife in the shoulder and not being caught but within the film it contains a very important message that is sex slave trading does existlets face it slave trading or sex trading of people do exist in this world unfortunately our governments are more concerned with blowing up countries where the leaders do not have any weapons of mass destruction rather than worry about the illegal sex trade that go on within their own backyard for those people who are involved in those type of illegal work deserve to be shot dead in cold blood with no question asked they are a disgrace to society and humanityoverall would have to be the action film of the year so far way better than the dark knight and indiana jones  the kingdom of the crystal skull others like me have felt a feel good feeling inside after watching the film the money spent on ticket not going to wastea must see film,reality
first of all this is my first review on imdb but there will be more so thank you for readingif your a fan of fast paced action thrillers with sentiment thrown in for good measurethen my friends you have arrived neeson delivers in a well written high octane thriller that will leave any red blooded male with a tingle surging through his body the acting and delivery is brilliant which is a credit to the casting directors and producers we get enough content and character background to have sympathy for our hero and find ourselves throwing imaginary punches with every brutal stroke the fight scenes are well choreographed and action is fast paced at no point did i ever feel the film had hit that wall that so many other titles in this genre hit we are allowed to enjoy a solid story a believable premise and some very enjoyable acting from all concerned the story without giving it away is about a former us government spy that must come out of retirement to save save his daughter i left the plot brief and wrote the above comments first because most people including myself switch off after hearing this type of plot so what makes this film different the acting and dialog for a start they go hand in hand no line or action in this film is thrown away the direction and story are very compelling but i have to admit without liam neeson i may have well overlooked this little gem i gave this a 10 not because it was the best film i had ever seen but because i know that at the box office it will be overlooked it will in my opinion become a dvd seller and get many of its fans from this basei give this film a 10 in the hopes it not be overlooked however i am one man with one vote i hope my hollowed cries do not fall on deaf ears this film deserves a loyal and steady fan base real mark 710,reality
an excellent edge of your seat heart pounding ride leading you from teenage deception to the undeniable love of a parent this action packed thrill a minute movie will move you challenge you and entertain youfirst i was told it was just another action movie with liam neeson well when you say liam neeson its not just another action movie it will have substance intrigue and be well worth your timethere is very little you can say about this movie without touching on spoilers so i will just sayjust breathtaking  a must see,reality
while the action and the actors are good this movie lacks everything else that makes a good movie for me if you dont care about a good story and like expensive action i am sure youll be happy with this movieas mentioned i am not happy with the story the story is as simple as you can imagine not only is it simple it has zero depth and yet it is still full of goofs pretty much all that happens in this movie is that neesen is running through paris slaughtering one evil gangster after another on that way simply everyone even innocent people are shot hit or kicked the movie barely cares about morals even less than rambo and i am no fan of rambo the moral of the story probably comes down to this you may kill everyone for the american dream especially nonamericans because only foreigners have been killed in this moviei am no moralist and i totally dont want to be one when it comes to art maybe i would have liked this movie if neesen would have been drawn a bit more evil most of the time he is looking like some shiny hero especailly in the pathetic 0815 hollywoodending and for me that is simply totally absurd psychological there is no realism in this movie  and isnt the psychological aspect in stories the most interesting everything in this movie feels as if you have seen it before visually its boring the conversations and characters are stereotypical there are no new ideas totally nothing interesting there isnt one moment in this movie that will force you to think there is no uh what did just happen now not even an oh i am so interested in what will happen next objective i should rate this movie higher maybe with a 2 or 3 subjective i have no other choice but to give this movie 1 point i cant remember any movie that angered me in a similar way,reality
being a white anglo saxon australian even i feel the racism and stereotyping dripping this movie and clearly the other reviews agreei found it hard to enjoy when so much ignorance was displayed and frankly left perceptions about travelling overseas is really likethe story is in fact very predictable but fun to watch if you can get over the clich riddled lines and while the action was imo brilliant it is very violent and should never have been pg13however this could have been a good movie if care had of been in thinking outside of americans sure they tried to make the french arabs and albanians all evil but if they stopped the foreigners is evil and just had baddies and more common sense this movie might have done betternot for kids,reality
in a nutshell stars liam neeson on a mission to find his daughter and punish those responsible for starters the plot is completely generic and never rises above mediocrity so since the plot is nothing special then maybe the journey along the way will be inspiring and originalwell neesons character does have a lot of experience and various skills that he has acquired during his life so thats the back story on how he is able to pull off the task of tracking down his daughter but that explanation seems to work too well for neeson as he effortlessly gets through anything along the way it gets old surprisingly fast as he uses a very small array of tactics to take down bad guy after bad guy without giving anything away there is very little suspense when it comes to wondering how he will get past someone in his paththe big problem i have with neesons character is that he comes off as a master of every situation that instantly knows the appropriate move to make in order to get what he wants that alone is too unrealistic but theres more there is one scene that doesnt ruin the plot where he rather carelessly gets caught hes so skilled yet in 2 seconds he is subdued without any great counter skill and then without building any real suspense 2 minutes later he is already back on the case ready to beat up more peoplethere are other less major problems with this movie such as the dime a dozen bad buys but the last one i will go into is there were some underdeveloped elements with this script the history of the neeson character would have been an interesting route to explore also a little more depth on the relationship with him and his wife or daughter would add to complete the experiencewhile the movie is never boring it is however repetitive standard forgettable and rather unemotional considering the subject matter liam neeson is a fine actor but this role could have been done by anyone less repetition some script additions and direction improvements are what is needed to get this film out of the gutter this will probably be another case of everyone thinking that the movie was entertaining which equals good it definitely does not although it is one of the least boring bad movies i have seen so in conclusion does very little to inspire when you compare it to similar movies and it is certainly filled with almost no originality along the way avoid this progressively bad film 310,reality
this movie was perhaps the worst movie to be released in the past five or ten years its director and producer should be executed by hanging for crimes against humanity this movie has no pracital entertainment uses but only for a torture implement for prisoners in third world countries even if this was the only form of digital media i had i would never watch it again poking a can with a stick down a dirt road for 13 days with no water seems more fun than sitting through this crap chute of a movie if anyone is considering watching this movie dont do it you will regret spending money for such filth and remember no matter how hard you try it is impossible to unsee this film if someone close to you is about to watch it i suggest you destroy the disc before too much damage is done,reality
has some welldone action scenes which might look excitingly new to younger viewers besides that its a storytelling nightmare and a slap in the face of anyone who appreciates brains in an action movie  even when their not all over the screenmost notably the movie fails miserably at creating any kind of credibility  not to mention empathy  for the main character desperately trying to portray him as the rejected father who gave up the job that he loved so he can be close to his spoiled daughter the film makes liam neesons character mills look like nothing but a gigantic loser he gets pushed around by his horrible daughter and his even worse exwife why would he ever try to help either of them and why should i care if he succeeds or not after 15 minutes i have absolutely no idea but somehow i am still willing to see where this goesto make a long storytelling nightmare short it all goes terribly wrong for example we are forced to witness mills as some sort of jack bauers clumsy brotherinlaw who thinks hes tough because its said to run in the gene pool did the creators really believe that 24 is suspenseful because bauer has a gun and uses a lot of highend spy technology why else would they show mills aging excolleague at his home computer telling him the name and birthplace of his daughters highjacker based on some sort of pathetic voice analysis no offense but this scene is just pitiful at another point mills finds out that his daughter lied to him to get permission to go to paris he just waves her goodbye and doesnt do anything about it once more i am left to wonder why should i care for this person when his problem is not losing his daughter but  excuse my french  having already lost his balls and brains at this point all i can think of is the 8 euros that i paid to watch thiswe then more or less follow mills on his point and brainless killingspree through paris encountering extremely flat and moronic enemies yes including the stereotypical evil bureaucrat in the end he finds his daughter being sold to the son of a sheik i mean really how bad is this how can you so openly exploit the most simpleminded resentments and enemy concepts for your dramatic purposes  and think you get away with it especially after these concepts have so eagerly been used in real life and politics over the last years sorry im not against shooting people in movies but based on this it just makes me sickin the end mills gets his daughter back and takes her to singing lessons while i struggle to find out what this movie is trying to tell me the world is a bad place so dont travel dont go to paris become the generic version of britney spears instead dont stand up for yourself but save your daughters bottom however stupid she acts or was intended to be some sort of parody on american paranoia i honestly dont know if so it failed if not its just pathetic,reality
i stopped watching it when the good guy started torturing the bad guy really torture tricks filthy morals the acting is  until this point the worst i have ever seen and the characters my god the 17 years old girl is portrait as a brain damaged little kid also the message of travelling to europe is filled with danger wow really all the messages on this film are for idiots i am still thinking if i will watch it until the end the prejudices and stupidity that are portrait on the movie are also too obvious maybe i will watch just to see what kind of prejudices are embedded on the film besides the american love for military war and the american idea that all the other countries are corrupt and bad,reality
this movie is about a father who used to be some kind of agent for the us government hes retired and settled down somewhere near where his daughter is so that he can make up for the lost time with his daughter while he was still working for the government almost immediately through the film his daughter got kidnapped now this is were the movie captured the audiences with emotions causing massive over rating of this movie father and daughter relationship then daughter got kidnapped that is the only emotional hook this movie can offer another strength of this movie is the action although theres too many clich moves around it reminds me of steven seagal compare this movie to bourne this movie is like a rat and bourne is a horseapart from all those strengths the movie has some major weaknesses maggie grace cant act the script was badly written the character building was too brief if it wasnt for the fact that kim is the daughter of bryan mills i wouldnt care if she got kidnapped like how i didnt care that amanda got kidnapped or raped too because who the is she she just appeared for a few minutes and got kidnapped that is why character building is important which this movie is lacking,reality
this is quite difficult to express all emotions after seeing this movie but i think its main feature is that all characters are so alive and true including negative ones that you start to believe and feel every emotion they express maybe just mother and daughter look sometimes a bit unnatural but this does not spoils anythingthere is some similarity with some stiven segal movies but i have to say that segal movies and his character are just too dumb and cruel comparing with this movie so there should be even no comparisoni watched last 60 minutes of this film many times though i know what gonna happened this is still so exiting and emotional every time,reality
if you fancy some deep thought provoking drama then this one isnt for you what we have here is a veg out and enjoy fast paced action thriller in the mode of the jason bourne trilogyliam neeson gives us a rollicking good ride as the ex spy preventor and father of a 17 year old daughter kidnapped along with her friend in paris by albanian mobsters abducting girls alone for the sex slave industrywarned that he only has 96 hours before his daughter is lost forever neeson takes off to find her with the few facts he haswhat follows is an hour and a half of furious good fun as the body count rises through the roof and the baddies get theirsif youre in the mood then this is definitely one to see,reality
wow this movie was truly outstanding in every sense the action was breath taking the message was deep and the emotivity was powerful thats why it worked on so many levels at the same time the action was so intense but there was still an undercurrent of love and passion making it so absorbing i forgot i was watching a movie and was just drawn in by the action and storyline this is why it was so tense i was literally on the edge of my seat which rarely happens it even gave the bourne movies a run for their money neeson offered a powerhouse performance in both a sense of great action sequences and stunts and a sense of passion for his daughter drawing the audeince in so they were really on his side i dont know what else to say other than this film was highly underrated and is probably the greatest spectacle ive ever seen watch it damn you,reality
so the title speaks for itself the movie is excellent well directed and very entertaining however its not that tense but the pace goes so fast that wants u to get moreyou see liam in this movie his character is complicated and his character needs a movie by itself hes like man on fire combined with bourne moves but here hes more cruel the plot is very simple not complicated and no shakespeare words involved however it makes you wonder is there really people like liams character in this world in the end watch this movie asap as it is very entertaining and fun to watch i dunno would you rather to watch dukes of hazards piiifff can believe people these days,reality
this action movie is so real that attract people from the start to the end it is definitely an excellent movie you must see it this action movie is so real that attract people from the start to the end it is definitely an excellent movie you must see it this action movie is so real that attract people from the start to the end it is definitely an excellent movie you must see it this action movie is so real that attract people from the start to the end it is definitely an excellent movie you must see it this action movie is so real that attract people from the start to the end it is definitely an excellent movie you must see it,reality
the film started out good i knew the plot and was really getting into it then it started getting way over the topsex slaves that apparently everyone knows about yet does nothing a shoot out with machine guns yet liam neeson doesnt get a scratch hes like a one man army,reality
i cant believe this thing gets such good reviews its a b movie with money and good fight scenes thats it the filming is appalling camera shaking everywhere a copycat from the bourne trilogy the action scenes are so clich  a car chase some guys jumping from bridges the hero getting tied up and escaping at the last minute some corrupt law enforcers and a pathetic final boss with his special weaponnothing new but it gets well reviewed because of some gross and dramatic background with the alabanian mafia and human trafficking it also plunges into the dexter syndrome meaning as long as its bad guys its ok to torture them yeah i can understand that it can be a pop corn movie some might enjoy but thats it theres no script dialogs are terrible poor famke jansen the subject of human trafficking which is very much real is pathetically used as justification and the real bad guys are mostly eastern european and arabs while the bad french are just doing business and providing for their familiesbesson just had a little fantasy about a vengeful cia agent killing everyone and thats it hard to believe he did lon when you see this thing he wrote,reality
an american girl 17 years old goes on a trip to paris her father exagent does not want her to go as it is so dangerous she ought to call him as soon as she arrives and every evening i am so glad she is so save in the states otherwise he might put her under constant surveillance i guess of course he is right right after arrival she meets her charming kidnapper hours later shes violently dragged off her suite thats what happens when a young girl travels through the dark old continenther father her saviour he kicks ass one guy dares to help a villain that gets beaten to a pulp in public he instantly gets pounded as well hes black probably an accomplice of that albanian scum neeson just hunted down liam neeson shows us what a real hero looks like an all american father in lone starmodeof course albnanians are the villains yet we meet an interesting mix of other participants in these foul deeds done most are more or less characterized by nation or culture albanians only do the dirty work of course all the other mistrusted yet more cultivated folks play their parts respectively if it werent about selling women we might not even hate them as much as it is however we see them for what they are nonhuman fit to be hunted down and killed in broad daylight without asking twice torture and everything well done by our hero a pity he could not rescue all those probably eastern european girls he rushed by while on his mission sedated as they were it would have been hard to do i guess and after all his goal is saving his daughter i mean they made it his business he wouldnt come for them if they had left his daughter alonewe learn dont go abroad listen to your father and if you kidnap a girl better make sure shes not americanseriously if the film would have any flaws besides its massive use of stereotypes and its reconfirming peoples ridiculous fears id have given it a one of ten besides that it is rather entertaining and well made so 310 for well made propaganda,reality
the film offers two things action and a fatherdaughter reunion and it does just that with the tragic expense of 92 minutes of your life it argues the very definition of a good action movie as such the film is not worthy of its blockbuster reputation the films pace is a speedily one that goes by so damn fast that you dont even have time to process any of the information that the film throws at you this requires a second viewing therefore the only people who can catch up are the hardiest of actiongoers also youre viewing it wondering where did the last five minutes go at that point youre already lost in the horrid butchered editing till you find yourself pausing it to take a breather the pace also does not give way to the films dialog some of the dialog is great but it fails to catch up with the actors that speak it again another example of butchered film editing the film goes from a meaningful drama to a letsgoandruinanddestroyeverything where the action thrives from speedily boat chases to fist crunching sequences suffering long and hard of shaky camera syndrome but the action overwhelms our protagonist so god damn much that it reaches a point where there is no story and our characters get lost in the midst of all the explosions and foreign gibberishthe films story line is one massive plot hole in itself what are the odds that the daughter kidnapped kim just happened to be the daughter of an excia agent what are the odds that sex traffickers just happened to kidnap the daughter of a kickass cia fulltime father and what are the odds that she was kidnapped at the time she was on the phone to her father and what are the beckoning odds that they were kidnapped on the very same day as their arrival including the evil taxi driver that drove them to their apartment questions like these dont match up the films story line is so damn focused on the action and combat choreography that it doesnt concentrate on the reason its being made in the first place creating more questions than answers is possibly the worst thing a storyline can do at this pointoh theres also no character development liam neeson misses some great opportunities to grow into his character as it seems hes so focused on smashing guys up and finding his daughter that perhaps he gets lost in his own motif nobody has character development giving the certain situation theres all the more reason for us to fall in love with our characters in summary its a worthless film with jawaching action with an eyesore pace,reality
the reception that this movie has received over the years is unbelievable to me all too often when i challenge someone to name a second film liam neeson was in that is worth watching the one film being schindlers list and ill always hear s a great movie this is perhaps the worst action film i have ever seen the lines delivered are positively horrible and the actual fighting is preposterous one user stated that fans of the bourne series would enjoy this film as the action scenes are shot similarly whether or not this is true a young fit matt damon doesnt look nearly as ridiculous flipping bad guys over his back while spin kicking another as an aging neeson does while action films often dont need to be believable to be enjoyable makes a few attempts to be seriously as a meaningful film which are out of place and laughable dont see this movie,reality
im not certain how its possible that so many people can give glowing reviews to this to me such a high score on such an overwhelmingly mediocre film is ludicrous i like a good action film i quite enjoy neesons acting usually but this is horrible i guess it makes sense that people like pierre morel and luc besson will continue to make loads of money cranking out this predictable formulaic demeaning and regressing cinema so why stop i guess i would do the same i wont go into the plot because there are some really fantastic reviews already apparently there are people who have sense out there that sum it up perfectly essentially utter crap tripe funny and horrifying but only when its not trying to be actually maybe i will go on bear with me i promise this is an accurate description before i continue i have to say that if you happen to be a student of sociology or if your interested in understanding modern or historical racism then this movie actually has merit but only as a study or example of how racism still exists everywhere in our world especially in the us seriously its terrible to see that people think this raises some sort of awareness about human trafficking once again other reviews have tackled this already but i must throw my lot in with the rest its too bad that people around the world have to put up with these stereotyped threats to america the crooked police with a friggen baguette under his arm the muslimalbanianunamerican thats the point who wants to take your daughter give her drugs rape her and then sell her to muslims it exists sure enough and its terrible of course but this is neither appropriate or needed in this medium french are stereotyped as incapable and crooked albanians as fat greasy ugly rapists dont forget the drugs who are apparently also really bad at what they do i was about to go on but to this point ill just say that this film is ignorant and racist damn we should have listened to liamthe daughter thinks it the wife thinks it the step husband thinks it the crooked police think it did i miss anyone oh yeah the abductors think it of course he said he was coming i sure underestimated that americanfine hes superman and captain america in one happens enough in movies and frankly not a big deal but the tracking of the mobsters cmon if your going to make him a secret agent you can actually create some justification as to how he is so bloody competent at finding people in a foreign country but no they dont bother because then the writers might have to take two minutes to look at the storyboard all we know is hes superman why leave every girl if your superman you might as well take 2 minutes to do some good he hurdled every other seemingly impossible obstacle easily enough no emotion from daughter or dad at death of friend what about the parents what about the other girls whered the methadone come from and why didnt they simply give us a reason for neesons superman status this inofitself is why the movie is so horrifyingly bad they could easily throw two lines in explaining some of the less believable scenes but they dont im angry and confused mainly at how its possible that this received such a high rating this is the best example i can think of right now of the worst movie ever made for many many reasons all of you who think this is good or relevant to a human trafficking discourse or that its good for awareness of the topic should seriously get some sense and i mean this feel ashamed the money doesnt go to trying to stop human trafficking it goes towards the house cars and meals of the already fat luc bissonits not the fact that this movie was made that gets me there are always poor decisions being made for all the wrong reasons all around the world its the fact that what i thought was a community of for the most part intelligent and conscious movie goers is not respect your movies dont put up with this garbage most of all respect the victims of a real and horrifying problem in our world dont support this cinematicdiarrhea,reality
if your not drawn to this film by its simple trailer of the phone call between the characters played by maggie grace and liam nieson you yourself need a recharge of the batteriesthe film starts of simply enough with the character of bryan mills on a quest to buy a karaoke machine for his daughters birthday he pours over the instructions just to make sure the item is good enough for his daughterhowever hes somewhat estranged from his family despite the fact that hes giving up the career that took him away for so long after an awkward moment where he delivers the gift hes called upon by a friend played by leland orser of runaway juryto work security at a concert of a britney spears type divathe next day mills drops his daughter off for her trip to paris where he is told that she and her friend amanda are merely going there to check out the muesuemsinstead they hope to follow us on tour alas a encounter with a runner for a group of thugs who kidnap young girls for sex slavery marks them and they are later kidnapped as they kidnap mills daughter and her friend he advises them to let his daughter go or else hed come looking for themand looking for them is what he does after the runner is killed trying to escape mills mills embarks on a twisted and sorted journey filled with seedy characters and friends ready to betray him after he finally gets his hands on victor the kidnap groups leader he is set to find those who know have his daughtervengeance is served by the character of bryan mills as he eliminates the organizers of this group until it ends in an epic battle aboard a yachtthe villains are rightfully chilling and ruthless mills is honorable as a charles bronson style assassin the bryan mills character doesnt use catch phrases or fancy moves instead of being superman hes presented as a father who has just the right set of skills to rescue his daughter and perhaps bring down the networkshould have gotten more praise then it was given this film is a sleeper of a gem that supplies the right balance of action melodrama and overall heart that is what makes it different then many actions films made today a truly excellent film rated 10 out of a possible 10,reality
is a very serious action movie involving fist fights gun fights car chases i was very impressed by liam neesons acting and especially his fightingstyle its amazing how he can take down 10 opponents with his body famke janssen was alright in this movie but i could see that she was just uncomfortable with her role man when she cried i laughedthe story is about this retired agent whose daughter gets kids kidnapped by men with a tenacity for trafficking women the news shocks him to the bone but its all a piece of cake for him he only has to put his life on the line who cares well anyway i enjoyed this movie for its action and story the only thing that i hated about this movie is the shortness of it the movie was an hour and twentynine minutes but it seemed like thirty minutes i guess i must have been enjoying it so muchi plan to watch more movies by the director pierre morel and that just shows how much i really liked with this moviestory 80 acting 69 action 90 overall 90spoiler goofs in one part his daughter says that the kidnapper has a beard but in the next scene she says he has a mustache,reality
luc besson is not my favorite director but liam neeson is one of my favorite actorsyes it starts a little slow but thats only to get to know the characterswhen the phone call happens thats when the movie starts the fight sequences are so raw much like bonddaniel craig not those pansies from before and bourne but here he beats over 40 men with his bare hands and the dude is not in his early 30iesthe boat part might just be the best fight i have ever seen and most realistic which is very hard to come bydid i mention i watched it 3 times in a rowonly one part vexed me the albanian guy was named marko and that is not an albanian namealbanians are muslim and marko is a christian name,reality
my friend saw this movie and recommended it she said it was a good movie for young girls to see i am not into actions and i am not at that age of meeting strange men or strangers in general or traveling with a wild friends and getting into mischief but it was very interesting and kept me hooked it does teach a lesson on not trusting people who might seem charming even if you dont picture yourself in a situation like this it teaching a lesson on trusting people in general and it teaching a lesson on not doing anything you do not feel uncomfortable with the main characters mean mother convinces the father to allow her to go on the trip he agrees as long as she calls him and there is a guardian which the friend thinks there is as her friend said her cousin would be there spoilers when the girls arrived to france and shared a cab with these charming men her friend tells them where they are staying the main character seems skeptical and implies to her friend that she shouldnt have done that but shes like its fine she also realized her friend lied that her adult cousin would be there her father calls and she confides to him that there are not adults on the trip but kind of tells him its all fine then she witnesses her friend being kidnapped and tells her father his daughter gets kidnapped shortly after while on the phone but the father goes to france immediately to save her the whole film is fast paste and interesting unfortunately her friend died but her father saved her,reality
was the best action film in the uk in the autumn of 2008 liam neeson was a credible and exciting action man and the kitchen scene when he reveals himself to the kidnappers was one of those visceral cinematic moments when you have to shout out get some because you know theres gonna be an ass kicking bad style forget about the ludicrous plotting the film does everything it says on the boxand is an enjoyable euro thriller accept the film at that level and you wont be disappointed its better than quantum of solace i disagree about comments over neesons acting the fact is he is totally credible as a one man demolition squad if he wasnt the film simply wouldnt work neeson reinvents himself as an action man in the same way that nicholas cage did so in con air watch out for more chop socky from neeson in the future perhaps as a baddie even a bond villain remember you read it here first,reality
what a thrilling film it was fastfastfast liam neeson was excellent and it was good to see him as a heartless killerhe had a heart but it was just for his daughter he kills everyone its a bit hokey in parts but what an exciting fun film it was really fast with the quick shot changes and the great sound fx and it also shined a light on the terrible of sex slavery parents should watch this before letting their girls go away to far countries would recommend this as a funyet serious filmnot really a date movie but one for seeing with your buddies and talking about it over a beer and some wings 910,reality
well it was a boring evening until i decided to run down the local video store to rent out a dvd holy maria liam neeson is a great actor but who would have thought he is a cold hearted martial arts street smart action hero and loving father yes there are many stereotypes in this story i will not go into it as it has already been discussed but this is a moviehellomovie everybody i enjoyed every minute of it for a very simple reason all this movie wanted to be was a simple and good action moviemission accomplished it is fast paced nobody is trying to make you feel sorry for their actions and at the end i was jumping on my couch just like tom when he finished the bad guy at the end nowadays we do get too many thrillers and action movies that want to save the world and the whales and somehow go off track never swayed of the track for one tiny millimeter and i would go as far as calling this the best action movie in the last 5 years jason bourneyou have been served,reality
as i do i watch films late at night when i cant sleepand i often spend longer than i do actually watching a film searching for it most of the time the search yields crap resultsluckily imdb sorts out the riff raffnot this time is a great movie from start to end it has a clear and solid story line which is executed to the end beautifully great storylinegood actingneed i say more,reality
i just finished watching this movie wow i so loved it this movie is beautiful because of its simplicity i often say that a good plot relies in its simplicitythis movie is smart fastpaced full of actionliam neeson was just great he plays the role of a retired hardened agent working for the government he just fits so well into that roleanyways guys this movie is cool many fighting scenes intelligent tricks i enjoyed watching it and would recommend to anyonei hate people always trying to find flaws in movies its a movie there for your eyes just watch and enjoy  nick,reality
my brother almost begged me to see this movie to my surprise it delivered it was a very entertaining movie with nice action over a thin plotas some will say nothing new as far as retired tuff guy that is an overprotective pops very little in the area of father daughter development but enough for you to get the ideai always look at a movie whether its a rehashed idea or not and try to figure out what they will do to make their movie different from the previous copies well one thing liam brings is a toughness and nice ruthlessness that i thoroughly enjoyedwhen looking just at the previews i wondered how this guy was going to find some kidnappers 1k kilos away from where he was and if he did i felt that it would be so phony that after that point i wouldnt even care this movie was so believable that it made me feel like this dude could probably find bin laden the same way for any action lovers i dont think you will be disappointed,reality
liam neeson strikes again with let me say a perfect movie my second best movie for 2008 after the dark knight my favourite action movie of all times liam neeson is perfect in the role of a father whos daughter was kidnapped  he is in the hunt to return her back using his special skills as a former protector best acting from one of the best actors which will make you believe he really has those skills the movie also arouse a major problem of slave trading which start to grow more  more now adays you will be asking yourself throughout the whole movie what would happen to his daughter with a lot other examples of other girls being kidnapped also  i see that this is the main point of the movie a message to everyone whos in control who could do anything to start hunting down those people  a message to every parent to take more care of their children i recommend this movie to everyone who really wants to see a very very good movie with perfect acting from everyone perfect directing  production my third best movie of all times  genres1010,reality
a great action flick with notes of james bond and die hard throughout the film is crisp direct and gritty  without the generic template for a hollywood thriller a great surprise to see as this film has not been heavily promoted  much like death sentence with kevin bacon in 2007liam neeson seems an unlikely hero at first but his natural and unassuming approach make his performance appear real raw and most importantly convincing the film is fast paced and the direction doesnt waste a second for explanations of plot  yet is simple to followin my opinion a real gem for 2008  the most ive enjoyed a thriller since casino royale,reality
well i had big expectations to this movie i was long waited and i can announce that i was happy when it was over sorry thats not true i was sad because there is no more it was so great all the way thru it was action  killing at its best it holds a good style with a lot for killing and some torture with out going over the line to totally unreal can really only recommend this movie its a must see just look at the lead character liam nilson one of our time legends and the if you add a good story  script to that well thats the form of success damn im not over it yet and its been about 15 minutes i will recommend watching it in the cinema because of great sound effect which you dont catch in a bad version or with the ordinary speaker casper hansen out,reality
this is one heck of wild ridethink if trade met kill bill vol1 is one of the most furiously exciting action movies ive seen in a long long time the only reason this goes from 10 to 9 is because there is so much action that the character development wanes a bit but i promise you will not carethere is nothing original about the plot there are no oscar worthy performancesneeson is great though derives its power from its lead characters strength and willingness to do anything to save his daughterhave you ever watched one of these movies about despicable people and youre always sitting there wondering why the hero never makes them pay enough of a price well in a nutshell thats why i love this movie its the gift that keeps on givingthe action will drain you and the movie flies by like the concordi doubt there will be a more exciting movie released in the us in 2009 is one that ill be adding to the library the most fun ive had watching a popcorn action flick in yearssimple premise a little cheesy to start then foot on the gasfammke and some of the other cast bring it down a notch but from minute 25 to minute 90 youll be on the edge of your seat a very small price to payi cant stand the negative reviewers on this one in a movie like this someone has to be stereotyped some nationality some group you have to so what you have is about 5 negative reviews from albanians and frenchmen that dislike the stereotype nothing more to give this any less than 6 stars is disclosure for i am an idiotclichd yes overly violent yes tough subject matter yes the occasion bad line or suspect acting yes but who cares this movie makes the bourne series look boring i had a grin on my face for the last hour this is what i want from a movie my moneys worth 810 85100,reality
as a critic to draw comparisons between and the james bond series would be like taking a gun and shooting yourself in your foot and so i must continue on with this review in a limp while this latest effort from director pierre morel isnt exactly as compelling or engaging as most of mr bonds movies what it does have in common is a riveting mix of action that runs on adrenaline and kicks with personality of course liam neeson is hardly a james bond type and quite frankly neither is his character but the trials and tribulations that bryan goes through here share the same sense of personal conflict that often occurs during the best spythrillers this isnt a movie riddled with politics evil villains looking for world domination or fancy gadgets no instead morel adopts a much more grounded everyday threat to work with here and as such achieves a good sense of focus and pacing that drives the feature forward unfortunately despite this keen eye for bringing action that we care about to the screen the scripts lack of just about anything else hinders the movies ability to work anything but the brain it can be touching but only momentarily is fine for a couple of hours of thrilling mystery but if you crave more than a sixpack youre probably best waiting for a martinitelling the story of an exspy and father bryan who is on the hunt for his daughters kidnappers in france takes a much more domestic heartdriven source of narrative to drive itself forward compelled only to find his enemies for the sake of saving her daughter within a contrived timeline before she gets sent somewhere out of his reach and knowledge bryan makes for a cold unrelenting character to follow throughout the feature neeson proves he has what it takes to fulfil such shoes conveying the abrasive goaldriven attitude of his character with enough conviction to maintain our own interest in his story of course when it comes to showing how he feels outside of a piece of combat however both neeson and his persona fall a little shortbryan is a regretful father who in the past neglected his exwife and daughter in order to be good at his job yet realising how much bonding time he lost in doing so decided to quit his job in order to move closer and spend time with his daughter in this arc there is genuine sympathy to be felt for bryan and neeson does enough to get this across even if he is far more compelling when firing off a weapon and breaking peoples bones the closing sequences are where the majority of all this development does finally pay off however in an emotive climax that provides adequate catharsis involving the two central characters however compelling such moments are though there is no denying that the majority of is driven by pure logic and visceral action moments involving the heart are sporadic and almost immediately forgotten and as such the movies tone can get a little erratic at timesas a whole the feature isnt as remarkable as it could have been but it is in no way disappointing either instead takes a much more focused route and delivers a spythriller that delivers on all the elements needed to create tension conflict and does so with a character that is convincing in his role as a source of unrelenting pain for those who have crossed him those looking for a taste for the genre before bond comes out should find themselves at home here and while is certainly a lot darker more grounded and at the same time less charismatic than cinematic icon 007 theres enough action and plot here to justify a watch perhaps with a little deeper characterisation the production as a whole could have been stronger but for what it is is pretty much standard for the genre no too remarkable but not too disposable either something for the aficionadosa review by jamie robert ward httpwwwinvocusnet,reality
i just watched this movie and its definitely one of the best action movies ive seen in the last few years its because this isnt movie like many other action movies that are made these days at least 80  of newer action movies are all about special effects and big budgetthis movie gives us great actingvery good action and lots of tense moments liam neeson is damn good in the role of the father who will do everything he can to find his daughter he really surprised me with all that good action stunts he pulled off in the endhe is 56 years old so i wasnt expecting too much in the beginningi was veryvery wrongso in the endi aint gonna tell you anything else about this movie because i dont want to risk and spoil you watching it i can only highly recommend ityou really wont be disappointed,reality
i loved this movie  thought it was edge of the seat stuff from start to end considering all the average stuff thats been coming out this was a pleasant surprise just loved it no over the top dialog to bore you to pieces just a you deserved it you got it attitude from neilson does this picture proud the action sequences arent too long  unbelievably theyre believable if you like action a decent storyline to hold it all together and a fresh face for a new badass then this movies for you yes its somewhat predictable but doesnt prevent you from getting engaged and enjoying the show will a 2 be coming outheres hoping,reality
is a serious lemon neeson deserves a better script viewers deserve a better movie this is so monomaniacal it becomes thuddingly unsubtle in the first ten minutes we get sentiment and we get violence and we get supercreepy fatherdaughter scenes that made my toes curl across his career luc besson vacillates between almost passable escapism fifth element and utterly unredeemable dreck big blue subway leon the script is so barebones that it results in laughoutloud developments 45 minutes after lading in paris a girl is kidnapped for a europrostitution ring um yeah and you can identify a single criminal in europe from two words spoken into a phone liam neeson passes himself off as a french agent without speaking french or having an accent terrific theres dumb theres dumb and then theres ,reality
ouch an hour gone by since leaving the theater and i am still recovering from the painful excruciating 93 minute experience called a film so weak and terrible from plot to script to flow to acting that i cannot bear to hash over the detail if you are debating on whether to see it or if you should trust the high imdb score help yourselves and trust me wait for it to appear on free cablelacks depth at all levels and it pains me to slam it like this honestly i am torn liam neeson is one of my favorite actors and id like to give any movie he is in props just for having him in it but i cant do it for the only reason i did not walk out of the theater is that i believed  hoped there was a good reason for an actor of neesons depth and resume of riches to contract for such drivelbut there is something bigger here than my opinion of this movie the high imdb score noted above i read several of the very favorable reviews and found them suspiciously lopsided and written with unnatural professionalism all i can think is either a i just dont get this movie and something is wrong with me or b imdb has been corrupted by a vast hollywood conspiracyheres my theory the economic recession has turned the porn industry flaccid leaving a great swath of affordable real estate in the san fernando valley and leagues of unemployed writers willing to work for food in this case sign a nondisclosure agreement and write fraudulent reviews to falsely inflate imdb scores and deceive moviegoers driving them to see films rent dvds etc all for the benefit of those along the money chain unlike some of the other mediocre reviews i cannot even give high marks for the action or fight choreography yes theres lots of it but its so overthetop with neeson going virtually unscratched after dodging a thousand bullets and countless manoamano encounters it is just silly so mr neeson please forgive me and please get busy on rob roy the golden years,reality
from the opening sequences full of obviously expositional lines all the way through the formulaic and unconvincing fight sequences and reaching the final predictable inevitable and thoroughly boring hollywood ending this film was a disappointment i confess that i have high standards for films and i expect a little effort in the scriptwriting departmentfor people who have one or two brain cells to keep their ears warm with this film is very boring the film equivalent of paisley wallpaperfor those who just want a mindless action film masquerading as a thriller go for it but dont expect anything that hasnt already been done a thousand times since the mid 70s stephen segal has done the same stuff for years and in a more entertaining way,reality
im not a hommaphobe but i dont think gay people could handle the manliness displayed in this film im pretty sure liam neeson after making this film beat his wife for overcooking his steak then pounded her relentlessly she probably forgave him because he was good at it with those big arms and throbbing penis you gotta admit hes a pretty good looking guy id have a beer with him sometimes when i close my eyes all i see is him and his sly smile and it makes me ejaculate not because im gay but because whenever i think of liam neeson he makes me produce more sperm in my balls that old sperm has to come out hes just a really great guy,reality
i dont normally like or even watch movies like because im not a big fan of the whole actioncrimethriller genres in fact the only reason that i watched this movie in the first place is because my dad borrowed the second movie from my unclehaving said that i loved this i give it ten out of ten stars and if i could i would give it eleventhe fighting was realistic as was the way he went about getting his daughter back i could feel my heart beating all through out the movie its fast paced but so much that you get lost if you blink and the beginning isnt so slow that you lose interest this one movies that i simply have to buy all in all is one of the best movies i have ever seen im going to watch 2 and when it comes out 3,reality
after his daughter is kidnapped a cia agent goes after the bad guys with a vengeance it is interesting that writer bresson receives before the title screen credit because the script here is atrocious nearly as bad as his la femme nikita it starts off as merely subpar in the expository scenes where the cardboard characters are introduced including a 17 yearold daughter who looks about 25 and behaves like 12 then the kidnapping occurs and the film becomes increasingly ridiculous neeson singlehandedly takes out about seven hundred bad guys in paris while barely getting a scratch on himself and he does this with a straight face the guy makes james bond look like a wimp,reality
i saw some people commenting that is better than the bourne and james bond movies hell no i would just like to mention that im in love with the bourne movies so dont think i just dont like the genrefirst of all it was just all so easy for him so easy it got boring he was prepared for everything and knew what to do all the time that is not a real person i found myself hating the main character i mean cmon he shot his old friends innocent wife how is he supposed to be the good guy sure it was all to get his daughter back but did he really feel the need to shoot every single person that had any remote connection with his daughternothing interesting happened the entire length of this film pretty much the guys daughter gets and he shoots everyone until he gets to her none of the hundred deaths is he connected to instead they all go home and live happily ever the end,reality
is a dramatic and interesting movie about a spys daughter getting kidnapped while shes in france maggie grace lost the fog suburban girl jane austin book club is a little on the little kid side for her age and height but her performance as a scared and worried teenager who is being held hostage was amazing liam neeson star wars is a spy who will do anything to get his daughter back he lets nothing stand in his way when i went to go see this i was shocked he was bigger and badder than james bond i thought i was going to the movies to see my favorite actress ex lost survivor maggie grace and i thought o wow its going to be another boring film with just a pretty face in it boy was i wrong this movie is a must see i suggest that everyone goes and gets them a copy of this movie when it comes out on dvd has such a good supporting cast such as famke janssen x  men 123 will leave you on the edge of your seat and you will be praying that nothing bad happens to some of the main characters in this wicked film,reality
yea though i would never have expected to see liam neeson in an action flick he does a spectacular job playing the role of an excia preventor he has a natural knack for action as he is long and lithe allowing for intense hand to hand combat as well as fast paced runningthe story line is somewhat meager but is sufficient to warrant the viewer the ability to sit still until the next action scene pops upneeson definitely beats out most other actors in action and shows his undying prowess in hollywoodall the way up till the end keeps the viewer on the edge of hisher seat and barely leaves one wanting more910,reality
this movie will remind you of man of fire and the bourne series in one this movie is fast paced and has kills and fights every minute liam is relentless and unforgiving if i had to pick something bad the first ten minutes does foreshadow way too much but once the action starts its first rate now why im mad this movie was supposed to be released in september 2008 for unknown reasons fox studios pushed it to january 2009 which for those of you who dont know january and february are the dump months this is the time when production studios dump the movies they know are flops or dont expect any money from fox are idiots in my opinion this movie would have been one of the top three action films of 2008 but its being completely disrespected with the likes of paul blart and bride wars go see this movie liam nieson is a bad ass the plot is original and the action is up there with the bourne series its awesome to see a good guy wholl hurt anybody to win liam doesnt hesitate which is a rare thing to see in good guys go see it go see it go see it,reality
i just saw this movie and it was awesome truly a great action movie that keeps your attention on it all the time because you dont wanna miss on the action scenesthis is one of the those movies where you just know whats gonna happen people are gonna get killed hurt and probably a few explosions while the plot isnt the best its simple thats why its a good movie theres a good balance on on getting to know the different characters but its only quick introductions any one whos seen a more than 5 movies in their lives doesnt need the whole life story of each of the characters you just get a idea of who what where and why and then the movie startsliam nesson plays well in it retired spec ops liam nooo really he was the right pick for the lead role and he delivers very well you can almost sense hes got a lot of war stories and the skills to keep doing what he was trained to dojust a quick note for all the i hate it just whining about the movie containing stereotypes oh the big americans just do this and that blah blah doesnt most movies contain stereotypes french director and writer and producer got a problem with americans go whine to the french thenno im not americanthen a lot of you saying its trying to be like bond or bourne perhaps then again i love to see somebody kick ass so yea this movie is for people that love that if not stick to quantum of solace thats a real movie about feelings and how the world can be a better place,reality
this was a pleasant change to the ordinary plot line that this genre usually calls forthis movie had me at the edge of my seat from start to finish it is one of those vengeance movies where the audience is left with a great satisfaction after the villain is slayedjust like all feel good movies you need to have a wider range of imagination when dealing with the plot such as when the protagonist is fighting a million villains needless to say he will prevailnevertheless i thought this was a good thriller and action movie it felt as if all the characters involved had substance to them not like your usual thriller obviously this is not a very deep and emotional movie but given the constraints i felt that neeson gave a very good performance at least what his character called for everyone pretty much painted a very clear picture of the characters except maybe for the step dad i felt that his character was too empty but then this is a thriller and after such a nice hour and a half i might be asking for too much,reality
i really liked the movie its like book jason bourne in his 40 i really enjoyed the movie rewarding scenes getting up from the couchthis is one of the best movies ive seen for a long time i recommend to all bourne fans that were little disappointed after how that movie missed the book the only thing that i didnt like is his daughter actingshe run like a child while she was 17giving credits for the scene when she was its little thing that i laugh seeing that girl performancebut all other parts action story fight scenes the character was really great loved really loved the scene when guy walks into that house where they keep the girls and tries to recognize the guy on the phonehow he acts as a different person confident taking over all conversations making those guys scared and than fight scenethank you for this moviethank youwhat can i more say that i really loved loved the movie i give it 1010,reality
wow i must admit that this movie is by far the best movie i have seen this year you dont need gadgets to be a superhero all what you need is liam neeson i wasnt really keen on watching this one but once i saw the first 30 sec of the trailer i was thrilled and what a surprise i am so glad i watched this moviehow do you know that a movie is good for me i sense that from the first 10 minutes of the movie if you feel the sparkle then thats it thats the onei dont want to talk much about the movie because i dont wanna spoil it for you all what you have to do is to watch the trailer and i am sure if you are into action movies you gonna love this onei hope you enjoy it as i did good luck ,reality
just tagging along to watch this film i hadnt known about or heard of its existence even it was simply brilliant neeson played his role perfectly and the story was gripping with shocks and plenty of empathic moments the fight scenes were well shot and the action was breath taking i can honestly say my heart was pumping fast through the majority of the film in this emotional rollercoaster action thriller the film touches on a controversial story plot with darkness the mystery in the plot is deep and thickens through the film its truly clever the film is a must see i havent had the satisfaction of film entertainment since seeing gladiator in the cinema for the first time,reality
i love it when an action film has a solid plot decent acting and tons of great action if you liked the movie seraphim falls and you enjoyed liam neesons character then you will love this film a previous reviewer compared to the bourne films and complained that it couldve been better i agree as some of the supporting acting was terrible however i personally detest the political nature of the bourne filmsthe great thing about is that it has no sociopolitical agenda liam neesons character is solely focused on saving his daughter and will do anything to accomplish his mission whether it means killing or torturing those who get in his waytowards the end the action gets a little unbelievable however nothing that deters from the enjoyment of the movie my biggest problem with this film is maggie graces horrible acting as liam neesons daughteris a typical luc besson action film that cares very little about character development and strives to provide the best action and cinematography possible and in that sense this film is a major success i gave this film 1010 stars because it embodies what i look for in an action filmintense action gripping suspense and absolutely no sociopolitical agenda,reality
has everything you want to see and hear in an action thriller liam neeson is just super cool in this movie he is so incredibly believable as a really tough and super smart guy in this movie all of the scenes where he has to mix it up are realistic and not the computerized garbage we see on the screen these dayshe is a retired cia agent who has to rely on his skills and former contacts he acquired as an agent to try to rescue someone the film visits a lot of really desired localities places we plan to visit one day the locations add to the visual delights of the vieweri just never lost interest in this film and the pace of excitement this film created was riveting it was great from start to finishdont miss this movie you wont be disappointed,reality
i started watching the movie expecting to see a clich but i was pleasantly surprisedliam neeson is very good at what he does he actually makes me care about the storythe whole cast well chosen and fits into the story perfectlythe end of the movie which i am not going to spoil for you is good but it wouldnt not have hurt if it was a bit longer if you havent seen yet i advise you to do it as soon as possible because those 93 minutes of your life will be well spent if you have nothing to do or if you are looking for a great film in the hurricane of overbudgeted blockbuster filmspeople go see you wont regret it for a second,reality
if you like any of the bourne movies this is one movie you should not miss fast pace action with lots of down to earth fighting only occasional okletitslideafterallitsamovie moments and last but not least luc bessons handwriting all over the movie the main character is so driven and determined to get his daughter back that its a joy to see him shoot and fight his way through his enemies i was completely by surprise with the outstanding performance of liam neeson and would never have pictured him pulling such a role off from the moment liam receives the call that starts his vendetta you believe every single second that he means business well done,reality
i never realised europe was such a dangerous place my sister travelled around china in the 80s with a girlfriend both around 20 and here they are worried about paris i thought i would forgive the ludicrous premise if it resulted in a good thriller type film unfortunately it didnt a filmbynumbers pushing standard buttons americans good europe dangerous fremch weaselly albanians all crooks and arabs decadent a waste of time still i am sure liam neeson and famke janssen both of whom i normally like got a decent payday so its not all bad ps travelled and realised are not misspelt line 9 is here and this is line 10,reality
first of all i have to say that i love the shoes liam wore nice shoes people who abducted her daughter wore nice shoes too good job by the people dressing the actors what is the word costimographersthe plot is a standard action film with some parental involvement selling virgins to the rich arabs i do not know it is a little bit clich too much blood and too many dead people i did not like that much violenceit is not very realistic plot i do not like thatliam neeson is fabulous like he always is other actors are excellent as well especially actors acting albaniansparis is beautiful like it always is i am glad that this film is focusing on waves of east europeans and other foreigners coming to find luck in paris and finding corruption and problems paris has no room for all those who want to find happiness in it parisiennes hate foreigners and other french people the only thing they want to see is the seaside and skiing twice a year rest does not interest them,reality
who knew liam neeson had it in him certainly i didnt this has feel of the bourne identity plus frantic plus whatever kickass action hero kim maggie grace is holidaying in paris with her friend amanda only an albanian gang of human traffickers kidnaps them but before they leave kims father bryan mills liam neeson gives one of the coolest threats in history little did they know bryan is a retired cia killerits an odd thing to recommend a movie based so much on a single scene liam neeson has the voice and the skills to pull it off it has the simple death wish sensibility he is a force of nature and no bad guy has a chance the story has some ridiculous elements but who cares anyways i want to see liam kick some a,reality
my theory is that most thrillers perhaps only the best thrillers have any chance of being remotely plausible or realistic if a thriller were actually plausible some reallife bad guy would have already figured out the wouldbe plot device at that point it could not be a thriller simply because it would already have become national newsis not a great thriller it looks pretty good and liam neeson does his best at knocking guys out but underneath it all it is a silly movie the film is slightly more serious about itself when compared to the die hard movies but other than that they seem a lot alikethrillers do not have to be endless machine guns bursts car wrecks and fiery explosions they really dont one of my favorites is the french connection but dont get me wrong has its place i mean the idea is to give some thrills and raise the pulse does that but you have to suspend most thought and all logic to get maximum effect,reality
it seems a impossible rescue at the beginning only 72 hours against a local woman trafficking gang the thing is you get no idea about any information about them and you need to cross the ocean which takes time as well what i say is this success of the mission depends on too many special objective factors in other words the director provides the mission too many sort of lucky factors to make it successfulthe girl gets a millionaire stepfather who has a private plane so it doesnt take too long to cross the ocean then its her spy fathers turn im not sure if it is too lucky for bryan or it is too stupid of the criminals that the girls phone is still there and then what a lucky guy bryan is again that he catches the trafficker in the airport or maybe they are there everyday if it is positive i have nothing to say but feeling surprise that what a dangerous world it is keep your girls safewhats more another thing is the jacket so lucky hur hundreds of girls there how can he just found the girl with the jacket and also what a special jacket it is is that the only one in the world the following plots are possible only when the spy is as good as 007in conclusion if you just watch it as a movie i mean just enjoy it without too much judgements it is a pretty good one,reality
if you want an entertaining moment watch this movie it has everything that should be in an quality action movieit has a nonnonsens story line its not to much over the top like spiderman or james bondand the actor fits with role i watched it for more then once and could watch it again and again for someone that has not seen this movie if youre smart you also check out 2 and watch them in one moment  i guarantee that you will be entertainedi loved it and will still remember it kind regards me,reality

is a french thriller starring liam neeson maggie grace and famke janssen the screenplay was written by luc besson and robert mark kamen and directed by pierre morel neeson plays a former central intelligence agency cia operative who sets about tracking down his daughter after she is kidnapped by human traffickers while traveling in francehe sets on a frantic quest to rescue her after the young girl is abducted by slave traders in district b13this is film provides a lot of fun and entertainment as a predictable action thrillerits got all the attributes of a pleasurable action thriller  excitement some undeniably enjoyable scenes and the absence of what it needs to be more memorable and more substantialalsoa viewer is introduced to a new side of liam neeson one that is relentless and likes to hit criminals in the throat and he makes this action movie engagingthat is why this is one excellent film despite of being far from a masterpiece,reality
liam neesom at his best in this action adventure movie i have never seen a movie where neesom has had a bad role his toughness is what really makes the movies more interesting to watch i have seen him in satisfaction and that was an okay movie but he really dons out the action films much better what caught my attraction in this film is the way he took charge and that he took nothing that stood in his way to find his daughter i think any human being whether mother father grandparents brothers or sisters would do exactly what he did in this film he was fascinating in and i am looking forward to watching 2,reality
it was probably one of the best surprises ive seen in my life i expected a good movie but not that good i remember as liam neeson played cool characters like schindler in schindlers list but i didnt expected to a character very fast to fight and ready to all to save his daughter the movie is only one hour and half which doesnt make the film long or boring not at all it seems difficult to be bored when watching this movie i think actors like sylvester stallone and jean claude van damme have a rival now if you are looking for an action movie which takes places outside the usa with the idea of revenge is the movie you need to watch,reality
i have seen this movie 4 times i own it and its amazing this movie never gets old the acting is so amazing the plot is so intense and the action is so incredible i love liam neeson i thought that he did an incredible job in this movie and even though hes getting up there in age he still knows how to fight i enjoy this movie more than the bourne series or even the bond series because of its intensity the only thing i thought was lame is that when liam saves his daughter in the end the daughter is fine and dandy when they return home and liam has no consequences from killing so many people if the girl went through being addicted to drugs and sex trafficking she would be changed for life she would become a depressed and disturbed girl and not some happy joyous daddys girl but other than that the movie is incredible and definitely worth watching i cant wait for 2 coming out soon it is going to be just as intense and great as the first film,reality
this 90 minute action movie keeps you on the edge of your seat for the whole time wondering what will be the next course of action liam neeson very well portrays the role of a caring father and an exspy who has some very great skills the direction is very good and the editing is razor sharp not even one scene where the viewer can complain of it being unnecessary the action sequences are mind blowing and more importantly the handtohand combat has been extremely well done the way liam neeson finds each link looks so genuine the two car chase scenes are also a treat to watch all in all its an awesome movie this kind of cinema comes with great effort and hard work my only complain if i can put it that way is that the movie should have been a little longer so we could have more of it,reality
liam neeson stars as an ex cia operative that is forced to come out of retirement in order to find his daughter after she is kidnapped in paris i was excited by the previews and was hoping for a good action film that i could also relate to i found it in this movie i like to get personally involved and it didnt hurt that i was about the same age as the daughter when i saw the moviethe first part of the movie which im sure if you are watching because you want action would probably be boring for the action junkie i however liked it it allowed me time to get to know the characters and the dynamics between the characters for me this makes the movie much more enjoyable and for those action junkies it didnt last long before the action startedliam plays the part of brian mills whose main goal is to rekindle his relationship with his teenage daughter he was a workaholic who neglected his family and ruined his marriage but is determined to keep that one connection with his daughter kim played by maggie grace i didnt feel she was the perfect fit for this role she was too old to be playing a 17 year old girl but while an important role it was still a small part in the film so it worked ok kim wanted to spend the summer in europe with her 19 year old friend liam brian is not happy with the idea but was just beginning to develop a relationship with his daughter and didnt want to ruin it before it flourished so he agreed the first day in paris they were kidnapped the directors were excellent in the construction of the abduction scene it was intense the whole scene was set from the the daughters perspective while she was on the phone with her dad it really builds the suspense and sense of dread the directors did an excellent job with setting up several of the scenes in this movie and it is their ingenuity as well as liams acting skills that make this movie greatthe abduction is where the action starts and it doesnt let up throughout the entire movie liam neeson is perfectly cast in this role and proceeds to blaze a trail of blood bodies and even a little torture in the process of finding his daughter i also feel that liam is a great talent and is underused by hollywoodthe action scenes are staged well and highly entertaining it also had good lighting i hate watching movies when you are somewhat guessing at what is happening because the lighting is too dark i pay good money to watch someone elses imagination at work i dont want to have to use mineafter talking to a few friends about their opinion on the movie the only thing we agreed on is that liam neeson is great and that there is enough action to keep you entertained one person felt it was morally questionable with all europeans and middle easterners as bad and only americans as good another person felt that it put women in a poor light without any control over their own lives ie kidnapped by men and saved by men i felt it was a wellconstructed action film where the directors used their imagination to make the scenes unique and suspenseful i would see it again in fact i already have,reality
i decided to write this review now after seeing this movie for about the 100th time why because of some of the reviews on here that make no sense what so ever namely techstuph trust me i get it we all have different opinions we are entitled to and freedom of speech allows us to print it however this movie kicks ass i mean this flick is non stop action from start to finish i am not saying you have to like this movie but if you are going to call out plot holes than your call outs should at least make sensefirst off you call out the fact that the kidnappers choose to grab the girls by breaking in to a 5th floor apartment why not grab them from this party they were supposed to go to well how about the fact that would be out in public perhaps they would be seen perhaps others would try to help the girls what happens if from when they were dropped off to when this party was supposed to happen they changed their minds say they decided to leave and go out you question his accent yet the kidnappers are not irish or french they are albanian and do not speak french so i would guess it didnt really phase them not to mention why would they ask he had his card knew where they conducted business and knew about their deal with the french government i am not sure what you are referring to on top of the roof and traitor he states that he cant leave that his daughter is running out of time that it was not a building it was a trailer referring to when he broke the girl out wearing his daughters jacket i dont hear anything about him being a traitor and it is not mindless the sex trade is a very real issue in europe which is why i found this movie convincing if you are going to call plot lines out at least think it through this flick kicks butt,reality
was an awesome movie i saw this and if you ever felt frustrated by the evils of the world this is the film for you truly a great action movie that keeps your attention on it all the time because you dont wanna miss on the action scenesthis is one of the those movies where you just know whats gonna happen bad guys who deserve it are gonna get killed hurt and probably a few explosions while the plot isnt the best its simple thats why its a good movie theres a good balance on on getting to know the different characters but its only quick introductions any one whos seen a more than 5 movies in their lives doesnt need the whole life story of each of the characters you just get a idea of who what where and why and then the movie startsliam nesson plays well in it retired spec ops liam nooo really he was the right pick for the lead role and he delivers very well you can almost sense hes got a lot of war stories and the skills to keep doing what he was trained to dojust a quick note for all the i hate it just whining about the movie containing stereotypes dont most movies contain stereotypes french director and writer and producer hey at least they get itthen a lot of you saying its trying to be like bond or bourne perhaps then again i love to see somebody kick ass so yea this movie is for people that love that if not stick to quantum of solace thats a real movie about feelings and how the world can be a better place,reality
i saw the trailer for this film a few months before its release i cant remember looking forward to a film so much from just seeing the trailer the trailer set the film up perfectly by the time i finally got to see it my expectations were so high i knew i would be disappointed wow was i wrongthe film starts off well good introductions to the key characters bryans daughter manipulating her parents into allowing her to go the paris with her friend she makes the promise to call at regular intervals a promise that is broken almost immediately her father played excellently by liam neeson finally gets to speak to her on the phone during this time the house she is staying in is broken into and she sees her friend being attacked she lets her father know what is happening he tells her to hide under the bed then shockingly he tells her that she will be his prediction is right and after she is one of the abductors finds the phone and hears her father telling them that he will find them and kill them the abductor wishes him luck and hangs up the phonethis is also the main part of the trailer what grabbed me was the way neeson spoke to the abductor you would expect panic and anger but no he speaks to him in the calmest voice you will ever hear this tone is frightening you totally believe that this man will carry out his threat and he does so with such style and believability you find out he has special forces training and he puts them to use in dispatching everyone in his way but unlike classic action films the way he does it i found to be very believable everything he does is calculated and no energy is wasted there are no crazy drawn out gunfights no spectacular martial arts fight scenes what you get is believable he takes out people in his way quickly and efficientlyneeson is perfect in this role not a typical action star but he pulls the role off effortlessly you believe in his character and when the film ended i found myself wanting more for me this is what movies should be aboutthe film is written by luc besson a master in this kind of filmthis film ranks in the top films i have ever seen along with leon the professional also by luc besson,reality
i cant believe it took me so long to watch this film it had never caught my eye until a friend gave me it to watch i am so happy they did as this is now one of my favourite films the acting from liam neeson is perfect he plays his part so well and makes this film what it isthe action scenes throughout are great and not too fake or cheesy as i sometimes find with some films the storyline is also very good and is very movingone of the main things i loved about is the fact that it doesnt take too long to get into it the beginning is good and kept me interested unlike some films which just take too long to get into with a very boring start i am so happy i finally watched this film and would recommend anyone thinking of to do so as soon as possible definitely worth it,reality
when his daughter is kidnapped abroad a former cia operative follows the trail of a sex trade ring and stops at nothing to find herwalks the fine line between true action movie entertainment and a a grim thriller the formula works although there are times when you wish director morel had made a clear choice between the twothe movie starts well establishing excia operative bryan mills as a flawed father with the best of intentions and once his daughter is kidnapped during a brilliant iconic scene involving a call between mills and his daughter the tension rises considerably the action sequences impress early on and some people have compared them to the bourne franchisehowever the body count starts to pile up at rate that is hard to swallow when the feel and tone of the movie seems like a thriller or procedural flick this is not die hard or lethal weapon where you expect a fun romp filled with humor and extravagant scenes and yet the movie cannot be viewed in a serious tone as mills leave a huge trail of killing and destruction behind himlikewise the sex slave ring angle gives a grim tone to the entire movie but never fully explores that aspect keeping the movie fast and furious the second half of the flick stretches the confine of realism but without ever becoming tongueincheek liam neeson is perfect as mills but the rest of the cast sleepwalks through the film casting maggie grace 25 year old during filming as mills 17 year old daughter is very questionable to me so this is really a neeson oneman showall in all this is packaged as a tense thriller but is really just a good old action movie where the plot does not make much sense there is nothing wrong with that but with a tighter plot and an extra 15 minutes of character development it could have been an even better movie7 out of 10,reality
i was introduced to this film by a friend who let me borrow the dvd i didnt have many expectations for this film and i wasnt much of a fan of neeson having seen very little of himthe film was absolutely fantastic it is action packed and never left me feeling bored at any stage it starts with bryan mills neeson seeming fairly pathetic at the starts as he attempts to improve his relationship with his daughter it soon becomes apparent however that he is more than just an ordinary father when he has to use his special set of skillsi recommend this film wholeheartedly if you like action films or liam neeson then you have to watch this,reality
the film drove my adrenaline right to the roof the theme about human trafficking is great it makes people aware of this real issue however the film is more about the liam neesons revenge he did an absolutely wonderful job in his role and let us see how would he save his daughter at any cost my favourite lines in this film are i will look for you i will find you and i will kill you the film perfectly illustrates how liam achieved his promises to the kidnappers and he achieved it exceptionally however the only downside is that the actress of the daughter wasnt delivering very decent performances in this film overall i would still rate it 10 out of 10 definitely a must see film if you love liam neeson and revenge films i initially wasnt attracted to see this film by itself but rather liam neeson since i have previously watched his unknown which was also a great one love and liam,reality
liam neeson was great in this movie at times i was reminded of john mcclane and jason bourne characters but with more seriousness  focus as happens with many films of this genre you have to suspend your belief somewhat as this quasisuperhero appears bulletproofsome intermittent subtitles could have fleshed out the bad guys characters a little making them less one dimensional without detracting from the suspense while keeping the audience in the loopa miscast maggie grace tried to downplay her age without success watching her run was reminiscent of a baby giraffe taking its first steps there are many younger actresses out there who can play the ingnue more convincingly the violence can be gruesome and the sextrade scenes sickening but overall this movie delivers and is well worth watching,reality

starts in los angeles where former hardened spy bryan mills liam neeson attends his daughter kims maggie grace seventeenth birthday party separated from kims mother lenore famke janssen he tries to stay close to kim  involved in her life kim asks her father to sign documents that will allow her to travel alone with her friend amanda katie cassidy to paris  throughout europe at first bryan is hesitant to sign the papers but finally agrees once in paris the two girls are kidnapped by albanian gangsters who specialise in prostitution  the slave trade bryan manages to fly to paris  uses his contacts to obtain the information he needs  sets about finding his daughter kim  saving from a life of drugged up prostitution  dishing out a little revenge on the waythis american english  french coproduction was directed pierre morel  is a very gritty action thriller that is almost great but not quite while it has some good action scenes  a solid plot i thought it lacked a little something  i ended up wanting a bit more the script takes itself very seriously  the overall film has a gritty feel theres no oneliners or messing around here when bryan goes in he goes in hard  fast with no messing the central concept is ever so slightly racist as the idea that europe is dangerous  your liable to get kidnapped  sold into prostitution is a little overplayed the other central theme of the unity of the family  that nothing else matters is rather broad the bad guys keep changing from a guy at an airport to alabanian pimps to mega rich oil sheiks bryan brings them all down in the end though at about 90 minutes in length moves along at a decent pace  theres enough shootouts fights  action to keep one entertained but i didnt find any of it particularly memorable the characters are alright but i found the coldness of bryan played by liam neeson distracting  i didnt like it at all even the other characters are a little thinavailable in an uncut internationa version  an edited us theatrical edition theres a couple of minutes of difference between the two but nothing that noticeable the action scenes are good they are swift  fairly brutal without any prolonged fights or shootouts if bryan wants to kill someone he just kills them theres a decent car chase through a building site toowith a supposed budget of about 25000000 this ended up being a big boxoffice just about everywhere it was released filmed in paris  los angeles the acting is ok as i said i didnt like neesons cold performance at all though australian pop singer holly valance turns up as a pop singeris a solid action thriller with a tough gritty edge i cant say its particularly original but is good for what it is action fans should like it  definitely worth a watch,reality
this had everything and more such a simple story yet so beautifully told on screen hats off to the director and screenplay the editing was sharp yet so smooth throughout composition and soundtrack were perfect from scene to scene the fundamental aspect of a fathers love for his daughter isnt shown anywhere else as well defined as it is herei have to say i did have a lot of preconceived notions walking into this picture stuff like well its liam neeson  the man is known for his iconic role in schindlers list but can you really picture a father in his 50s still kicking ass in an action film how wrong i wasthe fight scenes were choreographed so well and once again smoothly edited like i said earlier really captivates your imagination when there are those quiet sombre moments and thrills the excitement of stepping into unknown territory camera shots have to be praised for being so darn clever in capturing long sort after details in a matter of seconds that way you know where the story is going instead of being thrown randomly into a day 2 or a 3 weeks later scenariois on the edge fast paced and script worthy enough to be published as a book i really enjoyed it cant say one bad thing about it i hope you who are reading my review have as much fun as i did watching it,reality
this is a great film for those of you like youre films in the fast lane the action starts almost the moment the film starts and it will have tearing at the seats and throwing the occasional punch in the air from your sofa the locations are good as well as it shows the grim an truthful side of paris you can really a feel of what is going through his mind and the result will grip you right to the endi wont add nothing that will ruin your viewing but get it in bluray on a big telly and enjoy there are a few films that you will watch several times but this one of them its also very bourneish with the music car chases and filming style,reality
bryan mills is the new james bond this movie is about a spys daughter being kidnapped and he must go to paris to find her at first i thought oh no a film in paris that means subtitles but it wasnt also i thought how could liam neeson be this kind of character after previous roles hes done like schindlers list however he pulls if off very well when i went to watch the film once his daughter was kidnapped a half hour of the movie was gone plus 15 minutes of extra stuff before he went looking for her i worried that they would rush all the action and dont pay mind to the story however once again they didnt i liked this movie because bryan once to find his daughter so bad he will kill for her hes different form the other characters that are looking for there daughter like certain limits that they have but he doesnt he shot someones wife in the arm to find his daughter he will kill with no hesitation this movie has great of everything great story great cast great acting great location great screenplay great action if you want to see a action film that is perfect in every way and great martial arts fights which by the way liam neeson did all the martial art scenes himself no stuntman see this no doubt it was really cool of how loyal liam neeson was to this project he even went through special forces training for the film so he could do his own fighting scenes hope to see a sequel cant wait,reality
i must say that im usually not very much into action movies and movies where theres too much shooting and violence involved and yet i thoroughly enjoyed this one even though its packed with shooting scenesliam neeson is the best cast i could imagine for this film apart from harrison ford i suppose and hes done a brilliant jobone knows of course what ending can be expected but its the journey that counts and what a journey it is if you want to be captured by 90 minutes of entertaining and unrelentless action against the backdrop of paris this is the movie to watchin parts it was reminiscent of a bond movie or the spooks series but then hey the main character is an ex spy after all so you would expect him to know all the tricks of the trade and carry them out in styleloved it,reality
is a very good action movie but not one to be so seriously this is all for the fun and to see liam neeson kick some serious butt i went into this film not expecting anything too spectacular i was blown away within the first five minutes of the filmthis movie reminds me of james bond and jason bourne but here the action guy is much older and his mission is to go to paris to find his kidnapped daughter within a few days before she succumbs to prostitutionthe acting is very good the only well known actor here is liam neeson and he was perfect the supporting cast led by maggie grace is not that bad eitheroverall this is the perfect action movie i had a fun time watching this i cant wait to see the second one i rate this film 1010,reality
i recently watched to see what all the fuss was about and now that ive watched it i can tell why is one of the most entertaining movies ive seen in my life the only plot you need to know to have fun with this movie is this liam neeson is fighting and killing people to get his daughter back there is a lot more to it than that but think about it too hard and it wont be the entertaining movie everyone is calling it liam neeson is kinda like swarshinager in commando by that i mean that their both trying to find their daughter who has been kidnappedi enjoyed this movie and i know im not alone but it isnt perfect some parts of the film were a bit boring and tedious and i tried understanding what was going on but the plot was so confusing it lost me in a few places like i said this is entertaining just dont try to find any hidden messages,reality
this was an excellent example of how the gritty and seedy underground of how women are out of existence by slave traders liam neeson plays a retired government agent who is trained in the most prestigious and complex forms of martial arts as well as weapons trying to find his daughter who was by a group of albanians while on vacation with her best friend yet in order for him to complete his search he needs the help of a questionable french fellow agent who sits behind a desk giving liams character small clues is more than enough to find his daughter but finds out his friend is also involved but at a very small level this causes his search to escalate to disastrous results hitting small hooker barns to taking out a slave trading cell on his own leading his way to the nerve centre of the albanian source and a fat disgusting sahib who craves very young girls including his daughter who was sold for the highest price at an auction with interpol and other factions on his heels looking for him nothing gets in the way of dad and his little girls freedom from the most vile organization on earth brilliant performance from liam neeson hes even better than 007 to the point gets results and doesnt waste time with every skirt who carries a gun under her dress this is how an agent does his work,reality
was a pleasure to watch its not boring at any time its felt with action and it still have a great storyone of the better actions movies ive watchedi actually think this movie could be longerwhich i dont think at many the playtime is only 93 minutes and you arent bored at any time i gave this 610 because of the great story and action scenes because it wasnt the best movie ive ever seen it was too short imo and still not the most original storyspoiler bryans daughter got kidnapped on a trip to france with her friend amanda she is sold as a prostitute bryan is told that he got 96 hours before hes daughter is impossible to locate from here the movie is about bryans hunt after her daughteroverall great entertainment ,reality
preparing to see mel gibsons latest flick which draws plot elements from 2008s got me thinking again about liam neeson who is not the first person one thinks of as an action hero plays an aging cia spook whose daughter is kidnapped while vacationing overseas neeson immediately takes off after the bad guys and eliminates them one by one during his search the movie is satisfyingly violent although it was inexplicably trimmed for american audiences go to youtube for a much grittier and more satisfying version of the electric shock interrogation scene the fights are simply amazing and neeson looks pretty damn agile for an old hoss he also gets to beat up on bad guys of several different ethnicities including our pals from the middle east i hope the gibson flick is half as good it is rated r and one can only hope it will be a hard r if you see try to catch the european version,reality

a fathers worst nightmare is what bryan mills a former cia agent has to endure when his daughter whom he reluctantly let go on a trip to paris with her friend amanda is kidnapped right after she arrives in the city the purpose of her being away is not for ransom money it is because this girl is a young morsel for the degenerate crowd that deal in turning these naive women into prostitution and drugs for a profitdirected by pierre morel is a thriller that comes from luc besson and his factory that churns this type of entertainment for fans of this genre it is better to leave ones mind at the entrance of the cinema or in another room if it is viewed on dvd or another type of format because most of the action is incredible at best we dont mean to say the film is unwatchable for it is the kind of action film that keeps audiences riveted to the screen but alas when not even the first 30 minutes of screen time have elapsed bryan mills has disposed of a dozen men and he will get rid of many more scum bags before the flick is over why did the cia did not insist in keeping mills in its payroll is hard to imagine he is a one man invincible team in many aspects is a comic book fantasyliam neeson much leaner than he used to be appears as the hero of the story this man is so resourceful that he knows from early on because of his contacts who is behind the group that took his daughter away he is an action man when threatened in this case because the love for his only daughter mr neeson is the whole picture and he does not disappoint others in the cast include the wonderful famke janssen maggie grace and other less unknown facesthe editing by frederic thoraval needs to be mentioned because the way the action is arranged to create the immediacy and fast pacing that are necessary for a film of this genre the cinematographer michel abramowicz does a good job capturing paris especially at night pierre morel whose second venture in directing this is will go far if he chooses wisely for he can deliver a thriller like almost effortlessly,reality
i think this movie is a little but underrated this is a great actionpacked movieat first i was kind of skeptic i thought this is some poor remake of james bond even though im not the fan of the mentioned series but this movie has so much to offer the main story of the movie is realistic and may be going on somewhere as i write this really tragic but true we all know thisliam neeson was perfect for the part his character was great built i liked the cold professionalism the brutality and his nonhesitating courage hi did a great job and even his voice fitted perfectly into his partthis movie has so much surprises and nonexpecting twists i truly recommend this to all good actionthriller fans great 93 minutes of funoh and dont expect too much from holly as i expected she had nothing much to offer as an actress and her part is not important to the plot shes just there for some emotional points just to complete the story any other girl could do it so if you watch this movie pay no attention to her name in credits this movie is fantastic on itself,reality
liam neeson plays paranoid american ex security intelligence officer bryan mills divorced from wife famke jamssen but a loving and overprotective father of daughter kimwhen kim announces her intention to travel to paris all mills fears and anxieties rise to the surface but he relents and gives reluctant permission for kim to travelthe attractive kim and her travelling companion are automatic targets for the dark and swarthy types who deal in the sex trade and both are kidnapped drugged and prepared for what time remains to them for a life in brothels somewhere in the world after being auctioned off to the highest bidderkims predicament unleashes a raging torrent of revenge in mills and us relations with france are put to the test as he proceeds to leave a trail of death and destruction in his frenetic search for his daughter much of what happens is hardly credible yet enormously fastpaced and entertainingwhat you see in is what you get if you are looking for some deeper analysis of the hideous sex trade then perhaps you need to look elsewhere if you like gratuitous violence and relentless action then will probably keep you entertained for 90 mins 810,reality
i thought the movie was decent and quite entertaining however the end was disappointing and unrealistic a girl who has just been put through an ordeal like this one would not act or interact with anyone in the same manner that she did before first of all her friend is dead and yet she seems as happygolucky as ever this may be a minor detail but i thought they could have brought out some of the after effects better than they didi think this movie could have been more of a wake up call to viewers it still was about the workings of the sex trade secondly when she runs to embrace her mother with the same big childlike grin on her face it makes you stop for a minute and wonder if this is seriously how they are going to end the movie overall a good watch but it could have made a bigger and more realistic impact,reality
only begs one question why did it take producers this long to give liam neeson his own revenge thriller ok there was sam raimis darkman in 1990 a cult favorite before neeson rose to fame but the irish actor who seems to age like fine wine has dished it to baddies in 18th century scotland rob roy a galaxy far far away star wars episode i during the crusades kingdom of heaven and dare i say wwii germany so what took so long for him to be a modern day retired cia agentand neeson belong together neeson has always wellplayed the wise mentor role that draws respect from all other characters in the films hes in and the audiences hes a natural fit to play an older man still capable of laying a beat down on amoral criminals particularly of the european trash variety is a simple but genius vehicle to deliver thatwritten in part by luc besson whose films leon the professional have only gotten more commercial with age the transporter and sequels tells the simple story of former cia agent bryan mills who retires in order to make up for lost time with his 17yearold daughter kim maggie grace from early lost a relationship destroyed by bryans never being around when kim goes to spend the summer in paris her overprotective father calls her right when she gets there convenient timing considering shes about to be kidnapped bryan vows revenge on the kidnapper and flies to paris using his incredible wealth of skills to track her down and make her captors paybesson gives us another actionrevenge story motivated by love the fatherdaughter connection can never be exploited enough considering it guarantees our utmost sympathies it also makes the hardnosed dont mess with me attitude of neeson on his revenge spree all the more crucial in our minds never has a dull moment because were behind neeson 100 percent and love every move he makessure could go much deeper its sort of just assumed that part of neesons motivation is to prove to his daughter how much he cares but that never actually crosses our minds thanks to anything thats in the script or that director pierre morel does it also couldnt hurt to make bryan a bit more conflicted give us some sense that hes not exactly a paragon of justice something that would make come more from the head and a tad less from the fists instead the movie happily enjoys the fact that its plot motivation action and force of an actor in neeson will win over the audience and it definitely does,reality
i was debating whether to give this a 7 or 8 but i gave it an 8 based on how much fun it was to watch liam neeson this movie would have been nothing with anyone else in the role nothing was overtly wrong with the movie and nothing was great except neesons performance i loved story flowed a little too nicely and he got his information almost too quickly but i bought it and was easily overlooked it was interesting that i almost looked forward to neesons dialog more than his action but both complimented each other in a way you rarely ever see in action movies i honestly like luc besson probably more than i should and i will not hide that fact i do not think this is a particularly good movie but it was a lot of fun to watch at least once i may never watch this again but if it is on cable in 10 years i will probably linger,reality
this film definitely had me interested when i saw the trailer i thought that an old man kicking butt was awesome i never thought that this movie was better than james bondi also thought that the plot was good a father searching for his daughter in an international country was good but then when i learned that he knew like kung fu i was excited this film kept me interested because he went through people like cigarettes to find his daughter i saw the main actor as an old drama actor but he proved me wrong in this film when he just started beating people to a pulp asking for information i started to jump up and down this movie definitely should be a pick when you wanna watch an action film i bought this on dvd and i do not regret it i want to watch it over and over again,reality
i have to say i am in love liam neeson is god is a fairly run of the mill action movie utilizing several times the bourne method of camera work during several action scenes im sure you know but ill explain it to all the newbies out there because im that popular already shaky shaky camera cutting back and forth between whats happening seizure inducing etc liam neeson is bryan mills a retired spysecret agentwhatever goes on a kick ass rampage of anger and destruction in an effort to find his kidnapped daughter who is being sold into the sex trade its fun in the beginning seeing bryans goofy smile when he makes his daughter happy and watching him trying to be a father figure in his daughters life but that all pales when you see the transformation from bumbling dad to deathbringer 5000 the smile disappears and thats the first indication that all youre going to be seeing from him from then on is lovely facebreaking violence one problem i did have was some of the things youre expected to believe like how he was able to get the exact name and home town from a brief description by a frightened teenage girl and a few moments of albanian speech i could be wrong and this sort of thing happens all the time but it just seemed silly to me and the very end they should have just stopped but they didnt as you can tell i was attempting not to give too much away,reality
my grandson who is 12 and i watched together the special effects action and spy technology were fascinatingso much so that my grandson thinks he might like to go to military school to learn how its done the thread of tension held taut through the whole movie leaving us feeling a little drained my grandson turned to me and said wow when it ended i concuris pretty much a oneman show as liam with his always impeccable acting skills carries it though xander berkeley is good too as far as his bit part allows him to be liam makes one hell of a tough guy watching this retired preventer come out of retirement before our eyes as he hears his daughter being kidnapped was the best scene and set us up for the tension and excitement that followed its a wild rideyou wont be disappointed and will want to see the film more than once,reality
previously the only with which i was familiar was the tv miniseries executive produced by steven spielberg focusing on extraterrestrials if i had heard the plot of this movie and knew nothing else about it i would probably have assumed that it stars harrison ford what a surprise that liam neeson plays a former government agent searching for his kidnapped daughter using rather aggressive tactics seriously some of what he does just might count as torturewhat i thought early on was that the one girl did incredibly stupid things when they arrived in paris giving a bunch of information to a stranger this is only the second time that ive heard albanian spoken the first was in the inside man in which i learned how to pronounce enver hoxhas surname anyway this isnt the movie that i would recommend above all others but its ok for the length that it runs also starring famke janssen,reality
wow i was completely back ha ha by this movie it is so inspiring and the love liam nelsons character has for his daughter is breathtaking this truly is an amazing movie that was written really well there is little to no down time in this movie constant fight and a constant run to save his little girl i found this movie to be inspiring and full of action all at once he literally takes down half of paris to save his girl of course anyone would cringe watching those helpless girls be sold towards the end of the movie it was sickening to think things like this really do happen liam nelson definitely won the dad of the year award with this movie and im hoping a lot more w oscars and grammys coming up soon amazing plot and action packed,reality
an exgovernment preventer bryan mills is trying to gain a real relationship with his estranged daughter after 17 years of being caught in his work his exwife is left bitter to him because of his devotion to his job and she is on her daughters side as she wanted to tour europe with a friend bryan reluctantly allows her to go his daughter and her friend misplace their trust in one man and it leads to their capture now bryan is determined to get her back good luck to those who took herliam neeson does a fantastic job as bryan he portrays a worried and hellbent father brilliantly others in the film do a great job as well maggie grace surprising performance as kim is well done solid script flushes out everybody that needs to bethe story is told realistically without being gratuitous it moves at a quick but smart pace and keeps the audience interested the action is choreographed fast and brutal throat punches and pistol whips gun shots and neck snaps have never been so palpable in a filmthe emotion is just as effective while its not as much part of the appeal of the movie it is not at all ignored desperation from both parents is touching and i challenge anybody to not feel a wrench in their stomach at seeing the confused and forced drugaddicted women that the trafficers have again these images are gritty and depressing without being over the topgreat film i highly recommend it 810,reality
i have to start with a review of the movie in a magazine empire which gave this movie a real rating the reason for that was the fact that the movie shows europe in a dark light and if you would actually take the whole thing seriously you could accuse the movie of being xenophobic or should that read europhobic  but thats missing the pointthe movie is there to entertain and not to warn americans to stay in america and take their vacations there which the review also stated entertain might seem a bit of a stretch if you have seen the movie but i do stand by that after a slow start the pace picks up and there is almost no stop until the endthe movie is pretty intense but it is completely justifiable and it does stay true to itself which makes it a lot better than recent efforts brave one death sentence in that same or similar fashion,reality
 wherein a repentant father played by liam neeson is now trying to be involved in his daughters life after many years of working as a kind of fixer in various shadowy government agencies  is abruptly forced to draw upon his numerous talents that generally involve very efficiently killing people when that daughter is by albanian flesh merchants at the beginning of her trip to parismight be considered a revenge fetishists delight but it is also something relatable to fathers and moms too who would not hesitate at all to do anything that was required to save their children though i clearly lack the handtohand combat skills neeson portrays in as a father of three daughters i can quite easily relate to the drive and determination to do whatever it takes no matter what to go and save his daughter before she is literally lost forever to a perverse underworld of wellheeled creepy sheikhsbreakneckpaced from starttofinish does not let down in the action and violence department neeson leaves many bodies in his wake as he tears literally through paris to get to the men who took his daughter brutal and decisive neeson is a machine nearly maniacal in his singleminded pursuit to get to his daughter no matter the coststylish and pretty though somewhat muted more real according to the extras on the dvd paris is the beautiful backdrop to the horrific underworld enterprise goings on penned by the great french auteur luc besson and helmed by a french director phillip morel the film does have a certain foreign feel and in fact was released in france before the us morels history as a director of photography also gives the visuals their refined but also slightly gritty rainslicked feelwhile stylish and essentially perfectly composed as an action movie has no great message other than to say dont mess with my daughter pal it might serve to make us dads feel quite inadequate as protectors of our children dont know about you but i wouldnt feel comfortable stepping into a room of 7 albanian criminals and waxing them all in two moves id be dead meatregardless is quite enjoyable a fullthroated action film and wonderful to watch liam neeson in action,reality
is a fast paced well designed and choreographed action thriller that details the return to duty of an intelligence man whose career distanced him from his family when his own daughter falls victim to the crime syndicate in paris the driver of this well written luc besson and robert mark kamen well directed pierre morel film is the nonstop violence filled mission of a desperate father whose skills at getting to the heart of a matter have not been diminished by his early retirement liam neeson is in grand form as bryan mills the skilled and committed father who can out kill and out wit even the most vicious of the albanian forces against whom he must struggle to save his kidnapped daughter from being sold into human slavery to an arab sheik the film moves so rapidly with the skills of cinematographer michel abramowicz that the various other characters who populate this drama scarcely have time to establish an identity famke janssen radivoje bukvic maggie grace et al the violence is constant but due to bryan mills skills each death is so rapid that the camera doesnt linger there are scenes in the brothels where the drug induced young girls serve as prostitutes that are quite disturbing but again the camera doesnt pause long enough to make them gruesome this is a fine performance by liam neeson who demonstrates a mastery of the action roles that likely will lead to others in a similar vein it is a wild ride but a very fine one grady harp,reality
very pleasantly surprised at this 1 rental i really knew absolutely nothing about it prior to renting but while watching it i distinctly felt similarities to the professional leon and while totally different in plot indeed it is another luc besson written filmliam neeson was excellent as a father who was ill at ease in normal society but who was very comfortable when plying his trade the supporting cast was completely up to the task but it was neesons embodiment of bessons central character which made the film the action was mostly believable and almost nonstopi feel that while it was not quite on the level of the fifth element or the professional it was far better than any of the transporter trilogy and that luc besson has somehow found his center again may he continue on around there forever,reality
liam neeson joins the long list of stars who become lone action heroes rescuing a family member what makes this film different is the running time of 91 minutes  this includes 6 minutes of creditscredit this to the taut direction of pierre morell  the skillful writing of luc bresson well known for this type screenplay and robert mark kamenthe above knew they had a very improbable script  they very wisely made the film run so fast the audience had no time to realize how idiotic  improbable the script was a few good fight scenes  2 great car chases helpedliam neeson is first rate as an exciatype employee rescuing his just kidnapped 17 year old daughter from being sold he is a one man armyhe has the charm to pull this offi think he would have been a superb james bondi am unfamiliar with the rest of the castthey all perform well the production is first ratethe movie was a success in its theatrical run deservedly sodo not expect anything great it is fast furious action packed fun he kills all the bad guys  thats the way i like my heroesratings  out of 4 85 pointsout of 100 imdb 8 out of 10,reality
i wont take anything away from the actionpacked goodness of no pun intended this movie is right up there with under siege and no way out in terms of oldfashioned buttkicking but the plot please girl wants to go to europe father exmercenary is worried off his rocker girl goes anyway first person she speaks to turns out to be a human trafficker and the girl gets sold into bondage father of course tracks down said trafficker and all his employers right up to the top and gets daughter back any of us who have been to the continent will see this film as another ridiculous hollywood example of how life in europe really is does human trafficking go on of course and that is sad but what are the chances that this girl gets kidnapped out of the millionorso tourists traveling europe at any given moment it was a little dumb they should have had the father not even know his kid was going that would have made it a little more believablei also loved how liam neeson kills hundreds of people burns up building blows up boats etc and he returns to the states untouched to reunite his kid with her mother what all in all a nice little action movie but only as believable as ahhnolds commando 6 out of 10 kids,reality
is a masterfully directed superbly acted actionthriller which features an aged liam neeson as retired handler bryan mills and maggie grace as his daughter in distress the cast is rounded out well featuring a particularly strong supporting turn by famke janssenoriginally posing as an almostinnocent family drama quickly takes a turn for the nightmarish when kim the daughter is ripped from her idyllic paris vacation and smuggled into its seedy criminal underbellywhat follows is a magnificently filmed romp through paris and parts unknown as neesons character returns from his retirement in a decisively violent way upholding his pledge that he will find those who have his daughter and he will kill themthe writing is fastpaced the dialogue crisp and believable the music is perfect in setting the atmosphere of any given moment the cinematography is fresh and exciting in essence it is a cinematic slam dunk which should be used as a benchmark from which to judge others of its genre,reality
this is pretty good action movie unlike many other its kind you really cant feel the hero would overreact personally i really dont like abuse of women and move shows some gruesome scenes of it which make me actually glad of the body countusually i dislike the high body count because it has flimsy excuses for sake of just killing but in this case i could actually believe character liam nelson played would act so and very few people would object to itevery father worries for his daughter and in that respect i found liams actions actually believablethere are some ackward moments in the film like others have noted like when the main character portrays himself as french official and starts to talk to albanian criminals about satellites who see and hear everything  in plain english next he asks things he should know either by being person he portrays or what he should know if the satellites really see and hear everything also in few scenes i think more people would have come to arrest main characters he seems to occasionally have aura of untouchablitybut these are minor flaws lot of action films have lot more blatant and less subtle errors at least in this movie each car that crashes somewhere doesnt blow up automaticallywhat bit ruined me it all was the end of the movie i can understand that people recover fast but i found it bit implausible that the daughter returns to childhood dreams enthuastically despite her best friend got killed and she herself kidnapped drugged and almost rapedafter seen the body count and surroundings it didnt feel plausibleoverall i think liam neelson played his part very well but the script was bit oversimplified in some parts which left him look bit stupid i think his character needed bit more depth in the father daughter relationbut he was very believable action person really refreshing to see something not so overblown as in many hollywood films,reality
this movie successfully fills that bourne void that ive been feeling lately is about what an exspy has to go through to rescue his kidnapped daughter it shows an extremist point of view through the eyes of bryan mills liam neeson as he kicks punches and shoots his way through paris for a 90 minute movie it starts packing a punch after the first 15 minutes character development was straight forward and digs deep enough to know the current situation between bryan mills and his exwife and estranged daughter in the beginning i almost thought the story was going on a tangent into unnecessary territory with that pop singers body guard ordeal i start thinking to myself when is liam neeson going to start kicking butt but when it started to get good it got great the action scenes are an adrenaline rush that emanates the spirit of the bournetrilogy except that this one is more emotional and personal it was fun to see liam neeson muscle and interrogate his way through the airport the construction site the hideout the fancy party and the yacht all the fights and shootouts were quick that escape scene when liam neeson was tied to an overhead lead pipe was a bit clichd but it didnt ruin the fun ride i said to myself yeah liam beat the sh out of them psychologically it shows what extreme methods someone has to go through to save their loved ones even it means threatening and shooting innocent people but it was only a flesh woundoverall i recommend this movie thats unless youre associated with the french police this wasnt a positive portrayal of the french government,reality
dir pierre morel 2009  a mindless little thriller but entertaining in its own right it features liam neeson good to see him back in leading film roles as an ex cia agent neeson daughter is kidnapped whilst vacationing with a friend in france and it falls to neeson to get her back the films best scene comes early with neeson addressing the kidnappers over the phone and warning them that they are unaware of with whom they are messing he of course phrases it differently and speaks with a steely reserve that is quite effective neeson is very good but overall is too mindless to violent and too xenophobic to truly recommend,reality
this action thriller was so good i actually looked up my forgotten imdb password in order to give it a 910 ratingscrew bourne and bond this film put them to sleep hands downi admit that the beginning of the film was somewhat boring and predictable but hell after her daughter was adopted it was none stop actionif you are looking for action gun fire and nodragging fighting scene come on some of boneds fighting scenes put me to sleep if i want to watch a realistic fight id watch mmaif you like bourne series or bond series watch this you wont regret it,reality
grab a dramatic storyline  some awesome action sequences and a determined father played only as liam neeson could and you have it really is a great moviethe film follows bryan ex  spy he has moved to los angeles to be closer to his daughter he has some lost time to make up for but when his daughterkim goes on a trip abroad to paris and is kidnapped by professionals who steal young girls and force them into the sexslave trade he takes on a new objective to get his daughter backthis film is straight to the point there is no messing about and it really lets you know that bryan knows exactly what hes doing he knows what to do instantlyneeson is brilliant as bryan in the film and to be honest really makes the film what it is with some outstanding hand to hand combat and awesome kick ass dialogue this could well be one of neesons finest moments on the screenthe film is very realistic and very gritty its not afraid to go right out and show you how real this situation is with plenty of guts and blood it will satisfy anyone who is a fan of the action genre and at the same time it creates the perfect blend of action to drama and will satisfy anyone who loves there films with a bit of drama i guess you could say its a thrillerthe settings are all spot on and really captures the gloomy rough terrains of paris in comparison to the sunshine state that is california this really makes it stand out that they are not at homeits like a ticking bomb throughout it puts you into the film every minute that goes by is a minute closer to something happening to kim and the difference between bryan either finding or not finding his daughter before its too late you really are on the edge of your seat throughout and you dont move from there until the credits role the film is so unpredictable and you dont see anything coming it has to be one of the fastest paced action movies or movies for that natter that i have ever seen and i loved itit doesnt ever get boring or drag on in fact its bad that it had to end it keeps it short and sweetoverall it has to be one of the best films ive seen in quite a while and definitely one of my favourite action moviesa solid 910 from me,reality
to get right down to it is a very gratifying film in terms of action liam neeson does the job of portraying his role of the father well enough and the movie gives just enough background for the audience to care about him his daughter not so much more importantly he executes the fighting sequences very professionally and realistically although his character does go overboard a tad but the viewers will not be disappointed as all the purveyors of the disgusting illegal trade of peddling drugged up prostitutes do get their comeuppance at least the ones that neeson encounters luc besson the fifth element and pierre morel unleashed show that they are established flashy film makers who know how to entertain right when they work togetheryes there are problems such as the acting at the end where the daughter does not show her gratification enough one other reviewer mentions this as well as the effects of the horribleness that she has gone through and the fact that she can go from really drugged up to lucid in the span of 15 minutes there are also loose ends of the politics and consequences for what neesons character did but that would make the movie longer and less of what its supposed to be a satisfying fastpaced vengeance of a bad ass father totally focused on saving his daughter from the worst circumstances for a girli feel like an old man for saying this but i hope teens as well as the parents learn something about life not being a party all the time and responsibility as a parent respectively,reality
the premise of seems like a pretty standard kidnapping thriller what elevates this film is a brilliant liam neeson who portrays an exblack ops or cia agent its never really clear struggling to connect with his teenage daughter and the emasculation of retirement when his daughter goes missing on a trip to europe he gets a chance to kick some ass again but thats not the point of the story neesons performance is fueled by desperation every minute hes delayed he could lose his daughter to the european sextrafficking circuit its this sense of urgency that drives this film forward and twists the viewers stomach in knots thats not to say the film doesnt provide some truly exciting action sequences and there are some great visceral moments when neeson takes on the bad guys but what makes this film truly stand out is its heart thank luc besson who wrote the script for injecting some humanity into all the thrills his writing coupled with neesons performance combined with a very timely subject matter human trafficking and you have the makings of a great thriller,reality
i did see this movie on opening weekend but i have not gotten the chance to sit down and write my review for it now that i finally have the chance here it goes i wont bother in mentioning the plot for the trailers show plenty of it but not necessarily all of it this movie is an action flick and i love action but that is not the main reason why i enjoyed itover the years i have seen liam neeson in many movies and even if the film is horrible he makes something out of it he gives an exceptional performance his role his rather unique because im not used to him as a leading action hero nonetheless he pulls it off and adds both humane and grim layers to his character which i love youll see what i mean by this when you watch the film the rest of the movie is solid ranging from the excellent car and onfoot pursuits to the gun battles handtohand combat and the interesting plots and surprising emotional impact its good but liam is the driving force i rooted for him throughout the movie overall rating  out of ,reality
this is a pure adrenaline rush of a movie non stop with a disturbingly relevant premise to todays world it can make difficult viewing at timesliam neeson certainly plays the part as a man on a single minded mission focused purely on one thing and one thing onlyto get his daughter backshe and her friend are very quickly targeted by sex traffickers on their arrival in gay paris and from that point on this is all about track and revenge and boy does neeson take his revengeok some of the sequences do become a little bit over the top but right to the end your still asking yourself if his daughter is alive and intacti have to describe this movie as harsh the premise about young girls being forced into prostitution is far too relevant in todays society to make this a simple action movie therefore it is very difficult to class as entertainment seeing as there is some social commentary involvedthat aside though this is a solid film and one that will keep your insides twisted right till the end,reality
probably one of the best movies in awhile and certainly the best action movie in a year or two is a lean and exhilarating movie that sets itself up very well liam neeson is first rate and mostly believable as preventor mills director pierre morel sets up the characters and situation with the right amount of time depth and history to give us something to latch on to then the movie launches and it really launches its going full speed for at least 50 min or 23 of its runtime the action and fight scenes rival the best of todays movies including bourne and james bond spoiler you have to suspend belief a little bit with a late 50s neeson taking on 8 younger men in a room but thats about where it ends has great focus and direction and is a highly effective action movie one of the best in recent memory recommended,reality
in a nonstop hunt to rescue his beloved daughter from kidnappers liam neeson kills maims chases and drives cars in this relentless actionthriller set predominantly in parishas a familiar feel to that of the jason bourne films except this is more direct and easierto follow plot which does not tarnish the film i cannot fault the entertainment value and the intrigue that the screenplay creates but it is hampered like many such films by fortuitous events which frustrates me personallyliam neeson impresses as the excia agent and i never for one moment thought that he was not a viable operative he gives a heartfelt and understandable desperate feel to his character with a real emotive punch for me the best moment in the film was the actual kidnapping it was excellently crafted and the interplay between neeson and maggie grace on the phone prior to her being is perfectly pitched and brings great tensionis an entertaining film which does not tire the actual premise is hard to come to terms with as it feels rather strained and events unfold regrettably with too much fortune for the protagonist but is a thriller to enjoy and to be gripped by,reality
amazing moviewhich holds you to the edge of your seat till the end neeson plays a retired central intelligence agency operative who sets about tracking down his teenage daughter after she is kidnapped by slave traders while traveling in europe i know there are few holes in the script but you wont mind it as the fast paced story line progresses you will find yourself involved in the amazing action and thrill undoubtly this is better than what youd expect it kind of reminded me of james bond and bourne but its different in its own way this is how the movies should made the things which were highly important in this kind of storyline were there in the movie that made movie much faster and entertaining good editing indeed  in the end a must see,reality
i really didnt know what to expect going to see was it a drama or suspense thriller was it a pseudo action flick along the same vein as mel gibsons ransom i was pleasantly surprised that there was nothing pseudo about this film is a stone cold action flick with a captivating story that actually has some meat behind it but a straight forward kickbutt action hero kicking butt and taking names to get back his daughter comparisons to the bourne films are not unfounded the film goes from the us through the seedy underbelly of europe the film has a serious enough message about human trafficking but still has this mainstream story about a father searching for his daughter and as he says in one of my favorite lines he has a certain set of skills that makes him a nightmare for people like you the story manages to develop the main character and what he can do without actually ever showing him in his prime instead they introduce him through a bodyguard job and other small hints that he is a killer and very good at what he does unlike other action films or heroes they dont try to introduce us by giving us a big back story the film focuses on the task at end and is non stop actionive never been a huge fan of liam neeson hes okay but never really impressed me that all changed watching him lead this film liam neeson is incredible as the father who will stop at nothing to save his daughter hes brooding and powerful and is just flawless at the combat and the action scenes he does a great job maggie grace plays neesons daughter who is by traffickers she certainly appears younger than what she is but she doesnt a decent enough job her and neeson have good chemistry as father and daughter famke janssen takes a huge back seat role as graces mother and neesons estranged wife she barely has any lines and hardly shares screen time while the rest of the cast are just barely supporting none of them really stand out i mean they all do a fine job but neeson really shines and heads this film up so well that no one stands out above him and no one stands against himalthough a brilliant cinematographer and having worked on many great action films french director pierre morel hasnt had a lot of directing experience but it is clear that he has had some great mentors likely including luc besson who is a brilliant director writer and film maker regardless morel has a flare and style all his own and really handled the film well is a rare gem in action films because i dont think anyone sees it coming its an action thrill ride with heart and will entertain even the staunchest of critics 8510,reality
this was the best mix of actionsuspense i have seen in a long time liam neeson is phenomenal in this movie his dialog delivery is awesome when he calmly tells the kidnapper of his daughter that he will find him and kill him there was no reason not to believe him but without a doubt the absolute best thing about this movie was that neeson was not a typical hollywood hero or good guy never once did he stand over a helpless antagonist and magnanimously i wont kill you that would make me as bad as you he kills them alright he shoots them in the back and tortures them to death to extract information something i would expect the loving father of a kidnapped daughter to dothe only fauxpas by the film was casting a 25 year old maggie grace as a 17 year old girl her running around prancing in teenager dresses and affecting a fake case of pigeon toes was kind of disturbingbut overall one of the best films ive seen in recent years,reality
this is not an 80 movie the writing was horrible it was if they just took the first draft of the script and said eh good enough letz shoot it no the first 15 minutes were so sappyclich it was frightening you could even tell that liam did not believe what he was saying it almost looked like he was trying not to laugh at how stupid it wasthe paris part was mostly good but very unrealistic of course how are all these people so bad at shooting guns seriously it was worse than most action films in that respect machine guns at point blank range miss our hero over and over really really sillyif someone actually wants to see how eastern european or balkan mobs work see eastern promises once you watch that film youll find the structure of the albanians in this film laughablebut besides those short comings it was an entertaining action filmps  maybe its just the american in me but shooting people in the back as they are running away even bad guys is not what a hero does but it happens many times in this film,reality
so i went to see this movie with my friend hearing beforehand that it was going to be more than any other action movie so true this movie takes action sauce and pours in a dash of real drama and a glob of rough trueworld topic there are scenes that you will watch and burn with rage at the appalling business that the antagonists are engaged in your eyes will widen and your spine will chill faster than you thought possible at the actions thrills and surprisesi had some issues with this movie though the cinematography is not up to par with many movies ive seen there are several action scenes that are missing a huge chunk of quality pierre morel fails to take advantage of the cameras ability to enhance the emotion and give the audience a blowaway experience he makes the same mistake with the editing and the sound mixing timing kills certain pieces of the movie that could have turned out incrediblei will admit though neeson does a darn good job with his character in this film his character is both brutal and loving a hardtrained killer spy and a real genuine father at the same time something i have barely ever seen from any other actor in any other moviego see this for the subject matter and the acting despite its lack of effective film technique it is still very worth watching,reality
i went to this movie after not even seeing the trailer before i was invited to go with a bunch of friends so it wasnt the kind of movie i normally watch im more of a chickflick kinda girl but i was so into it the whole time i was watching it the beginning is just like any other movie slow enough to introduce the characters then the action begins and i swear i didnt blink the entire rest of the movie i was glued to the screen unlike most of the movies ive seen recently someone else compared it to the borne series and i kinda agree with that it has the same kinda fast paced action that is totally addictive when it ended i couldnt believe i was in there for 15 hours or however long it is in the entire movie i wasnt even tempted to look at my watch and see how much longer it was gonna be another reason i liked it was that everything i wanted to happen happened unlike a lot of movies where you wish something should or shouldnt have happened sooner or later than it did all in all a great movie,reality
liam neeson in an action role he is not the actor youd instantly cast but its done so well neeson plays bryan a retired preventer of bad things from this movie we learn that being the preventer of bad things means being able to beat this shite out of anyone in under 10 seconds but when bryans daughter is kidnapped bryan is forced out of retirementits not a new idea but the way its executed is the way the plot develops and how the characters grow is the appeal of the movie we really want bryan to succeed but at the same time we have doubts as to his brutal methods is it right that he tortures a bad guy who is absolutely terrified as bryans daughter is kidnapped we are shown an extremely powerful scene i wont spoil it for you but its easily one of the best in cinemaas bryan rips through paris he takes out bad guys in extremely realistic fashion there are no fancy kicks or drawn out fights bryan uses logical attacks  hit the throat or head until they stop movinghaving said that there is one lengthy fight there is one guy in the entire film that lasts more than 20 seconds against bryan it works so well because when half a minute has passed were thinking ermok liam hurry up the result is an edgeofyourseat battle with hardcore moves does bryan survive the fight thats the question i was dying to find out throughout and more importantly  will he save his daughter all in all is an actionfilled thriller with very strong emotion and powerful themes coupled with incredible acting and beautiful direction a mustsee for any thriller fans whether youre into action or not,reality
oh my god youre so fking rightjust finished and cant stop shaking i love luc besson and i fking love liam neesonunbelievable strong movie especially if youre in for justice and revenge which i admit i am absolutelyits funny last night i watched eagle eye which was a very solid action flick and i tough it couldnt get faster and more action packed but boy i was wrong this movie is on par with milestones like die hard and alike especially the second halfand i thank luc for keeping a very rough cold style because in much movies i think what would have i done in this situation and often the actors and my theoretical acting differ quite a bit but luc and neeson form an extremely professional and skilled agent who for the first time really does what i would dodid i tell you i love this movie because i love it and i will definitely watch it again in cinema which usually dont ever doi thank everyone involved in this movie for forming it the way it is thank you,reality
once two american girls are kidnapped in france a retired government agent and father of one of the kidnapped girls sets out to try and find them wreaking havoc and taking care of anyone who tries to stop himis a fast paced action thriller that probably offers nothing new but in very few of these action films do you get a lead actor that can portray a character that you actually end up cheering for liam neeson plays the role of a man on a mission to rescue his daughter to perfection hes intense and you can tell by the way he looks at a lot of the other characters that hell ring their necks in a split second if they so much as look at him the wrong way unlike other action stars like steven seagal for one who is always so calm and collected and doesnt show the type of desperation of a man determined to find his daughter watch belly of the beast if you want to know what im talking about and whose characters are actually very uninteresting because he plays them exactly the same every time id reckon that liam neeson could give seagal a few acting tips and kick his ass with little effortall in all a good fast paced action thriller that delivers the goods and is also carried with ease by liam neesons excellent performance in the lead role,reality
was a great action packed movie that was the first movie i had seen in a theater in ages it was so worth it on the edge of your chair entertainmentliam neeson was superb i doubt anyone else could have pulled off the character portrayal as he did he is so cool and calm that is what made it such a great moviewas not familiar with any of the other stars in the movie however they were goodi recommend the movie for anyone who is interested in a total action packed thriller,reality
i tried to like this film and at times i did it has some great moments overall its a pretty good action picture despite what i call the rambo plot one make takes on the world  and wins its certainly an exciting edgeofyourseat nailbiter buti have traveled to paris with my sister and as soon as the girls went looking for cabs i said to myself no you dont just hop in a cab with a cute stranger in fact you should have reserved a shuttle and had it waiting for you it kind of bugged me that the girls mother or stepfather himself a world traveler hadnt thought of doing that combine that with her friend being a complete airhead and they didnt stand a chance i thought theyd at least make it to the party the cute guy from the cab had invited them to before they got nabbed enter liam neeson great actor does a good job with the material hes given and is very convincing but after he found the bad guys in record time and had escaped being killed run off the road arrested beaten up or otherwise stopped for about the 4th or so time i could no longer suspend disbelief at the incredible luck he had yes we want him to win and the bad guys to pay but come on virtually no setbacks from start to finish no ones that luckyfor what it was it was a pretty good ride but if you want to see an action movie with a whole lot more i would recommend gran torino,reality
there has been a lot of talk saying is a heart poundingadrenaline rushing must see movie there is nothing great about this movie there was corny action scenes like when the main character does ten flips down a hill with a jeep and drives off like nothing happened the humor was ok could have been more and not the greatest acting and dialog the plot of the movie was totally away from another movie where people kidnap women who have just crossed the border turn them into prostitutes and sell them to rich perves the only thing they changed with the movie from the other was putting action scenes in it that werent that great at all the only reason i gave this movie a 5 was because i felt bad for the producers for wasting their time making this movie,reality
lots of spoilers i must have seen the previews for between tv programs several timesweek and it was beginning to get really irritating however there was something about the vigilante plot that made me want to see it started out a bit slow with the background of the family  liam was the dad who quit his secret service job to get closer to his daughter whom he rarely saw because of his job his exwife remarried an ubra rich guy who upstages him at his daughters 17th birthday by giving her an incredibly beautiful horse liam brought a karaoke machine this all wraps up nicely in the end  i wont give it all away so the daughter decides to go to paris with a friend pretending to stay at a cousins place with auntuncle who of course arent in paris  they took a trip somewhere else so the two girls land in paris and are immediately hit on by a cute boy who shares a cab with them checks out their place and calls in their location and that theyre aloneto a ring of international human trafficers the two girls are typical teenagers their first time away from home  freedom clouds judgment  taking rides from strangers in a foreign country  in which neither could speak the language bragging theyre alone bragging the whole 5th floor is theirs and they want to party good lord write stupid on their foreheads and send in jason friday the 13th thats where the previews begin  but nothing could prepare me for liams strength and drive at finding his daughter no jedi tricks here  this guy does not fool around chatting or providing background for the audience who might have dozed off and forgotten the plot he goes right for the information  and kills anyone in the way  right away  no time for them to plead for their lives or james bond their way out of his clutches liams takes the shot  every time it feels good  these guys are scum of the scum gives the audience what they dont get in real life  quick justice for creeps another chance for parents who should be more careful in sending their kids off places unsupervised  just because other parents arent taking the time to make sure the is are dotted and ts crossed for teenage journeys the films wraps up really nicely too the introduction into liams type of job at the very beginning of the movie comes in again at the end  like the stuffed bear ryan brings back for his daughter in red october great directing  action shots are incredibly well done ala die hard and bourne pace is fast steady but with a breath here and there so youre not exhausted by the end of the movie i havent seen a good action movie like this since live free or die hard this is a good one dont miss it  in the theater,reality
if youre an indian or have seen a good number of recent indian movies the story of the film will not be new to you its about a former cia operative liam neeson whose daughter is kidnapped when shes on a tour of europe in paris the kidnappers are part of a notorious group of albanian sex traffickers and neeson has just three days before she is sold to somebodythis film has a good blend of action and sentiment the tempo of the film is really fast there are a few highspeed fight scenes that keep you on the edge of your seats especially the ones during the last 20 min of the film overall i would give it a 7510,reality
looked up the rating at imdb just before seeing this movie and i was pretty much surprised by the 80 i was seeing om my screen for some reason i never heard before of this movie so i did not have any expectations or whatsoeverand what pleasant surprise this movie was the storyline which reminded me of man on fire is all about bryan mills daughter being kidnapped in paris and him getting her back the kidnap turns out to be a bad move for the kidnapper because bryan mills used to be spy or something like that in the old days and still has some skills up his sleeve by the way the fact you dont exactly are told what he used to be is a good example of how the characters in this movie are kept flat which for a change is a good thing apart from some less meaningful scenes about divorced parents and the resulting motherfatherchild relations you will not find any distracting personal blabla in this movie heck you even better could watch the latest james bond if you want thatjust as in man on fire this action movie does not make any concessions it is very right up your face for example when bryan quite brutally interrogates an albanian partner of the kidnappers he tortures him by electrifying him when he gets his answers he does not just walk away no he walks away while switching the power back on again another method but quite comparative to the situation in man on fire where denzel washington puts a bomb in the bad guys ass gets his answers and still lets the bomb explode however where man on fire was just raw the action scenes in are much more polished and that is exactly where the comparison with the bourne movies comes in the hand to hand combat scenes are just as in the bourne movies very fast and technical and filmed in the same way the same goes for the scar chase scenesraw action movies like these are quite rare which in my opinion is a shame is not a brilliant movie therefore it is to short and to simple but on the other hand both the simplicity and shortness make the movie such a rush in my opinion a well deserved 8,reality
the incredible invincible liam enters and do away everyone standing in his path of saving his beloved daughternoticing the writer of the movie no one could hesitate about watching a wellmade action that amuses you during the whole movietime writer of famous works like the professional nikitataxi and morerecent films like transporter series and b13 has gained some fame for himself as an thrillermaking writer and director with this information i was sure i would not regret spending time for his newlymade movie the which is directed by pierre morel the man behind b13 which was a fascinating french movie of 2004 like b13 has a fast rhythm which has helped its director to show lots of actions and beating up and chasing scenes and as i expected hes done it absolutely right morel knows the principles of an action movie that holds the audience spellbound during the movie time unlike b13 here we are facing with a superstar who clearly knows what hes doing liam neeson has done a wonderful job as a father of a 17 years old girl one that despite being separated from his family loves his daughter very much and would do everything he could do for her best the relation between father and his child is quite believable and turns up as one of the brightest aspects of the film this helps the whole brians devoting thing to the end of the movies very rational i suppose if it was a drama movie it could bring tears to audiences eyes because of the right chemistry of characters and the whole acting things to sum up i enjoyed this movie a lot because of its strong screenplay and also the actors acting and above of all the directing of this movie,reality
i hadnt been to a movie theater for years but i dont think that alone explains why i enjoyed as much as i did the story is very appealing in this day wherein bad guys are worse than ever and the rest of us are proportionately more abused going in we know the bad guys are really in for it this time though this one does not fall into the category strictly there are too few revenge movies to be hadliam neeson displays true acting flexibility and is one of the best heroes of the genre ive ever seen and i grew up with connerybond indeed during some of the action sequences i couldnt help considering that except for a kind of lurching instead of suaveness neeson could make the ideal bondthe action direction is good but the dysfunctional interaction in the protagonists family felt shallow to mewhich of course doesnt matterand the suspension of disbelief fails at times a machine gun just doesnt miss that much at close range the movie doesnt aim to win awards just to be entertaining and it succeedsfinally maggie grace is remarkably convincing as a seventeen year old despite being twentysix,reality
first things first i came into this movie with no expectations it was simply a last minute recommendation from a friendpros great production quality the action scenes were well choreographed car scenes werent too laden with special fx and the lighting of the film was really superb to boot the storyline was pretty convincing and the thematic content was quite serious it was nice to see an emotional character written with a certain coldbloodedness that is usually glossed over for fear of alienating the audience oddly enough that brings me to my next pointcons gratuitous carnage probably about 10 coldblooded murders with another 3040 other slaughters i dont mind a bit of death but this was over the top its foolish to assume that simply filming lots and lots of murder scenes will help a movie compete with other studio action films violence can be artfully and thoughtfully woven into a film but that definitely did not occur herethe ending was also a fairly big letdown but at that point it felt like the film just wantedneeded to wrap up quickly  it was getting a bit tiredall in all a fairly decent film definitely a solid rental it would have been eerily spectacular if it had been directed by david cronenburg a director whos understanding of violence and the more disturbing parts of the human psyche would have made this story pop,reality

besson and morel did a fine job when you finally unwrap this american action movie you see the joke is us it is apparent to me that to protect your brainless daughter from perils of europe one has to be a coldblooded killer once the spoiled brat boards the plane at lax you should start dusting off those old skills torture gun play reckless driving handtohand combat get ready to go on remorseless killing spree because the seventeenyearold blond sure is worth it it does not matter a bit that the focus of parental affection displays total disregard for you lie in your face ignore your advice practically beg for trouble does not matter honey we love you we will torture and kill anybody who mean you harm because you are special you are going to be a singer this movie gained a lot from casting liam neeson fine actor is able to push the right buttons so viewers are cheering at the carnage alas at the end of the day the question creeps in what if the bimbos destiny was in fact to be drugaddicted sexslave after all she looks good in the veil and nothing else in the movie suggests she has other talents well done tongueincheek job mr besson,reality
intentionally or not 2008 is essentially an a remake of a 1986 b picture jake speed in both pictures two young women visiting paris are kidnapped by slavers in both pictures a larger than life hero pursues the villains and in both pictures one woman is saved but the other is notin the earlier film jake the hero may in fact be a superhero although that possibility is never answered and jakes pursuit also takes him into africa for most of the picture but otherwise both plots are pretty much the samedoes however have a faster pace a more unified setting and in general better acting,reality
mr peter morel you have picked an express train to latch on togood for you something about luc besson just works every single time im sad that his declaration of being finished with the directors chair may be true however his scripts are mounting and churning out entertaining action flicks if you can get the transporter series to make money from its wit and smart action you know you are doing something right ive yet to see these two guys first collaboration district b13 but as far as the sophomore effort goes i have one more reason to finally seek it out released in europe last year and finally making its way stateside at the end of january the tale pits a retired us government preventer with the albanian captors that stole his daughter in paris his job ruined his marriage strained the relationship he had with his child yet gave him the specific skill set to get it all back all he has to do is kick some butt kill numerous baddies without a glimpse of remorse and call in a few favors while burning some old bridges in the process liam neeson shows the physicality that george lucas must have seen when casting him as a jedi warrior but didnt utilize well morel sure opened the floodgates and neeson does not disappointthe european flair shows face right at the start with the films opening credits sure the star gets top billing but who do you ask gets second and third thats right the director and writers then followed by the title someone understands the true creativity behind a feature film well not just someone a continent whereas we in the states only care about who we seedoesnt that new brad pitt film look awesome oh i dont know i kind of wanted to check out the latest from paul thomas anderson whocinephiles abroad know the creators the orchestrators and the people for whom thered be no words for pitt to speak its a shame that the name luc besson wont fill the seats by itself here in america because im sure if you mention a lot of his filmography to a film fan and ask what they all have in common the answer would be all films i really enjoy and yet the person answering probably has no idea what the common factor is allowing them to be suchshot with a kinetic pace not quite tony scott speed as my friend suggested more bourne supremacy but even a bit clearer than that the action excites at every turn neeson is a man on a mission a man with everything on the line to find and save his daughter before the estimated 96 hours are up and she is lost forever sold on the black market to be used abused and most likely disposed friends enemies strangers you name it they are all potential targets to be shot at neesons bryan mills is the ultimate badass working from his heartusing his head but only to survive not to censor his actions so as to stay out of trouble he gave it all up to rekindle a relationship with his seventeen year old yet im sure never thought that the only way to do so would be to use all that training the flip remark from leland orser calling him rambo is more appropriate than you may thinkthe supporting cast is definitely a necessity to keep the plot moving but in the end its all about neeson moving forward and bullrushing his way through extras maggie grace can sadly get very tired but i dont fault her as much as casting she is a 26year old playing 17 so her overly annoying girlish tendencies are overblown because she is overcompensating for the age difference famke janssen and xander berkler two favorite character actors of mine are solid in small roles while my favorite supporter is olivier rabourdins jeanclaude playing a french internal government agent an exassociate of neeson he portrays the duality of wanting to help his friend while still keeping his job and financial influx intact he knows that whatever is uncovered in the oneman vigilante escapade could potentially harm his paycheck by exposing illegal dealings with criminals on the part of the police force so he is never completely open and that guardedness leads to a fantastic dinner sceneis actionpacked and a great showcase of liam neesons ability to break out of the mildmannered brit he sometimes gets relegated into playing no one is safe from his wrath and no obstacle will get in his way in fact those obstructions actually help him hide and kill with even more accuracy and safety besson also keeps his streak going of highly entertaining scripts helping to launch the careers of frenchmenlouis letterier going from danny the dog to hollywoods the incredible hulk anyone if this and the high praise for district b13 is any indication the name peter morel may soon be one on billboards stateside as well as i said he hitched his trailer to the right perpetually moving train,reality
spoilers this is certainly a first where we see liam neeson as the lead in an action movie he was sublimely superb in his abbreviated appearance in gangs of new york but here hes top dog and he pulls it off with surprising effectiveness in spite of his adding yearsyou can really tell that liam has put in his time at the gym hes trim almost to the point of being gaunt he doesnt have that bulky largely masculine frame that weve always been used tohe plays the part of a former cia operative now retired who is cast back into action after his daughter is kidnapped soon after arriving in france you really believe and really like his character in spite of the ruthless way he goes about getting his daughter back of course the only people he wastes are bad ones so no loss there your forbearance of his brutal means are somewhat tested however when he shoots and merely wounds the wife of a former french secret agent once a compatriot now riding a desk aware of but not trying to stop the evil in his environsliam neeson does a very good job in this action thriller because of his usual dedication to the craft his refusal to leave a scene unfinished and his still ominous presencethere are a few chin scratchers in the narrative like a few over the top car chases and the absurdity to believe that the french government would allow as many visitors to the country to simply disappear but overall the action makes sense especially considering that liams playing a father trying to rescue his daughter at any costthe rest of the cast are convincing the bad guys are ghoulish the good guys are few but decent and the actress playing the daughter does nicelywhile has a few formulaic elements it has its own thrill its own flavor and with a performer like liam neeson it has an undeniable richness8 out of 10,reality
was a good action thriller its the type of movie where you cheer the hero and boo the villains my father recommended this movie and called it old bourne  the movie they made if bourne had retired and had a 17 year old daughter it was so good that i watched the 2nd half again straight after watching it the first time if you liked bourne i whole heartily recommend this moviei use imdb often to get a feel for whether a movie is worth spending the dollars to see at the cinema or wait for the dvd release when the score from the users ratings is really low i dont even bother with that but when i truly enjoy a movie i always find it amusing to read the hated it section of the user reviews why it confirms my belief there are people out there with pushing some radical view point or have very narrow views on what is acceptablethis is very obvious in the reviews with in the hated it section you have the guy who is antiamerican the reviewer who is antiviolence someone else who took offense just because some of the bad guys were eastern european and another who completely doesnt understand that review rating is controlled by the number of viewers who liked or disliked the movie but berates imdb  the majority of reviewers for not agreeing with his point of view ok you didnt like it but please respect other reviewers opinionsthe main character bryan mills was right when he told his daughter i know the world sweetie because he knew there are people out there that have different agendas and values to those held by average middle class westerner which is the whole point of the story and is evident by some reviewers hostilitygood movie watch it,reality
sometimes old fashioned just works  yes this could have been made in the 80s with mel gibson but darn it really is immensely entertaininga sordid plot of kidnapping and the sex trade is well done  it gives the film real depth  and is actually a very wellmade part of the film  it adds a drama element that gives real depth to what is otherwise a popcorn action thrillerit is slow initially but gathers pace then when it gets going it just doesnt stop  and the action is well donea good turn by liam nilson my wife hated his fake hair color though and the supporting cast  its all pretty much what youd expect and it is very watchableim giving it 8 because the time flies by and because of the drama elements  very watchable and a good blend of spy skills and straight out hardnosed action,reality
again we see liam neeson at his best in this underrated action thriller exhibits perfectly how a film with a sustained story line should be shot fast exiting witty and gritty the films plot revolves around the abduction of kim the daughter of bryan mills a highly successful us spy bryans journey to france to track kim down from the hands of an albanian criminal mob grips the audience in pierre morels first serious attempt to display his craft in directing two things stand out about this film the superb acting by bryan liam neeson and the camera shotsthe audience sympathises with bryan the father from the outset he is likable confident and determined to establish some sort of a relationship with his daughter against the backdrop of a now liberated and catered for exwife bryan does not seem to be concerned with scoring easy points against lenore famke janssen but instead wants to get down to business finding his daughter and in the process killing the bad guys this leaves the audience with their thumbs in their mouthsthe camera shots successfully highlights bryans other persona both professional and ruthless the audience is left in awe of steven seagal style hand to hand combat without feeling that they squandered money on a cheesy 2nd rate film the camera angles shows the brutally of liam neeson well in his pursuit for answers which at times shows his character to be heartless especially when he ignores the plight of other trafficked girls which leaves us wondering is this guy an action hero or not the simple answer is no pierre morel is a realist it seems when it came to shooting this film any father would be concerned about the welfare of his own in merciless times and bryan is no differentoverall is a great action film which surpasses expectation yes the acting of the 17 year old daughter resembles a 13 year old but liam neesons execution as a resolute wise and competent character surely compensates the lack of ability of other actors,reality
this is an intense movie the story was ok i guess but nothing special the same goes for the acting in general but the action was good and this is one of the most intense movies ive seen there a lot of fighting and killing but its not overdone liam neeson fits the role perfectly and its cool to see him do a role different than the ones he usually does i have to admit at first i was really skeptical but after the movie i just sat there laughing i totally forgot everything around me if you want to see a drama or a touching film about trafficking i guess this isnt the movie for you but if you want to see an action film this one is surprisingly cool,reality
someone wrote how unrealistic this movie is and that person would be right concerning the acting and settings as for the content by which human slavery is depicted from what i have seen and know on the subject it is much worse and a lot more disturbing as actions films go it is fantastic i really like how it brings the topic to light i loved how he just stepped up and became a killing machine for love never have i cheered so much for the evil villains to be buried in their own putrid blood my emotions just seem overwhelmed when confronted by the tragedy and its lack of understanding by law enforcement one of the many reasons people should be asked to watch this film is so the general public wakes the  up and asks so many more questions of the laws governing any country and state as to how they deal with these kinds of crimes what would you do if your child was ,reality
well this is my first review all i can say is wow i am totally thrilled to be writing a review for a film which is totally worth your moneytotally executed in bourneish style as i was watching this movie it reminded me of the bourne trilogy this movie has so much similar antics that jason bourne portrays in his movies but the storyline takes a different turn i never thought liam neeson could do an action movie so flawlessly i thought he was more suited to the roles like the ones he did in schindlers list but boy was i wrong he takes this movie to a whole new level with his brilliant performance as bryan mills who goes in search of his kidnapped daughter kimmaggie grace neesons age doesnt show a bit and he takes this movie by its reins the ending is predictable but the way neeson goes about doing his part is what impressed me the mostfast paced brilliant and excellent action takes u to an absolutely fantastic ride just sit back and enjoy especially if u love liam neeson or jason bourne for that matter  ,reality
i like the story it is discussing a great cause human trafficking but this time an american female citizen kidnapped in a west european nation by an albanian mafia an east european nation for the joy the middle eastern elites the movie takes you deeply in the human trafficking business it has well presented one strategy of the kidnappers scheme it showed how corrupted official make their own contributions in this business and how excessive freedom given to the underaged by their caregivers could add to the success of the kidnapping process the father might have been over protective of his daughter but on the other hand the mother allowed her underaged daughter to travel all around europe to follow concerts of a famous music band maybe the level of violence in the movie didnt have to be that high liam nesson showed a physical ability that might be a little over his age good movie and an emotional one,reality
is possibly the best action movie ive seen this year putting away the batmans iron mans etc etc this is old school action and well worth it not as over the top as bourne which is still excellent neeson plays a character with the controlled rage that only someone highly trained can use properly all of his fight scenes are well laid out for style when you consider the man is well over 6 feet tall his moves are lethal using hand chops to his opponents throats in order to end the fight quickly just like a true fighter would i have nothing negative to say about this movie except its unfortunate that it wont see the publicity is deserves nor will there likely be a sequel still i highly recommend it to anyone and everyone,reality
lacks probability i read in numerous comments well it does indeed but whats the fuss did i miss something was it supposed to be a documentary a movie in my opinion especially an action movie is to entertain to provide a safety valve through which the teeming emotions triggered by the everyday drudgery can be released and they should serve the cause unharnessed by the constraints of the reality ambitious movies as my girlfriend labels the ones that convey some profound message and mirror reality are actually not that far from the remaining ones in fact they lack probability as well the only difference being their producers who try to convince the public they are showing them life the way it really is but then if that was true who the hell would spend their money to see that thus action movies lack probability as much as they lack hypocrisy bluntly stating they are mainly to entertain fits the profile perfectly still its nowhere near as rough as lets say total recall eraser or any arnie stuff its major strength is liam neeson and quite meticulous development of his character bryan as he elbows his way through the assignment as the story unfolds one can actually feel the bond with him and understand the reasons behind his going on a killing spree its a violent movie but again a whole lot more sophisticated than the usual schwarzenegger kickassery nice term i spotted somewhere on the forums basing on the longer spells of building the tension interwoven with the short intense and actionpacked combat scenes  an effect which only contributes to keeping the viewer on the edge of his seat and last but not least neesons numerous oneliners adding some black humor to the otherwise grim bournelike atmosphere are exceptional dont miss his cellphone monologue as he addresses the villain  thats the essence of the movie and the genre as a whole its nine out of ten to me and it would have been ten wasnt it for the movies length  its only 93 minutes im sure they couldve come up with a few more improbable scenes should they wished,reality
yeah  i read the other reviews where people are getting pedantic about the formulaic nature of the film or lack of moralsocial commentaryhowever i disagree and although thought the same within the first 10 minutes  washedup father dedicated his life to the job loses family exwife finds someone richer  better blahblah however if you ignore the minor details  the first halfhour is the setup and then it is straight into highspeed car chases a bit of parkour close contact combat gunfights drugs trafficking immigration spying almost no nudityyes you read that right moral dilemma of being a parent etc and then some morei like liam neeson as an actor and was not fazed by his lack of distinct american accent  neither should you he is no j bournebond and he is not intended to be no mystery  but his singleminded goal provides immense entertainment till the end and there is almost no letup there are plenty of languages thrown into the mix with the paris backdrop which no good eurobesson flick would be complete without a lot of action if you had time to think  you are thinking waay too mucha really good movie to get your blood flowing personally i feel the movie does have an ethical side  but no need to get tetchy about the politics  as you dont even have to leave home read the papers or possess a connection for that these days it will come at you faster than you can say frantic,reality
not since the 80s and 90s have we seen the kidnapped daughter rescuer daddy type action movies it was a pleasure to see one again liam neeson would have been my last choice for this movie but he turned out to be the perfect choice his cool and calm demeanor and his lack of muscles shows what a true spy or mercenary relies on his brain move over stallone schwarzenegger and van damme its time for some real action heroes the kind that dont need to bench press a buick to save his kid or do all these sweet and fancy karate moves which he did do it kinda reminded me of the indiana jones movie where the guy pulls out a big sword and indie just shoots him same in this movie liam isnt afraid to kill the bad guy with the quickest and most lethal force he doesnt have time to pussy foot around with the dude showing off his karate skillsi totally recommend this movie for all action flick lovers the plot was sound the action was nonstop and the acting was brilliant liam neeson shone in this movie go see it,reality
this film is very high paced thriller which delivers the goods in the adrenalin stakes  where as the violence in saw is emotionless  here is is driven by very well acted level of aggression which continues through most of the film  the lead role has mental anguish pretty early on but falls in to his work quite naturally as the movie progress morals are questioned and even through it is action film there is a genuine use of white america to highlight some of the horrors of criminal society a lot of the people become fodder here  and while they banter with their ego  the viewer quickly realizes the hero has already written their epitaph as he struggles to find interest in banter a reason why i draw analogy to commando for the internet generation the main sources of piracy on the internet seem to be porn and music  in this film music is celebrated as giver of spirit where as pornprostitution is portrayed as the direct product of greed and dehumanization  i hope this inspires you to watch this movie ,reality
im about to not recommend this film but i ought to say that i only was able to get through the first fortyfive minutes or so maybe it perked up and turned into a masterpiece in the last half i doubt itive always enjoyed liam neesons work hes a big hulking guy with a nose that begins in the middle of his forehead he always sounds a little self conscious in front of the camera as though hes reluctant to have his photograph i like that in a guyhe hasnt been on the screen much in recent years and ive wondered why now i believe that if this is the sort of garbage hes been offered i can understand why hes enjoying his leisure timethe genre is action movie the propellant is the kidnapping of neesons daughter and her young friend to be sold into sex slavery neeson spends the movie traveling around making threats and fulfilling them hes an exspy and marshals all his skills to track the kids down in europe he bashes heads all over the continent weve all seen it dozens of times beforegiven that its formulaic it still neednt be so terribly uninventive and uninteresting die hard was an action movie that had its moments the bourne identity had its action scenes wrapped around a bewitching puzzle  who am i has none of that spark it could have been written by some hack in a drugged stupor neeson does his usual best hes aging but not too old for the part famke janssen is mature too still beautiful still rangy but ready for different parts nowthe most interesting feature of the movie was its villains its always interesting to see which kind of villain the benumbed minds of hollywood will choose for years it was germans then the cold war came along and it was russians there were odd bits of drug cartels here and there ten years ago arabs are beginning to show up there is the occasional hybrid die hard had a german gang some of whom spoke with russian accents crimson tide and air force one had the russians  but splinter groups not representing the russian governmentuses albanians not the first time albanians have been used and for good reason albania has historically modeled itself on maos china tune in tomorrow used albanians in a parody of villainy as did wag the dog the albanians are seriously here well why not nobody knows where albania is except the albanians its terra incognita vaguely associated with the balkans  as in bosnia  or the middle east  as in iran and what the hell they dont have any movie theaters in bosnia anyway so theres nothing to lose,reality
ok so neesons daughter is kidnapped by angry sex traders so every girl neeson comes across that has been by these guys has been drugged and raped surprise surprise except for his daughteri have seen more believable bond movies than this neeson leaps around killing guys and seems to be invincible this is ridiculous this movie is not gritty in the slightest characters are one dimensional and the storyline has more holes in it than luc bessens reputationi hate this film with a passion i wasted 90 minutes of my life on a film i really thought was going to be adult and hard hitting instead it was a by the books predictable pile of squeaky clean american trashit was like watching an episode of the oc everything was clean and shiny and it suckedif you think that this film is worthy of a 5 rating you dont know what the hell you are talking about go see irreversible or this is england for hard hitting story lines and gritty action,reality
fabulistic film keeps you watching till the end very clever had me stuck to my seat 1010 i thought the plot of a girl being kidnapped and her dad chasing around paris for her would be boring but i was pleasantly misits a film you can easily watch on a sunday night over a beer or wine and just get stuck into it its like a good book you just want to get to the end and see if the good guy wins being a movie they always do for anyone looking to watch this its a certain you wont be disappointed theirs a great plot and a story behind it and also allot of action but the fact its got actors like liam neeson and maggie grace from lost its also got the bonus of a grilled cheese sandwich,reality
i know its hard to believe but the movie has no swearing no sex scenes no computer animation and the best of all no super female heroes a story with a tragic beginning but with a good ending that will expose real life bad guys and corrupt politicians who messed with the wrong victim and just when hollywood is running out of ideas and actors who are not drug addicts studios like europa corp bring this movie that kept me on the edge of my seat from beginning to the end thank you luc besson robert mark kamen and pierre morel for a great movie and hope to see more titles by you in the future ps looking forward to a sequel revenge of the bad guys,reality
i commend the makers of this great action film for leaving out all the cuss words that many movies of late have insisted upon blasting us with it kept me at the edge of my seat and wide awake by using good english although not by any means a religious movie the stars quest to redeem his daughter from evil to get her back at any cost to take it personally when others did notalso made me thankful for all god has done to get his children back home and to rescue me personally i will definitely be telling others about this movie and may even go see it again myself i always get more the second time i see a film or read a book,reality
a welldone shootemup starring a great actor neeson projects the quiet competenceconfidence of a professional agentspythug very ablythe movie had a plot hole or two but they werent outrageous my biggest gripe is how the good guys with pistols somehow manage to killtake out the baddie with a machine pistol near the end of the movie neeson should have been shot dead in the back but miraculously escapes harm from a spread of bullets does this qualify as a spoilertough subject matter and one wonders how true it is these days sexual enslavement of eastern bloc women has been going on for a decade or two but are tourists being targeted as depicted scary in any case this is a good film with some welldeserved brutal justice handed out,reality
it has an 80 with almost 40000 votes liam neeson gives a great performance and although there are some plot holes how the heck does he cause all of that mayhem without any ramifications especially if the french government knows who he is it is still a great movie its like bourne on steroids the fact that he actually kills almost everyone involved is awesome and he is a totally remorseless killer who doesnt even let middle men live an amazing film and great action anyway  when does it get on there i dont want it to be 1 or anything but it should be recognized,reality
this movie was what i wanted it was enjoyable and full of violence but parts were totally funny it was great i felt that famke jansen was perfect for the role since she always plays a total ball buster the stepfather was henpecked and i remember him from from mommy dearest maggie grace was perfect yes she was goofy at times but it just trying to show her innocence liam neeson was brutal and brilliant at the same timei felt that at certain parts i was like damn this is so messed up when you become a hence man for a living he made me feel that if something ever happened to one of my kids i would do the same thing if i was qualified to break someones neck  overall it was enjoyable and a good date movie,reality
this movie was wonderful this was a powerful story and i enjoyed it from beginning to end i would love to see moreluc besson really knows how to tell a great and important story and bring in american money to the french film industryi love how liam hurt people and worked over everyone the way they deserved because of this i felt like i was watching a real father pursue his daughter and doing what was necessary in every moment rather than hurting people in a manner that they could walk away unscathedthe most important and smart decision in the film i thought was the choice to make the film pg13 this was an excellent decision young women should see this film and hopefully become aware that they must be more aware of their surroundings and actions whether in their own country or abroad this this film could have easily been steered in the wrong direction by showing more of the prostitution and drug side with nudity to attract an audience thankfully it was not donewhy cant all movies be this good and pure,reality
this movie had me on the edge of my seat so much so that when the movie ended i was watching the credits just as intently as i had watched the movie waiting for there to be another shoot out or knife fightall the action sequences from the driving to the fighting were all new to meand i must now say that neeson is now my favorite superhero what i really loved about this movie is that it didnt need any expensive special effects or overdramatic explosions it was just pure excitement the whole way throughi wish i was still watching it right now and he kicks a in this movieloved it,reality
the bourne series appears to have rejuvenated the whole actionmovie genre even infecting the bond franchise in my opinion mostly for the better with whiteknuckleride thrills conviction acting and contemporary settings now the norm where once there was willis  schwarzenegger cartoon excess i know which i prefer as i say this kidnap thriller certainly borrows heavily from the bourne template not to mention charles bronsons death wish from an earlier era and even recent french thriller tell no one with liam neeson metamorphosing from a seemingly ordinary average doting father into a driven clinical but of course resourceful killing machine to rescue his teenage daughter from algerian abductors in paris the film did though for me take a little too long to get going and suffers somewhat from too much sentimentality of all things particularly in the mawkish scenes between neeson his estranged wife now a richmans plaything and their spoilt 17 yearold daughter disbelief suitably suspended though neeson incredibly tracks her down pretty much from scratch to a girltrafficking syndicate where druggedup teenagers are bid for in an eerily abhorrent auction by respectableseeming businessmen his character unsurprisingly racking up carwrecks and bodycount aplenty the searchers it isnt and neeson basically has to carry the film as hes by far the biggest name on board here but he certainly convinces as the expert retired intelligence operative who snaps back into the groove under extreme provocation the rest of the actings nothing to write home about however and i feel the film could have benefited with better support and also by building up the mr big character a bit more as neesons nemesis i also felt some of the action sequences were tricky to follow and fully engage with as the backgrounds were often unnecessarily dark and afflicted by a sort of staccato stopstart camera style the best action sequences in the bourne ultimatum by contrast flow naturally in a sort of heightened realtime and often in broad daylight for all its plagiarism however and other defects ive mentioned above this was still a watchable almostallaction movie for a saturday night,reality
first off i didnt expect this movie to be that good but boy was i ever surprised as the first 15 minutes took off i had no clue what direction the movie was going for but as soon as you know it the thrillaction starts i am really impressed with this one i absolutely love the raw action in it and liam neeson was brilliant his character was extremely unbelievable and doesnt everyone wish they can kick ass like he does in this movie the plot is great because its a thrill ride till the very end and the whole pace of the movie just keeps flowing consistently throughout these kinds of movies leave you thinking at the end about the world we live in and all the terrible things that can and often do go wrong all over the world it really makes people think about their lives and shows how grateful everyone one should i definitely recommend this to all movie lovers out there you will not be disappointed with this i give this a 10 out of 10 hands down,reality
i sat down tonight with the thought in my mind that id like to see a good action movie i heard about and the story concept seemed interesting so i decided to watch itwell let me tell yall i wasnt disappointedthis movie was great as actiondramasuspense mix the fights were great the storyline straight and clear the characters developed enoughanother commenter said that this film has some of the makings of the bourne movies let me second on that neeson plays a man who takes a no bit approach to solving a problem while employing a great deal of tricks and the art of his former trade pretty much like jason bourne also the pace of the film is somewhat comparablei am not saying that the film is equal to the bourne trilogy in all sense but if yall like to see a good and exciting action flick id definitely recommend this onehowever do not watch it expecting the answers to societys problems like corruption drugs prostitution and so on you wont get anything in that department but if you are a father or ever want to be youll probably get the feeling that yeah this is what id like to do or at least it would be nice to try and do if my daughter ever got in the hands of these kind of peopleenjoy the movie,reality
i have never commented on this site just saw this movie last night and i was on the edge of my seat for the entire flick i cannot speak highly enough about this movie there was no thought whatsoever that this was nothing but a real and convincing plot and the characters were completely believable liam neeson was convincing and completely engaging the entire movie you felt his angst and determination unlike many action movies everything seemed completely plausible you will never say no way you will cheer you will rethink your own dedication to your family this will be one of those movies for me like the die hards etc that when i see it on no matter what point in the movie i will stop and watch,reality
now im not into any action movies but upon seeing the trailer i just knew i wanted to see this one ive just arrived from the cinema and i wanted to write a review suggesting this movie to everyone because even if there hasnt been much enthusiasm about it this movie is so incredible the acting is really great the story is very very good the ending is awesome i couldnt ask for anything more in this movie everything is in moderation and the plot is also very realistic makes you think how easily you could get into danger without knowing this movie kept not only me but also my friends stuck to the seat just wanting to see what happens honestly i would recommend this movie to everyone even though it is slightly under rated this movie deserves a 1010,reality
me and a couple of mates went to see this film today and werent disappointed we all loved it and i have giving it a ten out of ten if quantum of solace isnt the best film this year then certainly is the trailer doesnt really show a lot of the brilliant and many many action scenes but it does show the instantly classic line delivered by neeson on the phone which i would say is right up there with such classic lines as go ahead make my day i would recommend this fantastic movie to anyone who enjoys good action and appreciates good acting although it is a total action fest it is more than a typical action movie like rambo 3 or eraser it has got some really brilliant talent and tackles real life issues superbly,reality
i was very disappointed in this movie it was a great movie but very much similar to the book i wrote in 2004 illegal goodbye by angela jobe published by virtualbookworm i had people come and tell me it was a lot like my book but i hadnt seen the movie so i had to see for myself at first i thought some scenes were just a coincident but after seeing the end now i dont think so at all the movie is based on two girls being from the airport my book is two girls being abducted from a mall and to the country turkey and thrown into the black market in the movieone girl was hesitant about going with the guy and the other girl wanted to gosame as my book in the movie the father will do anything to find his daughtermy book her twin along with her father will do anything to find her the part that blows me away the most is the auction at the endjust like my booktoo many similarities extremely disappointed,reality
from the beginning one could figure out the genre of this moviethe quantity of blood and number of bullets the infallible not to mention superhero capabilities of cia agent the onemanagainstarmy plot the innocent virgin of the only innocent father blahblahblah to those who havent seen the bourne trilogy this one would seem cool to those who did this one is hilariousi have been through some of the comments after watching the film most of positive ones refer to thrilling great actionpacked amazing fantastic features of the movie yet the negative comments are way more persuasive be warned to read the negative ones first,reality
so how many of these movies have we seen this theme of a middle aged man going in search of his kidnapped daughter has been done countless times therefore i was quite surprised to see this movie now considering this theme is so overused nowthere is not much deviation from the formula the middle man aged man bryan millsliam neeson has just sent his daughter unwillingly to a europe trip his daughter gets kidnapped by albanian traffickers and he sets out to rescue his daughter and kill the bad guys in the process there is also the clich of immigrant guys involved in prostitution there is a message that young girls shouldnt go out to unknown countries bad things are always right in the cornerdoes this rule apply to young boys btw in the end the character as usual faces the whole prostitution ringall by himself and rescues his daughterthe more i see famke jennsen the more i am convinced she shouldnt be acting in movies at all she literally sleepwalks through her role it is amazing her beauty is not interesting enough to keep me interested i havent seen any other movies of liam neeson but he seems quite forgettable in this he does the standard tough guy role who doesnt need to show emotions much the depictions of immigrants are quite disturbing to say the least the lack of action scenes is another problem it isnt complex enough to be a thriller to be a psychological thriller type of movie and it isnt fast enough to be called an action moviethe rewatchability factor is non existent and it is not even worth for one watch okay for this genre but it is a reason why recent action movies havent really caught the attention of the viewers the lack of originality and the clichd treatment is the main problem hereoverall 410,reality
what as much as i love liam neeson he does some really bad movies sometimes and this is one 79 out of a 100000 votes what is wrong with the general population this movie was quite terrible and ill name just a few reasons why well the revenge and relentlessly pursue of something or someone is very old and unoriginal so it had to be refreshing in some ways but no not at all so many awful stereotypes and plot qliches its hard to watch the american girls are just so blah his daughter and her friend are so stupid and spoiled and follow a u2 tour in europe so thats what the kids do these days you dont give a darn about them liam neeson doesnt really even have to act he has two emotion tones in the whole movie the suspense is awful and predictable the acting is terrible besides neesons mediocre role as a mad dad the dialogue is lame and qliche there is nooo intriguing cinematographybottom line 79 this movie was very weak in almost every single cinematic aspect,reality
i cant understand why people like this bclass moviebad acting bad script bad cinematography bad montage it should be just straight to vhs yes not even to dvd seriously is neeson new nicolas cageive tried so hard to find anything good about this movie but i couldnt it tries so much to be serious and showing disturbing issues of kidnapping people but it just plain stupid and stereotypical characters there are just annoying and not likable everybody are behaving so not natural have fake accents im big fan of action movies and you can trust me on this avoid,reality
predictable from start to finish mediocre performances across the board including neeson who you feel was stifled by the script and direction an earlier review suggested this was very much like man on fire believe me they are worlds apart on paper they tick very similar boxes but where man on fire slowly built tension made you care for the characters via stellar performances and solid dialogue and plot twists aplenty merely plods though the usual juxtaposed strands to achieve its superficial outcomes where you could almost feel the heat of mexico city seeping out of the screen with man on fire the arctic chill of emptiness and apathy blow through this its all thrown together quite nicely with some impressive cinematography along the way but as the saying goes you can put a dress on a pig but its still a pigcould have been worse could also have been a damn sight better,reality
age difference of the daughter taking a 25yr old actress that look older then her actual age to act as a 17 year old girl calls a really bad judgment her acting is bad too worst part she is in 2 and there is going to be 3 the story is good a lot of teenage girls young ladies and a lot of parents making bad decision that actually brings to this situation sadly this is still happening as we speak hopefully there is a lot of heroes like the father character in this movie to save this young ladies the mother character cares more of rules which does not matter then the rules that does matter in both movies and 2 in 3 i think both the mother and daughter should be given more credible role then how the movie depicts both ladies as not much of a help role and seriously make the daughter look younger she look so old,reality
i kept saying are you fing kidding me the whole time i was watching this so it was very distracting and i couldnt enjoy the film because of my exasperations basically i didnt believe any of what happening how many bullets were in gun how you could drive like that without accident why a singer would need that much security i couldnt follow the plot at all how you can enhance a photo that much i only decided to watch it because it was so popular couldnt believe it has a rating of 79 right now liam neeson was good in the movie and the only factual thing in the movie was probably the street price of the prostitute i read vice so i know the street price 40 is standard,reality
the most and maybe only successful area that hollywood productions have is action thrillers and was one good example of the decline of the empire of movie industry this film is filled with clichs excia guy goes and gets her kidnapped daughter who was kidnapped by albanians in undercivilized and corrupt france while doing that he used the identity of a french intelligence service agent but he was still speaking english with albanians living in france so the assumptions was 1 audience does not like subtitles 2 audinece are not smart enough 3 there is no need to be smart at all as whatever clich they put in their movies it sells,reality
i will find you and i will kill you cia retiree liam neeson says resolutely to one of his daughters kidnappers we know hell follow through on his promise too its great to see liam back on the screen in this tailor made role kicking butt but really folks this is an overrated movie neesons a character you dont want to mess with and these albanion scum have messed with his daughter hes been trained to kill and this is basically what hes gonna do to everyone involved here one an old friend of neesons his daughter and her friend are vacationing in paris or france im not sure within hours of their arrival where the friend has already met her romeo the two girls are snatched and are sold into a sex slavery graces friend not so lucky so its liam to the rescue trawling the streets for his loved one and pulling some deadly moves on his oppressors the auctioning scene near the end where the girls drugged virtually walking zombies are shown singularly into a room first cloaked with a bridess gown as such before its whipped off is the most fascinating as its unforgettable the bidders sit above in booths a female vo outlining the girls assets before starting with figures apparently grace is the best import so shes the last girl to be auctioned not unless liam has something to say about it he sure knows how to break up a party to me wasnt anything special it needed more input into its story if its characters too at least it ends happily for grace back in the loving arms of her father some nice stunt work near its gripping final holly valance has a small role doing what she does best shes graces characters idol who first tells grace to not waste her time,reality
as exciting wellmade fastpaced hollywood thrillers go it is hard to match for sheer loathsomeness retired operative bryan mills liam neeson lives alone on his cia pension his life up with barbecue nights with his cia oldboy group and with obsessing over his 17yearold daughter kim maggie grace who is about to go on a trip to paris with a girlfriend substitute paris for bangkok redlight district and you will get an idea of how dad reacts to the idea of his little girl on her own in the city of light considering that his facetoface interactions with kim and her mother famke janssen are hopelessly awkward bryans obsession with his memories and his photo album though played for pathos start to seem a little creepy but dads paranoia turns out to be well founded before kim can unpack her toothbrush the albanian slave trade scoop up her and best girlfriend amanda on the phone with kim while the kidnapping takes place bryan has just enough time to hear a few clues before hes begging his exwifes rich new husband for a private jet to get him to paris in the 96 hours after which authorities tell him she will disappear foreverthe trouble is everyone in paris is in cahoots with the albanian slavers for all the help he gets bryan might as well have stayed in los angeles taking on disney human smuggling and the mexican drug trade in this film from a french writer director and producer the french are all slimebags even bryans old friend  fellow agent jean claude olivier rabourdin refuses to get involved irish actor neeson nails his american accent when he pronounces his old buddys name john clod and when bryan persists amps up his resistance the albanians and their chief clients the arabs are even worse bryan gets to revive his old skills shooting stabbing and breaking necks as if he was in his prime almost no one he meets in paris doesnt end up dead and to a man theyre the better for it fortunately at one point when bryan gets in too deep he is saved by that old standby the pipe which has that one essential loose bracket the hero needs and which also contains that pressurized steam whichat least in action moviesseems to be the lifeblood of large buildingsnothing so banal as the electricity or natural gas we use in real life in the end according to one imdb contributor bryan kills 35 people to get his daughter back but he fails to win our sympathy not once in is he given a hint of the selfdeprecating humour which is the hallmark of the successful action hero dour socially awkward good only at murder he is a man better off on his own once off the plane his evidently untraumatized daughter bubbly as ever after her ordeal rushes into her mothers arm with great relief no doubt even worse than 4 days with albanian slavers has been a transatlantic flight next to her dour dad and famke janssenof whom we see too littleis clearly better off with the rich guy,reality
i watched this on tv the other night and for the most part enjoyed it along with liam neesons character i also thought many of the nonstarring roles were well played but it is not much more than a good popcorn muncheri am about the same age as liam so it was quite nice to see an old guy kick buttbut i absolutely hated the exwife and daughter especially the latter what brain dead mother would allow an even more brain dead 17 year old to go to europe following a rock band around i absolutely hated the kid and was rooting for her to get her just deserts but dad saves her and brings her home and what does she do races headlong towards her brain dead mother and anonymous stepfather both of whom financed the tripi see 2 is being madehopefully the kid will have died due to over exposure to cell phone radiation or fallen off the horse and the kidnap of the brain dead mother will allow liam along the way to match up with marion cotillard which is what he deserves,reality
i found this movie quite exhausting to watch and i was tempted to walk out of my own house before reaching the very predictable end i like to evaluate films on the basis of what they aim to achieve in my humble opinion this is just another clichd one american takes on a whole army such that he can locate his missing relative film to deny this works sometimes would be silly of me as films like polanskys frantic and scotts man on fire do a great job its a little similar to another film of harrison fords firewall but this has a slightly more interesting pretext kidnapping in my opinion is a great focus of a thriller or action film its just that completely lacks the acting the plot and a good soundtrack with one you can make the greatest film of all time with none its a disaster 410 go watch frantic instead,reality
while i enjoyed the fast paced action that this movie delivered i could not believe that the writer actually placed made this happen in parisif someone routinely nabbed american girls right from the airport charles de gaulle dont you think this would instantly make the headlines and all available police forces and secret service agents would be all over it this movie starts with an extremely bizarre premise and it kept presenting more and more improbable impossible and unbelievably exaggerated crimes and heavily stereotyped bad guysbut it delivered all the action and gunflinging that you can expect from a rogue exagent rescues his daughter kind of movie i was decently entertained by the action but at the same time felt like i just had my intellect raped two stars for this mainly because the movie contained a pony,reality
this movie contains excellent acting ex specially by liam neesonif your looking for a decent story with a sprinkle of suspense then this is the movie for youthere is a couple of criticisms i would like to address i found the plot entertaining however this movie contains old clich movie gimmicks in respect to the action contained in the filmparticularly on the boat liam neeson seems to kill all enemies without taking any damage some of the action was illogical and it jarred me back to reality in that sense its a bit clich however its worth a watch,reality
i took a look a out of curiosity when i read the premise and could not have believed what i was about to experience let alone find out later it was a french production it seems hollywood just doesnt want to give audiences what they want to see but does deliver justice in every possible way that a moviegoer could dream ofthrough every scene i found my self with my mouth open saying thats what i would of had happen how many times do we see in movies like fast and furious where even tough guy dom wont blast the bad guy when he has a chance is the complete opposite every opportunity to kill a bad guy is judiciously advantage of i have never been more thrilled by a movie and everyone i know enjoyed it for the same reasons i didin short i would recommend hollywood make enjoyable movies like and stop being so philosophical and weak when dealing with the bad guys,reality
what can i say one great ride was a surprisingly good moviei mean i knew pierre morels talent but surely didnt expect it to be so accuratethe story tough completely unoriginal and predictable is captivating from one end to the other we have many energetic action moments but very few intelligent and creative ones to say it with few words  intense action few surprisesliam neeson was what i call the main event because ive always looked at him like an icon of caring and mildness this time is just as lethal as an ak47 or m16 the american version of ak47  didnt care too much about the girl i almost wanted her dead  she was annoyingly stupid too stupid if you ask mehowever doesnt intend to be extravagant it sticks to the point ant that is very important for me better simple and good than one complicated inteligent mess that doesnt men i wouldnt have appreciated some depth in this plot it may just have filled the gapid like to add that ive appreciated the authenticity of this title the european scent was obvious since the image of human trafficking was kept unalteredall in all was a simple action film which will please almost any fan of the genre i recommend it to those who seek for fast action thrillsi liked it even if it has some flaws i therefore rate this title a 12 out of ,reality
neesons character bryan mills is referred to rambo by some of his ex spy buddies in the beginning of the film and as it turns out he turns into a sort of rambo later while trying to find his daughter neeson is not an action star which was the main problem with this movie it wasnt believablemills daughter kim goes to paris with a friend and gets kidnapped a few hours after arriving it just so happens she is talking to her dad when the kidnappers strike so mills goes to paris and all by himself he hunts down the albanians and kills people left and right mills doesnt even ask any of his ex spy buddies to help outmills ex wife was the worst character she lies to him to get him to sign the papers to let their daughter go plus she doesnt even seem concerned that her 17 year old daughter is going to europe with one friend then when her daughter is kidnapped shes not going nuts saying call the police and the ending was terrible when mills and kim return home her dad just saved her from being a sex slave and she doesnt even want him to come home with herfinal verdict it has some good action but i think the lead actor was miscast but still good enough to check out,reality
this is one of those films you enjoy even though you know its slick and glossy and totally dumb it contains nothing original has trite dialogue an indefensibly heavy dependence on coincidence and luck narrative signposts that a visually impaired simpleton wearing a blindfold could read in the middle of a blackout and superheroic antics from an ageing leading man that in reality would have him reaching for a comfy chair for a sit down within five minutes of the chase beginning and yet the films action sequences are so wellstaged that they somehow manage to hold it all together and stop you from reaching for the stop button on your remoteliam neeson plays a prematurely retired government agent hes one of those amiable but secretive men who never tell their family what it is that he really does choosing instead to lend himself an air of mystery by explaining that he was a preventer ie someone who prevented bad things from happening he tells this to his virginal teen daughter which is when you first suspect that the writer isnt just aiming for the usual 1724 demographic here but is also reaching out to every potbellied slouchshouldered balding middleaged dad who has seen their life pass them by but who console themselves with the fact that theyve at least raised some reasonably decent kids even though they feel totally alienated from them and probably dont know where they are or what theyre doing 85 of the timeanyway against his better judgment liam allows his daughter to go on a holiday to paris with her best friend and wouldnt you know it they go and get themselves kidnapped by a gang of albanians typical you let them out of your sight for five minutes at least thats one good thing about the dispensing of barriers in europe us brits so long the villainous figure of hollywood flicks have now been usurped by the east europeanneeson calls on his security pals for help and using only a few seconds of taped conversation a small piece of string and an empty fairy liquid bottle they are able to identify not only the ring leader of the gang but where he used to live personally id have shelled out for mates like that to come with me to paris but liams made of sterner stuff and flies out on his own and within something like twoandahalf minutes of arriving in paris hes on the trail of the young dude who groomed the girls for abductionok so this film isnt really to be seriously even though it doesnt really seem to have much of a sense of humour about itself like most films of this genre if there is any obstacle to the logic or progression of the story it is either ignored completely or summarily dispensed with through the use of a throwaway line thats why nobody thinks to tell the parents of the second girl that their little precious has just become a statistic in the human traffickingsexual slavery figures and its why nobody in paris has noticed that lithe young female tourists to the city are regularly disappearing within hours of getting off their planes its why neeson has no trouble making himself understood in a foreign country and why every albanian gangster in paris has an excellent grasp and command of the english language its why neeson can identify his daughters spotter through a hazy reflection of him taking her photograph on her mobile phone and its why a drunken and drugged girl can remember the name of the street in which she was imprisoned as her captors turn her into a junkie ready to turn onto the streetsand the reason i highlight all these weaknesses inconsistencies and flaws of the film isnt so much to damn it as to emphasise how surprising it is that i managed to enjoy so much of what was going on the action scenes are the kind of highlycharged adrenalinepumping setpieces that sometimes have you forgetting to breath and the makers are canny enough to know that this is where the real strength of the film lies because when you strip the story down to its bare essentials  innocent young heroine plucked from the warmth and security of her family to become the plaything of a wealthy but villainous sheik  youre talking about a plot that was old in the 1920s and liam neesons hairraising escapades and lastminute escapes are straight out of those old boysown serials of the 30s,reality
liam rolling through paris kicking complete ass i knew exactly what i signed up for when i saw this movie the action was fantastic and the acting was great his daughter was a spoiled valley girl who you didnt really care about nor did you care if she was saved but i guess it is just one fathers love for his child the plot was well played out and very intriguing as far as rambostyle one man vs the world movies go but the movie was eclipsed by quite possibly the worst ending to ever hit an action movie why would they not end the movie without the last two scenes the editor should be stabbed in the heart with a frozen carrot,reality
the new liam neeson kidnap thriller qualifies as both entertaining and predictable ostensibly the message here is parents should think twice before they turn their funloving 17year old daughters loose in paris france without an escort district b13 director pierre morel appropriates many of the clichs and conventions of kidnapping thrillers but he ramps up the violence marginally for this pg13 thriller while suspending any vestige of realism the result is an exciting and suspenseful yarn about a rambo style father who takes names and kicks butt although it doesnt concern ransom demands resembles the 1985 arnold schwarzenegger kidnap thriller commando however isnt half as good as the schwarzenegger saga mind you neesons sympathetic performance as a doting neversaydie dad in pursuit of the evildoers who abducted his only daughter keeps things interesting the villains in the formulaic screenplay by luc besson  robert mark kamen who together wrote both the transporter and kiss of the dragon are as sleazy as maggots the problem is no one single actor or character emerges who can match neeson blow for blow big dumb action thrillers need a chief villain that we can genuinely loathe and that the hero can lock horns with in a struggle to the death assembles too many triggerhappy miscreants that neeson dispatches as easily as tenpins in a bowling alleyfinds former cia agent bryan mills liam neeson of schindlers list living in los angeles so he can be near his estranged daughter kim maggie grace of tvs lost who lives with her mother lenore famke janssen of goldeneye and stuart xander berkeley of air force oneher affluent stepfather lenore and bryan were divorced years ago because bryans job as a preventer for langley kept him from spending quality time not only with kim but also her mother lenore has nothing but contempt for bryan and does her best to keep him at arms length from kim indeed bryan lost his job with the company because he flew 9thousand miles to celebrate kims birthday while he was on duty elsewhere in the world morel and his scenarists stress bryans deep love for his daughter they show him pasting kims new photos into a scrapbook that contains pictures from each birthday bryan finds himself outclassed by stuart at kims 17th birthday party when he gives her a karaoke player while stuart gives her a horse kim still loves bryan but she is growing up and a girl has to do what a girl has to do especially when her best friend amanda katie cassidy of black christmas persuades her to fly with her to paris to stay with her relatives before kim can accompany amanda she has to get bryans written authorization but our hero doesnt like the setup he worries about what could happen to them even though kim assures him that they will only be touring museums reluctantly bryan breaks down and signs the form but he demands that kim take an international cell phone with his number programmed into itno sooner have the girls landed than amanda gets the hots for a parisian pretty boy named peter nicolas giraud of second souffl who shares a taxi with them in this respect recalls the rrated hostel where sexy girls lured lusty lads into a death trap in eastern europe peter invites them to a party but the girls never make it peter phones a gang of grimy albanians that operate a white slavery ring in other words they shanghai young girls pump them full of narcotics and force them into prostitution kim is on the phone with bryan when the villains invade the apartment where amandas relatives live unfortunately amandas relatives are gone on a vacation too bryan coaches kim about what to do even as the thugs come after her and drag her out from under a bedpredictably lenore is distraught when she learns what has happened bryans cia buddies provide our hero with a wealth of information about the albanians they inform bryan however that he has only 96 hours before he will lose kim forever essentially kim will be sold to the highest bidder and be a sex slave until she dies bryan has stuart arrange air passage for him to paris and our hero pulls out his black bag of tricks bryan contacts an old colleague with french intelligence jeanclaude olivier rabourdin of the messenger the story of joan of arc but he wants bryan to leave the country bryan warns his old friend that he is prepared to tear down the eiffel tower to get his daughter back secretly jeanclaude assigns a team to shadow bryan eventually bryan locates the albanians and inflicts heavy losses on them but cannot find kim bryan manages to rescue a girl who may know of kims whereabouts he helps her recover from the drugs that the villains have injected in her and she gives bryan a lead ten years ago harrison ford would probably have played liam neesons part meanwhile neeson behaves believably enough to convince us that he is as a savvy as matt damons jason bourne and can get into and out of the toughest predicaments imaginable bryan shoots stabs kills fights and tortures the treacherous albanians until he gets what he wants indeed neeson resembles an indestructible steven seagal hero who can triumph over wellnigh impossible odds famke janssen is relegated to the thankless role of the distraught mother and maggie grace is hopelessly clueless as kim the parisian locales look gritty enough and our hero has his hands full the whole time right up to the final gunfight on a sheiks yachtdespite its paucity of realism and reliance on clichs benefits from neesons stalwart performance and morels vigorous staging of the action that never loses its momentum throughout its nimble 93 minutes,reality
for all of you fellow liam neeson fans you must see this it is a great recovery from his role in love actually which is a completely respectable film and its the first time in a while that he seemed really into his character this movie definitely shows a darker side of him a badass side refreshing it is makes you realize that actors dont have to be typecast all the time and maggie grace though her role can be described as little more than a cameo gave a convincing performance i think the under the bed scene was a little overdone on her part almost like she was in a hokey lowbudget horror film anyway the plot is decent keeps you on the edge of your seat and is worth your buck,reality
as a fan of action movies i must say this is the best one in a long time i gave this movie 810 because i think that if you are a fan of action films then you should defiantly see this movie liam neeson does his magic playing the lead role as the man you dont want to mess with besides the great acting in the movie when it comes to the action scenes he proves that he is more than capable of picking a fight in other words they couldnt have done a better job casting him as the lead character as for director pierre morel well all i can say is i am looking forward to seeing what he does next so next time you are at a theater and you are looking for some action put your money on this one cause it is a good one hope you like it as well,reality
this is a great film simply an action thriller about a frantic father with some serious arsekicking skills using them to find his kidnapped daughter and punish those who took her from him any plot holes can be easily ignored as the film is smoothly paced and very well deliveredliam neeson is fantastic from the start from the strain of the disconnection he is suffering with his daughter to the anguish of what transpires to her in the kidnapping and then his training allowing cold hard ruthless devotion to her recovery liams characterisation of bryan allows you to both empathise with his predicament and appreciate his employment of said spy skills in pursuing the bad guysif this film didnt have someone of liams talent as the lead i dont think it would have worked if you get on board with his characters point of view youre in for quite a ride,reality
i have to admit that probably thrillers are my favourite genre plus i like liam neeson and when i can see him in a good thriller movie i like it double saying this and if you like this genre too you will agreed that is difficult to find out one that it keeps you on the edge of your seat for the whole movie thats one of those difficult ones to find out probably in the mix theres more of an action movie than a thriller but still a very enjoyable piece everything goes to fast straightforward you dont have time to breath its true that it doesnt allow you to play with the movie cause it gives you no time to think dont look here for a psychological thriller cause is not is pure tension action suspense and high levels of adrenalinebetter than any bourne movies million times better than any 007 ones at least for me make some popcorn sit and relax if you can 810,reality
these days good action movies are hard to find earlier we got it in the way of bourne and bond series but this film definitely deserves high applaud for many reasons liam neeson at this best good direction great plot human trafficking is well shown in this film entire minutes of this film are very beautiful and definitely can be watched one more time i could see some negative review in this post but am surprised by those am waiting for liams next film lincoln to be released soon in this movie the kidnapping scene is one particular unique scene which is not shown in any movies certains details which are not shown should be understood ourselves and if all the details are put in then we would get a 3 hour slow paced movie rather an entertaining movie i would recommended everyone to watch this movie if you want to spend some precious 93 moments of timehats off to liam and the movie which cant never be from any ones heart,reality
they took his daughter hell take their lives delivers all the chills and the thrills with a perfect sense of pacing the right amount of action and a lot of necks breaking bad ass impresario liam neeson is taking names as a retired spy who is forced back into action when his daughter is kidnapped by slave traders while on a leisure vacation in paris he basically just kills everyone he sees that isnt her daughter and hell hath no fury like a roaring rampage of revenge the sleek action scenes were just downright gritty theres no wires involved no gratuitous back flips or slowmo flying kicks its all bare knuckles street fighting brawl great choreography i must say and as it may slightly resemble the bourne movies stands on its own feet as a high octane action thrillerfrenchman extraordinaire luc besson cowrote the screenplay and his right hand man pierre morel directs all in all is a mustsee for all you action junkies out there,reality
this film draws heavily on a blend of the brawn of bonds latest outing but the intelligent execution of the bourne movies but neither outway the otherthe plot is very one sided but the acting and excellent pacing make it a story that is very intensive and enjoyable not to mention that the characters are very connective with the viewer all filled with a certain charmits a great action flick as well as above skillful choreography and excellent believable action is quite balanced with the unbelievable driving sequence with the off roadersall in all an epic night out film and one i would definitely buy for the christmas build up truly enjoyable viewing,reality
at first i thought it was going to have less action than i thoughtafter the film was over i loved its violence and actionliam nessons performance was a violent more darker version of james bondi would also like to see him as a potential replacement for daniel craigthe story was very dark in tone and very violentthe action was amazingthe acting was amazing including liam nessonsit was outstanding and i was almost amazed by the way he turned to lovable father to vengeance assassini was also surprised by the casting of kims mum and dadfrankie jaseenjean grey from x men and xander berkeleygeorge mason 24overall i loved this film and i think liam nesson should be involved in more action films,reality
action packed jaw dropping right after some 10 minutes when the movie beginsi was looking for an action flick desperately after i saw bourne ultimatum which could match the same standardsbut i must saythis movie is nothing but 100 pure actionand in some aspects better than bourne moviesthe guy inspite of age is quickyou get to see the killer instinct which one looks for while watching an action flickthe movie never loses its paceand you just stick your eyes to the screen for next frameand frame after frame you see quick actionthe script has been written welland its well thought ofdoesnt contain meaningless actionthe issue of trafficking has been well tackled in the movieand movie leaves you with a thoughtthe ugly side of wealth and powerall the characters have acted out their bit well,reality
came across this film by chance was looking for a film to pass a couple of hours and didnt let me down although you wonder for the first 15 minutes where the films going your suddenly thrown into the actioni was originally sceptical about the film as it opened in much the same way as most american films start you know the american hero saves the day yet again type filmseveral times throughout the film it becomes difficult to watch as the subject mater although dealt with sympathetically can be hard to think about when kim sees her dad at the end of her ordeal and says you came for me i admit i was close to tears its very seldom that a film can move me in that way overall i gave it 910 would be 1010 but im leaving scope in case i find a better film than this doubt i will though,reality
liam neeson was great in this movie at times i was reminded of john mcclane and jason bourne characters but with more seriousness  focus as happens with many films of this genre you have to suspend your belief somewhat as this quasisuperhero appears bulletproofsome intermittent subtitles could have fleshed out the bad guys characters a little making them less one dimensional without detracting from the suspense while keeping the audience in the loopa miscast maggie grace tried to downplay her age without success watching her run was reminiscent of a baby giraffe taking its first steps there are many younger actresses out there who can play the ingnue more convincingly the violence can be gruesome and the sextrade scenes sickening but overall this movie delivers and is well worth watching,reality

while it is a good action movie if you can edit it to some degree the rating is completely wrong in no way is this a pg13 movie this movie should not be seen by anyone under the age of 18 at the very least prostitution is the main theme of the movie contains nudity violence and a lot of foul language this should be rated r at the very least besides that there is no need for the nudity as the prostitution is implied and therefore does not require a visual in addition to that there is no need for the language it doesnt make a movie it is a factor which can determine if i even watch the movie liam neeson is an excellent actor i really enjoy his movies that is the only reason that i even watched this movie overall take out the language and the nudity and it would be pretty good movie,reality
enjoyed this movie thoroughly finally liam neeson shows that he can do what steven seagal did 15 years ago i hope that he continues making movies like these the plot is uncannily similar to stevens flicks excia guys daughter gets hurt by a bunch of goons and he raises hell by going through town and kicking mucho butt we need more heroes like these not just in movies but in real life with vin diesel and dwayne the rock johnson gone off making scifi or family movies if liam continues making movies like these hell be the new king of action flicks holding the baton handed over by norris schwarzenegger and stallone,reality
there is nothing particularly original in this action flick predictable from start to finish liam neeson is bryan mills retire security agent we never find out his exact previous profession who is forced into action when his daughter goes missing in parissome stereotypical swarthy albanians take neesons daughter to sell her to some equally stereotypical greasy arabs meanwhile the stereotypical lazy french police do nothing but get in neesons way think polanskis frantic but without the plot twistsi have to wonder why neeson let himself get attached to this project his acting is good the directing is fair but with a lot of distracting continuity problems the problem lies with the script if you have never watched an action film before in your life then there will be some new stuff for you here everyone else save your cash and catch it on cable in a few weeks before it disappears into film oblivion forever,reality
wow just wow this film is just absolutely amazing faultless let me start of by saying liam nesson is such a great strong actor and you couldnt have had a better actor to play the part now the film was just magnificent its definitely in my top 5 list of all time its a film you dont forget for its fantastic outcome breathaking storyline and so much epic action it really is faultless i expected it to be good but this is way beyond good the storyline is so interesting and it makes you be aware of the real world and although its violent it makes you realise to watch yourself out in the real world spectacular film you would be a fool to miss this film 1010,reality
bryan mills is a former cias operative whose longtime dedication earned him on one side special skills mostly rhyming with kills and cost him on the other side his marriageas a secret agent hes a combination of james bond and steven seagal but as a husband not so much yet you wonder what his wife lenore famke jensen was expecting since she didnt marry a baker or an accountant but looking at her postdivorce lifestyle and her new rich husband she naturally feels triumphant over bryan but bryans attention is focused on his 17year old daughter kim maggie grace he retired for a bodyguard job to spend more time with her and theres a sort of genuine bond between both and liam neeson is always believable as the misunderstood and hurt fatherin twenty minutes the characters are all setup with more or less twothree dimensionality kim wants to become a singer bryan tries to connect her with a pop artist he protected from an assailant he bought her a karaoke machine at her birthday but her stepfather out stepped him by offering the most predictable but no less efficient gift a horse and not any horse one that makes the illfated khartoom from the godfather looks like a pony the tone is clear kim is a cute spoiled little girl and its a miracle she didnt turn as bitchy and arrogant as her mother and the conflict with the mother starts when she allows kim to travel to paris and discover the world with her friend one step further she would have bought condoms for herthe script doesnt embarrass itself with subtlety as we immediately take side with bryan who faces ungratefulness every time he finds out that the travel in paris is only the first step to a u2s european tour the two girls want to attend he doesnt even know that the cousins supposed to chaperon them are in travel reluctant to let her girl go he finally resigns but gives her a cellphone so she can call him from the international area his very instinct just saved kim i spend time to describe the setup because the action sequences only work because they rely on a very solid characterization we follow the film less for the action than bryans motives and the sympathetic feeling neesons eyes never cease to inspirethe action takes off when kim and her friend amanda are kidnapped by albanian human traffickers luckily kim has enough time to tell bryan that strangers came to the house bryan knows shell be kidnapped he tells her to hide under the closest bed and describe the men with as much details as she can anything can be helpful she leaves a few indications but enough to help bryan to track down the whole network from this point to the end according to bryans friend the albanians started abducting foreign travelers and after four days there are chances kim would be sold and it would be impossible to find him all bryan has are his martial arts skills his intelligence his electronic expertise his fatherly determination and 96 hoursbryan is like a combo or john matrix r in commando or jack bauer from the tv series 24 except that liam neeson has a quality in his acting so efficient that you never see the superhero he is but the determined father without liam neeson there are chances that wouldnt have be as seriously and be reduced to another actionthriller movie with a relatively conventional plot which is actually the case but one casting towering in every meaning of the word all the others is enough to elevate the film into one of the best and most gripping actionthrillers of the 2000s and if not the best it certainly is the most memorable through its capacity to build fresh material out of new stuffa great film consists of three good scenes and no bad scene this is the statement of howard hawks i used in some other reviews many would spot plot holes or unbelievable scenes but one bad scene can only be judged on the way it ruins the whole narrative or make us lose our focus no scene does that foreign clichs action overdose chase their flaws are forgettable because they all work as links between a few great scenes that redeem all the archetypes and there are three great scenes in first in a year rich in impacting movies such as slumdog millionaire milk or the dark knight takes the cake as the most memorable exchange during the infamous fatheranddaughter phone that ends with bryans speech ordering the bad guy whoever he is to release the girl and hell forget everything otherwise hell track him find him and execute him the following good luck with a strong accent is the trigger of bryans chase and makes the confrontation even more electrifying finally bryan contradicts all the stereotypes of the toughguywithprinciples by shooting a harmless woman on the arm and threatens to kill her if her husband doesnt give the information not only we believe he means business but we still like him hell even dirty harry wouldnt have got away with thatthese three moments elevated the film above the usual standards of a simple catandmouse thriller what do they all have in common they rely on the menacing presence of liam neeson and his human look on the eyes this unique capability to look strong and sensitive to inspire our immediate sympathy has me totally offguard and although its not flawless and some characters are either underdeveloped or stereotypical the film has an exhilarating straightforward direction as if the director pierre morel was confident on the movies potential and never tried to overhumanize it bryan mills carries the whole humanityand this is saying a lot for an actionthriller movie hero,reality
probably one of my favourite films ive seen i love every second of it the action the small parts of comedy the strength of characters the use of characters the whole film is very easy to understand it has a clear story and good use of actors only one bad thing to mention why start with the book of photos little bit confusing i really do like this film you just know what hes thinking but in a way that you cannot predict his moves you really get to like his action for his daughter and that no compromise or any change will make him change his mind he is on a mission and he knows how to prove his point specially with a gun pointed at jeane claude p correct me if i have spelt that wrong he clearly knows what he is doing but he cannot do everything in an instant there are parts where timing is key if i had to describe one it would be when he waited for a chance to get inside the apartment and find out clues to find out where his daughter went it went from small clue to other small clue really fantastic story d my opinion i love this film it has good action easy story and fantastic finish i really recommend this film and i love the way it has its ups and downs but it all ends with a good finish  thanks guys and happy reviewing,reality

hello fellow movie goer i am here today to tell you the review of such a great concept for a movie a former cia specialist is troubled by the taking of his daughter by sex traffickers while she goes on a trip to france so he goes out and saves her that is the basic plot of the movie its a cool and actionpacked sounding concept but was it pulled off good nope this movie ended up being not just action packed in a good way but over the top where the dad former cia agent gets in the middle of heated gunfights or fights against 3 or 4 men he barely even receives a scratch now i know not all movies are really realistic but i at least like seeing the protagonist whos fighting struggle a little bit other than the whole conflict also i noticed during the movie that liam nesson who plays as the father kills just about every single person that gets in his way he even shoots his friends wife and almost kills her because the friend has trafficked women before then the father even tells the friend that hed kill his the mas kids too if he didnt help kind of too much right now im not saying its so bad that its unwatchable but in my opinion its just an entertaining rent a one time movie kind of thing so try it out if you think youd like it but if not i completely agree thank you for reading this review,reality
im not a fan of liam neillsonhes always seemed to be a lame duckbut i watched this filmwith my should i go to bedor what else is on all of a sudden i was thrust into as good a movie as i have seenliam is a good guy with a good girl daughterhe is retiredand divorcedshe goes off to paris gets capturedand all hell breaks outhe is ex whateverand what follows is mayhemterrific car chases boat mayhemcrueltya fathers love for his daughterand determination his beloved estranged girl will come backthis is not a loveylovey flick but a hard boiled revenge film that really rattles the boundariesif you dont like a dad killing everyone hurting his baby dont watch,reality
having heard all the talk about how good wasi decided i wanted to see itso when it came on skyfilm 4i decided to give it a tryi really enjoyed this movieyou could really understand and feel sorry for liam neeson as he heard his daughter being even holly valance shows upwhich was nice viewingand a surpriseas i never thought much of her acting abilities to be honestbut i would absolutely recommend this movie to anyone looking for action and excitementit is a good movie to watch and is not a waste of timei had never really paid attention to liam neeson beforebut i would watch other films with him in them as he is a solid and decent convincing actor,reality
this is the best movie ive ever seenits really fantasticthe best critic from methe first time i saw this movie i was really excitedi havent seen better movie beforeit was so realistic that i could see it again and againi must confess that i was really like the actors that were playingi believe that mustnt there are people that werent like this movie because this movie its perfecti highly recommend itfor those that havent see it they must see it and fastvery fastbecause they dont know what they losti havent anything else to say about this moviei just believe that was a really perfectfantasticgreat moviefor this movie always the best critic from me because i love this movie very much,reality
liam neeson plays a retired secret agent whos divorced and has a daughter who lives with his exwife without going into spoilers his daughter is kidnapped and we get to see neeson hunt down the kidnappers and rescue his daughteri thought that one of the strong points of the movie was the realistic setting the bad guys are new slavers in the world  slavery may have been banned in the us long ago but tell that to the girls who are trafficked and forced into prostitution these criminals are real and exist in almost every country and unfortunately society looks the other waypersonifying the person who looks the other way is jeanclaude played by olivier rabourdin who has a wife and two daughters whom he hugs while ignoring and in fact aiding the sex slavery of girls just like themneeson gives a superb performance in the movie hes a great actor who can comfortably act in dramas and action movies with equal easemy only gripe with the movie was that mills neeson was unnecessarily made to defeat all the bad guys by himself as great as neesons acting was that decision was unfortunate considering the realistic setting of the movie we were introduced to several other extremely skilled exsecret agents in the beginning why couldnt they have joined mills four of them against the traffickers would have been believable the director could have gone the action movie route without sacrificing believability,reality
i am curious why reviewers here rate this movie above the bourne trilogy when liam fights his opponents crumple up like folding paper he utilizes oldstyle jujitsu moves and moves stiffly like a middleaged man for some unknown reason he wades in everywhere no matter what the odds he is also invulnerable to bullets as shown by the chaser at the construction site shooting point blank at him and liam just shrugs the bullets away how he knew where the construction site was puzzled me too clearly he loses his head all the time he is in france so why did he not call in his friends and really do a good job,reality
it was an amazing ride with liam neesons best performance so far everyone from the writer to the director made a great job here the story is very interesting and filmed to an optimal running time of 90 minutes the pace is so fast that i and my wife couldnt sleep well all the night because really took us on a very high level this is an example how movies should work today and the box office charts proofs that very clearly thank you very much to all the stuff and i hope very much that there will be soon another from this team i was so sad seeing how all these girls disappears every year in so criminal murder hands its long time ago that i gave such a high vote 910 a great add to my dvd collection,reality
neeson simply carried this film with a no nonsense kick ass approach i have always wanted an action hero to take charge in a realistic way james bond is too comic book but craig comes closest to what neeson does here i love the scene where he blasts first as he seeks answers from the scumbagsmaggie grace was excellent in lost and she plays the same role here several years younger than her actual age and she does it well until she grows out of the perfect 90210 looking babe she will be typecastbut she has real talent so her time will comeunless she wants to do soap operas her entire lifesee this movie if you have not this crap is real and it happens in our world a pretty face is a mixed blessingmaybe more a curse in the long runevery father should own this movie especially of a teen girl thats a looker,reality
the film was a surprise hit from a budget of 25 million this film made 145 million in the american boxoffice and 221 million worldwide it made pierre morels career as a director and some people on imdb have touted him as a potential bond director and shows at the tender age of 56 that liam neeson can be an action star but is this film any good in my opinion sadly notliam neeson plays bryan mills a retired cia agent whom career led to the break up of his marriage and missing important time with his daughter kim maggie grace bryan stay in contact with some of his cia buddies and even does some bodyguard work including saving a young singer played by holly valance kim has just turned 17 and wants to be a singer her friend invites her to go to paris for the summer and follow u2 on their first european tour what 17yearold girl listens to u2 bryan warns her saying that paris is a dangerous place to go but lets her after being in paris for a few hours kim and her friend are kidnapped as happens to every teenage girl who goes to paris and bryan has to use his skills to go use to find his daughter he has 96 hours before kim would be addicted to drugs and never be foundthe good points of the film are there are some good action sequence especially with its budget maggie grace isnt bad playing a teenager and its good to see liam neeson in a leading role even if he has a weird accent thats it the plot is simple i have nothing against simple plots but there is a fine line from simple and enjoyable to completely stupid sex trafficking and the sex trade are complex subjects and are terribly mishandled in this film if it wasnt for the fact that film was directed by a frenchmen and written and produced by luc besson then it could have easily been made by american neocons as i said within hours the girls are kidnapped and that paris is a city unsafe for americans paris is no different to any other city in the world all nonamericans are stereotypes the french are corrupt and there is a very simple black and white morality in this world even if the large amount of torture used it is a very onedimensional world from the setup to the characterisation this is a film for xenophobic americansthe film also plays like an extended episode of the show 24 bryan mills is basically jack bauer who is in a race against time he uses torture to great affect and doesnt seem bothered by the consequences but at least in this film bryan is doing it to find his daughter not on behalf of the american government the action of the film is also much like the action in 24 with elements of paul greengrass bourne films overedited and a lot of shaky cam i dont like that an element i liked was that bryan was an older action hero but seems too good finding things with ease and getting out of situations without many problemsthis film isnt that good i expect better from luc besson he is the man who gave us leon and the fifth element,reality
this is a movie about a guy who does what he says in the most extreme manner possible a father trying to reestablish himself in his daughters life has quit his job and is now living closer to where she is he tries but his ex wife does not seem to care for him much at all from what i got at that birthday party well something comes up a chance for his daughter to take a trip to france with a friend and she needs her dads permission to go to another country against his better judgment he agrees with conditions well they get to france and it is not anytime before the girls do something incredibly stupid and they later end up being as it were by men whose intentions are later spelled out well father now uses what he learned from his old job to track down these men and when he finds them for the most part it is not pretty granted i enjoyed seeing him do it as all these guys are scum the movie has great action and it flows very fast nice to have a film that does not seem long at all it is just fun pulling for this guy to get his hands on the bad guys i think liam neeson being in the movie as the father adds something to this movie as he does a very good job he makes a rather good movie even better just like he did in the movie darkman so for a movie with lots of action some thrills and a few tense moments is your movie,reality
one of the best action flicks ive seen highly recommend this movie if you like intense action films i thought neesons characters overbearing protectiveness was a little excessive but that was the only thing i could find to complain about and that isnt much lots of great chase scenes brawls and shootouts not sure just how accurate the portrayal of the sex slaving industry is but it seemed fairly believable to me the bad guys seemed genuinely evil and got what they deserved i never figured neeson for an action star before but he came through with flying colors in my opinion im hoping they make some kind of sequel id watch it for sure,reality
i liked this movie lots of action suspense car chases fistfights and gun totin baddies i was dismayed to imagine that young people traveling abroad are in danger of being abducted and no one seems to be doing anything about it i hope thats not true i like a fastpaced movie and this certainly fit the bill good fatherdaughter scenes would watch this movie again  probably several times i am a true liam neeson fan and wish he made more movies michael collins is my favorite along with rob roy in which tim roth  now of lie to me fame  plays the best and most evil guy ever and coming soon the red circle with orlando bloom i give this movie 9 out of 10  for action suspense and generally good acting famke janssen is great as the exwife and olivier rabourdin is great as the hapless french exspy desk sitter jeanclaude only criticism car chases and fights were too obscure better car chases in ronin,reality
when albanians kidnap his daughter while she is with her friend in paris former agent bryan millsliam neeson will hunt for them find them and kill them simple as that the film follows his pursuit of every last scumbag involved with doping up his teenage daughter preparing her for prostitution even discovering that members of french police are involvedincluding an agent he knew while in the field almost everyone involved in this network of trafficking female tourists the albanian lowlifes who kidnap and pimp the girlsincluding those responsible for selling virgins including kim to a wealthier clientle and anyone else connected with this despicable business bryan eliminates he warned them and they wouldnt listenfor a pg13 film this is very violent with neeson in incredible form and absolutely convincing as a specialist in combative techniques trained to quickly upend the enemy he mentions to his daughter when she asks of his profession and bryan says that the title was a preventer and his mission is to secure the package which is her he doesnt prevent the carnage that is inflicted on those who made the unfortunate mistake of taking his daughter is a film obviously influenced in regards to the coldblooded and swift actions of the hero as many films have been as of late by the bourne series because director pierre morel shoots the fight scenes with quick cuts and the camera often moves at a frenzied pacebryans moves are so fast it almost takes your breath away because before his adversaries can engage in combat their bodies are dropped to the floor a sharp thrust to the throat or abdomen knocking them for a loop the race against time aspect reminded me of william friedkins the hunted because bryan is always on the move every action devoted to rescuing his daughterlike tommy lee jones seeking after killer benicio del toro hardly stopping to relax as time was of the utmost importance no dawdling is allowed while morel makes an effort to show little actual flesh damage from weapons firedmore blood spray on walls most of the violence is of a physical nature bryan pulvarising foes at an alarming speed the plot setup might burden the more actionhungry fans but i appreciated the decision to develop the dynamics of the fatherdaughter relationship and how his strained feelings with exwife lenorefamke janssenhave undermined bryans intentions to make up for lost time thanks to his overwhelming job in the field protecting the country how bryan succeeds in his mission is really a pleasure to behold and neesons effective performance really adds a great deal to discovering what happens to kidnapped girls drugged for prostitution is horrifying and you can sympathize with why bryan is so dedicated to wiping out this whole disgusting operation a certified crowdpleaser critics reevaluated this action thriller after it become a big hit,reality
i saw not expecting much just another routine action movie but it was better than expected liam neeson does a great job as bryan mills a former preventer spy who retired so he can be closer to his daughter and make up for time he lost with her mills quickly finds himself in a race against time to save his kidnapped daughter whose been sold into a sex slave trade in paris neeson continues to show his skills as an actor especially in the actionfight sequences with movies like rob roy schindliers list batman begins and seraphim falls neeson continues to show his talent as an actor in the rest of the cast are admirable in their roles including maggie grace leland orser xander berkely and famke janssen in a brief cameo appearance the movie does have some intense action and fist fights that are well executed as neesons mills wages a one man war against the men who have his daughter in order to save her from a terrible fate director pierre morel did a great job of making more than just your routine action movie at the heart of the film is a story about a fathers love for his daughter and how far hed be willing to go to save her morel keeps that story at the center while giving audiences some cool action sequences for guilty pleasure if youre a fan of these type of movies then youll also enjoy with just enough action suspense thrills and some surprises is sure to please anyone looking for a good movie to watch,reality
prior to seeing i had no real expectations i knew what the plot was about basically but for the most part i thought it was a great filmliam neesan plays a man who once worked for the government in forensics or something his daughter goes on a trip to europe and gets kidnapped by a group of guys that put girls on drugs and then use them as prostitutes neesans character then goes off to rescue his daughter using all of his abilities that he possessesi thought the plot was simple and worked neesan loves his daughter and is great at forensic stuff so him going off to rescue his daughter was interesting and exciting at the same time great story one that is quite similar to that of commando except this time it is a former forensic guy not a former military guyliam neesan is great in this film his calm and composed character fits well in this film and makes him a guy who you can cheer for i think he was great in both batman begins and the phantom menace but i think this is easily his best performance in a film nowthe action is pretty good too there are great shooting scenes as well as great hand to hand combat scenes some of the better action in a film that has been made in recent yearsi also think that the overall message and theme of the film is great it shows what a father will do for his daughter most fathers can probably relate to this film and how a guy will do anything for his daughterso i really liked this film it has great action a great theme great story and a great performance by liam neesan i recommend it greatly,reality
this is the first movie in years where the trailer is not better then the movie many people would think an action movie with liam neeson wouldnt be good but he was perfectly cast this movie is the exact template for anyone wanting to write produce or direct an action movie it has a plot you can follow dialog that is not over the top and a lead actor who can both act and surprise youwhat makes this movie good are the reasons classically trained critics hated this movie its plot had a beginning middle and end it was believable and not over the top critics today dismiss any movie that doesnt have more plot layers then an onion in a movie such as this you dont need all thatthe best part of the movie is liam neeson he was perfectly cast in this roll mainly because cant picture him as an action star he seems like the ordinary dad next door type however in the movie this is whom his character is and when you see him jump in a cab to beat a guys ribs to pieces you are left with a shear wow he is also an action star who can act when he goes ape on a guy because he wants his daughter back you believe himthis movie has the triple crown,reality
is a movie that you can go to and just escape for an hour and a half in the fast paced style of 24 liam neeson plays an ex government agent who knows how to get results the film took the time to engage us with the characters and especially the relationship between the father and daughterit made the pursuit a personal rescue mission rather than just a vendettaalthough the plot was somewhat predictable who couldnt see the kidnapping coming when the daughter lied about her proposed museum trips in europe it was still very entertaining the pop singer touch was nice toogo see it and enjoy,reality
i saw this film a month ago and it was an excellent one i had to take a minute to comment on it you would probably think that this movie would be a rental but its worth going to the movies for this one the storyscreenplay is great and really keeps you engaged i dont want to give away anything so ill just say the action and the thrill are the selling points of the movie the time spent on characters is perfect its a great entertainment the directioncamerasetsimagery work was simple and could have been more enhanced through the use of cutting edge technology nonetheless it was a great movie a must see 8 out of 10,reality
is a great movie which will always be remembered as a blockbuster and a powerhouse performance by liam neesonbut there is one point that i recognize after few years if someone saw this movieits greatness will not be realized as it is today as the timing of release of this movie makes it a much much better treat to watchfrom last few months we have been deprived of true action packed thriller like bourne series or mission impossible seriesall we got were superhero movies or romantic movies the release of among those genre makes it much more different moviei have seen tons of action movies but due to the gap i was much more entertained as everit looked something different although it wasnthats off for the studio at brilliant decision of release date months later after it was released in europeon its own as wellintroduces us with another angle and dimension of the great liam neesonthe action is a but it becomes better with emotions of fatherdaughter love conveyed by neesonif you are fan of actionthrillers dont miss this movie it fills the tank of our appetite for an action movieits worth watching in theater and even better to watch at home with family and snacks,reality
i will have to say that i thought was a pretty good action flick once it gets going just about 1520 minutes into the film the action becomes fast paced and nonstop all the way to the endliam neeson does a good job here playing the tough exoperative almost everything is believable although there are some minor points where plausibility is lost certain aspects of the film are almost too convenient as well as rushed thats the worst i can say hereall in all the film keeps you on the edge of your seat and doesnt let you down for a second that being said there is some room for improvement but a pretty good film over alli dont know if i would say that it tops the bourne films thats a gray area for me what i can say is that most will enjoy it and will not be disappointed,reality
liam neeson and give us something we rarely see these daysa real toughguy action hero in the tradition of charles bronson bruce willis and clint eastwood before clint became a pussifist er i mean pacifist writing as a lifelong clint eastwood fan since my first clint eastwood movie a fistful of dollars i say skip gran torino if you want to see a great action flick that is not trying to make a statement but just flatout entertain you go see if youve already seen gran torino and came away feeling unsatisfied as i did go see and youll realize what was missing in gran torino i cant remember the last time i went to a movie and the audience applauded at the end of the moviethat was my experience with i hope everyone will go see while it is still in the theaters,reality
is a great action movie which is a rare thing these daysusually the action movies these days have great visual and sound effects but fall flat on face when it comes to screenplay and performance the last good  visual and sound effects only great good  screenplay and performance action movie was wanted in other words the backbone of this movie is liam neeson first of all it was surprising to see somebody of his age 56 to be performing carrying such stunts so well then his dialog delivery which reminds of his smooth and elegant performance in schindlers list the 1st 20 minutes of the movie are a bit of stretch even though it sets the foundation for the movie but then every director has his own style there again you could see the liam neeson from love actually and thats what keeps you still interested in the movie anybody watching the movie can make what might be in the book and how it might be written all in all a great action movie at the start of the yearhope there are more great ones ahead and not just good ones,reality
the first thing i do after watching the movie i liked is reading comments of those who hated it just to see what might i miss and you know to get the other opinion and i have to say some of you are right all these things in the movie just sort of a happen rich stepfather spy father icecold mother and so onso why ten because i can even imagine what would i have done when receiving such a phone call from my daughter so i was just watching this unstoppable daddy going through the thing like a razor that is what i would like to do i could definitely feel the fury of this character i guess that is whyplus it somehow reminded me of die hard plus liam neeson plus the speed an the thrilli think it is a great movie of its kind,reality
i knew this movie would be good just from the previewsliam does an excellent job playing as a retired cia assassin the film brings to light a growing problem in the world the problem is human slaveryapparently it happens a lot in france the director was definitely pointing towards muslims from albania as the main pushers and buyers of the slaves i know dubai has a history sex slavery and perhaps the director wants to say whos doing it with out fear by releasing the movie in english and america so he wont be censored from telling the truth this reminds me of rambo there was so much anger in that movie just as in this dont mess with people especially if you dont know what their capable of and of course the bad guys find out they messed with the wrong guy excellent movie 1010 a lot of action but not over the top,reality
this movie is great i have to say i did not expect it to be as good as it was acting was really good and the action was great i really liked the story line and it was laid out so perfectly i was on the edge of my seat all the way through the bad guys are so bad you dont care they dont get any mercy from brian liam neeson i really loved this movie its rare for me to see a flick that makes me want to tell everyone about it its rare for me to see a movie that i am not ready to leave or turn of half way in only bad thing i have to say about this movie is that some of the loose ends are not tied up at the end other than that its kick ,reality
liam neeson delivers an excellent performance in this movie giving us a cold calculating intelligence agent and loving father without resorting to any sort of hackneyed acting tricks the script likewise avoids such obvious displays of his hard edge like kicking a puppy or something like thatthe main story is straight from the headlines and while it may or may not be accurate in its details it does give us something to rally behind and so we dont mind that neeson resorts to trickery and outright brutality in his quest to find his daughter some might call it pandering but since scumbag slavers do exist in real life i dont mind being pandered to herethe action sequences while a little too quick with the editing show a lot of thought neeson uses whatever is at his disposal to end the fight quickly and there are no idiotic quips or comments hes there to do a job and talking just gets in the waytop notch effort from all involved and certainly the best movie to come out of luc besson in a whilethis movie is well worth watching on the big screen,reality
just wondering how the movie will affect the travelers who planned a vacation to french if paris is really that corrupted id say thanks to the production team for warning me from traveling to paris lol well apart from being an excellent action thriller is a serious movie took the topic of kidnappingprostitution business in one of the most civilized countryfrence the makers definitely took the position of a international prosecutor who punishes everyone in this industry the story is about an excia agentliam neeson who was estranged from his family and got divorced years ago had to allow his 17yearold daughter to travel around europe with no guardians he eventually found his daughter kidnapped by an international prostitution organization traced the steps of his daughter he had to risk everything he had and probably everything french people had to save her this is not a new kind of story what amuses me is the undertone of the movie which is loudly blowedout selfrighteousness and revenge against the corruption of a nation yes thats right a nation every class and everyone is involved in the crimes committed in this movie from the slum smalltimes to the ones behind the desk from illegal immigrants to the billionaires the movie is an outrageous accuse to the ignorant system of paris with such social commentary is suddenly differentiated from its homogeneous movies maybe thats also why its rated 8010 on imdbmy rating910 recommend to everyone who thinks hes a good person,reality
when i first saw a teaser for this movie i wasnt sure id see it and then i saw a real preview and had to wait for it to come to theaters well i finally saw it and i was definitely not disappointed as with most action movies if you try to look at it as if it were real life it wont work but taking it for what its supposed to bea great action filmwill leave you satisfiedonce the momentum gets up to speed with this movie it doesnt rest so be preparedi loved every minute and plan to drag everyone i can to see itbottom lineif youre looking for a great action film this is a spectacular choice,reality
before going to the showing of this at my local theater i looked at the reviews on imdb i always look at the lovehate category to get both ends of the review spectrum for films the good reviews promised good action and a great mr neeson the bad reviews state that this film is a retread of all the other lame action movies coming out of this drab cinema periodwhile the film is entirely predictable and formulaic in its approach it never fails to thrill you will never find yourself uninterested in what is going on in the film liam neeson pulls off being both dangerous and gentle simultaneously his daughter is the most annoying character but neesons acting is superb enough that he makes you think he actually loves her and feels the need to rescue herthis film may not wow you with its plot or character development but it will entertain you better than any number of action films to come out recently think jason bourne except larger and more realistic,reality
is a great movie and distinctive among modern action movies combining more realistic heartthumping action scenes with a straightforward story line i find it tiresome when a film has nonstop gratuitous action that is unrealistic pompous and too drawn out i thought quantum of solace fell into this category although it was not as bad as something like charlies angels in terms of exaggerated effects by contrast i thought the action scenes in worked really well in a suspense movie that steadily lets the mystery unfoldthe continual suspense is presented in an easytofollow manner that naturally leads to the next stage liam neeson plays bryan mills a semiretired cia agent whose daughter kim maggie grace wants to go to paris for a while ostensibly to visit museums but later it is revealed that she and her friend want to trail u2 on the rock groups full european tour mills was reluctant to let her go in the first place in conflict with his exwife lenore thats bond woman famke janssen the characters have some personality but mills is a regular guy and there is no overdwelling on their psychology i could meet dark knight halfway on the psychology but i thought it went too far mills remains skeptical about the trip and then finds that kim has been kidnapped into an albanian sexslave ring thats the way i like it good guys versus bad guys i had a similar sort of visceral satisfaction as in delta force in which chuck norris really gives it to the terroriststhe movies intensive action is mostly in close quarters a room an elevator a car or just a regular facetoface confrontation skillful filming and sharp editing give scenes an aura of believability besides mills is an agent skilled in handtohand combat helping us believe he does mostly oneonone nailings but he dishes it out to a few groups of bad guys too the fighting and shooting scenes are not padded or overblown and the viewer is left with the sense that the filmmakers were relying more on coordination and execution of quick movements than on special effects as for wideopen action scenes mills in a fastpaced realistic sequence chases down a villain who falls onto a lower highway wideopen action scenes in quantum and some other movies contain too many unbelievable stunts in quantum eg exaggerated jumps from buildings or to other buildings,reality
greetings again from the darkness was actually looking forward to seeing liam neeson in an action movie  especially one written by luc besson unfortunately just didnt find this very believable though the basis for the story is frightening and fascinatingcurious as to why 25 yr old maggie grace was cast as 17 yr old kim arent there any actresses available who actually look that age did enjoy the hyperenergetic thrill seeking character of amanda played by david cassidys daughter katie cassidyone of my pet peeves in action movies is when the hero can scrunch his shoulders a bit and turn his head while successfully dodging automatic gunfire liam would have been killed a few times especially in the car and on the yachti did find liams character interesting because of his simmering passion toward the captors and those in his way reminded a bit of matt damon as jason bourne still for a dad digging into the underworld to rescue his daughter ill take paul schraders 1979 hardcore with george c scott while nowhere near the oneman demolition team that neeson is scott really captures the disgust that a dad would feel,reality
the best movie of the year so far but the year is young nellson is a great actor nellsons stage presence of an angry father drives the movie nellsons character is an ex special forces operative whose daughter is kidnapped nellsons daughter is by a prostitution ring when dad arrives to france the storys event become messy nellson gets nasty in this movie too many scumbags nellson has a few good one liners a great action movie 8 out of 10 worth seeing why did nellson not use the help of his buddies is a good question for the film his ex wife turns out to be an awful woman she just treats him like garbage,reality
i saw this last night and thought it was an excellent movie much along the lines of man on fire but less bloody and violent the acting was terrific and the suspense will keep you on the edge of your seat you will leave this movie feeling satisfied and complete  no cliff hanger no unfinished business the story is well told straight forward and they kept the action believable and not too outrageous i have always like liam neeson as an actor and he was the perfect selection for this part  calm demeanor yet you can feel the rage he has inside makes you wonder what you would do if your daughter was in that situation all in all i would highly recommend if you like a good revenge movie with a lot of suspense action and terrific acting,reality
i just watched this movie few minutes agoslow pace at first but later youll be driven by your adrenaline as you go alongevery pumping of your heart wants that the movie will end up good yet it is i just cant imagine myself as playing the role of the actor here by yourself youll be entering the dark side of the world trying to capture back your daughter of course although in the real picture of life this would be somewhat impossible but definitely the story would remind us that as fathers although youve broken your family in the matrimony of marriageyet the sole responsibility of the father still exists hope this would a lesson to children not to disobey their parents since most of the time they know what is the best youll love this i like most the story and the way the actor moves himself two thumbs up great,reality
neeson has never been better considering his age if neeson was any younger the action would have been at top level i wanted to watch every second of this movie and it is rare for me it is as good as the dark knight 1 man dynasty unstoppable like the joker and gets what he wants the story and plot was 1010 the action was 1010 neeson 1010 only bad thing was they made neeson look immortal going anywhere and killing anyone he wants but overall this will probably be the best of 2009 if not one of the top 5 this movie is a must watch enough saidmore movies like this need to be made with a younger main character,reality
 brian is divorced but still deeply loves his daughter consequently hes very protective of her and doesnt want her to go to france brian relents and sure enough the daughter is kidnapped in france and he goes in to bust some heads and rescue her also along for the ride is famke janssen as the bitchy exwife lenore and thats about as much of a character as she getslook theres not a whole lot in this film that has not been done before your taste for this is limited to how much you enjoy liam neeson knocking out killing or otherwise incapacitating 50 or 60 people as unbelievable as that soundsno strike it its just largely unbelievable there are many things that are unbelievable in this film such as killing so many people in another country no less with no repercussions also the various technological devices used to get brian from points a to b to c border on magic but the fights are so pretty and hard and fastliam neeson does a decent turn as brian i love his attempt at an american accent i hope it replaces arnolds voice in popularity in the 21st century its hard to believe his able to go from mildly overprotective humble giant to frank castle in the course of a plane trip but those who have lost family members in the past are free to dispute that his willingness to put innocents in similar predicaments does him for favors in my eyes thoughin the end we learn four crucial lessons from this 1 never go to a foreign country 2 foreign countries only want to sell our women for prostitution 3 over protective fathers are always right and 4 a fathers love for his daughter extends to using torture on others to ensure her safety why oh why do we have a film advertising torture days after a new president bans its use sigh i just had to laugh afterwards all the film needed at the end was a this could happen to you fun fast simpleminded and hardedged just dont go in expecting any life lessons whatsoever b,reality
this is an incredibly surprising movie while i recognize the skill and abilities brought to the table by liam neeson i was somewhat skeptical when i thought of him in his kind of a role all i can say is i have never been so wrong neeson brings an amazing character to life that is believable and fresh he completely outshines daniel craig in quantum of solace and grabs you almost at the very beginningwhile the subject matter is disturbing it has an aura of realism that makes you connect with the characters be with neeson the whole journey i found myself at the end satisfied  while the movie is only 93 minutes luc besson has found that sweet spot when it comes to having just the right time for the storyline time to connect and care about the characters yet not bored with an overly gratuitous and meaningless plot,reality
it has been a long time since we had a character like bryan mills played surprisingly and convincingly by liam neeson in we have become a movie watching public which has been brain washed by the bourne movies and to a lessor extent the dialog heavy action films of tarantino that have come out lately they give us 2 plus hrs of yakking extraneous inner turmoil and brooding every now and then some action thrown in to keep us from falling asleep we have been convinced that for us to feel for these men and women we must get inside their mind we must see them hurt and struggle with the monster they are it has been a long time perhaps since the days of segal younger and thinnerhacking through guys like scissors through paper that we had a an action hero who kicks ass and shows absolutely no mercy or regret and doesnt spend half the movie trying to reconcile the monster within there is no time for such frivolity bryan has a job to do in and all that brooding and reconciling can be done by others bryan only has 96hrs to get his daughter back or loose her forever so he harnesses the power of the beast he has within him and god help anyone in his way bryan mills is a dad who regrets his time missed with his daughter but doesnt sit around brooding on it his exwife is now married to a guy with lots of money she does everything she can to bust his balls bryan is pressured by his exwife into allowing their daughter to head off to paris with a friend this is where the real movie starts she is kidnapped not long after her arrival and before we have a chance to blink bryan is in paris cutting a bloody path to find where his daughter is he is told most girls with the intent to sell them into slavery are out of the country within 96hrs there is no time in those 96hrs to worry about what might happen he uses any and all means at his disposal to hunt down kill maim torture etc those responsible for his daughters abduction the director pierre morel who cut his teeth as the lens man on action films such as the first transporter turns his star loose and neeson gives a performance i didnt know he had in him written by luc beeson the architect behind the transporter films has woven a very tight 93 minute film that doesnt waste time with extraneous brooding but fills every minute with adrenaline pumping action and revenge great stuff,reality
the fact that this movie has already been released in other parts of the world for a better part of a year now should be a major red flag i mean if the movie was good or at least the studio execs thought it was good it wouldve been premiered in the united states right after viewing it i can see why it wasntimproper character development campy dialog and bad acting especially by the daughter played by maggie grace  you know shannon from lost hamper the overall enjoyment of this movie i didnt care about a single character in this film and i think thats pretty important check out the daughters running skills every time she has to run she looks like  well just check it out its ridiculousthat being said i still enjoyed the action sequences and seeing liam neeson kick some ass was surreal  yet believable some of the more violent scenes were pretty brutal which is refreshing to see in this current watereddown hollywood climateall in all i was entertained by the movie is no bourne identity but it worth a video rental when it comes out on dvd,reality
great fun lots of silly bits and plenty of but he wouldnt have been able to and but they would have none of which matterbut why of why didnt they end it with neeson and his daughter hugging sobbing in the master bedroom of the boat your hearts beating adrenaline pumping even getting into the silly emotion then of course they give you the happy airport reunion even step dad saying anything you need and oh god they even go and give you the lets see what you got just takes away so much from what theyve built up over 15 hours bloody studio crapbut why of why didnt they end it with neeson and his daughter hugging sobbing in the master bedroom of the boat your hearts beating adrenaline pumping even getting into the silly emotion then of course they give you the happy airport reunion even step dad saying anything you need and oh god they even go and give you the lets see what you got just takes away so much from what theyve built up over 15 hours bloody studio crap,reality
i thought this movie was terrific it seemed so realistic the only 1 problem i had was with the acting neesons family in the movie obviously his daughter in the film got the role because she was somebodys kid or niece or lovechild you know what i mean his daughter in the film had to have been retarded her acting was horrible i mean horrible she runs and i mean runs around the movie like a retard i am not trying to be offensive but watch it and you will know what i am talking about why would the director tell an 18 year old girl to run likes shes 3 years old then maybe im wrongthe director is retarded what i am trying to say is that somebody is retarded in this film they could have done without the wife and step father they should have picked a better actress to play neesons daughter in this film either way the movie is great and worth watching but i cant explain how much the acting of his daughter drove me nuts i hope she reads this comment and decides to get help in the form of a jerry lewis telethon,reality
ah i notice some critics are making a fuss about racial stereotypes etc sure the bad guys are albanians but they also include arabs french and americans besides neeson is irish so im at a loss over the strange politically correct beating the film is takingthis is a solid action film that fans of the bourne movies will really get a kick out of relentless in its action and violence especially because neeson plays a father who would stop at nothing to get his daughter back though be patient as it is a slow starteryes it isnt entirely believable but im sure very realistic spy stories are really boring to complain that this stretches the truth is akin to putting bourne or bond under the same scrutiny so ignore the bad press this is a good if bleak action movie,reality
i do totally agree with the writer before its a truly magnificent action and a pretty decent and above all straight thriller no spoilers no mistakes here with imdb   and edges or dead ends only a  even though simple  quick and reasonable plotbut i honestly would have guessed liam doing such stunning martialarts although i count on him to perform many more of those scenes and films by now i mean was he doing all the stunts and kicks and so on by himself since he did some boxing in his early days or was he taught it just on the setas for me the only little flaw is the end where i would have expected not such a sugar sweet happy end but rather some additional showdown or even a bitter ending having him to die after saving her finally or something like that because how would his life go on he first became active after her kidnapping because then he could be what he was always doing so wouldnt it have been logically to let him die at the end so to speak after he has performed his duty but thats it already with my critique what makes the movie still a very fine one to my mind,reality
contains no more spoilers than in a magazine review but then again if youre sensitive dont readafter listening in his cell phone to the sound of his seventeen year old daughter being dragged away and brutally kidnapped by unknown brutes the former special forces agent ryan liam neeson quietly waits until somebody picks up the phone then he says i dont know who you are i dont know what you want if you are looking for ransom i can tell you i dont have money but what i do have are a very particular set of skills skills i have acquired over a very long career skills that make me a nightmare for people like you if you let my daughter go now thatll be the end of it i will not look for you i will not pursue you but if you dont i will look for you i will find you and i will kill youa few quiet seconds pass before a voice in the other end replies good luck if this sounds exciting to you its just the beginning is one of those rare gems in its genre a simple and wonderfully well crafted action movie where liam neeson plays previously mentioned exspy a mediocre and somewhat pitiful man that while spending a career for his country has been neglecting his family now when the marriage is broken and the daughter already is seventeen he bravely attempts good fatherhood even though he barely knows who his daughter is these days and even though the exwife hates him and has remarried with a rich square who buys the daughter a horse as a sweet seventeengiftthe whole shabang gets rolling when our antihero is forced to agree to his daughter going for a trip overseas to paris with her best friend  even though daddy through paranoia or supernatural knowledge about the future sense trouble the minute she sets foot in paris she is abducted by horrible villains connected to the trafficking industry  and our friend liam has to give up what hes bad at buying birthday gifts and start doing what he does best  knock off bad guysbecause after that theres just one direction and that is full throttle dead ahead the revengerescueaction blows high in the sky  neeson is undeniably great as a well dressed rambo when he in one white knuckle sequence after another tracks down the big shots bigger shots biggest shots even bigger shot passing all limits of rage to stack up the bad guys in a body pile and bring back his daughterluc besson had a finger in the screenplay and you can tell for one thing the setup is beautifully done for its genre that james cameronish formula where you as quick as possible set up the score which takes about fifteen minutes and then hit the pedal to the floor but there is a human edge to the story too many people have had complaints about the boring first part of the movie but it serves a point neeson gets time enough to make a nice and believable portrait in the beginning and that is why we like him through the rest of the movie and that is also why we totally agree that his every act of violence is well justifiedapart from that theres no need to think too much in this movie  one great holdontoyouradrenalinscene follows another its the dark knight on a vendetta bourne with balls james bond not with a vodka martini but with a big damn scotch on the rocks  and when the 90 minutes suddenly have passed you get that feeling you get when the rollercoaster ride has stopped  already over better get back in line i mean jeez we just have to do this one more timeno action fan alive can miss this film there is one line in particular that concludes the experience we can negoboom,reality
very good old school action flick liam neeson is very convincing in his role as estranged father and exintelligence operative who uses the skills of his profession to find his daughter who was abducted in paris there are some raised eyebrows how can someone who dont speaks french pretend to be a french cop but this should not keep anyone to watch this tour de forceeven more surprising was that there dont where any trailers or big adds and i have to admit that only the names of liam neeson and luc besson got my attention otherwise i would have missed a great moviein my opinion the best action movie this year so far,reality
it is a great movie excellent actor liam neeson he displays his character in such a way that you always know that he has for sure what to do next step his only concern is for rescue his daughter and to do justice at any price it is such a great movie that moves me to register in imdb i think that he displays a wonderful known for fighting he always is in the exact place at the exact moment and never seems to fear what is going to happen next minute also you can appreciate the love existing between he and his daughter you know that she is waiting for him and that she is excting to see his father rescuing her and also enjoying being with him after tough moments,reality
liam neeson had been a young irish boxing champion at the age of 15more than 40 years down the line he shows the world that he is still good enoughin his character is that of a former spy who is capable of tearing apart an entire prostitution racket which kidnapped his daughterhe is relentless in his pursuit and lethaldelivering serious damage to all those who are part of the unholy nexus in this movieunlike most reviews i would not consider this movie as a bourneesque action thrillerneesons action scenes are more in line with that of daniel craigs bond in casino royalethe difference is that neeson is a loving father and when a man of his skills is bent on taking revenge hell does break losethe scenes of young girls being raped and tortured are intensely dark and horrifying and the brutal rage perpetrated by neeson against the offenders is glorious in its furyneeson is indeed called rambo by one of his cronies early in the movie more as a friendly banterbut the demolition that follows justifies this nicknameif you love action dont miss this,reality
was the action movie of 2008 the first reason why it was an ultimately great movie is because it was the type of movie that kept you on the edge and you just could not take your eyes away from the movie theatre screen also the actors that were starring in the movie did a great job of luring the people in and basically did a fantabulous job in the acting its self therefore they picked out a great location for the movie i mean who does not love paris france its marvelousness but it shows that it can also be a dangerous placefor example storyline that the director pierre morel put together for this movie was great because it kept you wanting to know what going to happen next furthermore when you have a a bunch of people like just so drawn into the movie you have done a great job i know that when i was watching it with my parents i was like on the edge of my seat just anxious to to what is going to happen in the end it is a great action movie also they did great on keeping it action and not go from action to like horror movie i find that its a bit harder to find good action movies because people do not always do great stunts but they did great at making a really good action movie like jumping off roofs and throwing like grenadesand shooting warsespecially the actors did great with acting you define toy got the feeling were as the were like in the actual situation and not just acting out for fun now a days people dont really take pride in there work to really strive do do a great job but bryan mills  liam nesson did great a being not only be a dad but a great agent kim maggie grace who is actually born the same day as me did great at being the girl who was by the french gang men did great as being anxious and wanting to get out and did an abundantly high pitched scream in the movie about four or five times if i were her my throat would of hurt right away additionally lenore  famke janseen the lady who plays brians exwife and kims mom you could see that she really had the motherly instinct in her when her daughter was she really would do anything to get her back to safety in the end all the actors in the movie did an enormously exravagant job in this movie probably there best of all timeon the other hand most parents might not approve of the film because of how there is kidnapping but its apart of the world and its function kidnapping is not a great thing but its what makes the movie the movie because thats were you get the action of the movie because the dad wants his daughter back and the get into a whole gun fit the leader of the groups son gets killed and the leader wants revenge over brian for killing his son in other ways i can kind of see way parents dont want there hidden to see it but they can go to the movies themselves and watch it and they will not have to worry about all the bad things that are going to happen during the beginning middle part of the movie there is a solution to there there worriesin addition who ever picks the location for this movie did a outstanding job because who does not live paristh all the old buildings and highways available they did great the buildings were old look and when you would see them jumping off the roofs it was really cool because there are many different sized buildings and they would get stuck in the close lines because many people there live in apartments and air dry there clothing although its in paris and is an action you can still get to see a little bit of paris it self and and what it has to offer for moviesnevertheless why not watch if you want to watch a good action movie this the movie for you and for anyone really in the future not all movie are going to this extravagant so people should take sometime to watch a great movie at least once in there life all i really have to say is this movie is a good action movie for anyone who is willing to watch this movie this movie is a good movie even for a family night out to the movies and dinner but if you have a young child that gets scared easily don not go to watch this movie other than that its a good movie,reality
my list of great movies usually doesnt include action movies but more of the movies with depth and tactical plots and the likes however is by far one of the very smart movies if one looks closely to details like for instance i havent seen any of peter morrels before but there are details in the directing that shows brilliance like when neeson is trying to barge in the apartment from which his daughter got kidnapped and while he is crossing from one window to another holding the upper edge of the outwall you can see clearly that the director focused on his eye wrinkles to show the effort of trying to impossibly hold on to his fingertips not to fall such details  only people who pay attention to the directors effort can notice them not to mention the shooting of some scenes were so masterfully like when neeson is having the last fight with the man on the yacht and when he takes the drugged girl from the albanians additionally there is the tracing process that he does and there were details which my friends didnt notice like when he gives the paper with the phrase good luck but in albanian and pretends to want to know the translation he listens carefully to the voices of all the guys and then he picks the one he suspects he wished him good luck when kidnapped his daughter also the way he notices the spotter on his daughters mobile simcard and when he shoots his friends wife in the hand  all the cold blood neeson kills with is so believable because its his only daughter who we can see clearly from the beginning of the movie that she is his life so the story connects so well and makes all the action that i heard one of the commentators laughing at so believable and needs some kind of a certain intelligence to grasp the whole concept of the movie and by the way all spy movies are so stupid that they dont focus on the character of the spy and the skills he usually has as much as they focus on the stupid action like in john woos stupid action movies and james bond its the first spy character that really can exhibit a set of skills that make you wish you were a spy they way he reacts to how his daughter is being kidnapped while she is with him on the phone the attention to details the use of language the mobile tracking while the french police tries to locate him the driving of the car the usage of syringe to help heal the drugged girl torturing techniques the negotiation with drug dealers god i just loved this movie and i love liam neeson for he is really really and by far one of the greatest actors from schindlers list to ethan frome stunning performance to suspect with cher and many others it really annoys me so much that some of the people dare to criticize his accent bluntly is this the kind of criticism where you insult the whole movie industry by ignoring the performance and shedding the light on the accent such people usually dont really have any idea about movies actors directors writers and they really dont understand anything but they are bitter enough to go waste their time eating popcorn and making fun of good movies to give their friends some good laughs thank god they are usually few,reality
its hard to describe how much i enjoyed this movie its absolutely the best film ive seen at a movie theater in quite a long time anyone who doesnt like this picture is probably an evil person and a supporter of white slavery jokeis a throwback to earlier simpler times when action movies were good and rightwing and the plot left no ambiguity as to whether the hero of the picture was right or wrong in his pursuit of extreme justice i found myself on the edge of my seat many timesthe writers really know how to push the right emotional buttons first with neesons horrible exwife then with his warnings becoming prophetic and again with the ruthless search for his daughter she really didnt deserve a father like thisim glad that the filmmakers resisted the temptation to turn the girl he rescued for information into a tagalong sidekick like the one that spoiled other action movies like commando 8mm and 3000 miles to gracelandthis is the first french movie that ive seen in a long time that didnt have at least one scene that pandered to islamic andor leftist groups however ill admit that the wealthy arabs being white slavers aspect was a bit clich and probably offensive to middle easternersthe only thing i can think of that would have made this even better was during the scene where neeson triumphantly returned with his daughter if he would have the time to tell off his exwife,reality
halfway through this movie i turned to my wife and said someone screwedup she asked what i meant and i replied someone should have tapped out liam neeson to play james bond my favorite bond has always been sean connery the way neeson played his character in this movie i could have imagined connery playing the same role twenty years ago they both have that charismatic style to put their enemies at ease just long enough to get within striking distanceive always enjoyed liams performances from excalibur rob roy star wars and every thing else i dont think ive ever seen him in a bad performance maybe a bad movie krull but not a bad performanceif the powersthatbe ever decide to get away from the bad boy bond and back to the classic style then they need to look at this movie the only thing missing was someone to say that he no longer had a license to kill,reality
i dont want to spoil this film at all just rent it or buy it just simply excellent brilliant liam neeson at his best this is so fast paced and does not stop at all until the end creditsjust read the rest of the user commentsliam neeson is trying to save his daughter this film scares you a bit daughter goes on holiday to paris with a friend and something bad happens liam goes and rescues her dont want to say anything else simply brilliant the film brings you right in and you are cheering him on for getting a step closer liam neeson is like a jack bauer 24 like series 1 make sense get itone of the best films ever definitely a movie for your collectionsimply brilliant filmexcellentamazingand i dont have shares in the movieamazingbrilliant,reality
this movie has it all even a surprisingly good storyline most action films are full of explosions with a weak plot this movie is not like that at all the script is very well written the dialog is fantastic and the characters are well developed being the great actor he is liam neeson does a superb job of simultaneously depicting a loving father and a force to be reckoned with you sympathize with liams character bryan mills in the beginning but quickly realize he needs no pity at all as he has the training and skill of 007 he loves his daughter more than anything and will hence do anything for her i do not want to go into detail because it will truly spoil the experience for you the trailers purposefully left out significant details for a reason why spoil it by reading summaries or reviews this movie went by quickly and left me begging for more a perfect 10,reality
liam neeson is so awesome in this movie ive always loved him i like most of the movies he does but in this movie he doesnt just kick ass and not remotely worry about taking names he does it in such a nonchalant manner its just so matter of fact the character he plays he is that good at what he does and liam is just as good at playing this character as his character is at eliminating the oppositionlike a lot of the others whove commented here i couldnt help but compare neesons character to bond and bourne but hes in a whole league of his own isnt he he has no gadgets a lot of the time no weapons either just his bare hands are enough to put numerous bad guys out to pasture before they even realize theyre up against a foe im a chick and went to see this on valentines day and i couldnt have cared less that we didnt see something more romantic i was entertained thoroughly even if a lot of the basic plot was predictable neeson made it all worth while,reality
first off this movie is awesome the main character whats his face is excellent and i love the fact that the violence is so justified and realistic this movie really captures you if you havent seen this movie wow you are in for a thrill ride it is so worth the watch it doesnt look like much at first but oh my god its awesome please if you love action movies this is a must see this movie will stand the test of time and go over in history as one of the greatest action movies ever made so what are you doing reading this go watch itby the way the girl playing the daughter is fantastic which makes the quest of retrieving her so much more thrilling,reality

this film looked awful from the trailer a middle aged neson trying to act like a believable ex cia operative trying to track down his daughters kidnappers it looked boring i was wrong the movie starts out with neson saying some hilarious lines to his daughter dont go to paris i know the rest of the world its a dangerous place its paris after all the french are scary and dangerous or so the film would have you believe sure enough the daughter goes to paris and as soon as she gets there two hours later she is by a bunch of albanian sex trade smugglers the fact that she gets kidnapped in the first two hours of arriving in paris is just so ridiculous you have to laugh and there albanian neson than jumps on a plane and goes to paris to save his daughter neson is like a psychic or something he can listen to a tape recording of his daughters kidnappers voices and he knows who they are within a few moments with little trouble this follows with more scenes that are supposed to be seriously by the audience just keep on coming from that point on and i just couldnt stop laughing at just how stupid this film got the enjoyment i got from watching film was just like team america its showed the ignorant insular view hollywood has of foreign countries and there inhabitants just as matt stone and trey parker parody the ridiculous themes of micheal bay films so does although unintentionally and this is what makes it even more laugh out loud funny the action scenes and lines of dialogue are also very team america if you like the way matt stone and trey parker parody action movies and find most action movies make you laugh rather than feel gripped to the edge of your seat i recommend this movie,reality
when his daughter played by maggie grace goes to europe and is kidnapped bryan liam neeson goes to investigate bryan used to work for the cia doing dirty jobs nobody else wanted skilled in combat and torture techniques he uses his skills to hunt the kidnappers downliam neeson showed a lot of promise in his early career the high watermark of his career so far has been schindlers list and from that point on its been a downward spiral with the possible exception of batman begins here hes badly used as a tough guy trying to help his estranged daughter although he does well this isnt a role neeson is suited for he has too kind a spirit under character to pull off being an enthusiastic torture and killer maggie grace is also awkward in the film shes trying to play a 17year old but doesnt do it with any skill the rest of the supporting cast try hard with the material but also come off looking at times lostthis is pierre morels first shot at a big studio film teaming up with luc besson writerproducer here might not have been the best move the film seems rushed in places and the emotional moments look really bad theres also a very odd ending that doesnt seem to belong to the same movie tacked on so the audience can go away happyall in all not a great cinema experience if youre reading reviews in order to get an impression whether to see this film on the big screen then my advice would be to wait for the rental dvd release early next year instead,reality
part 1 how could this allow to be made the whole western movies from 1960s onwardsespecially 2000s are to make every girl be like amandaand a good father like bryan is always portrayed as bigotedpart 2 how serious white slave trade has become to make liberals feel slightly guilty and make a movie about italthough the production value is not excellent the movie has high historic valuebut i have mixed feeling about the singer and so called singing career thats a major turnoff from the mainly good messagesuggestion for next project organ trading,reality
man i just saw this movie recently and i was impressed incredible acting job by liam great storyline that shows how fast human trafficking can be in other countries this movie is pretty relevant because a friend of mine was telling me stories hes heard will on a european tour it is a very organized crime there even more than the drug market here in america as for the movie this movie was all about liam he reminded me of action movie heroes like rorshack and v the film did seem a little too perfect and things do seem to happen too conveniently it only made me wonder what if my dad knew that stuff overall this is a must for any hardcore action movie fan,reality

is a film that has been rather poorly received critically but has been highly enjoyed by the majority of mass audiences and its not hard to see why it definitely has its flaws but keeps such a pace at least after the opening act that its not challenging to watch and doesnt overstay its welcome the movie boasts liam neeson in a role dissimilar to anything ive seen him in stars as an exspy and security detail agent named bryan mills who goes on a committed rampage to find his kidnapped daughterthe film opens with some painfully generic exposition we have a divorced father who now only wants to get close with his daughter whom he neglected earlier in life because he was always away on business his exwife is still bitter about the amount of time her spent away from them and obviously desires the preference of their daughter the daughter kim of course now has a new stepdad who provides her with a much larger house gets her better presents and earns the compassion of his daughter kim then asks bryan if it is all right for her to go away to paris with her friend bryan is torn because with her gone he wont be able to form a closer relationship however in saying no kim will only be angered with him also making relationship matters worse theres also the fact that he has seen many monstrosities in his line of work that hes scared of what could happen to his daughter if away alone in paris mills begrudgingly agrees to let her go this wouldnt have been as bad if there werent awkward and contrived subplots spliced inwhen kim departs for paris we are introduced to the next cardboard cutout character her friend amanda who plays the enthusiastic dumb blonde the first thing they do upon arrival in paris is trust an attractive albanian fellow who they think not to question because who cares hes hot amanda low and behold he isnt the nicest guy and the two of them are seized kim manages a quick call to bryan and from there bryan is forced to follow a trail of clues in attempt of kims rescue this opening 30 minutes is pretty much awful its all familiar and not even familiarity done well however after the initial eye rolling the film does pickuponce the film reaches the search the viewer is treated with a relentlessly paced quest the action rarely ceases and thankfully the action is exciting and remains surprisingly grounded in reality without being dull as far as casting goes liam neeson was the perfect choice for the role he is believable both in the sense of compassionate father and focused action hero apart from one scene the scene of the kidnap hes pretty much spoton the whole film the supporting acting is surprisingly serviceable as well despite not being delivered much character to work with i dont really have much to complain about they all work well with what they have some on the onescene actors are particularly impressive i find those doesnt often deliver as much emotion as someone in their place actually would but the emotionally honestly of even the very small roles was well doneone problem with where the film goes after the introduction though is that it never really builds the first action scene when mills arrives in paris is just as exciting as the climactic scene of the film the film remains rather flat without a real rising action another complaint is that i felt we didnt get inside the protagonists mind as much as we could have for instance at the scene of the kidnapping we see it from kims point of view at the time and then as mills retraces it later it would have been far more effective had we only been treated to bryans end of the conversation the first time and then trace along with him the viewer would be more involved with his character and it would have made it less repetitivedespite the film having some flaws after the opening in certainly wasnt as bad as i feared while watching the opening act i enjoyed watching neeson in frenzy as he destroyed everyone in his path with cold and determined matteroffactness and while i cant give this film a hearty recommendation im not going to warn to steer clear either 610,reality
i saw at the cinemas this week i had no expectation apart from a pretty cool trailer as i had not heard much about the movie before that i saw the film with my girlfriend and she has not stopped talking about it since shes not into action films at all but she appreciated the neatly derived story that is usually absent in action movies we also agreed that neeson played the protagonist perfectly it helps to have an actor of his quality of course but for it to work you need the character to be believable too what father wouldnt travel half way around the world in search of his daughter this movie is definitely not for critics but for patrons who want value for money ie good story action and a great lead theres a lot of poor movies out at the moment id rather see this one again than something no where near as good,reality

god i love this movie i mean nobody but liam neeson couldve pulled that off but maggie graces character makes me also kinda hate it i mean were rooting the whole time for neeson to save grace a spoiled rich girl with a giant house rich parents maids chauffeurs and birthday parties with tables stacked with presents and pony rides but then her dad says hes not sure if she should go to paris because its dangerous and little rich girl throws a damn tantrum i mean i wanna respect the concept of the movie with neeson saving his daughter but i cant again great movie liam neeson is astounding but i wish i could watch it and not be rooting for the human traffickers to get to keep his spoiled brat,reality
i dont normally watch action movies but because the ratings for were so good and the film is kind of part of the pop culture i decided to give it a try how bad can it be turns out it can be very very badthe hero liam neeson is a retired spy or something like that he has seen a lot of bad stuff in his career and knows that the earth is a dangerous place you can get killed every minute if you dont watch out this is proven in the beginning of the movie when he accepts the job of a bodyguard for a popular singer of course there is an attacker at the concert which he casually knocks out it gives the impresson that popular people are attacked on virtually every occasion nothing specialwhen his daughter wants to go to paris he is of course not excited about it and of course she is kidnapped as soon as she arrives in paris and there is no backstory to the kidnapping just regular easteuropeans who kidnap tourist which they find at the airport i mean that happens all the time right the 17 years old daughter is particulary dumb she behaves like an 8 year old always running around and screamingi find it still surprising how such dumb brutal crap is considered a good movie it appeals to the most primitve feelings like revenge and sadism the main actor is simply invincible and better and stronger than anybody else like a superman fantasy of a little kidsorry for the not so well written and onesided review i created an account at imdb just write this review because i was so angry how bad this movie was and english is not my first language,reality
iconic this generic action thriller is your typical runofthebryanmills situation father desires to have a better relationship with his daughter but unfortunately is kidnapped by an albanian sex trafficking ring yknow that common holiday occurrence well atleast thats what people thought judging by the harsh decline in paris tourists back when this was released its fine though grab a baguette put on a beret and chill because this girl who yearns to be a pop star has the most protective daddy in the entire world he will tear down the eiffel tower to find his daughter just so she can use that karaoke machine he lovingly bought for her birthdayis an enigma it has everything going against it a cheesy first act with questionable dialogue several moments of disbelief the occasional clumsy editing and the hero returning back to the united state on a commercial flight despite wiping out a third of paris yet beneath the unintentionally realistic horror of human trafficking is one heck of an entertaining film morel just takes the entire scenario so seriously that you cant help but root for bryan mills to smack a gun on someones throat or interrogate an albanian using good ol fashioned parrilla electrocution between you and meit all stems from neesons career redefining performance it has to it must the phone call outlining his particulate set of skills iconic neeson embodying the likeness of a relentless onehit ko machine gimme more shoot first ask questions later definitely its a role that neeson needed and i couldnt be any more thankful for his choice he mustve said ill take it quicker than the momentum of this films pacing its unstoppable no time to think about the implausibilities just run gun and fun ninety minutes of pure entertainment cementing the second best fictional father in cinema history after mcclane that is if you havent watched it go out now buy it and enjoy the ride good luck,reality

while i can understand people liking this and i can appreciate the effort this just didnt click with me some parts i liked liam neeson can be intimidating and some of the action scenes are good but the movie never really hits a stride the plots basic its not meant to engage you so i went into this with my brain off expecting to have a good time the whole movie was marketed as this tough actionthriller but its actually pretty slow there are quiet moments then an action scene but theyre not really integrated well it feels like the action scenes are there just for the trailer shots not because theyre needed if that makes sense also i get the feeling this was originally rated r and edited down to a pg13 i say that because people are shot and no blood is shown also the camera man has a seizure during these scenes and never directly focuses on anything its disorientating and takes away from the only action the movie has the climax is good though its probably the most well done scene in the movie and its only 90 minutes long but there are a lot more movies that i can watch instead of this,reality
this movie starts off with a workable plot maybe even a good one certainly it had possibilities thereafter it retreats to a predictable mash of violent adrenaline rushes with clich dialogue one liners come backs etc that any movie watcher over the last 30 years must have had their fill of once the plot is set you knew generally how it would pan out it was just a question of which country the gangsters were from exactly who their accomplices and enablers were and how many brutal fight car chase and shooting scenes there would be and also what kind of gadgets would be used it is all wornout formula  liam neeson does okay with the material such as it is i guess but you almost expected him to morph into bronson van damme or even arnold yes neeson suggests a more complex interesting character but it is only a suggestion everyone else is barely there it is entirely a neeson vehicle and forget about seeing any interesting directing camera work or art direction  if this type of thing is your cup of tea enjoy but dont look for anything special,reality
i really liked this film because the film is about a father who loves his daughter and his wife even though they were separated the father was determined to pick up her daughter who was kidnapped in french even this movie did not make us bored to watch it too many times because the film can make the audience carried away very full of action movie and love,reality
yet another entry in the violence if fun series the hilarious thing about modern cinema is that you cant kill a dog in a movie but you can murder 1000 people and viewers wont bat an eyethis movie spawned a flood of even worse imitations so its sort of like the new diehard i cant believe how popular this is considering that it doesnt make much sense from start to finish first of all white slavery does exist but almost all of the women are from poor countries and are lured away by promises of jobs kidnapping a middle class america girl just wouldnt be a prudent venture for scumbagsliam neeson is a bit long in the tooth for this project at least in my opinion hes like 50 years old and hes constantly diving through windows or jumping off a five meter wallthen there is the matter of how he manages to shoot and kill about 50 dudes yet he seems impervious to bullets in one scene he jumps behind a sofa for cover thats like a little kid hiding behind a curtain with his feet showing below the handtohand fight scenes were a mix of old kung fu movies and an 11 year old childs idea of how a fight goes down or are those two the same thing,reality
the acting is awful the story ridiculous the editing of neeson in action is amateurish the fight scenes are laughablethis is a movie barely worth watching once took me 9 years to finally get to it but obviously i didnt miss anything worthwhile why this movie made it big other than the antimuslim feelings whipped up globally and worse why its rated 78 here is beyond me critics clearly get it right on rotten tomatoes at 58,reality
while watching the first thing that crossed my mind was wow this could be the story of fictional tv character jack bauers retirement years considering the success of 24 suffice it to say that i mean that as a compliment and thoroughly enjoyed this filmbasically the plot of this film centers on liam neesons character who is estranged from his daughter played by maggie grace and really has no way back into her life anymore though tenuous about her decision to travel to europe for a summer with a friend he knows that not signing the consent form will only further drive a wedge between them so he allows it of course her and the friend are immediately targeted by european slave traders and kidnapped right out of their apartment sending neeson into action to try and get them back the kicker though is that neeson now retired was once a government agent who worked for an agency not unlike that of ctu of 24 fame at least that is how it is described as a result neeson actually has a fair shot at tracking down his daughters abductors for the remainder of the moviewhat really separates this movie from other action fare though is the character development at the very beginning where other pure action films eagle eye comes to mind spend just a few precious minutes to develop the characters the entire first 30 minutes out of only 90 total of really fleshes out the fatherdaughter relationship this makes you the viewer root even harder for neeson cause when his daughter is the acting is also very solid albeit in a subdued fashion at least from neeson whereas kiefer sutherlands jack bauer emotes wildly and often neesons take on government agent is much more simmeringly intense we understand how badly he wants his daughter back but he doesnt have to pitch a fit to convince us also grace shannon of lost fame transitions from well from small to big screen as her innocent portrayal of a young girl also helps the audience become emotionally involved with the filmthus while this film is not epic in any sense of the word hence the fourstar rating it is still very entertaining in a straightforward sort of way by doing all the things that a good film should developing characters creating emotional attachments and having enough of a plot to keep the action moving forward if you are a fan of the thriller genre please check this movie outit may not shoot straight to the top of your favorite movies list but you will also likely not be disappointed either,reality
my reaction to this was similar to my reaction to wolf creek 2005 a very watchable film but including some really sick sexuality for those with their feet firmly on the ground as regards to good sexual practice then i assume this can be very acceptable horror if one has a love of this horror genre has an even more gripping storyline to wolf creek also a more blatant imageryme when it comes to the portrayal of sexuality i feel on stronger ground with family features such as aquamarine fun horror though features at the quality level of that one are rare scary horror can be brilliant too but i am safer with such as the scream series particularly 1 and 4 or halloween 1 to 5i am hoping that if i watch this a few times then the problems i get from the sexual violence will calm they did with wolf creek could be i should be able to appreciate this action story a whole lot bettera plus uk news of the problems of young people trying to cross europe to gain political asylum hint that the sexual horror of does have echoes in reality i used to find it easy just to accept such news but without realising the level of horror i am now glad that i purchased my disk,reality
when will hollywood studios actually comprehend the concept of subtle yet again here is a most stupid filmlittered with appalling overacting ridiculous script and simply pathetic storyline theres not only nothing new here but what mess there is is boring beyond belief pretty much everything about this stupid movie is garbage from script to casting its hard to believe they made sequels to this nonsense and if you check those reviews youll shake your head too the greed of movie studios avoid this film at all costs its total crap how this kind of rubbish moves from storyboard presentation to approval is simply incomprehensible no wonder enthusiastic cinema fans look to australia canada and europe for their cinematic fix hollywood is stale and past redemption look to the independent film festivals for quality and innovative cinema you sure wont find it here,reality
the grey rating a flexible rating system used to determine the quality of a movie based on a methodical comparison with the film masterpiece the grey themes of survival the killing instinct drive to survive are explored  sir liam neeson  simple well written and doesnt try to be something it is not owns its identity  action sequences that are not overwrought lack of wolves  warm climate  lack of poetry  set in paristhis film has a lot of similarities with the grey in terms of how it was produced and received by audiences you could write off both the grey and as low budget action films without much substance but then you would watch them and realise how much of a horrible person you are for judging a film based on its appearance remember making judgements based on superficial externalities and stereotypes will lead to intense introspection and personal reflection when these judgements are shown to be wrong,reality
from the start the characters are baked into genuineness then the fastpaced actionplay takes over to give its viewers the extraordinary experience which any other film with similar plot fails to deliverliam neeson is my new favorite in the action genre with his performance outstanding his physique his demeanor his air  all add up as icing for the action cake the plot  story is clichd but what adds glitters to it is its execution no leeway is provided by the writers keeping it tightened with shortflashbacks of how the sequence previously mentioned must have occurred brilliant fight sequences  relationships bonds makes it a wonderful edgeoftheseat watchmostly it works due to the emotion involved and the experience totally pulls you in forcing you to want to be inside the movie and for men to want to be neesons tough cia characterbottom line highly recommended cause there arent many movies with such impeccable standards no viable plotholes as suchcan be watched with a typical indian family yesprofanity mild  vulgaritynudity mediocre  sex implied no visuals  foreplaymouthkiss no  drugs mild  smokingalcohol very mild  violence very critical  gore strong  porn no implied,reality
liam neesons daughter is in this 2008 action thriller also starring famke janssen maggie grace and katie cassidy directed by pierre morel the script was written by luc besson and robert mark kamena retired cia agent bryan mills has moved and given up his career to be closer to his daughter kim grace his exwife lenore janssen has remarried to a very wealthy man and she seems to be limiting bryans access to his daughter however on her 17th birthday he drops into her party and gives her a gift hes thrilled when she calls later and says she wants to have lunch with him however lenore comes along in order for kim to travel to paris she needs his permission and signature bryan doesnt agree right away hes seen the seamier part of life and doesnt want her traveling alone in paris he finally agrees to let her go when he learns shell be staying at the apartment of her traveling companion amandas cousinsof course the cousins actually arent there and rather than haunt the museums kim and amanda are following a rock groups tour kim is supposed to call him every night but that slips her mind when she finally calls its just as amanda is being kidnapped bryan remains calm tells her to get under the bed and when she is and she will be to scream out as much of a description as possiblewhat follows is a riproaring fast moving kick ass liam neeson tracking down the culprits who are engaged in the trafficking of young women bryan takes no prisoners and he uses every cia trick at his disposal including hotwiring cars torture gunplay fighting skills  you name itthis is a terrific movie and theres just enough of a setup so that we care deeply what happens so often action films give us a shell of a story and then get right into the action  and while the action can be terrific this is the type of film you can get into for the characters as well as the actionliam neeson  action hero a new genre for him in 2008 its a genre hopefully he will explore more,reality
i thought this was brillianti always avoided watching this i always felt the liam neeson was not a great actor but this is his best role by far that i have seen he has made some other good films but i never expected he could pull off an action rolethis film is about an ex cia agent who has retired to be near his daughter she then goes to paris to follow u2 and gets kidnapped the kidnappers intend to drug her pimp her and then sell her liam goes in for the rescuethis film gave me so many emotions i really got into it whether that be because i have 2 daughters myself or not i dont know firstly i felt so sorry for him at the beginning of the film all he wants is to spend some time with his daughter but he doesnt seem to get the chance at her birthday he got left behind because her new stepdad who is rich just outdid him with presents and party etc then there was liams ex wife played by famke janssen oh my god she made me so angry she was such a bitch at the beginning of the moviethen when he went to paris to save his daughter i was really on edge i didnt know if he was going to be too late there were s many girls that they had kidnapped and sold etc that he was having a hard time with films like these you never know if the daughter could have lived or died she could easily have died and he would go for revenge or she could have easily lived and he would just rescue her it was a good on the edge of your seat thrillerthe acting was really good by everyone the story was a typical search and rescue story but it is a very good story to tellthere were a few bits in the movie which made me question things i know he is an ex cia agent but where did he get all the equipment he used there was one scene where he saves a random girl from the drug dealerpimp guys because she could have information about his daughter he helped her by having a drip set up in his hotel room needles and everything else to make her better he made the room look like a hospital haha where did he get all that stuff fromi will give this film 8 out of 10i really enjoyed it and it changed my mind about what liam neeson can dofor more reviews please like my facebook pagehttpswwwfacebookcompagesordinarypersonmovie reviews456572047728204refhl,reality

first i should note that my scoring system is very rigorous only excellent films manage to register an 810 95 of films register lower scoresthis film represents everything that is good about actions films it is a well executed action thriller without many noticeable flaws in fact it is perhaps one of the best action film of the last 5 years only the bourne films were as good as this one a film of pure energy and aggressioninterestingly this film marked the change of career for liam neeson who once did serious dramas and now makes action movies at the age of 60 he was 56 when he did this film and he still looked quite young thanks to modern makeup techniques,reality
when i first heard about this film i was like its just a copy of finding nemo nothing special even though i knew liam neeson would be in it i finally had the chance of watching this film and i was completely blown away with it of all those 90 min movies ive seen i literally believe this is the most entertaining 90 min movie ive ever seenthe acting especially liam neeson is just completely brilliant and badass the plot despite resembling a lot of finding nemo contained several surprises and was obviously far darker than finding nemo the action in this movie was just breathtaking i was on the edge of my seat whenever liam neeson pulled out a gun or a hand this was a superbly made film in every aspect it got into the story quite early and as soon as she got kidnapped you knew this film would be spectacular definitely the best 90 min film ive seen and im looking forward to 2,reality
liam neeson stars and kicks butt even at his age in this dark gritty thriller with a troubled tonebrian mills has worked for the government in the role of preventer it was his job to prevent bad things we are left to assume assassinations terrorism etc from happening he is retired and trying to build back a relationship with his 17yearold daughter kim when she is but brian has never lost his edge driven by love protectiveness and anger he sets out to find herand to destroy the men who took heri really liked but the wanton coldblooded killings made me suck in my breath every time our hero is strong angry and determined but he is no saint and he isnt bound by any sort of code he kills tortures and even shoots an innocent person to gain leverage for me this is the only drawbackthat being said was thrilling exciting and edgeofyourseat 8 out of 10 enjoy,reality
i give this flick a thumbs up for the nonstop action and thrills it provides on the other hand thumbs down for an implausible plot with gunshot plot holes liam neeson plays an excia agent who calls upon his skills and experiences in the good guys vs bad guys field when his beloved teenage daughter is kidnapped in paris while on holiday by an albanian mafia to be sold into prostitution while his resolute courage and resourcefulness and abilities are not what is called into question the situations he gets himself into are are we to believe that he could easily track down the head of the kidnapping ring based on a brief phone conversation and very vague tips from fellow excia members and then theres the fact that he on his lonesome manages to score a round into 35 antagonists yet he himself escapes with barely a scratch albanians frenchmen and arabs must be such lousy shots the theres the scene when he does get caught by the mob and hung by the wrists from the ceiling and at the opportune moment the bolts connecting the pipes hes shackled to give way and he instantly is free of his bonds to tackle the baddies perhaps lady luck was with him all the way through not to mention the incongruous ending where he brings his daughter to singing idol sheera for voice lessons after all that she went through surely she wouldve suffered a great deal of posttraumatic stress yet she acts as if the whole thing never happened  or maybe she went to an exceptional skillful headshrinker for all that ignoring what ive just mentioned just sit back and enjoy the action,reality
it has been 4 years since was released and two days ago i had the honour of understanding the hype at last is truly a movie you dont want to take lightly if you are a stickler for logic and plot consistency and will not allow for fantastic action scenes and adrenaline rushes make up for this you are best to steer well clear is just that an adrenaline thrill ride i would have to say that the threat included in this film which is written on the titles cover is probably the most sincere and intimidating since the paddy considine throw in dead mans shoes 2004 i almost cried for the future victims of his onslaught when neesons character speaking with an unmistakable irish growl assures the traffickers that he will find them is a linear film and does not really take chances with twists and mind games it just goes for the jugular much like neesons character i have to say there were some scenes that taxed the moral psyche a scene where bryan mills neeson shoots a man in the back as he runs down a flight of stairs i understand that the man was armed and would have killed mills given the chance but it just doesnt seem proper to shoot a man in the back on any given sunday the director luc besson really knows how to make you side with a character in a film you really want the guy to succeed every step of the way even in the face of impossible odds you know that mills will still get out of it alive and continue the hunt for his daughter but you dont mind you make provisions the action dialogue emotion and change of scenery are all enough to make you want to keep watching and ensure that is daughter is safe at the end of the day one important thing to mention too is that the film is wrapped up nicely to end it on just one movie or has the added benefit of being a potential sequel because of the lingering resentments we know now that there is a sequel and i cant wait to watch it,reality
this was a very entertaining thriller but it was very predictable with really nothing newthis is about a mans daughter who goes to paris with her friend and gets kidnapped by some men the father who has acquired skills at finding peoplewhich he learned from his past government job which he has recently retiredgoes to paris and hunts down the menthis movie was good but there are a couple things that i dont like in it the fact that it stars liam neisen is one of the problems he is not a very good actor exspecially when he fakes that atrocious american accentit was also very predictable but overall it was definitely worth a watch,reality
former cia agent bryan mills reluctantly agrees to let his 17 year old daughter kim go to paris on a trip his exwife lenore and her new husband stuart are all for it and kim sets off with a friend on arrival in paris however kim and her friend are kidnapped by mobsters running a slaveryprostitution ring bryans only lead is a short snippet of a conversation from when kim phoned him in a panic with that hes able to identify the origin of the speaker and which criminal gang hes with once in paris he quickly shows everyone connected with the case that he will stop at nothing to get his daughter backthis movie was something of a resurgence for neeson after all when he finished the haunting he stated he would retire at the age of 57 he became a bourne again action star if you are familiar with besson produced action you will know what to expect and this is no different its straight to the point very brutal and neeson is utterly believable as the frustrated fatherwha thou should know about besson produced action is the fact that you have to suspend belief for the duration of the movie and although this is one of the more realistic produced movies it still gets a little daft at timesbut its deserved of its status and is well worth it,reality
i was expecting so much more than i got out of this movie but thats certainly not the movies faultportrayed divorced parents and ungrateful almostgrown children actually quite well i had no idea the basis for the badassness would be such a touching story of a father who long to reconnect with his daughter to make up for the years in the past that he never had the chance to so sweetand all the more awesome for when he finally won not to mention it was badasswe can nego bullet in the head yeah thats how that went downgreat movie liam neesons voice was perfect for it,reality

this movie is definitely one of the best suspenseful movies i have seen lately it kept you right on the edge of your seat and you kept asking yourself what was going to happen next very good the effects for this movie were phenomenal and very well thought out and portrayed well liam played his role extremely well as well throughout the movie and not once did you doubt his abilities one of the greatest actors ive seen yet hope to see more of him in upcoming movies great choice of actorin terms of buying this movie i definitely recommend it its one of those movies that wont leave you disappointed and will leave you completely shocked with every coming scene well worth seeing if you havent already,reality
liam neeson is retired cia operative bryan mills the divorced father of a teenage daughter kim who lives with her mother and new wealthy husband in a really big house the kid is a spoiled brat who rides horses and her biological dad feels inadequate when compared with his exwifes new soul matelittle kim informs daddy that she will be traveling to paris with her best friend amanda he protests the idea but she sweet talks him into letting her go the twin tourists meet a stranger who shares a taxi with them he invites them to a party and when they are abducted while kim is on the phone with super dad he warns the bad guys that he is a man with special skills and that he will find them and kill them anyone else delivering that line would be silly but with neeson it worksthrough his many contacts mills is able to uncover the albanian white traffickers responsible for his daughters disappearance he reverts to his past days as a guy who gets things done in an unconventional and violent matter in order to rescue his offspring the action sequences are good and neeson a former heavyweight boxer in ireland steals with his performance a sequel is due in 2012 and i cant wait to see it,reality
there are certainly high points in this movie in terms of excitement and thrilling scenes what is odd is that his daughter does not seem traumatized by every thing the death of her friendthat has no conclusion the girl with the jacketdont know what happens to her the other two girls being brought into the sheik who drives the boat how did they get out of france fallout for those trading in human beings action and the unexpected is what makes this movie worki would have enjoyed more of a team effort from his friends especially in taking care of the other women who were enslaved it would have been more moving and had a bit more overall compassion,reality
ex cia agent liam neeson travels through paris in search of his pride and joy daughter maggie grace after she is kidnapped by a group of albanians with plans for her his long years of experience gives him a set of skills that make him unstoppable in his onslaught to find his daughter and it makes him a nightmare for the likes of people who took his daughteroverall the film was breathtaking action packed and all together just great to watch i enjoyed every minute of it and would more than happy to watch it over and over the beginning was a little dry but it soon progressed to an amazing filmi would recommend this film for any one who likes a good action film and enjoys watching a father fight for his life to save his daughter to finish it off i rate this film a 910 because overall it was a real thrill however it started a little slow and it could have been longer,reality
now this movie is basically the epitome of a badass liam neeson sure liam has played some badass characters before and will do so in the future but he is a badass in this one as well luc besson is one of the writer for this movie and he is known for being part of making quasi video game style action movies sometimes he succeeds and sometimes he doesnt this is one of the movie he does succeed now the plot isnt anything amazing in fact its pretty straightforward but the action and everything is so cool without it being cheesy now you dont really find out the exact background of liams character bryan mills but the movie does give hints his character is a someone that has ethics and knows exactly what to do in order to get the job done when it comes to his special set of skills but he isnt a nice guy either and will do whatever it takes to retrieve what he lost and that is what stands out about this character he isnt a moralistic character that has to be the nice guy or the very good guy to with the audiences approval the plot is this bryan millsliam neeson is divorced but has a daughter but she is with his wife and her new husband the new husband is a rich guy that provides anything for his wife and daughter but bryan still has a lot of love for her daughter and wants to make up for lost time with her and win his daughters affection the wife who is played by famke janssen who was in the xmen movies and goldeneye is simply a mean gold digger anyways his daughter gets kidnapped and all hell breaks lose because they angered the wrong man overall if you want to see a simple but fun and cool action movie this one might be for you i heard there will be a sequel to this movie and i am hoping it isnt a terrible one and not just a cash in for the sake of a sequel but have a coherent and fun story with better action scenes7810,reality
liam neeson packs a punch this guy can do everything this is an incredible film which documents the gruelling lengths a loving and specially skilled father will go through to get their child back safe its one of those films you have to watch with caution and with a pinch of salt the subject matter is dark one of the darkest i have ever seen think of the worse crime in the world the worse thing you could do to me this film hit an issue that scares me to no end you see human trafficking in the newspapers and grit your teeth with anger this film will give you satisfaction for the violence brought onto the perpetratorsthe flow of the film is goodit sets the characters up quickly shows the disrupted family unit the spoiled but loving child rich thinks hes godstepfather and bitch happy families mother and of coursethe protagonist the biological father with a secret past the film was a thrill ride the rest of the way through your suspicions as the film goes along turns to everybody and following the protagonist s techniques on tracking is fast flawless and how justice should be done if theyre bad kill them if they have answers torture themno cushy lawyers necessaryand we are given a more or less happy ending to that particular family but the issues brought up are still out that  pause for thought,reality
i know a claim of a perfect 10 movie probably sounds implausible but really is the best action movie that ive seen in my life from about 1980 on when i was old enough to notice things like thati could go on but its simple enough to say that the story directing casting and performances all come together to make a work of cinematic art that you cant ignore liam neeson and maggie grace make for what sound like an unlikely pairing but in the end jive into a perfect fatherdaughter setthe story is great at first one might roll there eyes at another dad goes for his daughter rescue movie is anything but that its not a simple oh gee person x is holding my daughter hostage no its a complex tale of despair and danger in what is unfortunately a reallife threat the hostage isnt sitting in a room shes on the move between sets of devious people supported by money graft and corruption its brilliant its honestsince this is the spoiler version i like that the writer made the characters primarily neeson as the main character react realistically to the situation hes an excia agent trained to kill and with decades of experience when it comes to fighting with someone or tracking someone or getting information he doesnt do anything cute he just does it there are no long kung fu fight scenes or breaking elbows backwards no knife throwing and fighting he just kills them boom hand to hand or puts a bullet in their chest maybe this sounds silly but its nice to see a super agent actually be a super agentthe final scene the true ultimate spoiler ever seen a mexican standoff where the good guy ends up dropping his weapon and then the scene develops into some stupid game of catandmouse to win well a mexican standoff does happen or rather the bad guy tries it puts a knife to neesons daughters neck and hides behind her neeson hesitates in the standoff his pistol raised and then a few seconds later after hes had time to perfectly line up his shot puts a bullet in the guys head firing past his daughter just what you want to see from a super spy marksmanhonestly when that happened i cheered and almost jumped off the couch shouting finally it was good to see the reality of a rescueespionage filmgo out and see this movie in fact dont even rent it go out and find it at the store and buy the dvd you will watch it over and over,reality
i feel compelled to give this a review as it is simply majestic first time writing a review on imdb here so just gonna slip in an introduction ive always been an avid fan of intelligent films and shy away from the usual big screen summer movies that frankly are so stupid it might just make you dumber after watching safe to say i an a fan of indie films i dont think im smart or gifted in art in any way i feel that im just a normal person that appreciates beautiful things so i appreciate a good music or a good book and most definitely a good filmis full of action and is pretty straightforward you touch his daughter youre gonna die simple but nobody says simplicity is a bad thing going along with the good storyline is awesome fight scenes and i can guarantee that with every punch liam neeson throws your heart will jump with excitement is it wrong to be happy to see someone get hurt yes it is wrong but youll get excited too nonetheless i usually also dislike car chase scenes why do almost every action film has to have a car chase scene anyway but in this film the chase scene has a better justified purpose in my opinion so i didnt mindi also enjoyed the beginning of the film which might be slow for some people but it is important as every second in this film is it gives you a better understanding in liams character the thing about this movie is its realistic down to every final bit and everything is believable of course the action scenes are not realistic per se but its as realistic an action movie is gonna geti think i really like because it explores the dark side of the world where the wicked lives i know the events in this film do happennot the liam neeson being a hero part of course and there are more horrible things out there human you see are twisted bstards and its nice to see the good guy winning for a change i like the themes it explores too like how the bad guys are bad but theyre not pure evil as fcked up a human may seem to be they too have feelings other than evilness nothing is pure anything as nothing is perfect i would be more specific but im trying to prevent spoilers as i want people wanting to know if its any good to read my review and be compelled to watchwhich this many compliments im baffled as to why i gave it an 8 never had i given a film a 9 btw maybe im just waiting a movie that is perfect in my eyes im really not a good writer i have a hard time explaining myself on a daily basis but this should be a bigger influence for you to watch because even a simple minded person like me can appreciate its beauty,reality
the main purpose of pierre morel to create is to depict a story a story which is as as true to life as breathing is to us this story shows everyone the world which is invisible and when it is exposed to us it cannot be unseen where drugs and sex come at a high price and where the rich often superimpose their superiority at the cost of other peoples lives i have very few bones to pick at in this movie my main problem being that the story starts up a bit too slowly but once kim is the 96 hours bryan mills has to recover his lost daughter unwind the subject of the film itselfthe most important statement makes is its exposing the real world in which people suffering from poverty are living in the human trafficking and prostitution are at the base of this well elaborated subjective pyramid while at the top is the fact that even the most honest and upstanding people jeanclaude will turn their heads the other way in order to get paid the fact that during the final scenes liam neesonappears at a white collar cocktail party where on the negative first floor the women are being auctioned as merchandise blew me awaythe whole movie was a critique on life the heart warming story tells of a secret life thousands of people live daily it is known of but not spoken of it is a life where there are no boundaries where money power and greed reign supreme this is not only happening abroad all of these problems are encountered in every day life for some of us this is a great movie and depicts a never ending struggle although in my opinion the ending could have been a bit better,reality
is liam neesons one man show completely having said this even if you are not a neeson fan this movie is still a must watch no mystery here it is a plain vanilla revenge story but the way this whole film has been shot and paced you just cant take your eyes off the screenon a serious note it exposes the dirty world of human trafficking the action sequences are superb the tactics used by leesons character to track down the culprits look realistic and plausible most of the times the guy playing the role of french intelligence officer who sits behind a desk does a decent job in this onemanshowniam leeson is menacingly dangerous i dont know if he has a daughter in real life but if he has i wonder if anyone after watching him in would marry her leave alone dating her just kidding overall a must see film if you are a thriller fan,reality
i have to say first that i cannot stand the french and for a supposedly american character to go to paris and beat just about every frenchman he encounters was simply superb of course many elements of the story are absurd and how he goes about it make it seem too easy but gosh i loved the action sequences and that most of the guys on the receiving end were frenchmy disdain for the french is also why i like that jet li film kiss of the dragonive seen several times on cable and relish watching it every time,reality
contains spoilers the bourne series have set the actionthriller genre to a whole new level and this is at the same bar no more no less liam neeson plays an ex cia operative who is hunting his daughters kidnappers it one of the fastest films ever made as liam neesons character bryan mills has a certain amount of hours days before it is impossible to find his daughter you are kept at the edge of your seat whilst bryan uncovers the crime bit by bit at the perfect place the majority of the film is in paris even though it is a dark film you cant help but notice the beauty of the french capital liam neeson and maggie grace are fantastic the story is original and finally shows a good image for fathers which is really hard to see in the day we live in the image of how fathers would do anything for their girls is very important this is no hollywood explosion trigger happy film it is an impressive well thought well filmed underrated film i dont give 910 stars to any film,reality

its hard to believe that with such ritzy credits this film could be so spectacularly awful the story begins with the insulting premise that for teenage american girls anywhere outside the us  even paris  is likely to be dangerous and its downhill from there ondire warnings of what a nasty place the rest of the world is quickly come true when the girls are kidnapped and daddy liam neeson has to come bounding over the atlantic in hot pursuit of the villains with the flimsiest of evidence to work on and with the help of a conveniently cobbled together but ludicrously unconvincing back story neeson runs amok in paris leaving a trail of criminal damage indulging in gratuitous violence and homicide  and all of course in a frightfully good causethe derringdo is so improbable that it tries ones patience at one point for example neeson drives a high performance car at top speed through paris miraculously avoiding collision in pursuit of a boat on the seine travelling at about about 10mph hed have found it easier on a bicyclethe characters of the fatuous main victims are so poorly drawn that one doesnt really care what happens to either of them  theyve been deceitful anyway  and neesons character as a devoted and loving father who is dedicated to violence and brutality is almost impossible to understand  or perhaps im just stupid,reality
i recently watched this movie on dvd and boy was i by surprise the movie is awesome one of the best modern day action flicks is much better than any bond movie i have seen and in fact has the material to give any bourne movie a run for its money in fact i couldnt help but notice the protagonist in this case is also bryan neeson is amazingly good as the exspy and looks really scary in some sequences just the way an agent shouldi would love to see neeson back in action soon a sequel to this maybea recommended movie for anyone looking for a good high class action,reality
this was a wellmade action movie and i cant say i didnt enjoy it or find it exciting the pace was turbocharged and while liam neesons character wasnt quite jason bourne  like me hes a bit old for that  he acquitted himself well however the moral was about as isolationist as its possible to be stay in america where youll be safe  abroad is a dangerous place full of foreigners it was written produced and directed to warn americans that if they want to be safe they should huddle at homehollywood sells itself as liberal and openminded but its actually a major force for conservatism,reality
a lot of action a lot of good wellperformed shots and fights credible all of them based on little details in fact this movie is about action and details all the few details even if they are almost invisible are what develop in a believable action scene theres also scenes that take your breath away like i cannot believe or wow now i understand what he liams character really feels incredible welldone and credible action scenes wellchosen actors and deep intense feelings about parents relations families incredibly disturbing images but real sadly madly real good job not oscarwinning movie but a really good one entertainment excitement  with a perseverance character which can go beyond everything to rescue what he loves the most,reality
id heard about this flick for a while from various friends but im usually about two years behind seeing movies finally rented on zune and wowgreat premise great buildup to even greater action and filled with those setpiece character moments that just make you want to bark hellyeah sitting there in your chair who wouldve known neeson could pull off someone like this i mean ive always regarded him as one of the premier actors of this entire generation but even though hes nearing in age the end of the generation he comes from he sure pulled it off as someone deadly cunning and smartthe best part was hes not a brainwashed superweapon like bourne and doesnt dally around trying look good and overthink things like bond hes a more downtoearth hybrid of the two out of his peak but still very much in the game and still honed to a razors edge in terms of his skillsets and personaas a very discerning and picky action movie fan i was delighted as a father of one little angel with another on the way i was enthralled its what every father wants to see done to scum like this on screen where torture isnt torture its justice other showsfilms try to evoke a sense of sympathy for even the most dastardly of criminals when theyre being tortured haha not in this film these animals stole his baby his princess his angel his world and they pay for itdearly and its delivered on screen with such righteousness i was actually clapping to myself when one particular scummer felt the juice from a buildings electrical current go through himto end this review neesons performance is nothing but balls a walking scrotum that dishes out karate and pain and death to those who wronged his daughter i want to give it 10 stars but settled on 8 simply because while the film is great its not perfect there are quite a few implausibilities on the productions part the pg13 rating oozed through a little too much in that rushed massaudience targeting that hollywood does so often most notably in the hugsnkisses disneyland ending with the daughter the guy killed half of paris getting his daughter back and nary a single cop or investigator has any interest in him as said i put these on the productions list of faults not the actors or characters they portrayed that part of it was topnotch if you havent seen this film see it now,reality
bad pointsnothing surprising or original here yes its a popcorn flick but one without anything particularly different some of the script is oversimplistic and too unrealistic liam neesons character assumes the persona of an indestructible person quite early in the movie greatly reducing tension in the fight scenesgood pointsits not too long just the right lengththe soundtrack is heldback not too inyourface and over the topsome original moments of surprise are thereconclusionthis is a basic actionbynumbers movie best viewed if you havent seen many action movies and like them it does what it says on the label but little or nothing more,reality
i discovered this on a dvd on a recent visit to mexico under the title busqueda implacable not being a fan of modern films generally too many special effects i did not realise that the film was two years old i sat down to watch this with my wife and we both concluded that it was an excellent action movie in the james bond style particularly satisfying is the way in which our hero in his quest to find his kidnapped daughter liquidates the baddies one by one the action scenes are nervous and impressive its a more modern and more violent version of harrison fords frantic indeed the film is very violent but this is good clean violence and is more than necessary given the sort of scum our hero has to deal with there is not a dull moment in the film and that is a very strong point i have also seen the actor liam neeson in various other films and have liked him every time some viewers may complain that parts of the film are not plausible but i would send this sort of person packing immediately  plausibility is in no way the issue here  what counts is the entertainment value and nothing else,reality
i dont know why i love this film so muchbut i doits a revenge flick of which there are many peddling the same premisearnies commando is a similar plotthere are plenty of spy filmsbournebondand plenty of action adventuread nauseumbut this one really does it for methe baddies are as bad as you get and believablethe violence is stylised and yet again believable as are the gunfights and car chasesits neeson that carries it thoughwhen he tells his daughters kidnappers that he will hunt them down and kill themthe hairs on the neck stand upand cruciallyyou believe himit shouldntt be as good as it isits all been done before and some of it defies logicneeson runs after a car for a few milesand catches itbut it just looks so realisticand the bad guys deserve everything they gettrust methis film is a crackerjust suspend your imagination in some places and enjoy,reality
i liked a lot it was full of suspense it was an intense thriller the action kept me excited and on the edge of my seat but i have a few issues with this filmthough it was exciting and a great action thriller i dont like it that the film took something as serious as sex trafficking as an action movie it is a serious issue going on in the world right now and it is not to be lightly it would be different if it was made to make people aware of the growing problem but it wasnt it was clear that it was only made for entertainment purposes it is a sensitive serious topic that should not be lightly and it most certainly should not be the subject for a blockbuster action film,reality
one of the best action movies i have seen in a long time was beyond amazing it redefines action in an incredibly unique way with its hard hitting and jaw breaking action scenes you cant dislike such a film its a must watch action thriller although i didnt expect much from liam neeson i was proved wrong i would definitely have chosen him after seeing thisthe movie is basically about the mans daughter being kidnapped although the plot is not ecstatic and it might be predictable sometimes but the way it takes you through is just phenomenal one of the best action movies i have seen in a very long time is a must watch,reality
the good a tensely directed film no loose baggage or unimportant scenes the film got on with telling the story and was nicely compact as a resultsome very good individual scenes in particular the initial kidnap scene and the showdown between neeson and the french secret agent overall a great directorial job by pierre morelthe badutterly unrealistic view of sex trafficking look middle class american tourists do not get kidnapped by traffickers the film makes out that young women are being kidnapped in france daily in fact the overwhelming majority of women who are kidnapped or coerced into the sex industry come from vulnerable backgrounds low income  drug dependency etc and poor areas of the world such as the exussr countries phillipines thailand etcthe body count just got silly neeson went through a ridiculous number of disposable bad guys i could have accepted that from a van damme or segal flick but i was expecting a more intelligent moviespoonfed investigation other than the clever bit neeson does with his daughter during the kidnap he pretty much moves from one strand of investigation to the next with little real difficulty thanks to outrageous coincidences for example luckily the first pimp he meets in paris is directly involved with the kidnappers who then immediately drives off to go the brothel site where luckily his daughterss jacket is there etc the coincidences just went on and oncardboard cutout villains and i dont just mean the sex traffickers it was obvious from the get go that the mom and step father were going to be made out to be practically criminally negligent neeson told them it was dangerous and of course he is proved right less than 4 hours after the girls get off the plane way too obvious villains for the audience to boo at yawnoverall ill still give it 610 as it was an exciting film it was just disappointing that what might have been an intelligent thriller turned into a generic action flick with the cheesiest ending of all timeand as for realism well if you want a serious look at the realities and evils of sex trafficking watch lilja4 everps to all americans thinking of coming to europe please do not be put put off by this film it really is very safe,reality
normally i dont post on imdb but i had to with this movie hehei put in my dvd minutes after completing splinter cell conviction i couldnt help but notice some resemblances still i remember liam from the batman movie cant remember the title wasnt too sure about m i wasnt disappointed in the least about this movie a mate told me he thought it was a movie made for me to be watched and he was right no silly heroics just a manwith a series of skills in the asskicking departmentwith only 1 objective save his baby girl  all in all a recipe for a nice movie if made properly which it wascompared to bond movies it had a bit of a sluggish start  not counting the awesome takedown on the first guy but the rest got up to speed quite nicely all in all a movie for people that like a nice spy movie,reality
first things first i love these james bond style movies always have this movie is just awesome almost as good as casino royale of 2006 basically if daniel craig were in this film it would have been a james bond with a few tweaks to the story but off 007 this movie is about an excia agent that is divorced and his daughter is captured by some guys that want to put her into a prostitution ring then when the daughter is captured neeson goes after the bastards who want to sell his daughters body all the while the mother and rich guy are doing nothing basically its just a great actionspy movie hopefully we hwood will keep giving us these awesome films as a huge fan of action i think that 2008 was the best year of the decade for movies,reality
back then when the movie was out i saw it as just another movie about saving kidnapped loved ones when i finally get to watch this it turns out that i was wrongthe movie was simple and straightforward it was about this guy who used to be a field operative for the cia he retired because he wanted to spend time with his daughter and such later in the story his daughter was kidnapped by someone and this is when he vows to save his daughter and kill whoever that did this i pray to god imdb doesnt consider this spoilerthe story turned out the way i thought it would most events unfolded the way i expected it to it was lacking twists as well so generally speaking its very very predictable however there is this one thing that clearly distinguishes it as a unique piece from the othersthis one piece being character definition the writer did a fantastic job in defining the characters early in the movie you understand why each character had this thought or did this etc and the best thing about this is that the writers managed to define the characters through detailed and yet usual daily actions eg buying a gift for daughters birthday so it doesnt fell crammed in at all it felt natural as they show us the sides of the characterson top of that the actors were simply great in this one liam neeson is awesome as usual maggie grace is surprisingly good and is definitely worth looking out for the others did a good job as wellnotice my comment on the movie being textbook yes its as generic as it gets but the way they managed to present it makes the whole experience a fresh and engaging one and it being textbook is also a compliment because while they didnt put in some fancy new ideas they did pull out everything that is required to make a good action flick and gave those elements some nice waxing and polishingto conclude its a must watch for everyone,reality
its been a surprising saturday night first surprise of the night was eating glutenfree choc chip muffins with sambucca  actually washed down well the second surprise was an actionthriller being two years since its release id put off watching this film due to the gritty content of traffiking but tonight was the night id decidedthe set up of the story was quickly done leaving the rest of the film for the audience to sit on the edge of their seats and watch the bourneesquire action and combat unfold not a lot of thinking is required which is a plus in this case guess thats the third surprise,reality
way too many story holes from the beginning the superrich stepfather could never risk allowing the girls to travel unprotected overseas what about the frenchparis police and how could he possibly evade arrestespecially during airport hijinks w the taxi also bryan ducked and dodged a little too much automatic weapon fire from the construction site scene forward however the film was very wellmade and left me with a good feelid recommend it to most folks btwif theres such a market for highpriced sexslave traffictrade young girls wouldnt it be easier for an enterprising group of albanians to start up a little country genetic body farm,reality
well i was told this was a movie id like if i liked assault on precinct13 and i loved that movie so i decided to rent the movie actually went to a cousins house and watched it and the movie was pretty good and kept me watching till the end but some sequences of the movie were outrageous but so are james bonds movies so i guess beggars cant be choosers but one thing i must say is that girl must have had to run laps before taking on the role because it seems all she did in the movie was run damn aman man damn id rather whoop you in nhl10 with atlanta vs pittsburgh and me winning the cup but i enjoyed the ferraro roches that your dad gave us it was a good ending to a good finals in nhl,reality
its okay its a very 80sish action movie straight outta the ouevre of segal and chuck norris they cut this one right down to the minimumscharacters are presented spoiled daughter goes w airheaded pal to paris gets kidnapped by white slavers from albania ciaspook dad liam neeson comes after them does his best dirty harrypaul kersey on the string of baddies which leads to a final shootoutbattle onboard some arabian sheiks yacht in the seine end girl is rescued and takes singing lessons from britneyoh hasnt she suffered enoughi thought some of the contrivances were hard to swallow and liams shooting was right outta dirty harry but okayyou need him to be unstoppable if you are going to have a movie its clear they left out many bits and pieces esp his dealings w the french cops and the albanian baddiesyoull prob not believe a word of it but you do buy neeson in the role if that makes sense outta  crunch,reality
is a truly refreshing and rewarding experience to view its back to the basics a ruthless believable to an extent at least hero kicking bad guy ass no gadgets no one liners just doing what needs to be done in fine style seeing a man fight to get his daughter back is so much more rewarding than watching someone try to save the world or something to that effect because a its believable and b because we can relate to it perhaps not directly but certainly to a larger extent than the world being in dangerliam neeson is in outstanding form carrying the movie from start to finish his slick tone mixed with well performed stunts result in the creation of a simply magnificent character i have no doubt daniel craig will be watching this performance a few times through before beginning work on the next bond flickthe movie is of course not without flaws it would of been nice to see one of the villains challenge neesons character fractionally more rather than just standing there like a lifeless dummy while neeson did as he pleased with them also the escape when he gets caught seemed far too straight forward and basic to be in the least bit satisfying there must have been a more stylish way to handle the escape than simply having him pull the pipe from the ceilingnevertheless certainly has a lot more things going for it than against it and this is why it is proving to be such a popular film im disappointed it took me this long to see it and ill say if you havent caught it yet and are perhaps on the fence as to whether to watch it have no second thoughts about seeing it you wont be let down and let us just hope no sequel is ever made this is without doubt a film that will be best left as is with nothing added to it,reality
this movie kept me on the edge of my seat from the line oh my god they got amanda to the part where he shoots the guy holding his daughter at knife point the plot starts off when a retiree finds outby phone call that his daughter had been  he goes around paris trying to find her  stop the bad guy that has herliam neeson is an excellent exspy  before this i doubted liam neesons acting talent highly now he can do any spy role this script is a well done thriller because oh boy was i thrilled this movie is a good movie so i will give it a 9 to those who havent seen this you better see it a must see i think thats enough said,reality
this film is about a former spy who uses his skills to save his kidnapped daughter from a human trafficking ganghas received very good word of mouth and i can clearly see why from beginning to finish its full of action or thrill human trafficking is a tough issue to watch by having a determined father to rescue his daughter it gives hope to the viewers that there might be a chance for a happy ending therefore the story is exceptionally engaging throughout i am normally a pacifist but i find myself wanting liam neeson to win every fight and shoot every bad guy right in the head it is refreshing to see an action movie with a purpose as opposed to senseless violence is a cinematic experience that has to be experienced,reality
okay this is a hamburger movieby that i mean you go and order a double cheeseburger with baconyou know what you are going to geta cheeseburger with baconi am kind of happy that they did this kind of movienot a ransom movie that has been done many times this movie takes a more honest and depressing theme that girls are being for the sex trade so it makes you feel good when liam goes around killing bad guys the story moves at a nice pace does not have any yeah right scenes and has plenty of gunfire any movie where they kill french people gets my voteand in this there is a bonus they kill arabs wohho moral of the storystay away from parisin fact stay out of france worth a matine price,reality
bryan mills liam neeson is a man who tries to reconnect with his daughter after spending most of her youth somewhere else than home hes a bit overprotective as he claims hes seen the world as it is and he gets more nervous when he learns that his daughter is leaving in france together with another young girl and then his worst nightmares come true when his daughter is kidnapped but the reason why bryan was so much else where than home is that he is a former top notch agent who wont stop until he gets his daughter backat a first glance you can say that is a clich and it is but theres no shame in that when its so damned well made one despite i knew what was going to happen i still managed to be thrilled and exited i literally was sitting on the edge of my seat for the last half an hourgood director well casted and solid piece of action all in all well spent hour and a half,reality
in case you are a movie buff when you watch any movie within the first 1015 minutes you will most likely get a feeling about the level of satisfaction it is going to provide you thereafter after watching this movie i thought of it as an adrenalinfueled revenge flick from french director pierre morel which is even better than all james bond and bourne film series put together in terms of pure entertainment value could easily have become a clich film like so many we have seen before however liam neeson plays his character of an excia agent who is determined to find his daughter at all costs with such finesse and elegance that you will find an unbelievable freshness in the way the movie unfolds and in its execution after watching him play the role of oscar schindler in schindlers list its simply incredible to imagine him playing the role of a retired ciaagent and that too with perfection i still have goosebumps when i see the part in which he talks with the kidnapper and says i dont know who you are but if you dont let my daughter go i will find you and then i will kill yougoodluck i just love iti strongly recommend to everyone even if you have little interest in actionthrillers or neeson so fasten your seat belts and get ready for the fastest 93 minutes ride of your life you are going to enjoy every second of it 910 without any doubt,reality
tagline an efficient hollywood revenge formula that works review by neo liam neeson is easily one of the most underrated actors in hollywood in a quick flash back he was memorable as the stoic yet philosophical in the star wars prequels and equally mysteriously cunning in batman begins apart from his nominated work by the academy in schindlers list liam has hardly been recognised by his industry in liam manages to engage the audience despite the simple and typical plot line by french inspiration luc besson of a tale of revenge and rescue in the city of gloom and doom paris paris is an interesting setting and despite being stereotyped by luc bessons zillions of other films it remains a juxtaposition of a city without a trace paris is definitely romantic beautiful but at the same time one would easily instil a world of drugs prostitution and anything that is ugly about the world today at the end of the day it is safe to say that a tale of a father chasing after the kidnappers is clich yet thrilling unoriginal yet interesting and extremely efficient thriller to say the leastthe story goes like this liam neeson plays a former cia agent and one day his daughter maggie grace is kidnapped while on holiday in paris the only trace of evidence is a phone call from his daughter just the moment before she is so the tale of a father turning the world upside down to find his daughter begins and the journey is certainly worth following even if the believability of the chase is very much within questionable mindsas mentioned above liam neeson plays the role of a father extremely well his ability to handle the most unbelievable situations during the process of the chase is that of an experienced actor in the works what made his performance more believable than it should be is that he is ultimately a father at its very core imagining myself as a father where my daughter is away i would do everything in my ability to protect her and even go and save her as a result with that mindset it is easy to believe the actions of a tormented soul it is rare that liam is given a juicy role to work with and here he showed all the emotional torment in the most respectable manner and while by no means oscar worthy it is a display that made the film better than it should beactress famke janssen xmen the last stand plays her role competently without being memorable but then again it may well be due to the limits of the script and the fact that luc besson is not looking for a femme fatal in this tale still she is believable enough without hampering the efficiency of the film likewise maggie grace jane austen book club is given little to work with apart from screaming and looking extremely distressed in the emotional torture of being kidnapped in paris perhaps the only part of the film that fails immensely is the lack of chemistry between the father and the daughter this may have been done purposely or indirectly as the father is meant to be distant to the daughter due to his former devotion into his work for the cia rather than looking after his familythere are some memorable scenes like the electrifying room where liam is questioning the suspect the scene and the moment when the daughter is suddenly from under the bed the only problem here is that this scene appeared in the trailer dont you just hate it and a typical luc bessons car chasing sequence like all bessons films the action is well shot well timed and integral part of the film there is no doubt that director pierre morel has a great eye for action and the city of paris as a former cinematographer in many other luc bessons productions like jet lis unleashed and strahams transporter morel is able to portray the ugly side of paris and it works in the films favour in terms of the films directionall in all is an extremely efficient display of a chase a thrill a ride and ultimately at its core a tale of a father who will do anything and everything to get his daughter back despite the similarities to the 24 tv series actually works and thats good enough for me and probably most genre fans it is true that the film relied immensely on the good acting from liam neeson but director pierre motel should be complimented for creating such a tight and thrilling encounter for the audience to endure a fine display of merging the boundaries of french and hollywood filmmaking and as the french saying goes luc besson you did it again  neo 2009 i rate it 810wwwthehkneocom,reality
first off id like to say that im not usually a fan of action movies like the borne movies 007 or mission impossible films theyre always too over the top for me so far removed from reality that at times i find myself laughing out loud at themthen theres this movie everything about it feels real the characters the plot and the surroundingsthis movie has a very basic and relatable theme daughter gets kidnapped dad wants daughter back at any costthe best part in my opinion is the use of liam neeson as the action star of the moviehes not some brainwashed super spy or some agent working for some super powered orginization hes just an exspy out to find his daughteri would say this movie is better than the most recent bond film the last borne film and the last mi filmand i really hope to see liam neeson used more in these roles his deep voice and calm demenor make him perfect for these roles,reality
this movie surprised me quite a bit the ads made it look more like a twisted thriller while comments i heard made it sound like a cerebral movie it turns out its a rather an aboveaverage action movie with a storyline that borrows heavily from the excellent movie spartanthe first 27 minutes or so are rather dull and annoying neeson plays a meticulous retired agent who spends his time trying to connect with his daughter who lives with his exwifes new rich husband and his daughter is one annoying girl his buddies try to hire him to do highpaying security jobs he eventually agrees at that point the action starts when the singer hes guarding is suddenly attacked by a guy with a knifehis daughter then decides to go to paris with her evenmoreannoying bimbo friend in paris they are kidnapped forcing neeson to travel to paris and take matters into his own hands hes got contacts there with law enforcement but they are not willing to help he finds rather easily everyone involved with her kidnapping and the motive behind it all to sell her as a sex slavethe action is pretty good and quite brutal for a pg13 movie but its the french sort of brutality think the transporter so its somewhat comical but here at least people are killed a lot of people its not as campy as most french action thrillers of late in that regard it maintains some of the soberness of spartan but there is still an element of fun here french export action pics certainly are not known for realism and this one is no exception all that neeson needs is a word and he can figure out where when and who he can kill anything with a single shot while his enemies armed with machine guns cant even hit his caroverall this is a very entertaining and exciting action pic im not convinced by the casting neeson can act the part but he sounds more like a grandfather than a father and sure looks fragile the insufferable leland orser plays one of neesons action pals while poor xander berkeley gets a thankless role as the rich dad spartan is still the superior movie but this one makes for a fun and lighter companion,reality
if there is any single word to describe this whole film it would be focus it could be argued that passion sentiment pace are important aspects of this movie but these qualities that merely augment the central theme of the singleminded purpose of a father whose world revolves around the security and happiness and love for his daughter a famous young poet once commented love for your children is unidirectional it has this unnecessary tendency to be suspicious while movies like mrs doubtfire father of the bride and meet the parents were more instrumental in depicting this truth wouldnt be too far eitheras i have previously said this entire film is about the focus of a person who could virtually do anything in his power to rescue his daughter from the miseries of woman trafficking but the trigger behind this focus is the factor of love for which he could travel 30000 miles to attend his daughters birthday while he was on a job decides to retire in order to stay close to her and lastly goes to paris to rescue her when all others had given up every possible hope an important attribute of a good actor is to immerse himselfherself completely in the character heshe is playing such that while watching a movie the audience is not conscious of the fact that it is an actor that is playing a role of a character rather it is the existence of the character all by itself liam neeson undoubtedly falls in such a category and once again he has proved his versatility power of expression and dynamic image through the portrayal of the character he has played people who have schendlers list or love actually or michael collins in their memory while watching this movie get prepared for a completely different dimension of dynamism from neeson facial expression changes one of his arsenals has been depicted in a number of situations right in the beginning of the movie when after presenting his daughter with a karaoke player she runs to ride on the horse his step father had bought her as a present there was a sort of painful resignation in his expressions which seems to say a million things but express only one i have nothing more to offer except my love similarly while he hears his daughters shrieks and cries over the phone while she is being away and just before he utters the famous dialogue of this movie his expression suggested a sort of unbearable helplessness as if something was happening and he just couldnt do anything to prevent it the other characters of this movie played their role accordingly but there was really nothing much to offer from the perspective of their roles the film had good pace a sort of continuity you would expect from such action movies like the dark knight or the bourne series movies it is important that such movies maintain their pace most of the time and pause at critical moments only to give some time to the audience to assimilate the successive events they had seen background score normally plays a very important role and acts as a catalyst to the motion of the movie and in this case it did just as was expected the action was quite realistic especially the hand to hand combat and it was pretty obvious that neeson had a good training at this fighting art known as shinshai goshin kai an art taught to the sas members and that it avoided the special effects commonly seen today mostly in martial arts based movies however at times the events seemed quite unrealistic especially the fact that a single person can wreck havoc in a country like france for whatever wrongs he has faced and still come back safely leaving the entire security system in tatters but in such movies one needs to overlook such subtleties and concentrate on the holistic effects of the events there was no effort to explain the process of girls trafficking and the prostitution business that is prospering in the frenchalbanian border regions but that was merely presented to add to the sensation or increase the criticality of the girls abduction there were no surprises the film was predictable but one would still be anxious to experience the excitement of the climax and that is what the effect of the pace of a movie can do it is a movie which is worth the ticket price and one would never realize how one and half hour has passed in a nutshell a compact well paced well directed movie and not to forget experience the versatility and dynamism of a legendary actor who has won the heart of millions by his unforgettable performances in the past,reality
not much was to be expected from this movie and it wasnt very widely advertised at the time of its release i also hadnt heard much about this movie before watching this movie neither from the common crowd or the media besides it stars liam neeson in an actionrole how good can that ever turn out to be is however unexpectedly good and one of the more pleasantly surprising movies of 2008within its genre this is simply one fine movie its a quite tough and bold action movie in which we see lots of graphic killings its real pleasing though to see the main hero shooting and fighting his way through france leaving a real killingspree behind him we can feel for the character and therefore are also more into the action we understand his motivations and we even cheer for him when he bluntly kills another person pointblank or shoots someone in the back a real accomplishment for an action movie to get its crowd so drawn into the movie its actionits pretty obvious though that this movie got heavily influenced by the also unexpected bug success of the tony scott movie man on fire it uses a similar type of plot as well as main character and it also handles its action in the same kind of way very bold raw and straightforward the movie is not as fresh or well constructed as man on fire though but the movie also deserves better than to be merely called a man of firewannabei must say that action movies really seem to get tougher these days in terms of its violence and mainly the handling of it movies now days often pick a more realistic approach instead of going overthetop with any of its action because of this the action actually looks and feels more tough its a real welcome development within its genreits not in the least thanks to liam neeson that this movie also works out really of course it seems like an odd for a 55year old liam neeson to go jason bournestyle but it works out surprisingly well for the movie he handles his role and also its action really well his character makes the movie and its story worknot that the story is much special though its suiting and good enough for within its genre but its just not all quite good and fresh enough to truly consider this a brilliant or the most original recent action movie around i therefore was also real surprised to see its rating on here which is extremely high for a movie of this type and its given the movie a bit too much credit like i said its a real unexpected great movie and i really enjoyed it from basically start till finish but really an 8 people just really too much especially when considering that there are far too many great movies out there who have a far lower average rating on here oh well the average voting score will probably settle down in a couple of years from now giving the movie its place and rating it in all sincerity and objectivity deservesbut to end completely positively is a real unexpectedly great movie within its genre in which neeson perhaps surprises the most as a convincing actionhero710httpbobafett1138blogspotcom,reality

pierre morels is only the second film he has directed but it is very solid work it is obvious that he takes pains in using his experience in operating the cameras to make sure the visuals are very well done this movie is short but to me the length is an advantagesurprisingly there is a fair amount of time in the beginning of the film no pun intended to develop the story and the characters we find out quickly  efficiently that daddy is divorced and his daughter is turning 17 daddy is trying to bond more with his daughter but mommy seems to be throwing up road blocks  isnt very good at communicating with daddy daddy is then shown doing his job which is person protection of a female rock singer this shows a little of what daddy does for a living and introduces some plotting to the picture then daughter springs a big lie on daddy about going to paris in the summer  lies to mom too about where she is going to be because the daughter has been lied too by her girl friend too now the blonde girlfriend amanda doesnt get developed too well except her main interest for the summer seems to be going to paris and getting laid all summer when the daughter gets to paris she becomes apprehensive of what amanda has gotten her into especially when she finds out they have a paris apartment to themselves for the summer amanda does get laid but not the way she intended tooboth girls are by algerian terrorists who drug them to make them sex slaves luckily the daughter calls daddy who tries to reason with the terrorist but is told good luck by marko from this point on the film is almost nonstop action but action which moves the story alongthe best thing besides being direct about this film is the action sequences are done well the story pulls the viewer in and we feel great satisfaction when all the bad guys keep getting out one after another very good film not sure when dvd comes out if it might have some extra scenes it might but the form being shown in the theater now is pure satisfaction,reality
the last time i sat through an action movie and was completely impressed by it was back in 2006 when i watched casino royale a james bond flick which topped all its predecessors in terms of substance and intelligence and very strong emotional undercurrent wheeling the story instead of just plain heightjumping stunts follows suit with casino royale in that respectthe utmost impressive fact about is its nonnonsense approach its pretty admirable that the director convincingly manages to establish the emotional undercurrent of the movie within such a short period that makes you really feel liam neesons hunger and desire to find his kidnapped daughter and the movie is only 90 minutes long it ends before you know its ending thats how pacy the screenplay of this flick issure this is no masterpiece but you cant expect much more from an action flick its an action movie and it serves its purpose well and not to forget the film also exposes sex slave trading activities which still exists in parts of the world some of the scenes depict the brutality of the business so convincingly and unlike your typical action film the avoids many common clichs a silent unspectacular start which gave more space to show you what a fatherdaughter relationship is like and the stunts are not actually as much overthetop as other action films tend to beliam neesons performance is simply talismanic you can simply feel the hunger and desire for revenge that beams in him and the way he goes about with an uncompromising approach towards finding his daughter is another high point famke janssen of xmen fame and the rest of the cast are adequate but its neesons show all the way it simply goes down as one of his careerbest performances to date right there with michael collins love actually and henri ducard of batman begins he owns this film and its also his first action film in a long long time and he seems fresh and fit to jump around ships like a 16yearold againthe film also has one of the best action monologues ive seen or heard in a long time neesons i will find you i will kill you is damning downright chilling statement of a dialogue that sets the tone for the rest of the film not to forget how he mentions it again when he meets marko in person i told you i would find youkudos to director pierre morel and the team and of course to neeson for making what is inarguably the best action movie of 2008,reality
i have to start off saying that i really enjoyed this movie ive enjoyed liam neeson since first seeing him in suspect with cher and dennis quaid and he didnt even have any lines it was amazing to watch the physical transition on his face from worried father to brutal hunterbrutal is truly the best word to describe this film it was something else to see neeson pull off these fight sequences amazingly well donethere were a few things that both my husband and i agreed that they should have fixed 1 where were his buddies they made a point of introducing these three teammates early on in the film they were the first people he turned to while still in the states so why werent they there to assist during the hunt i think that would have been an excellent addition to the action in the film2 there was no need to shoot the wife we didnt like that scene in the slightest i think the convincing could have been better done with well written dialogue instead just enough underlying innuendo for the officer to realize the danger he was in3 at the end when father and daughter are returning home they could have easily shifted the focus to a television broadcast as mom and daughter hug or as mom hugs exhubby and sees the broadcast over his shoulder something anyway have a news broadcast talking of the amazing rescue and return of xnumber of young women after a massive coordinated effort to break up the female slavery trade in europe then fade back to the family reunionwhy doesnt hollywood just call us before they miss these details ,reality
i give this movie a straight 910 all i can say is you need to go and watch it if you havent already its not just some action movie its got a solid storyline depicting something which is happening for real in todays world its sad how so many innocent young women get trafficked each year it is simply a must see although its a pg 13 movie some scenes may not be suitable for 13 year olds but its a movie every parent should watch and be alert with their children and for others to be aware the acting is pretty good although the teenagers did seem to be a little too overexcited not sure if thats typical of every teen but the movie is on the move 10 minutes into it you wont get bored at all,reality
absolutely terrifying i was screaming and crying during the whole kidnapping scene and i couldnt sleep the night after i watched it very scary but also very good id totally watch it again if i wasnt so afraidproblem way too many innocent people are shot or killed brian was very very violent the whole movie and it doesnt really give kids the right idea its only pg13 because there werent any fwordsi loved it but i do not recommend this to anyone who gets scared easily when brian and kim were reunited though that was just so great i was crying then too but for a different reason if you can handle a lot of violence death and torture youll love it if not dont watch itfinal problem brian was too invincible he would go into a room of like 5 kidnappers and kill them all easily even though they had the advantage a little unrealistic he was only beaten once and that lasted about two minutes before he went back to killing everyone,reality
id have to describe liam neesons acting as a worthy combination of james bond and rambo he plays his part so well fitting into the excia operative wonderfully  totally believable he shows the audience that this bryan mills guy is one you dont ever want to  with it makes you wonder why he wasnt selected to be one of the serial bond actors hed have done a great job if youre looking for action this is the place to go plenty of flash and dash with a token amount of skin thrown in cars boats luxury gunsyou know the drill as to negativityhis ex wife lenore famke janssen is soso not particularly into her role another problem i have is with all the microcinema shots that accentuate the action while not allowing you to see the whole picture this type of shooting gets boring quickly oh at the end there is the ultimate bad guy a sheik of course this portrayal has really run its course in media tales in summary the movie has a decent plot but the real draw is the talent of liam neeson for that reason alone you should get to see ,reality
in general i tend to prefer foreign films fantasy and romantic comedy i was intrigued by the premise of and a friend convinced me to watch it i generally avoid movies that are stressful because i watch movies to escape and relax but i dont regret my decision to watch the beginning of the movie absolutely terrified me and i was literally shaking in suspense has lots of great action and fight scenes that with a few exceptions are pretty much believable the movie is very involving and many times i found myself cheering out loud when a bad guy got down with the exception of one scene the violence in the movie isnt terribly gory or disturbing but if youre a parent concerned about exposing your children to violence then this is not a good choice this is a good date flick as theres a lot of tension and cliff hanger scenes liam neeson steals the show as he is on screen the entire move if you love mr neeson youll enjoy this movie i know i did,reality

a fun movie though not to be seriously sure there are many unrealistic scenes and predicaments and outcomes  but thats what this movie is it does not pretend to be anything else after the first 20 minutes or so  the action never lets up my gf is away and i saw this one by myself its a good thing because i do not believe this is a movie that ladies would like its a guy movie all the way liam neeson was awesome and never took his foot off the throat as the movie goes along you will find yourself clapping when another bad guy  gets his fate at the hands of a rightfully maniacal father a former secret agent i will also say that as silly as this movie is maybe people traveling can actually learn something  the naivety of these young ladies is probably more realistic than one might think there you go a fun movie and a lesson you cant beat that for the price of a ticket,reality
stupidity never stopped rambo from being entertaining even in the latest installment when stallones a wrinkled old man in we have the hilarious premise that old fart liam neeson can karate chop his way through an international sex slave ring without getting so much as a bruise guess what it works they did a good job of finding a stunt double that looks like neeson because the action flows flawlessly and there are some really good john woo moments here there arent many surprises no plot twists just a father shooting stabbing blowing things up and generally kicking ass in search of his kidnapped daughter who is on her way to hostel part 3 ala mel gibson in payback the fun is in how they dont hold back its a total riot to see shindler mercilessly killing anyone who gets in his way with the emotion of the terminator in a quest toward the completely improbable goal of finding one teenage girl in the midst of all of europe its simply satisfying to see the bad guys get what they have coming granted this is a really dumb movie but even a dumb movie deserves an eight when it achieves in the goal of entertaining,reality
i really enjoyed this movie its as if jason bourne got married had a daughter and had to rescue her when hes middleaged im a father of an 18yrold daughter so i can relate a little bit about wanting to protect a daughter and rescue her if necessary all of the acting was excellent and i thought the plot was believable even if the odds of everything happening as shown and the end result being what it was was very slim some would say not believable but its a movie come on what was particularly refreshing is that the language was closer to what i believe to be how most civilized people talk rather than the fword fests of most movies these days sure a few profanities here and there but when people are getting shot and such thats probably expected one result of anyone seeing this movie they arent going to be letting their teenage daughter go on any foreign non us vacation,reality
straight to the pointthe negative 1 some scenes look like they were shot on hd not 35mm this looks really cheesy and cheap 2maggie grace  is she 17 feels more like 13 3 dont know if its fox or europa but the pr for this film sucks the first teaser trailer looked like something for the oscars and not an action thriller the fact a month before us release you can download it in bluray on the mule someone is gonna pay 4the part until the kidnap is filled with dialogs you wont believe its not just corny its unbelievable 5the usa locations looks like europe we cant really feel the difference between the locations put more america in itthe positive 1 liam errrr he looks really really angry like others before me said forget about bourne and bauer liam looks fixed in this roll 2 great cutting perfect energy 3 every thing looks the same but feels different from the kidnapping scene to the last minute really good writing and directingis your movie if you like cold revenge and no bullshit attitude its great thrills perfect energy great liam nice writing after the first 30minreally would like to see 2 in the name of the father,reality
this film starts off to show that generic relationship between an exwife famke janssen and a loving father liam neeson who are unable to coexist but share an interest  their daughter bryan neeson quits his career as a preventer to be closer to his somewhat distant daughter kim maggie grace kim plans to travel to paris with her friend amanda katie cassidy who youll recognize from click but needs permission from her father in order to go when kim is by an group of albanians bryan goes on a mission to kill everyone involved in order to get back his daughteri was literally on the edge of my seat from the moment of kim being which is what is shown in the trailersspots until the very last frame the movie is action packed and while it endorses a massively high body count the kill scenes start to feel copied after it crosses the twenty mark there are twists there are some unknown actors and rising star actors in the feature but for the most part its an average actionthriller with a big name starliam who people will recognize from star wars the phantom menace as the wicked cool quigon jinn drives the movie as the sole participant and basically only known actor im going on a limb and saying this is his best performance of his career thus far the action is well done the pace is at a great quick speed and the ride is fun for everyone able to be admittedtheres eye candy for all genders and all ages theres some quick clever subtle witty retorts that some will chuckle some will laugh out loud and some will sit there confused theres a missing element of romance but this is as ive stated an action movie there are a few key scenes that will not be forgottenoverall i think its a great film the supporting cast couldve been selected better the kill scenes couldve been varied instead of using the same mo for 2030 men it does just dip into the world of unrealistic and has a commando vibe on how one man is able to take out 60 men without being much more than flesh wounded for some like me that will infringe the films rating and overall opinionif you dont look at it in that aspect youll enjoy it very much im sure ill be picking up the dvd when it hits the shelves at my local department store and may just end up going to view it once or twice more at the theaters who knows i do know that anyone who enjoys action in the least will have a good time watching ,reality
this movie completely lived up to its genre kept me on the edge of my seat for the whole movie and wasnt predictablethe characters were developed sufficiently so you empathized and understood what drove them the action scenes almost nonstop were very fresh the stunts performed were quite original and you never noticed any switches to any stunt doubles for an old retiree he sure knew how to handle himselfyou really feel the main character is a complete hero as well as what every dad would want to be in a similar situation  completely in the right although some of his methods could have been defined as unethical a little revenge mixed with the righteousness of it allthe relationships between the characters was also quite believablehighly recommended,reality
after a rather long set up opening segment with painfully obvious dialogue and scenes to give clues on where this was headed doesnt well take us anywhere we dont already know where its going from the zillion trailers or simply just the opening setup and all the way to the final act however what a ride it was thoroughly enjoyable action scenes liam neeson seriously one of the best actors of all time and we still forgive you for star wars episode 1 even though you did the best with what george would allow was again excellent and it contained a lot of funny and smart lines mostly from neeson i always enjoy jean grey uh famke janssen but in this film she was an obvious onenote as were all the characters outside of neeson strange for someone so incredibly nonviolent in our reality hes just deadly in and really shows us what the bourne retirement home will look like once matt damon finally grows up this is strictly for fans of the bourne films foxs 24 series and neeson predictable yes unoriginal well yeah and it doesnt trump bourne nowhere close but it was exciting to see what neesons bryan would do next or how he would get out of a situation im glad writer luc besson didnt include his staple jason statham to play the lead character bryan as he would definitely fit the role neeson saved what wouldve been just a retread  retired  revenge  romp bryan im retired not dead enough said,reality

im retired but not dead brian mills a former cia agent tells a friend in paris when he cant understand how he manages to get any kind of information about anything mills played by liam neeson with unstoppable force and as an oldfashioned vigilante who fears no one and kills everyone in every room he sets foot in is in paris because his daughter kim maggie grace 25 and capturing the essence of a 17 yearold was kidnapped by some albanians while on vacation with a friendthats all about the plot and even if you know how it ends its not everything about its no coincidence that pierre morel the director of the movie was the cinematographer of the transporter and danny the dog and of course its less of a coincidence that luc besson writer of those films wrote this film alongside robert mark kamen who also wrote transporter and produced itbesson never ceases to amaze me this whole decade he has created a new kind of action piece and reshaped it again and again im not sure if i know the exact formula yet but i can tell you some of the elements i use the word reshape because bessons writing material is never original but it never sounds repeated the same happens with the action itself whether its corey yuens fantastic use of cars in transporter leterriers excellent management of the fight scenes in dog or morels wonderful car chase scene around a traileror any single frame of a gunshot for that matter in this movie the producer always gets the best out of the directors he choosesis so straightforward in his development and this is respected by the whole cast and crew and assures the success of every moment of every scene in front of the viewer the parental relationship besson is so obsessed about and never fully developed watch dog wasabi leon nikita to experience the pieces is the basis of the moving content of the film and its written with enviable intelligence when kim is kidnapped and his father decides to look for her desperately we dont know very much about him or her or their relationshipand somehow thats precisely why we root for him for a man who burns down every place he visits by not giving us enough information of the characters besson leaves us no choice but to believe in neesons confident faceand fate no matter whatbrian with this confidence says and not to a friend ill hunt you ill find you and ill kill you the movie doesnt waste time in unnecessary dialogs shots or scenes this father always goes right to the point and the camera goes with him skipping everything in the way as i told you you may know how it ends but you cant imagine how impressive the ride in between is,reality
absolutely well crafted movie great performance by liam neeson he gets into the skin of the character and his face shows pain of a father i dont think anyone could have suited for that role better he was very believable as an exagent or preventer and his body language was also very much to the character the plot is fast and dialogues short but effective a special mention to the cinematography will be needed as the director being a cinematographer himself has given the movie an urban sleek lookthere were times in the movie which made me really scary about people i know being in a similar situation human trafficking though the its just hinted in the earlier part of the movie though only one small complaint the editing in the chase sequences was too sharp it doesnt allow you to grasp whats going on for few seconds and after that its over it gelled with the drive of the movie though because long cuts would make the scenes look more adventurousoverall movie is must watch for intense cinema lovers but this one doesnt come with heavy explosions and stuff unlikely,reality
i was interested of this movie for two reasons liam neeson as a badass and secondly if the what trailer promised was delivered  ruthless action using the idea a preferably divorced copagentcriminal comes out of retirement for one last jobkill the movie delivered boththe action was pleasantly brutal in the vein of the newer bond films the classic rambo style slaughter is done more lowkey and maybe a bit believably neeson kicked butt mostly by doing karate chops to the throat which i can imagine is sufficiently painful and efficient  no face punching here except if the said face is used to punch a wall or perhaps a carthere was a short torture scene although it was done by the good guy to the bad guy also i liked how it was clear neeson wanted his daughter back period there was plenty collateral damage and nod towards that a good guy is not exactly good all the time not all people got what they deserved etc i dont know how realistic the premise of sex slaves being auctioned was but at least it didnt revolve entirely around thati loved how the movie makers had realized 90 minutes is enough if it is not your action is not paced fast enough the ending could have been much better like liam shoots the last bad guy in the head a scared look from the girl cue end titles sort of how french connection 2 ends especially how fast the action before that was now it was there as if the viewer would have cared about that annoying chick from lost and her popssome of the dialog was just awful i dont know what it was but the short monologue by neeson that was also in the trailer i dont know who you are etc didnt work maybe he just doesnt have that something in his voice that would make that kind of stuff work but in the context of the movie it worked well enough since its an action movie and of course describes the entire plot for the trailer the annoying chick from lost was sometimes just terrible to watch especially since she was supposed to be seventeenfinal line its no frantic and i cant remember if it even was that good a movie but worth wasting 90 minutes of your life a good enough movie nothing horribly annoying,reality
this movie reminded the old action flick the one with schwarzenegger stallone or van damme in itwell especially schwarzeneggers commando the daughter of retired spy gets abducted bad guys just laughs when the father swears a revenge on them and then all hell breaks loosegreat action scenes sharp dialogs and as usual superb performance from liam neeson makes a solid and wild action movie so what else do you need to brighten the boring evening  thank yousorry about my english,reality
at the age of 56 liam neeson oddly decided to take the lead role in an action movie my first thoughts after seeing the trailer were accurately along the lines of what the hell  did clive owen not answer his phone on casting day but alas here we arei dont know why liam neeson as an action star confused me after all this is the guy who in a single montage trained orlando bloom to save the people of jerusalem from the mighty saladin trained obi wan kenobi and hell he even trained what is now the only credible batman so i suppose you have to give the man the benefit of the doubt that he can hold his own in the fight against evil albaniansplot liam neesons 17 year old daughter goes to france and gets herself kidnapped before she even unpacks her beret and the neeson single handily sets out to bring her back  at what ever the costs ohh he is so intimidating with his permafrown a few keys points about the things i learnt have from dont stand in the middle of a busy motorway and look smug  you only have your own self to blame when it ends messilyall americans or those who pretend to be american are goodif you want to blend in when in france brown bags and long bread sticks are the way to do thatliam neeson actually has the force which is how he was able to sense how when and who took his daughter by simply just walking around her apartmentthe neeson can outrun a 2008 audiall foreigners or those who pretend to be foreigners are eviljust by calling yourself jeanclaude you can in fact fool the half of france and the evil foreign albanians that you are a fact a french citizen even though you are an american with a thick northern irish accent who speaks only englishdont get me wrong the movie was very entertaining but the vast majority of the laughs were unintentional there was also something very unsettling about the shopping for girls scene as it was so dehumanisedthere was one question though that were left unanswered how in the hell can they justify casting maggie grace as a 17 year old four years ago she was playing an 18 year old on lost and here were at the end of 2008 and she has deaged yet again and dont get me started on her run  she makes phoebe from friends run look elegantit is a great action movie with some laughs if you want to be entertained and just enjoy a silly action movie then this is the film for you  710if anything i feel privileged to contribute to the liam neeson retirement fund where he can now retire to the green green grass of la,reality
action packed thriller in which liam neeson plays an ex spy out for revenge on whoever has kidnapped his daughteri was quite impressed as i expected to be cheesy and repetitive but the acting and the fight scenes were all handled very stylishly the story was fast paced and although it was a bit predictable at times it was actually quite tensethe characters were built up well so that you felt for them and cared about their fate neeson gave an awesome performance both emotionally and physically  quite frankly he kicked butt all round some great entertainment,reality
quantom of solace watch out i dont know about you but i have a feeling youll be left disappointed from watching qos after this this is one film you should intend to watch the plot is simple but sweet in this actionphiliated emotionally recluse version of irelands own liam neeson yeerroohhh about 15 minutes into the film you are plastered with some well executed exlosive action scenes that are similar in a sense to casino royale but better the plot is simple as it involves an over protective and worrying father whose young and niave daughter travels to paris with her dumbass friend and are abducted addicted to crack and placed as slaves in the soulless world of prostitution butliam acts quickly and after a demanding phone call he starts to call the shots and the hunter becomes the hunted kind of thing after the lines i will find you and i will kill you a bit cliqued i know but you are left excited and childlessly anxious after this is said and are probably thinking while smiling incriminatingly lets get these mofos i wont ruin the restat the end of the film i guarantee you will say in a clockwork orange type of context  ahsweet bloody retribution oh yeah if you become a serial killer after this please dont quote me enjoy,reality
nonstop action with liam neeson turning paris upside down as he desperately searches for his abducted daughter pierre morel director and luc besson who cowrote and produced the film bet on action spectacular chases scenes and gritty action sequences the movie is really violent with paris being an exciting backdrop for the thrilling tale liam neeson is utterly convincing proving to be a very skilled actor in any roles he plays runtime is quite short but the film tells everything and gets to be satisfying even moving in the end though a bit unrealistic its enjoyable on the whole not a masterpiece but pleasant,reality
as an exgovernment special ops unit or preventer bryan liam neesonis living his retirement years in hope of being more involved in the life of his 17yearold daughter kim maggie grace while overprotective and somewhat paranoid of his daughters wellbeing due to the severity of his past career bryan reluctantly allows kim to travel with a friend to paris however the trip proves disastrous as both kim and her friend are kidnapped by albanian sextraffickersthe story unfolds in a very mechanistic manner and as such also plays out in a linear and expected fashion this does not make for a lesser story but it does feel too conservative for the film in its entirety and the end result is a film which lacks the complexities which the themes explored involve still it is entertaining and thankfully never falters though some events are somewhat out of realisms grasp by the films end has a profound impact due to its subject matter nothing is overly explicit and the theme of the sextrade is not dealt with meticulous realism but it is captured well enough to make it seem tangible half the reason is due to the the directors ability to make the characters appeal on a personal level bryans concern for his daughter is touching though perhaps a little overbearing first but when danger comes to kim bryan no longer appears to have any fault he was right in his judgement this is not a problem but in fact a keen reminder of the role a parent plays in their childs life neeson plays the role for the most part quite convincingly he shows some genuine concern and when faced with the task of an action role neeson kicks into gear with a riveting performance however there are moments where he comes across as mundane and not totally involved with his character maggie grace and famke janssen play adequate supporting roles with both showing believable emotion at the dire and horrifying situation the character kim finds herself in though it must said that maggie has a very strange way of running that can seem rather bothersome perhaps that is he way of running as weird as it looks or maybe she was an ill choice to play a 17year oldwhile an integral theme is that revolving around the idea of sex there is none shown in the film nudity is also not shown though some women come close language is almost nonexistent though blasphemy does appear every once and a while the film is quite strong on violence though it is neither gory or bloody fights involve mainly handtohand combat with a healthy does of gunfire it is all quite engaging and exciting to watch with byran coming across as a more complete and violent version of jason bourne or the rebooted james bondas perhaps gathered the film is not exactly realistic though it is the sort of film which could and deserves to be so if it wishes to rank among the best of cinema this aside is a thoroughly enjoyable film with intense action marred by a few inconsistencies and lack of foresight into the films overall image,reality
i love the fact that has been released in here lima peru before the united states this kind of thing happens only every so often and it gives local critics such as me the opportunity to review the movie with a fresh perspective without the influence of more wellknown possibly american reviewers it also makes it really difficult for one to have any information on the movie  since it hasnt been released in the us few people have seen it so finding stuff about the plot or the shooting is harder so yes i didnt know what to expect from well it turns out is a pretty good flick maybe even better than one would expect from a luc besson action flickeven though is a pretty bythenumbers revenge flick it manages to be compelling thanks in part to pierre morels direction i like it because it gives the movie an undeniable sense of urgency  it is stylized without being too exaggerated making use of  not so  quick cuts and shaky cam but without making the film too shaky at least its not bourne supremacyshaky action sequences are exciting tense and expertly choreographed im not saying the action in is 100 original and revolutionary but what besson kamen and morel provide is exciting enough to make one forget that weve seen car chases in films about three thousand times i like the way bryan dispatches all his enemies  he definitely looks like he knows what hes doing  and the way all the action sequences seem to have consequences they are shot in a gritty realistic fashion which means people actually die and the french actually care when bryan kills and injures people this gives way to a subplot concerning a friend of his working for the french government if i were to compare this movie with other of bessons action flicks id say it is to a certain extent the antitransporter while the jason statham movies were all overthetop and exaggerated especially the second one is more of a realitybased believable movienot surprisingly the films greatest strength lies on liam neesons performance even though the films script is pretty average  and sometimes unintentionally funny  the fact neeson treats the material so seriously makes one believe in his quest i like the mans voice the way he makes even the most clichd piece of dialogue sound so important within the context of the movie and the way he threatens the bad guys he always sounds in control calmed and sometimes even dangerous one actually believes hes an expert and thats hes willing to kill the bad guys to save his daughter he also looks believable during the action sequences  i cant say if stunt doubles were used or not but from what ive seen i can say neeson is really effective at looking like a total badass the only gripe i would have with his character is that he was sometimes a little too brutal which made rooting for him a little hard  the way he tortures a villain  using electricity  was particularly disturbingthe rest of the performances are good i guess but heres no one that stands out as much as neeson famke janssen has a small thankless role as bryans exwife she gets angry and screams and cries a lot but we really dont get to know much about their former relationship maggie grace is not bad as kim at the beginning of the movie she irritated me a little  she and her friend actually  because they acted a little too stupidly and immaturely for my taste  actually it is because of this attitude that they get kidnapped  but i eventually forgot that and concentrated on her fathers quest xander berkeley and leland orser also have small  but vital  roles but never really manage to take the spotlight from neeson the film belongs to himi liked because its exciting and tense and because it provides with a great performance and solid storytelling liam neeson is as good as hes been in practically every film hes acted in and director pierre morel directs luc besson and robert mark kamens workmanlike screenplay with flair and style to make the audience forget about the clichs one inevitably finds in all revenge flicks this is the kind of hero thats perfect for an actor like liam neeson skilled and intelligent but also flawed one feels a little pity for him at the beginning because of the way hes treated by his exwife i liked the fact that the action was gritty and realistic and found the dealing of the underworld of women trafficking and the albanese mafia in the screenplay both intriguing and disturbing if i had to use only one word to describe that would be intense,reality
definitely the best action flick since the bourne series neeson gave a spell binding performance that we havent seen him done in years good films always has minor let downs and the same thing occurs in first of all the film was as actioned packed as it could get but some of the fight sense were repeated over and over witch was a bit annoying i wonder if they did this to make it easier for neeson or did the fight choreographer run out of moves and the biggest fault of all was the happy ending i dont know about you but if i was kidnapped drugged and sold i even being rescued i wouldnt be happy instantly i would at least be a little paranoia or traumatize not laugh is off and go do singing lessons that is just plain absurd however i give a clean 710,reality
this film does what you expect but it covers a few issues that might have been the very reason neeson signed on kidnapping prostitution sex slavery immigration etcthe action and fight scenes are fine but too heavily cut at times for you to actually see some of the moves some points in the film everyone just gets shot easily and quickly which take away the gritty realism the film was trying to achievethere are few good scenes with neeson and grace on the phone where he tells her she will be kidnapped other then that it just about rises above the direct to dvd action movies we segal doing right now,reality

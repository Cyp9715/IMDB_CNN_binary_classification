is a rare treat a blockbuster that lives up to its hype and a comic book adaptation that hits the markalong with tim burtons batman this stands head and shoulders above all other superhero movies  its a genre thats usually synonymous with silly campy cartoonish crap but bryan singer delivers a longawaited exception to the rule  is smart stylish and very cool one of the better sci fifantasy films of the last decadeof course it helps to have good source materialthe comics which originated in the 1960s are more politically progressive and morally complex than older superhero stories such as superman where the heroes are always right and truth justice and the american way always prevail  the series is a wellcrafted parable about individuality and discrimination  the characters are mutantsstruggling to find a place in a society that rejects them  its primary villain magneto isnt an evil lunatic hes a sympathetic character a misguided revolutionary playing huey newton to professor xaviers martin luther king the iconic character wolverine is a beerswilling antihero who cares little for ideals and fights only to protect himself and his loved ones the female characters are as powerful and important as the men rather than being mere love interestsrather than making just another flashy explosionperminutespecialeffectsextravaganza singer practices the lost arts of character and plot development  as a result the movie has a far greater depth than the average big budget summer flick  the acting is also quite good on the whole  hugh jackman who plays wolverine is fantastica bona fide clint eastwood caliber badass  some of the dialogue is fairly cheesy but in the hands of ian mckellan and patrick stewart it sounds quite convincing  stewart has made a career out of making lame dialogue sound coolhardcore fans of the comics have complained about the omission of several popular  this is silly   a movie that gave the background on every character in the comic books would be 6 hours long  there will be plenty of time to develop new characters in the forthcoming sequels  fans have also complained about the casting of anna paquin as rogue   i disagree  rogue is unable to touch another human being without harming themshe would not realistically act like a confident sassy warrior  paquin did a tremendous job of conveying the fear and isolation that such a young woman would feel she will undoubtedly grow into the part in future moviesin the end is a comic book movie  superpowers are explained with silly pseudoscientific babble the plot revolves around a fairly ridiculous takeovertheworld scheme and names like magneto are spoken with a straight face  dont read all the glowing reviews and expect citizen kane but dont underestimate either  it is an intelligent movie that people will enjoy whether or not they are familiar with the comic,fantasy
theres no doubt about it is not a stereotypical comicbook film whenever a movie is made that is based on comic books there is always a fear that it can and will be typically pigeonholed into the comic book film genre and that the movie is basically made for the fans of that comic book  comicbook films are usually unrealistic and unappealing to the general audiencebryan singer however did a wonderful job at making a movie that will not only overjoy the fans of the comic book but also the general moviegoer as well  the movie is grounded without the flighty unrealism of comic book material and it delivers a message about prejudice that has always been what were about fighting for a world that hates themthe performances are outstanding especially hugh jackman who in my opinion did a deadon wolverine and patrick stewart who never failed to show the peace and selfcontrol that professor charles xavier always strove to maintainaside the characters the plot was original i couldnt tell you what was going to happen in the end by the middle of the movie and most importantly the world was real  the only suspension of disbelief that is required is the assumption that these genetic mutations can happen and did causing these extraordinary people  honestly i was a little disappointed that the colorful highflare costumes were omitted but i instantly forgave singer when i realized why  it was simply to add to the realismall in all was excellent  if youre a fan of the comic book series as i was then youll endlessly enjoy seeing these characters come to life  and if youve never been exposed to the comic book this movie will give you an entertaining way to be exposed to its message about fear hatred and prejudice,fantasy
with so many movies out right now that are designed solely for entertainment puposesfrom gone in 60 seconds to mi2 to scary movieit is promising to sit through a 90minute film based on a comicbook that actually gives you an opportunity to think and be challengedbryan singers the movie is nothing more than an introduction to the lives of the characters from the comic book the very fact that his movie doesnt try to add new elements or change elements that already existed within the comic is what makes it so successful the comic series has been around for more than 30 years and for good reason it has dealt with all of the important elements that good storytelling includesrejection loneliness hope fear distrust love selfishness power and the price you pay for doing what you believe is right by consistently exploring various difficult elements of humanity the comic has been able to be not only entertaining but stimulating as wellthankfully singers movie translation is no exception is very well executed with excellent character work for the leads logan rogue magneto and xavier a good exploration of the motives of each character and dialogue that is sharp and intelligent however lest you think is only intellectual let me assure you that the specialeffects department has done an incredible job of mingling the human elements of the story with action from wolverines claws to rogues devasating touch from storms namesake displays of nature to magnetos awesome power constantly finds new and arresting ways of showingoff each mutants power and the closer you get to the end the more exciting it istrue the movie was not perfect certain story elements were modified slightly for bigscreen adaptation nothing however that is disloyal to the ethic of the series the soundtrack was only sufficient rather than being something truly memorable and not all of the characters were given equal time on screen some important characters were completely missingbut for a 90 minute movie that needs an action plot its obviously impossible to give all the and their evil counterparts equal attention or character development in fact the sheer scale of the series alone all but requires a sequel to flesh out what was missing in this first intro to movieyet as a beginning exploration of the universe this movie shines it is attractive fun and meaningful whether youre an fan youre looking for something that will make you think you want an action movie you enjoy scifi or you just want to leave the theater feeling like you didnt just waste a couple of hours and seven bucks go see bryan singers you wont be disappointed,fantasy
if this film had been given to the wrong director it could have been incredibly cheesy being a reader of the comics i know that there are a few things that works on the page of a comic book but not in a film and let me say that the costumes is one of these things that in all probability wouldnt work singer chose to go with black leather outfits and i for one am very thankful for this choice there are many things in this film that works but unfortunately there are a few things as well that prevent the film from being truly greatlets start with the things that work acting wise the film is very good this is above all attributed to some excellent casting hugh jackman is simply perfect as wolverine and brings out the duality of the character in a very satisfactory manner also the scenes were we see a glimpse of the rage in the character work remarkably well the only thing that could be said about him is that he is too tall but it seems most people including myself have accepted this fact i think also that it was a wise choice to let a relatively unknown actor play the part because in that way we have no preconceived notions about him as for professor x no other man than patrick stewart couldshould play him stewart simply becomes xavier both in presence voice and looks an example of perfect casting ian mckellen is brilliant as magneto and succeeds in creating a human villain rather than the usual clich like villains we see in hollywood productions the acting aside from the ones mentioned above is pretty good not spectacular but good the only one who does not look and act like the character we know from the comics is anna paquin who plays rogue the character is nothing like in the comics and paquins performance doesnt help the characterwhen it comes to music and sound effects in general the film is a notch above average the musical score has a very grand even epic feel to it and this suits the film very well the score is not as memorable as the score from batman 1989 but it is very adequate as for the general sound effects they are both very fitting and believable adding to the overall credibility of the film which is considerable the sound wolverines claws make when they come out is exactly as i imagined it very well done the effects in general are also very well made not as good as in spiderman but still very good a lot of care has been taken to make the effects seem as believable as possible and from where im standing they work the only character whose powers i did not fully believe in was toads ray park is an excellent athlete but many of his stunts look like obvious wire work this is a pretty general complaint i have as some of the action look rehearsed there is however some interesting action scenes and overall the action is acceptablethe story is pretty well written and the dialog is both witty and sharp especially much of the dialog between wolverine and cyclops james marsden is very entertaining and true to the comic books where i feel the story is lacking is in the climax which i am afraid to say is a little silly magnetos plan for world domination is actually pretty stupid when you think about it and that is a shame because much of the exposition is very well done generally however the first film is all about setting the stage for the films to come and it does do that in a satisfactory mannerall in all is definitely one of the better super hero movies out there and although it was surpassed by the sequel it still stands as a true testament to singers skill810,fantasy
a tale of superevolved mutants in a struggle against human oppressors is an instant scifi classic combining impressive special effects with an involving plot to create a truly memorable cinematic experiencelacking the tongueincheek camp of the later batman films and other recent comic booksturned movies draws the audience into its world of mutants and superpowers and prevents it from becoming tacky or absurd not to say that there isnt any humour in the film in fact it delivers some of the best one liners in a film this yearit is a rare thing for an action blockbuster to feature great acting but with a cast that among others involves both patrick stewart and ian mckellen is bound to be above average both stewart as professor charles xavier and mckellen as magnetodeliver stellar performances and their onscreen chemistry is compelling as they play two old friends turned arch enemiesthe rest of the cast deliver solid performances including hollywood newcomer hugh jackman as wolverine oscarwinner anna paquin as rogue and another rising star rebecca romijnstamos as the seductive but deadly mystiquea classic tale of good versus evil with heroes baddies and great special effects i dont think its going too far to say that is destined to be mentioned in the same breath as star wars and other alltime scifi greats,fantasy
there are some films which take the genre to some other level this film is definitely the one to do so in the superhero genregood  theres a whole bunch of good things that i can talk about bryan singer does his best to tell the story considering the comparatively weak script for an experimental film like this this was the first time in years that a superhero film was taken seriously given that there had been no introduction to any of the characters prior to this film it does a really good job to make them interesting plus it establishes the conflict between eric and xavier which have been an integral part of many films that came afterwards not to mention the character introduction especially that of wolverine was incredible we instantly know the basic characterization given to each of them which was enough to get behind the movie hugh jackman was the optimal choice for the role of wolverine and he proved it for next 17 years every single actor have done a good job in their roles also i believe that films have been the best superhero films when it comes to social themes we get to see the first of many times two friends with different world views clashing with one another it has grown incredibly stale now but was great to see back then and some other films after this especially first class and dofp the mutants wanting to be accepted by humans and the other mutants wanting to destroy mankind  what other superhero series have given such a theme or a similar one this movie is the reason we are getting films like infinity war civil war endgame batman begins and the dark knight while i prefer these over the first movie if it didnt bring the genre back on track we wouldve never gotten such filmsmixed  it feels dated had it been made today it wouldve been a lackluster it was clear that they were trying to experiment with this movie and still figuring out how to get things right while they got most of the things right they couldve made the story a little more complexbad  the story is quite a bit of a throwaway story while theres an interesting twist it still feels like the movie becomes a little goofy and cartoony after that twist some moments feel like they were shoehorned just to give some comic accuracy but they didnt feel justified i believe that if you get the basic elements right it doesnt matter if its not deadly accurate with the comics but if you want it to be so make some baseline for that dont do it randomlyconclusion  its a movie that set the genre back on track forever while the story and script might feel a little lazy when viewed today you can see that the execution of the ideas were as good as humanly possible if you are a superhero movie fan its a must watch not because its insanely great but just as a reminder of what led us to where we are i am a huge fan of the genre all credits go to nolans batman films the good films and raimis first two spiderman films i absolutely love the mcu and many dc films apart from nolans trilogy  man of steel wonder woman shazam the dark knight returns supermandoomsday etc but for me like for the genre it all started with the first movie so i have a very special place for this in my heart as a fanratingscore  810grade  a,fantasy
the answer to that question can be found in this movie with a resounding yes  being a fan of comics and cartoons i watched this movie with great skepticism  it was wonderful how the characters remained true to the comicsthe special powers that our mutant heros and villains possess are displayed exceptionally  it made me wish that i could have a special power of my ownenough can not be said of the phenomenal cast of actors that were selected for their roles  not only did they fit their parts perfectly but they made you believe  bravo to patrick stewart hugh jackman ian mckellen and a host of actors who were lucky enough to take part in this adventurebryan singer does a fantastic job of bringing it all together  the special effects in this movie only enhance the great script and acting  after seeing the dvd with the outtakes the editing was quite effectivethe true battle of good versus evil can always make for a great story but when a comic book is adapted to film and you feel that what you see is really possible it is a true stroke of genius,fantasy
the film version of stan lee and jack the king kirbys bestselling comic book creation has finally succeeded where more than twenty years of fourcolor superhero movies have failed  they have finally got it rightit is a stunning cinematic experience faithfully adapting nearly 40 years of continuity into a streamlined fastpaced wonderfully exciting trip into the legendary marvel universe  features incredible portrayals of much of the classic mutant cast especially virtual unknown at least here in the states hugh jackman as logan the canadian wildman we all know and love as wolverine  jackman seems born to play this coveted role with every bit of gruff and grim gusto his wolverine looks as if he simply stepped off one of chris claremont and john byrnes exquisitely crafted pages  the rest of the cast was also pleasantly wellcasted and wellsuited for their roles including the handsomely chisled james marsden as the stoic field commander cyclops and the gorgeous anna paquin as the cannevertouchbutwishweallcould rogue  famke janssen and halle berry are beautiful and bold as jean grey and storm respectively not just appearing as fleeting shards of eye candy but actually adding depth and strength to the flow of the film  patrick stewarts excellent professor charles xavier is in fine stewart fashion extrapolating on his jeanluc picard character and adding genuine compassion and warmthian mckellan is superb as the tortured master of magnetism magneto playing the part with malicious glee tempered with an extreme form of jingoism for his cause of the militant uprising of mutants over normal people  his brotherhood of evil mutants is composed of sabretooth viciously and animalistically portrayed tyler mane the phanton menaces ray park is the wickedly amusing toad and the stunning rebecca romaijnstamos is the shapeshifter mystique  park actually had the most to say of magnetos henchmen but it was appropriate as these three comprise an awesomely evil team of muscle and not philosophy like their leaderthe productions values were spectacular as were the settings taking us from a stark malign concentration camp in poland to the wilds of the canadian north to the serenity of westchester new york to a mindbending climax on liberty island  the action sequences were wellpaced and actionpacked and much more smoother and better choreographed than any of the batman films  the special effects especially wolverines legendary adamantium claws were truly aweinspiring was meticulously directed by bryan singer who along with 20th century fox actually listened to and cared about what xfans thought and wished to see on screen  although we would have all liked to have stayed in that theater for another 95 minutes there are many more stories to tell and god willing fox will let it happenmost importantly finally gives marvel entertainment group a firm footing on film a foundation that was never fully in its grasp until the surprise hit of two years ago blade  now that marvel has discovered that it can succeed with its toptier characters the sky is truly the limit for its varied cast of great characters  i hope that warner bros will sit up and take notice at what has accomplished  maybe this will be a wakeup call to those studio executives in charge of superman and batman and make them realize that the fans input really does count in the endhighest recommendation,fantasy
 is a well done scifi action film for all action fans especially for those who as kids dreamed of having special powers themselves each of the main mutant characters has a special ability and during the film i sometimes found myself thinking about which of those abilities i would choose if i were given the chance of course all of those special abilities are visible in the films spectacular special effects but the special effects were not the only thing that made watching this film fun there is also plenty of action and character interaction besides shooting and beating and using special powers as each mutant character is given a past to give him a motivation and a weakness the films plot never got boring because i also wanted to know how things developed between the mutants themselvesand i wont even talk about the ending it actually surprised me but go see for yourself,fantasy
ive always been a fan of the since the animated series aired id never really read any of the comics though  so when i heard they were making a movie about them i was counting the days until it was released maybe that affected how i viewed the movie but i was a bit disappointed director brian singer usual suspects did a good job with what hes got the multiple characters etc the whole project seems a bit safe though as if the producers wanted to make sure this big production didnt flop its a good movie but not a great one fans of the might be especially disappointed if their favorite characters do not include either wolverine or rogue mine personally is cyclops but he had a minor role james marsden who played cyclops was a bit on the stiff side but i forgive him because i like him as an actor on that note all the actors did an excellent job especially patrick stewart and ian mckellan as the forces of good and evil it brought an endearing humanistic side to a story i had thought was dominated by scifi if youre an fan i would definitely recommend this filmbut you probably have already seen it what fan would miss out if youre not a fan maybe this movie can be a starting point for a new obsession o,fantasy

was the usual suspects a fluke  bryan singer turns in a decidedly bmovie job directing this flat predictable comics adaptation  its almost too faithful to its original medium with 2d performances from all the principals except for hugh jackman as the grouchy wolverine he displays the closest thing to personality among these cardboard cutouts  patrick stewart is lifeless  ian mckellen who was believably dark in singers apt pupil here only looks very drowsy  and the themselves look like the cast of dawsons creek in dragthis film has endless problems  the action sequences and in particular the climactic battle in and on the statue of liberty look terribly staged just as on the comics page the characters halt to strike dramatic poses or dotingly brandish their super powers one of them hilariously even utters at one point storm use your power  it simply doesnt work any more than if singer had put speech bubbles above the characters heads compare these silly little fights to the superb sequences in jet lis black mask 1996 a film shot for a fraction of this ones budget but obviously with much greater talent and visionfor a comic with a rich graphical past the movies art direction delivers a strangely bland sterile look both for professor xs school and for the liberty set  both look lowbudget but neither is quite as bad as the villains secret seaside hideout which singer shot in such darkness that nary a detail can be seenoddly looks like two different movies  the first 15 minutes are lavishly designed and shot from the opening flashback of jews herded into a concentration camp to the discovery of a wolverine slumming in a moody northern logging camp  then abruptly the flair is gone and for the remaining 90 minutes we get a film that looks like one of the star trek tv franchise vehicles  except for storms look its pure penthouse magazine ca 1975 with halle barrys vapid expression rounding out the bill  the villains are halfcomically done but even that is a blunder by singer  we dont really get any comic relief from them and we can hardly worry too much about the if theyre beset by the likes of a villain called toad and even less when they remind us of the far wittier and betterlooking sendup of all this nonsense last years mystery menapart from the inanities there is also a true sin its unforgivably trite when a pulp fiction like this one hijacks the holocaust to inflate its meagre storyline and insincere theme  isnt really an allegory of genocide or even merely of racism  that stuff is just tacked on to what is really an exercise in big fights and big boobs  the old marvel formula fights and boobs arent bad in their own right but theyre done much better elsewhere without the pretensions to social justice,fantasy
how is this a good movie  maybe if you were into the comic books a movie of it would seem like a cool thing and then you just dont want to admit that the movie is pretty bad  it was not an engaging story at all after they left poland in the beginning  you kept expecting something that would to grab your attention but it never came  the ending was pretty lame and it seemed like the last 3rd of the movie was just setting up for the sequel i never really understood what the story was  i was expecting much better things  too bad for bryan singer after doing two very good movies or at least one very good then one notquiteasgood,fantasy
specialeffects and terrific 51 surround sound are the highlights of this science fiction film and what highlights they are  tremendous in both categories at least for 2000 when this film and dvd came out at the time they were the best specialeffects i had ever seen but strides are being made so fast in that category that every few years we movie fans are stunned at something new we see audiowise the rear speakers come into to play as well as any movie ive heardas for story once the beginning plugs for evolution and political correctness are over with it is a simple good guystryingtogetthebad guys fare its pure escapist fun made so with tons of scifi effects the characters arent particularly involving either the good guys or the bad guys the two leads played by hugh jackman and anna paquin should have been but werent jackmans logan wolverine always seemed to be pouting and angry but i guess hes a favorite of females for me and most males rebecca romjinstamos was a treat for the eyes her outfit was something to beholdif profanity bothers you the film was treat in that department too as there was very little obviously this film was popular enough to spawn not only a sequel but more in the making,fantasy
it is a great challenge to make the first episode of a superhero series why you have the pressure of making it believable entertaining dramatic exciting you know whatbryan singer hands down he is a great director is a hit and without the action sequences you would expect from a movie of this kind he keeps your full attention but not for long enoughthe minutes fly by and suddenly you will find yourself hoping for something exciting to happen and it will but by that the movie has reached almost its conclusiongood thing that there is a sequel that it works very good thanks to this first act not a bad thing right 8 out of 10,fantasy

fanboys have no sense of fun its partly their influence that makes these superhero tales increasingly selfimportant and witless if you flip through comic books today youll find they tackle issues such as drug addiction street crime racial bigotry and homosexuality all while musclebound louts in circus costumes are flying around and shooting laser beams out of their fists and no one fights crime any more they just wrestle with their own demons i recently scanned a comic book where an old superman and a young superman were throwing trucks and boulders at each other as they screamed poppsych jargon about their grievances in what seemed like an apocalyptic episode of dr philthis movie opens with a scene in a nazi concentration campyes a superhero movie with a realistic nazi concentration campwhere we meet the villain magneto as a boy who discovers his ability to move metal with his mind once were in the present or the nearfuture we see the us senate debating on whether mutants like magneto should be exposed and listed on a public register its like the yellow stars and numbertattoos jews were forced to wear in nazi germany get it i dont how is a fear of jews parallel to a fear of people who can walk through walls shoot fire out of their eyes or control the weather with their minds in this movie the earnest idealists are against the mutant registry and the snooty hypocrites are in favor of it frankly im with the snooty hypocrites what would we do if there were real superpowered mutants among us thanks to the fanboys thirst for realism even in comic book adventures the issues of wolverine and his ilk are made to seem like urgent social problemsfanboys have no sense of humor either a sense of humor is not the ability to laugh at everything but knowing when something is funny and when it isnt fanboys have nerdhumor nerdhumor comes from the desire to condescend to the very thing that one takes deeply seriously it comes out in this movie when logan later to be wolverine mocks silly superhero names like cyclops and storm whats your name he says to professor xavier who uses a wheelchair wheels this sounds like the movie spoofing itself but it isnt its the movie congratulating itself for being aware of its own absurdities and once it acknowledges them it can dismiss them and take itself all the more seriously this is in contrast to the 1960s tv show batman which really was a spoof but a fanboy doesnt get it not even if you tell him the joke yeah i know its a spoof but what kind of batman has a pot bellymarvel comics used to have a jaunty sense of fun but thats the company that introduced social relevance and superheroes who have everyday problems just like us the dc comics concept of heroes that are larger than life is dead and now even batman and superman have issues this opinion will guarantee me 0 of 564 useful votes but i think the ultimate superhero show is the wonderfully ludicrous cartoon series challenge of the superfriends now on dvd its funny fastpaced and entertaining in a way that a movie like this never could be the word the was dropped so that no one would give up on the title before he finished reading it offers the usual fare for fans of fantasy blockbusters great old actors patrick stewart and ian mckellan spouting nonsense younger actors delivering dismal wisecracks youre a dick rapid cutting so that were unable to savor a performance or believe that an actor is making more than one move at a time during a fight sequence cgi out the wazoo grandlooking sets and fabulous sound design for those who want their junk to look and sound good and overblown musicobviously i dont like the movie but it could have been far worse i watched the whole thing whereas i shut off the fantastic four the fantastic 4 fntstc 4 after 30 minutes and i was amazed how compelling and subtle anna paquin could be in a sea of sfx i kept wishing she and hugh jackman would steal away from the freak show sit down at a coffee shop and just talk for 90 minutes,fantasy
 is first superhero team movie in history also it is marvels first movie with a high budget movie is amazing about storytelling especially in first one hour i really liked the world they created but then it becomes a bit meaningless and complicated cgis are good for 2000 actors and actresses are awesome with their roles every one of them this film have some surprising scenes especially with mistique bryan singer made a good job at all,fantasy
after watching a lot of animated stuff i thought that it was time to watch some liveaction movies id heard rumours that the franchise was rather hit and miss well this was a very solid startnot everyone delivers a top performance but i was so happy that my favorite characters delivered hugh jackman does a relly good and charismatic job as the tough wolverine coming from a place he doesnt even know himself he ends up meeting marie aka rogue who brings him to xaviers school for the gifted their relationship is a highlight heremagneto gets a lot of star power from the magnificent ian mckellen and a well done take on his harsh past which leads him onto his dark path in life conflicting with his old friend xavier who are also given a nice portrayal by patrick stuartthe otherwise talented halle berry wasnt as convincing as storm i must admit the booming persona i knew was shifted to a quite monotonous one and her powers werent to show before nearing the climax james marsden was a good choice as cyclops but was kind of the same case as storm without real punch to the performancebut despite a few small bumps on the road i enjoyed more than i had expected because the story was actually really engaging when the focus was on the right elements like wolverine and rogue and how magneto fulfills his plan its not the usual superhero movie where action and special effects are the main focus but more like a psychological drama with some hero elements that makes it stand out among the crowdbut even though the special effects werent the main focus they were awesome hands down it may be a movie from the year 2000 but back then the effects werent used as much as they are today so when they were good they really rocked the screeni would recommend to people who like a well balanced movie with a well told story spiced up with the right amount of action and special effects,fantasy

ive never heard of this comic before and i hate comics in general but i enjoyed this movie i think some people are losing it a little with their big wraps of though it can surely only be described as a good fun movie thats not to be taken very seriously still hugh jackman was awesome and it managed to entertain me and thats all i was after,fantasy
the struggle of good vs evil with a lot of special effects if this was a childrens movie i wouldnt have commented on it but everyone is acting so seriously in this movie again i am afraid it is meant for ages 14 and above too like the matrix i completely and utterly disliked every boring little scene from beginning to end no fun no substance no originality there should be a separate imdb rating for american and european users so i wont get lured into crap like this by high ratings,fantasy
this first movie about the x men is my favorite of all the trilogy and the only one i was really excited to watch and i really liked of them all there is not a better wolverine then hugh jackman and i cannot imagine dougray scott  who was the first choice to play logan in hughs place patrick stewart and james marsden have both a big resemblance with the characters they play as wellafter watching all the x men movies only now i noticed that halle berry was using an accent to play storm in this first movie its a sad thing that so many famous mutants in the comics like jubilee shadowcat colossus iceman and pyro only have a small participation in it another sad thing is to see rogue as a frightened kidinstead of the sexy and strong woman she is in the comics instead of gambit rogues true romantic partner in the comics in this movie she has a interest in wolverinethe movie was directed by bryan singer and explores the ideas of prejudice and discrimination in the world specially united states,fantasy
this film was awesome its the first installment in a series of adaptations from the classic comics to bring the beloved comic heroes to life and the director achieves this with such cinematic kudos the film begins with the character wolverine played by hugh jackman struggling to come to terms with what he truly is but not for long we start getting introduced to the other characters as well at least the ones who havent checked themselves into the xavier school for the gifted yet we are introduced to a young rogue played by anna paquin who is so frightened by her special powers and what it does to the people around her that she runs away from home sooner than later she meets up with wolverine actually she hides in the back of his truck and he inadvertently allows her to tag along with him the chemistry between the two is blazing but weird since anna is so young and hugh is very much older along the way they are attacked by sabretooth and now know that it is imperative that they find the xavier school which they eventually do while there the meet a slew of gifted and team up with professor xavier played by patrick stewart to help stop the evil magnetto played by sir ian mckellen,fantasy

talking about the mockery of the expanded xfranchise that these days litters the magazineshelves of every supermarket and comes with a free holographic pog stuck to the cover i am of course referring to the golden age of comics long before marvel saw fit to suck satans scaly member and churn out the vacuous drivel its famous for today no marvel is dead and movies such as this one are surely the final nails being hammered into its coffin mercifully the art of the comic book is still alive and well and flourishing in the tender hands of the poorer independent labels where both artists and writers still toil away for the love of the mediumthis movie even standing alone and not being compared to its periodical counterpart soars to new heights of mediocrity looking as though its been filmed almost entirely on location in someones gardenshed it has none of the grandiose theatrical spectacle that it seems to think it has even given a beautiful location such as liberty island and was that grand central station our intrepid filmmakers still manage to find a way of shooting it so as to make you believe your watching someones shaky weddingvideo every effort to impart a sense of gravitas or screenpresence falls flat and the score well do you remember seeing rocky for the first time or supermanthe movie remember how on leaving the theatre that theme tune was still ringing in your head and did so for many years to come yes well this has none of that even the animated series had a catchy theme i only saw it once or twice but i can still hum you a few bars if youd like oh but wait i havent even started on the themselves yet they had the cast sir ian mckellen patrick wasthatboldlyorbaldly stewart halle butilookpretty berry hugh ruggedyetcharming jackman and anna iwasgoodinthepianowasnti paquin they had the makings of a true ensemble cast and then sadly had them all plod along through a story that just never seemed to get off the ground yes ive seen the sequel and yes i will watch the third instalment but this review encompasses my opinions for both the movies thus far releaseduneventfulfor example wolverine  sabretooth on paper these two have a long history together ask your average fanboy and hell surely tell you that when these to appeared in a book together you were guaranteed a thrilling acrobatic and visceral encounter sabretooth the savage brutal remorseless assassin and wolverine the berserker with the soul of a samurai struggling to tame his bestial urges never were two warriors more finely matched what do we get in the movie sabretooth an american prowrestler in a bonjovi wig following ian mckellen around like an bouffant poodle only to fall to his death at the first sign of trouble and wolverine well actually hugh jackman was one of the few things i cant fault about this movie cyclops being the other although the makers elected to portray wolverine at his most uninteresting jackmans performance given the material is a credit to him magneto on the other hand appears as a pale shadow of his comicbook self on paper hes not a geriatric waif of a man in a silly hat but a charismatic virile titan of a figure bestride the world a godamongmen some characters appear to have just been entirely rewritten rogue being the most obvious example now i wouldnt have a problem with this understanding the difficulties of bringing comicbook characters to the medium of film but if youre going to completely reinvent such widely loved characters at least do it wellfor the most part the are all weak watereddown versions of their comicbook originals thanks in no small part to the fact that they have been stripped of their trademark costumes garish and impractical though they may have been for the crossover to celluloid cyclops little nod to this noted what would you prefer yellow spandex it does detract greatly from the overall effect of superheroes on screen and although its true that at one time the uncanny did sport a standardised uniform and some rarely even employed a costume at all imagine spiderman or superman without their hallmark undiesoverall the suffers from one major and unavoidable flaw 2 hours in the theatre simply isnt enough time with so many years of development and plot in the comicbook and a cast of hundreds the move to celluloid was never going to be a successful one so i suppose this begs the question should it ever have been made on the strength of the two very soon to be three already made i have to say no ive heard tell that a number of spinoffs are in the pipeline a wolverine movie perhaps its my opinion that this will stand a better chance of succeeding and if its good then perhaps the travesty of the previous movies will be justified but until then i suggest you satisfy yourself with the uncanny as they were meant to be enjoyed between the pages of a comicbook,fantasy
this movie tries to be an action movie and an intelligent movie but fails dismally on both counts the so called intelligent parts to the paper thin plot were extremely weak and never really got past the we shouldnt pick on those who are different to us message as for the action it was drawn out predictable relied too much on special effects and lacked any sort of suspense also for most action type movies to work we need to at least care a little bit about the good characters and hate the bad guys quite frankly i didnt care who won or lost thanks to the almost nonexistent character developmentwell done this is the first movie i have ever awarded a wait for it  110  on imdb avoid this movie at all costs,fantasy
great for kids but anyone with a mental age of over 16 will find this tedious drivel a major disappointment ian mckellen what were you thinking how to spend the lovely fat paycheck no doubt and who can blame him ,fantasy
i have always liked the movie its a serious movie with a deep story and a dark nature ithas a very different cast and some incredible action the special effects are top notch the movie also has a unique score by michael kamen that fits this film perfectly below in a small but indepth look at the characters of the filmthehugh jackman as wolverine  there is not much information that is known about logan or as he is called by another name which is wolverine because of his hair and his raw fighting skills and not to mention his great sense of smell and like his arch nemesis sabertooth he too has an incredible healing rate he also has the outstanding ability to have three steel claws in each hand that comes through the knuckle area he uses these thick blades for weapons and they do the task well what kind of mutant is wolverine how can he possibly have this painful but yet great advantage that literally shoots out of his hands will professor x and his help logan find out or will wolverine have to find out on his ownpatrick stewart as professor charles xavier  professor x the head of the school for gifted youngsters he helps mutants with their powers by teaching them many things he is a kind man and he seems to be more of a father or parent than a mentor he is a very intelligent mutant and he can do many things with his mind in fact he just may have the most powerful mind on earth unlike magneto charles xavier believes in peacejames marsden as cyclops  scott summers has such powerful eyes he needs a special visor to control it what causes this red beam is unknown and his visor helps him maintain this dangerous red light but he can control the beam with the help of a knob as he can adjust this to help him whenever he needs to use it however but without the special visor look out for an incredible blast he is also a skilled pilotfamke janssen as jean grey  she also has a very powerful mind though she needs more time on how to master it with the help professor x she likes cyclops but she also cares about loganhalle berry as storm  this egyptian beauty has the power to create all kinds of storms ororo munroe has long white hair and whenever she uses her great power her eyes turn white as wellanna paquin as rogue  she has the unusual power to drain the life out of anyone she touches she must wear gloves to prevent this from happeningthe brotherhoodian mckellen as magneto a very intelligent man that is erik magnus lehnsherr where he hails from is unknown but what is known he has an extraordinary power that he can magnetize anything that is metal whether its as small as a key or as large as a car it becomes no problem for magnetotyler mane as sabertooth  the huge maniac that is known as sabertooth has incredible senses and is able to heal from injuries faster than anyone except wolverine this giant lunatic loves to hear women scream and he has a passion to hear the scream or none other than storm victor creed is a psychopath and with his long claws and razor sharp teeth he is out for bloodray park as toad  the green skinned mortimer toynbee has a real long tongue and can grab a hold of an animal for lunch and also can use it to grab and use to swing out of danger he has great leaping ability and fighting skillsrebecca romijnstamos as mystique  though her real name is raven darkholme she prefers to be called mystique due to her mysterious shape shifting the blue skinned woman can change exactly into anyone and even duplicate the clothes they wear she is incredibly agile and she has excellent fighting skills and shell give the greatest fighters the planet has to offer a great challengeother charactersbruce davison as senator robert kelly  unlike some people he is a believer in mutants and knows what they can do he is captured by the lovely mystique as it was a mission to her magneto shows the senator what its like to be a mutanti really like the movie and i think bryan singer did a good job on the characters though x2 is arguably better than this and i would love to have the franchise to spawn more than a trilogy though it may never happen but i think about this a lot that wouldnt it be awesome if they would have these great comic book characters together with other marvel characters from movies like the hulk spiderman blade the punisher  daredevil think of the epicness and possibilities i hope you have enjoyed this indepth look at the,fantasy
 has much to commend it compared with the average comic book flick theres a star director in the form of bryan singer and excellent performances from veteran british actors patrick stewart and ian mckellan although mckellan plays a villain he also draws sympathy to his character which is also unusual in a film of this type  above all theres an uncommonly interesting scenario  the original comic book was apparently inspired by the civil rights struggle in the usa and in the film version theres also a hint of the mccarthy era  ordinary human beings far from being portrayed in an attractive manner are shown as weak small minded bigots who might vote for george bush or read the daily mail meanwhile a civil was erupts among the mutants they persecute one faction stewarts committed to peace the other mckellans convinced that coexistence with humans is no longer possible and ready to fight all those who stand in their wayagainst this there are a few negatives  the acting of the attractive characters who play the young is wooden or more appropriately metallic compared with that of their elders  the expensive special effects are also slightly cumbersome they feel like inserted sequences  the matrix may have been emptyheaded but it set new standards for integrating computergenerated animation into the entire world of the film and rates poorly by comparison  also the possibility that mckellan might be right is never acknowledged by the film  were allowed to accept that he is genuine but not that his chilling analysis may yet be correct  and finally the plot is a bynumbers affair  neophytes are inducted by a master only for the master to become incapacitated leaving the newcomers to fend for themselves before a happy and sequelsetting ending  exactly the same as the matrix in factbetter by far than the average blockbuster doesnt quite live up to its potential  but theres more food for thought here than in most films of its ilk,fantasy
this film made my butt hurt sometimes you can sit through a three hour movie and it keeps you captivated all the way through not giving you a reason to think about your sitting position in the theater seat even though is about ninety minutes long its really slow and it made me think about how i was sitting and therefore it made my butt hurt so now you know thatbut is not just a pain in the a its quite good but not a must seethe trailer for promises an action packed movie as trailers often do but is more of a character film even though the characters are not that deep so i guess this movie would be more fun for readers of the comic book to whom i dont belonganyway i was hoping for action a la the matrix and surely director bryan singer has been inspired a little by the matrix one of the female characters makes a sideways flip in the air and i think that shot even has the same camera angle as in the otherwise same shot in the matrix this is the kind of stealing that film makers call homage but to bryan singers defense i would like to say that he has already proven to me that he has a good visual sense in the usual suspectsthe problem with is that the action scenes are few and far between even though they are visually stunning other than that the film has some cute scenes making it all worthwhile in the endi also have to add that this is newton thomas siegels director of photography best work yet,fantasy
i tried to like this silly action filmbryan singer has done the usual suspects and its placed 15 in the top 250 over the best films everwhy i did not like that one at all tries to be this smart and on the same time funny action filmi just dont get it bad actingsilly story,fantasy
this film does a very good job of setting the scene it introduces mutants a sect of humanity hated and feared by the rest we see rogue a young runaway who happens upon a another mutant a gruff unsociable cage fighter named logana dude with amnesia and retractable metal claws we meet senator kelly a political opportunist using the mutant threat to further his own careerhe puts me in mind of mccarthywith his belligerent and combative interviews in a senate committee of mutant affairshe grandstands and scaremongers with the best of themall the while pushing his mutant control billa law that will force all mutants to register with the government meanwhile theres erik lensherr a survivor of the holocaust and mutant with extraordinary powershaving seen mans ability to be inhumane first hand he believes mutants should strike first while humans are weak and divided on the issue his old school friend takes the polar opposite view and teaches his students to learn to live with their powers for the benefit of all humansprofessor charles xavier and his students the x men soon come into conflict with lensherr the stage is set for a war of ideology based on racial grounds erik with every reason to hate humans launches his attack to preserve his kindxavier on the other hand has a more precarious moral position he risks his x mens lives to defeat his own kind and defend the very humans that would love to get rid of them a complex moral minefield and a great filmshame then that the sequels were such utter dross no wonder bryan singer walked away,fantasy
 surprised me with its intelligence marvelous direction and wonderful charactersa startlingly fun movie to watch is one of the better comic book adaptations out there in fact id say it was the best one made until spiderman came out even then its a close call does really well with balancing the terrific number of characters it features on screen i think this is the movies best aspect it gives us a lot of depth to every character on screen including wolverine who i was not pleased with when i saw origins wolverine its a little ironic that there was more depth given to wolverine in a film that was not strictly about wolverine than the character study film did that was supposed to be solely about wolverine i started to feel an interesting connection to this character this is incredibly important because this is the first time i had ever thought much of anything for wolverine including in other films tv shows and comic books excellent developmenti was even more impressed with some of the side characters like rogue rogue was portrayed beautifully by anna paquin i was unprepared for the level of intensity that this young actress was able to bring to the table with her character she seemed frail but independent strong and weak at the same time and there was so much emotional strength given to her that by the time we got to the climactic battle i was genuinely concerned for her i also really loved the friendship that was played out between her and wolverine it was done extremely well and the two shared some really impressive scenescyclops storm and jean grey were a little underplayed but i was still satisfied with the level of character development that we still got from them i was able to take all these characters seriously and i was able to follow each of their own inner struggles in a way that again i had not anticipatedian mckellen was yet another surprise for me as magneto i had never held much stock in the villain believing him to be nothing particularly special and when i saw the old man who was to play him i couldnt hold back my scoff but the surprises kept coming through and i couldnt help but love this guys performance he plays the villain magneto very well giving a powerful and poignant performance thats nothing to scoff atand while i am talking about the actors and characters i cannot forget patrick stewart who played professor xavier i think this was the best performance in the film patrick stewart really brought this character to life giving the audience an incredibly powerful performance there was a scene when he was talking to wolverine and cyclops and i suddenly realized i was leaning forward in my chair to hang onto every word this guy had to say a brilliant and underrated performancethen there were the incredible visuals in this story whether they were all cgi or not i did not know and neither did i care this film was still made before everything had gone to such gargantuan lengths in the computers and i could tell the effort that was put into the visuals and they looked really darn goodbut what impressed me still more than anything else about was the direction this film was directed by bryan singer and he gives the audience some really intense direction i was blown away by the cinematography among everything else singer is a wonderful director i havent seen any of his other films but i want to now is an entertaining andabove everything elsefun ride that is sure to grasp comic book fans and noncomic book fans alike910,fantasy
unbelievably i have recently learned that some people dont like this first movie very much i dont know why because i did not want to learn i will just write what i think is the best one in the series including origins wolverine by far even if the second one is deeper and it comes from perfect direction mostly the movie is very consistent no uneven material it has at all it is very stylish and very enjoyable also the tone the atmosphere of the movie are so different from the comic book orand the animation it is like bryan singer creates his own world but somehow it does not turn into a flaw or disappointment visually it looks like a thriller rather than a colorful fantastic super hero movie but this works somehow personally i did not complain about it instead it makes the movie eccentric idiosyncratic i like the snowy shots and despite it is short one of the best action scenes of the movie the fight after the accident as for magneto ian mckellen was made for magneto and of course for gandalf too as i know some people complained about sabretooth but may be even if he was not made for the character like mckellen patrick stewart as professor x and halle berry as storm tyler mane looks great as sabretooth i saw the original character i watched the animation but i dont know why they were not satisfied with tyler manes sabretooth what was wrong he is as harsh as the original character too halle berry is so cute by the way there are a few smart moments like the steel balls or the metal floors related to magneto by the way i liked it the action scene takes place in the station is my second favorite just a note there is a shot with a weird angle it was amazing visually is one of the most stark plain movies ever made probably the last parts are amazing too we see some cool fight scenes everyone encounters with each other every time it is so fun to watch thanks to singers stark eccentric direction and the colorful characters the wolverine sabretooth clash is not the focus of the movie but better than origins wolverine on the statue of liberty there is a spiral camera shot loved and has much more,fantasy
i was not waiting for a clever plot but only for good special effects the plot was less than bad and the special effects sequences together are not new and do not represent more than 15 minutes of these 90 minutes of annoyement the caracters have no consistency the plot is weak predictable and targeted to 3 years old kids the open gate to a second film makes us laugh as nobody will go to see it the dialogs are absolutely ridiculous i only wanted to leave the theatre and go back home to play blade runner or starship troopers on videoin france the more people speak about this film the more they go to see something else very surprising that it is considered to be number 140 out of 250 best films must be because most of the voters are not french,fantasy
when this movie came out comic book movies were down on their es the last big comic book movie until then was batman and robin so basically the genre was dead and killed it was no other movie than that reignited the genre and proved that a comic fantasy world does not have to be corny goofy and cheesy at allbryan singer created a suspenseful story in which the characters had to deal with being different  and the conflict that rises from bigotryin the not too distant future prof charles xavier has a school for socalled mutants people who are different generally these mutants possess abilities that normal people do not have  which causes fear and hate in the hearts of the american people hence senator robert kelly proposes a law that calls for mutants to register themselves xaviers frenemy erik magneto lensherr is appalled by this law and plots to spread mutancy among world leaders at a un summit xaviers cyclops storm and jean grey struggle to stop magneto in the middle of these conflicts runaway mutants rogue and wolverine take refuge at the xavier school for gifted youngstersits a brilliant movie with tons of easter eggs and nods to the fans while not lacking action or fantastic elements the movie plays the brain card it is clever slightly dark remember how recently the second installment of captain america the winter soldier was described as a political thriller well did it firstbut what really excels is how it captures the emotional impact of being different how the daily struggle of minorities is portrayed through the metaphor of mutancy it is what sets apart from other super hero  comic book movies it is their trump card therefor its a shame that this element is being shoved more and more to the background as the xmovie franchise expands i hope in the future they will look back at this first one from time to time if only to remember what the xgene of this series isall in all brought back comic book movies it did for the genre what star wars a new hope did for space movies so maybe there are comic book movies you enjoy more than this they would not be here if it wasnt for the and their first movie i have never granted a 1010 to a movie before but this one deserves it,fantasy
this movie ranks up there with spiderman as the best comic book adaptation it introduces us to the mutants with a little of their background and how they joined professor x in his fight against magnetostellar acting and a plot that doesnt take itself too serious yet serious enough keeps the movie fueled the mutants and their adversaries are interesting the showcasing of their various powers a real treat because they are not overly endowed with powerful abilities each mutant having one definable power their one on one matchups are all the more attractive we have a little bit of a love triangle three dimensional characters tortured souls comedic relief and an attractive cast all wrapped up in costumes great stuff the movie inevitably sets up sequels for years to come there is no doubt this will become a franchise much in the way batman begins and spiderman are the question is will the departure of bryan singer mean the fall of this budding series,fantasy
its very rare for a movie to live up to the claims made about it by publicity and in articles prior to its release even good movies often fall short  but by george does deliver the goods right down the line its made in a straightforward basically realistic style with superpowers taken for granted and thankfully not explained if this isnt our world its the one next door  i loved the first tim burton batman but it takes place in its own dark universe the richard donner superman and donner was involved in too has some problems but its big sweeping almost pastoral approach was just right  singer does differently but just as legitimately  its one of the best superhero movies ever made and the best bigstudio movie this year  easilyjust as they said theyd do the movie concentrates on the characters and their relationships to the degree that the superhero stuff of which there is plenty seems almost secondary to the story which in this first entry is mainly about wolverine and rogue i was very disappointed in apt pupil singer misjudged that one so i was unsure as to what to expect with  would it be more like usual suspects or more like apt pupil  it turns out to be much more like usual suspects at least in terms of qualityand you get to see the turn into a team before your eyes very satisfying movie,fantasy
great movie the original 3 movies will always be the best but i dont like how the make one of the powerfullest mutants seem so useless in this movie,fantasy

bryan singer offers not only a solidly structured humble film but also an stylish and grounded story that represents the official blockbuster resurrection of the genre showing how good superheroes can work with the proper production behind them,fantasy
probably the first movie about a group of superheroes that got work very well and nowadays still incredible its amazing the introduction of the characters each one of them have your own characteristics personality and off course the powers really interesting and very cool see them use this the visual effects are good like the adventure,fantasy
faithful to the comics and filled with action brings a crowded slate of classic marvel characters to the screen with a talented ensemble cast and surprisingly sharp narrative focus,fantasy
amazing movie and wonderful its not bad especially when it comes to the end of scene,fantasy
i recently rewatched this movie after watching it for the first time around 2 years ago most of the characters are great and entertaining wolverine cyclops jean professor x magneto but at times some of the characters are severely underused halle berrys storm or annoying like rogue rogue is the weakest link of this movie and is very out of character compared to her comic book counterpart but aside from characters the plot is great and the effects are amazing to say this came out 19 years ago overall even though it isnt the best movie its certainly an enjoyable ride and a great comic book movie id be sure to give it a watch,fantasy
up until the 21st century dc had dominated the comic book adaptations on the big screen film franchises like superman and batman were essentially the only acts in town of course by the time the year 2000 rolled around superman hadnt been in theaters for more than a decade and batman had become almost as campy and goofy as its 1960s counterpart this was now marvels time to shine partly due to a large cast of recognizable characters was the right choice to reboot the comic book adaptation film franchiseeven though set the standard pretty high for comic book adaptations very few have followed in its stead where most first films in a hero franchise focus on the origins of the main character the spans such an enormous timeframe with characters coming in and out of relevance that it would be difficult to give all of their origins at once instead the focus is on rogue anna paquin and logan hugh jackman essentially giving some of their origins without having to explain the motivations of every other characterwhat really makes this film work aside from its relevant plot is the casting not only were these toptier stars appearing in the film but they were expertly given roles that fit them incredibly well in fact i can almost not imagine anyone else playing wolverine but hugh jackman the same goes for halle berry as storm ian mckellen as magneto and patrick stewart as professor xavier i wouldnt have gone with anyone else for those roles which definitely made casting the prequel trilogy quite the challengeprobably one of the best comictomovie transitions ever made i give 45 stars out of 5,fantasy
continuing my plan to watch every hugh jackman movie in order its straight to the hits with his second movie 2000plot in a paragraph in a world where mutants evolved superpowered humans exist and are discriminated against two groups form for an inevitable clash the supremacist brotherhood and the pacifisthugh jackman whilst nowhere near as ripped as he will be in subsequent movies has an impressive debut as loganwolverine anna paquin stands out as rogue she has some nice chemistry with jackman and im surprised she never went on to bigger things really famke janssen james marsden rebecca romijin and halle berry in a white wig are all decent enough without being greatbut for meit is the casting of patrick stewart and sir ian mckellan that is a masterstroke as professor x and magneto respectively they are not enemies so much as ideological opposites they bring style gravitas and panache to the proceedingsfor an origin movie introducing a host of new characters to the movie going public its not overly long i actually thought this has flown by then i realised its run time as the credits rolled most of the special effects hold up it has a nice score and ill admit it does hit me in the feelings during logans attempts at reviving rogue during the finale,fantasy
i watched this after watching the sequels and its clear to see that this is the best of the films patrick stewart and hugh jackman are brilliant in the film,fantasy
what you get here is a pretty common structure of a villain movie nice buildup getting to know the relevant mutants and the set our story is taking place in ending in a showdown the plot made sense for most parts motivations of characters added up good productioni did feel entertained while i dont think this is the pinnacle of possiblity in the marvel universe good movie nonetheless ,fantasy
theres so much great stuff in this which is the actual first movie to set the tone for superserious superhero films jackman was a revelation the faded line between good and evil kellys body horror scene magneto in whole etc etc etc but above all it boasts one of the greatest superhero films openings ever at auschwitz even with some good entries in between the franchise never got better until logan,fantasy
very classy scifi fantasy with an exceptional cast good music and allround fantastic production very entertaining indeed,fantasy
we have come a long way in 2000 a group of mutants gathered to fight another group of mutants over a mutant registration law while an ambush on un meeting must be stopped wellthis happened in 2000 long before the avengers civil war happened its cool how this film looks of possible ways to solve a problem with the as the good guys who wanna have a conversation about mutants living besides humans meanwhile there is magneto who wants to transform humans into mutants in his mind the next step of the evolution and a senator who thinks mutants are living weapons and who wants weapons in a school see what they did there hes bad but is arguing is kinda okay the whole movie is about people fighting for the right cause with the wrong means and btw all the actual fights are taking place without annoying one liners by the participants a fight is a fight that feels so good,fantasy
while 2000 can be lacking in action and its age is starting to show in a couple of areas this pioneer of the genre is still an entertaining experience with great character moments its at its sharpest when exploring themes of civil rights those that were at the heart of the series since its inception and the thematic elements can be surprisingly dark i dont think anyone expected this big budget blockbuster to begin in a concentration camp the film is a solid start to what would become a major franchise and its easy to forget what a monumental task it had setting up its fantastical but grounded world and characters while making them digestible for a wide audience is no mean feat and the fact it pulls it off so effortlessly is commendable its fantastic casting helped with most of the main cast sticking around for over ten years while the series did get better  though it also got much worse this feature is an enjoyable and engaging one from start to finish 710,fantasy
contrary to the ongoing publicity from the mcu the superherofilm genre did not start with iron man 2008 it began 8 years earlier with and director bryan singers deft vision of how to take realistic people who just happen to have mutant powers and convincingly put them on screen my rating for imdb really means a 7 with an asterisk several years ago i would probably have given a higher numerical rating for imdb but of course the field has kept rising in the nearly two decades  since but thats really the whole point this groundbreaking movie itself deserves a ton of credit for getting that train rolling with apologies to the classic superman and batman films of the previous generation ca 198090 they really had no successors and the special effects capabilities were not really up to the task is what made this genre stick i watched it again recently on dvd after many years absence and it still holds up quite well its just so likable the characters are engaging like people youd want to know better the storyline is clear and the ending is satisfying while obviously leaving threads for a followup its eagerly welcomed sequel x2 united 2003 raised the bar in every way and it still ranks imho among the handful of the best superhero films ever made gets a lot of things right for one thing the comics from which it draws its basic elements has had a very strong cohort of female characters almost right from the beginning sure enough in this movie the cast of players has something approaching gender equity with jean grey ororo rogue and mystique famke janssen halle berry anna paquin rebecca romijn alongside the leading men professor x magneto scott summers and of course wolverine  patrick stewart ian mckellen james marsden hugh jackman the only thing that doesnt quite make it to full gender equality is that the agendas driving the plot are still being set by the two older men who lead the opposing teams of good and bad mutants another obvious highlight is the quality of the casting stewart and mckellen already well established top actors at that stage gave the cast instant credibility are almost perfectly suited for their roles hugh jackman was a revelation in his breakout role as wolverine the snarling physically intimidating antihero continually plagued by the mystery of his own origin halle berry who i guess was intended to lend another reasonably big name to the list looked the part of storm all right but was too softspoken that character needs to have a commanding regal demeanor james marsden is fine as action team leader scott summers though a dozen other guys would do as well the young anna paquin plays a mutant who hates and is trapped by her own power famke janssen though not a great actress nevertheless nicely puts across a charismatic warmth in a key tooshort scene halfway through we get an early foreshadowing of her capability for selfaware selfsacrifice the mindenhancing cerebro computer straight from the comics has been sabotaged and puts the professor into a coma after he tries to use it jean knowingly putting her entire mind at risk uses it to uncover magnetos location in x2  where shes really the central character  she will choose a much costlier action to save the entire team for the villains here called the brotherhood  the brotherhood of evil mutants as it was in the early rather simplistic comics just wouldnt have worked  tyler mane and ray park as sabretooth and toad dont have much to do before the final dustup but theyre fine the shapeshifter mystique rebecca romijn doesnt need to do much either except look spectacular which indeed she does but in the final action scenes she has a great allout fight with wolverine storm also gets to show off her full weathercontrolling power at several points throughout the first 20 minutes or so has the difficult job of introducing not just one new leading character but an entire team of them to get this across we get a very nicely staged series of dramatic entries first is the flashback to the concentration camp in 1944 where young erik now magneto has the traumatic experience that shapes his entire life then its the present day with jean speaking at a senate committee meeting that also introduces senator kelly an effective bruce davison and the mutant problem that underlies all the movies along with charles and erik behind the scenes  then in rapid succession we get rogue logan scott and storm expertly linked and finally thesion where the main plot can finally get started a nice touch is that all the action is placed in historical context the shadowy contest between professor x and magneto and their teams has already been going on for years and this plot is just one episode in a bigger story x2 continues the saga pretty much where this important first one leaves off finally ill repeat what i said in my review of x2 they both succeed because the storyline and the characters take center stage  not the action scenes doesnt skimp on action but its what happens between the action set pieces that makes a movie like this last,fantasy
from bryan singers creative mind this is an instant classic for all fans hugh jackman did an outstanding job on his debut as wolverine a must watch for and marvel fans alike,fantasy
 released back in 2000 had several among fans of hype since it was the beginning of the decade as well as the film has been very anticipated this film does a lot well and is a great piece of entertaining running relatively short on screen time about 96 mins excluding the end credits compared to the typical 2 hour of other comic book superhero films although the pacing could have been better since it wasnt too long things come into place very quickly and the film becomes instantly good the cast is great which is what makes the film excel the chemistry between the characters work out well especially hugh jackman wolverine with patrick steward charles xavier as well as the other heroes storm cyclops jean grey and rogue the visual effects are top notch we see how far this franchise has come into the year 2017 as many had not known back then how successful these films would have become comparing this original film to the newer films of the 2010s this feels somewhat more dark in spirit and less comical in some ways a feel in tone is noticeable most definitely lived up to the hype and is overall exciting and faithful to its original comic book origins although with quite a simple plot it flows decent enough and by the end of the film in which an obvious sequel was set we are left wanting more highly recommend for those of fans of the source material as well as those wanting to see how the origin started,fantasy
when it comes to the i watched the 90s animated show but i never read the comics as a kid so when i sat down to watch the movie i wasnt sure if i would like it or not well i can say that is a fantastic movie from its themes about discrimination and bigotry to its acting and its faithfulness to the source material in fact had it not been for this movie the comic book movie renaissance may never have happenedthe movie starts with a young erik lehnsherr is taken from his parents inadvertently reveling his mutant abilities later the senate attempts to pass a registration act for mutants which deeply concerns lehnsherrs former friend charles xavier meanwhile marie dancanto flees her home and arrives in canada where she meets another mutant named logan the two are soon brought to xaviers school and now must stick together to stop magnetos evil plansunlike many of marvels and dcs heroes is a more socially and morally complex comic series about individualism and injustice as the heroes are not accepted and have to fight for a place in the world and unfortunately suffer because theyre not only different but also possibly deadly the bigotry that humans display towards these mutants provides an interesting metaphor for our own recent climate of political ethnic sexual and homophobic intolerance as well as the anxiety teens and young adults face as they seek their own place in the world some have equaled the battle between magneto and professor x to the clash between martin luther king jr and malcolm x while others have commented on mutants as badges for any persecuted group of people compelled to classify themselves whether they be minorities lgbt or gun owners even the narration at the beginning of the movie aptly captures thes background as well as the deepseating battles they will have to facewhile many comic book movies open with sweeping credits and fabulous music bryan singer decides to set this movie up a little different by showing us the horrors of the holocaust which recalls several scenes from schindlers list while lehnsherr unleashing his power evokes the prom scene from brian de palmas carrie and as far as movie intros go the opening scene at auschwitz grasps the viewer with its sadness and clearly this appalling and gloomy scene isnt the traditional way to open a comic book movie not to mention the way the scene also shapes the villains perception of mankind and allows the viewer to feel sympathetic for magneto and realize that he isnt like darth vader or norman bates but rather a illguided radical who has seen the dark side of humankind and sees them as inferior making for a much more interesting comic book villain than what some comic book films try to do with their villainsas for the director bryan singer he deserves all the praise given to him over the years because apart from a few other directors he has been able to make a truly great comic book film by giving each character be them hero or villain enough development to in order for us to care about them as well as addressing the themes that the comics touched on without preaching or hitting the audience over the head with it and a lot of that comes from the acute and insightful dialog from the screenplay by david hayter and an unacknowledged christopher mcquarrie whose fingerprints can be viewed throughout the movie like the argument between senator kelly and jean gray at the beginning of the movie is enlightened but it also sets up the events of the movie to come while the conversation between erik and charles towards the end of the movie interprets what a discussion between mlk jr and malcolm x would should be like the film is nearly perfect with its editing and music as we move from scene to scene with every moment benefiting the scene and never overstaying its welcome while the music by composer michael kerman is truly magical but also dark and foreboding at time perfectly complementing the dark tone of the film unlike a lot of more recent superhero movies there isnt a lot of action in the movie as it isnt the focal point but its still impressive to watch and is more than fulfilling and incredibly elegant like the fight between wolverine and sabertooth in the snow or the final battle at the stature of liberty while the visual effects are also fantastic and seem to add to the film rather than distract from the viewing experienceas for the cast theyre all flawless ian mckellen is outstanding as magneto and what might have come across as a corny performance instead gives us a distinguished and authentically enraged villain as ian appears to create layers of cruelty and discrimination within himself making for a more sympathetic villain rather than a powerhungry madman and he could have easily made the movie his own famke jessen is admirable as jean gray and brings a lot of deepness to what otherwise could have a poorly written character while james marsden brings the overly firm cyclops to life in a wonderful way rebecca romjin brings a lethal edge to the shapeshifter mystique while halle berry brings a certain believability and truthfulness to the role of strom patrick stewart was born to play charles xavier and gives a wonderful performance conveying all the characteristics of a father figure and leader anna paquin is perfect as rouge bringing a level of anxiety to her performance but also still managing to be a strong interesting character but hugh jackman as wolverine makes the movie and plays the character with every dose of hotheaded and depressing enthusiasm and its a joy to seetheres really nothing more that can be said about it changed comic book movies and should be watched,fantasy
 is a 2000 film based on marvels comic book series the plot follows a drifter named wolverine played by hugh jackman who is soon introduced to a young woman nicknamed rogue wolverine quickly realizes why the girl wants to stay with him they are both mutants or people who are born with supernatural abilities the misfit duos genes soon bring them in the middle of a clash between two organized mutant groups charles xavier played by patrick stewart and his mutant against magneto played by ian mckellen and his brotherhood of mutants action and heroism follow that lead to an epic battle of mutant against mutantthe film takes many liberties from the comic books but it seems to work well in this setting the movie has all the action and fun youd expect from the including a smug cyclops the rebellious and awesome wolverine and an interesting cast choice of halle berry as storm the special effects are good the movie keeps an exciting pace and the story is interestingthe problems with this movie mainly consist with the poor dialogue this is the part of a comic book movie that needs to be the least like a comic book corny oneliners puns and melodramatic dialogue take away from the seriousness established in the conflict some of the fighting scenes are a little silly especially the ones including the shapeshifting mutant mystique my final complaint which i make in hesitation was the way some of the plot devices were handled i cannot elaborate too much on this without giving anything away but one example i can make is the villains clich doomsday weapon where did it come from how does it work its just there to be there to be the conflict and the problem that has to be addresseddespite these flaws the film is still entertaining and enjoyable actionpacked and full of your favorite characters from the comics this movie is mostly for the fans outsiders are in for a corny ride that the action may not justify,fantasy
heres a cinematic rarity a comic strip getting a successful big screen treatment it doesnt happen very often but were finally at the stage of cgi technology to actually make an effectsintensive movie like this work and look right this is a film never designed to win any awards for the script direction or acting abilities yet instead appeal to the crowds as a fun exciting way to spend one hundred minutes of your life and with a film like this the biggest impact comes watching it on the big screen ive never been a fan of the comics or television series myself which is why i was surprised about enjoying this film the characters are clear cut easy to identify with and most of all extremely cool for a blockbuster film like this its rare to find characterisation but gasp it does occur here chiefly with the character of wolverine who is given most screen time hugh jackman is excellent in the role bringing the right balance of instability anger love and honour to his character and hes also very charismatic as well and thats not mentioning the great big bloody spike things which frequently shoot out of his knucklesthe rest of the are familiar yet due to there being so many of them are given little or nothing to do storm gets to partake in some spectacular hellraising moments yet thats it patrick stewart is on hand as the wise mentor professor charles xavier yet is also given little to do aside from roll around in his wheelchair and lapse into unconsciousness at important moments anna paquin puts in a good heartfelt performance as the shunned rogue unable to come into skin contact with another living soul and we do feel for her situation but shes the only one cyclops has great xray vision but when hes got his glasses on hes forgettablethe bad guys are a mixed bunch and seemingly possess little in the way of intelligence and theres only four of them sabretooth is a big hairy and powerful guy yet just seems like a bigger inferior version of wolverine ian mckellen as magneto seems a somewhat lame leading bad guy and the decision to make him a threedimensional and human villain takes away some of the impact of his character and the sight of him floating around in a cape is guaranteed to raise the odd chuckle mystique is visually arresting as the blueskinned shape shifter but most of her tricks have been stolen from the liquid metal man in terminator 2 and countless body snatcher films finally ray park better known as the actor under the makeup playing darth maul in the phantom menace is a delight as the purely evil toad with a whopping great tongue and the ability to jump about all over the placefor those expecting action there is actually not that much aside from the predictable ending one standout moment has chaos reigning at a train station but little else in the way of fighting occurs as this is a 12 certificate film we never actually see any on screen deaths occur and theres hardly any blood or impact to the violence either  here its unfortunately glamorised wolverines claws are used to impale only a few people who survive which is a bit of a cheat but the biggest cheat of all is the films copout ending predictably paving the way for a sequel which leaves most of the bad guys alive and the fate of the others unknownthis film is definitely worth watching for the special effects alone as they easily surpass the overdone nature of the ones in something like the phantom menace theyre also almost constantly on screen and most effective when they occur in normal situations when you dont expect them my particular favourite was when one unfortunate man dissolved into water or a moment where one character squeezes between cell bars and has his eyes bulge out alarmingly and then theres all manner of comicbook explosions lightning lasers and big clouds of vaguely threatening white stuff no i have no idea what it was supposed to be either the only complaints come from the occasionally poor editing and the openendedness of the finale otherwise this is well worth a watch and a nice satisfying piece of light entertainment,fantasy
i remember wizard magazine and a couple of other comic book publications speculating on who would be case for which roles when the film was greenlitdanzig was recommended for wolverine and instead they cast hugh jackman a man who in 2000 no one ever heard of time proved that to be a near perfect choice i mean 17 years on and hes still loyal to the roledanzig likely would have been flighty but at the time a comic book movie franchise was unheard of james bond got a movie franchise slashers got a franchise everything else at the most you could expect one maybe two sequelsbut then the sort of started it all didnt it sure blade came out in 98 but no one ever thought of blade as a franchise film the was really innovative in that way here they are still making the moviesmarkpaul gosselaar i remember was suggested for cyclopes and instead we got james marsden and again that was a good choice marsden looks like a prig and that is exactly what cyclopes should bea jerk with a false sense or moral superiorityagain it was a great casting call you disliked him from the start and he is the boss that knows how to get the job down and no one really likessave jean grey who again was an awesome choice of castinghalle berry as stormhmmm that one i question but the recommendations i remember reading cast an si swimsuit model and that i would question even moreits not that i dont think berry can act but storm is a kickbutt goddess and well in 2000 you didnt have the feeling that berry was tough enough as a result you only got that one shining moment of the character storm was supposed to be and that moment she delivered a line that was clearly josss contributionsinger did do a great job he has carved a name for himself in xhistorybut serious fan boys still wonder what could have been if they kept joss on or even if they only kept his scriptwolverine gets all the attention but the xwomen are arguably the most powerful women on any super hero team joss whedon knows how to write strong women he knows how to make them work he knows how to make them the tough hombres they are in the comicits evident by that one storm line that could only have been hisand there alone is the singular fault of the movie the women arent as powerful arent as tough as they are in the comic books the series was reliant on the men in it more than the women it was a disappointment but it workedian mckellen was cast as magnetogreat choice the comic reviews were recommending clint eastwood and well hes a far better director than he ever was an actor mckellen can act and he did a stellar jobso can stewart and even now bald head aside its hard to imagine anyone else as professor xthere were so many good choices so many turns it made that could have gone wrong that the few mistakes they made seem overshadowed by the great decisions of all involvedthere is a reason why really introduced us to the cinematic age of comic books,fantasy
the gulf that exists between this film and where superhero movies are now is so vast that feels quaint by comparison but theres something to be said for a plot that mostly keeps a strong focus on character and a compact running time the resources for largescale spectacle just wasnt there yet which may have benefited the end result in some aspects but it leaves you feeling like theres something missing there are some clunky action scenes which does add a bit to the oldfashioned charm but it does also make it feel quite datedi like more than most superhero stuff just by the nature of the world in which they occupy their problems and sufferings are easy to relate and the antagonists perspective is clear and understandable the conflicts are driven by character choices that remain consistent the varied abilities of the mutants has endless potential for the screen plus they really feel like a team where each character serves a useful purpose and is given real personalityim not always the biggest fan of where superhero movies have gone but this was clearly an important piece in getting the ball rolling its too bad that the genres progress has made this more of a historical artifact than an enjoyable movie,fantasy
the release of this first x movie marks the beginning of good superhero movies a decade and a half later superhero movies are some of the biggest of each year two of the biggest movies of the year so far have been from the franchise in deadpool and apocalypse the reason that i think accounts for the recent rise in success is the advancement of visual effects because the larger than life stunts that superheroes pull dont look laughably cheesy now that we have better visuals the visuals of this first installment are pretty pathetic in light of what we see nowadays you can all but see the ropes and such pulling the characters when they jump or get throw back or somethingwhat s really great about the series compared to other superhero stories is that they arent considered heroes theres always a huge social question in play about how mutants should be integrated into society with humans some people complain that this is too much of an allegory for how racial minorities and in particular homosexuals are treated but art is meant to comment on the problems of the time besides the mutant powers are more than just a social statement which is why all the mutations resemble superpowers like any ability the mutants powers can be used well abused taken advantage of suppressed and set off unexpectedly and uncontrollably this is what professor x is getting at by having a school for mutantsthe characters are written decently in this first movie but not as well as they are in the prequel movies of the 2010s most of them arent one dimensional but their personalities are caricatured as with logans irritability and professor xs generic mentor performance the main characters motives are simple but strong which makes for an easytofollow story but not the most interesting one the writing of the minor characters is easily one of the weakest aspects of the movie all of magnetos followers toad mystique sabertooth feel really cheesy from toads awful dialogue to the poor action sequences with sabertooth to mystiques eyes flashing green to alert us that shes impersonating someone the minor protagonists are a little better but bobby and storm definitely could have used some more personalityall of the actors give adequate performances but nothing beyond that the directing is fine except in the action sequences i dont know if the action was good for the time especially since ive grown up with great spfx all my life but i doubt it was great even in 2000 the score is very string and woodwind dominant with a flutey feeling to it much like john williams music is when he isnt using one of his main themesi wouldnt recommend this as a top pick for someone looking to get an action movie i doubt it will be many peoples favorite today especially in light of all the new x movies that have come out its good to see if you want to catch up before seeing the new ones and youll likely enjoy it beyond merely gaining a better understanding of the sequelsprequels so go in with low expectations and you might be surprised at how much you like it overall rating 710,fantasy
when batman and robin was released to widespread hatred from fans and critics alike it signalled the end of costumed heroes at the box office for at least a couple of years believing that audiences were tired of characters such as batman studios were wary of spending large amounts of money on bringing them to life in live action productions but in 2000 the usual suspects director bryan singer released a film that managed to ease the general public back into the world of superheroes the film was and with it singer had delivered the first entry of a franchise which would spawn 5 further films as well as 3 spinoffs not bad for a group of characters which had never before achieved the popularity of spiderman superman or batmanthe fact that singer was able to cast actors of such calibre and magnitude as the characters in no doubt contributed towards the films success with patrick stewart and ian mckellan portraying professor x and magneto respectively this was a superhero film that attempted to distance itself from the often campy adaptations that had previously graced the screen both of these classically trained shakespearean actors were perfect for the roles they were cast in and are perhaps the closest to their comic book counterparts with stewart in particular brilliantly displaying the poise and wisdom of professor x in every single scene elsewhere a slightly fresher faced hugh jackman proved to be a revelation as wolverine a mutant tortured by a past he cannot remember and the fact that he didnt quite resemble the character from the comic books in terms of his height proved not to be an issue whatsoeverin order to further distance itself from the colourful costumed heroes that had previously graced cinema screens singer opted not to have the don their classic blue and yellow spandex in favour of sleek black leather outfits while many fans have complained about this countless times over the years its a decision which works for the film singer was creating with the choosing not to draw attention to themselves due to humanitys hatred towards mutants another change singer made was excluding some of the founding members from the comic books including beast and angel this decision was likely made due to budget reasons with the characters mentioned above needing a large amount of prosthetics and cgi in order to work on the big screen it also allowed singer to present the mutants as people who are able to hide in plain sight with only toad and mystique who can take any appearance from magnetos brotherhood of evil mutants possessing any uncanny bodily featuresthe underlying themes that feature in are also a first for the superhero genre with the x men themselves being discriminated by the humans around them bryan singer has always been open about his sexuality and its easy to see that the persecution the mutants face within his film is supposed to mirror that which people within the homosexual community have been subjected to for years its because of themes such as this that transcends traditional superhero films and has an important message at its core its not what we are that defines us but who we are parallels can also be drawn with the civil rights movement that was prominent throughout america in the 1950s and 1960s with professor x existing as a peaceful martin luther king figure desperate for a unified world and magneto a much more extreme freedom fighter similar to malcolm x the fact that singer realised these themes within the source material and was brave enough to bring them to a wider audience amongst the action sequences is extremely impressive and the director deserves a lot of recognition for including them in what could have otherwise been a brainless summer blockbusterdespite a strong cast and important themes however there are problems to be found with particularly when concerning the films secondary characters cyclops has always been presented as a strong leader and a prominent figure in the comic books yet here he is second fiddle to wolverine and doesnt receive many scenes which showcase all of his characteristics similarly rogue is vastly different than her comic book counterpart the character being changed to a scared young runaway rather than a strong confident woman given the fact that singer wanted to represent people rarely seen in films with such a wide release its a shame to see a strong female character from the comic books wasted in her big screen debut elsewhere magnetos plot to turn the worlds leaders into mutants themselves comes across as a plan that would only be feasible in the comic books and seems out of place amongst the rest of the narrative singers vision successfully placed the in the real world in a way that zak snyder could only dream of doing with superman yet with a finale such as this it loses its credibility somewhat and the ending fails to live up to the rest of the filmregardless of this 16 years after its initial release is still a very important film in the history of superhero cinema and opened the door for costumed heroes at the box office following several well documented failures,fantasy
now whether you agree with me or not i could never really get into the first movie if you were to ask me the highlights of the first movie id say it established beloved characters impressively and had stellar acting throughout then all i could think about was the dull pacing of this movie a final confrontation that i found unimpressive and a pretty much absurd plan from the villain i understood the plan i just thought how convenient and nonchalant everything managed to come togetherthat said though the movie was more than impressive in other aspects i liked that it included its fear of mutants originally a stab at communism and it was extremely well casted patrick stewart  ian mckellen portray xavier  magneto to a tee hugh jackman as wolverine had slowly grown into the role for me as well as halle berry james marsden and rebecca romijn etc who all did a fantastic jobfinal verdict was this really a good movie i greatly respect bryan singers filmography and as i currently write there are a plethora of better movies to choose from 610 it was one of the first of its kind for the new millennium but its starting to show its age considerably,fantasy
 is one of marvels oldest superhero teams launched in the early 1960s a comic interpretation of a ethnic or racial group that is met with bigotry hatred and intolerance continued marvels tradition of featuring heroes that were decidedly more down to earth than their dc comics brethren it took years of development to bring the mutant superheroes to the big screen but it was finally tackled by director bryan singer who made a big splash with his sleeper cult hit the usual suspects as realized by singer and his screenwriter collaborators tom desanto and david hayter would bring comic book adaptations into a more realistic world than the ones that batman had played in in the 1990s and successfully launch marvel comics into a string of strong adaptations that continues to this dayin the universe the inhabit small numbers of humans have begun to show evolutionary mutations some of these mutations manifest themselves in the form of physical deformities such as different skin coloring scales or extreme sizes others appear normal but possess powers that make them superhuman such as extreme healing abilities control of temperature and the weather and walking through solid objects normal humans view the mutants with fear and trepidation shunning them and forcing mutants to live in hiding and with shame as opens we are shown a flashback scene in which young mutant eric lensherr aka magneto reveals his powers to control metal objects when he is separated from his parents at a german concentration camp during world war ii when he grows up his experience with intolerance at the hands of the germans has ingrained in him a strong distrust for human society in general when crusading senator kelley bruce davison decides to introduce the mutant registration act which would force all mutants to be identified by the government magneto played as an adult by ian mckellan has determined that no mutant will ever be marked as he was as a child and plans to fight backsimultaneously a young teenage girl marie aka rogue anna paquin has just discovered her power which is to take the life energy out of any person she touches this revelation comes to her when she first kisses her boyfriend leaving him in a coma fearful of her powers she runs away from home and in a small town in canada discovers a fellow mutant loner wolverine hugh jackman wolverine has advanced healing abilities and is also equipped with a skeleton covered in a material called adamantium a metal that is indestructible along with three sharp claws imbedded in his hands that he can unleash at a moments notice rogue and wolverine are attacked by mutants working for magneto and are saved by the the name of a team of elite mutants that have been trained to use their powers for good by professor charles xavier patrick stewart who founded a school for mutants in new york the key members of the are cyclops james marsters who can shoot energy beams from his eyes jean grey famke janssen who has telekinetic powers and storm halle berry who can control the weather professor xavier believes that magneto wants wolverine for some purpose so he is determined to hide him at all costs and prevent a plan magneto has to convert normal humans into mutants is very much an allegorical story depicting mans intolerance to that which he finds different this gives a dramatic strength many other comic book stories lack which are often a bit too wrapped up in their fantasy material singer and crew have made a good decision to ground in essentially the real world new york is new york there are the references to the holocaust which provides a good basis for magnetos hatred and the characters are smart enough to find the trappings of the comic book world they are in a bit ridiculous in one scene as the introduce themselves to wolverine with their code names he snickers and says this is the stupidest thing i have ever heardon the character front does suffer a bit from an overload of characters storm professor xavier and magnetos henchmen suffer from lack of development because there just isnt enough screen time for everybody on the flip side wolverine rogue and magneto are fleshed out to a decent degree allowing us to become familiar with them and involved in their story this imbalance of character development would haunt the future sequels as well was a film that had the potential to be a budget buster so some care was taken to not overload the film with visual effects and as a result looks a little low budget and underwhelming compared to its bigger budget successors the action sequences are kept to a minimum but the film is not completely lacking in its quota of fisticuffs the special effects are decent but noticeably restrained so as to keep the film in check in some ways this restraint is almost better as it allows to look to something other than eye candy to fill its running time leaving more room for the issues and characters would prove to be a popular comic book translation and marvel used it to launch itself into superstardom after that following up with spiderman two years later while it has some flaws is a good entry in the genre and one that set the tone for good adaptations to follow,fantasy
i read some of these post and thought that i had to write something cyclops is my favorite character in the comic and in the movie  he was stiff in the movie yes  why  because that is the way he is in the comic bookswolviren was not watered down because that is the way he is when he is with the  he always takes a likin to the younger personthere were ten characters  it is hard enough to come up with enough for each  they did a great jobthere really isnt a lot about cyclops to know other then he is stiff unless they wanted to tell about how he hit his head when he was yonger and that is why he has to wear a visor to keep from blasting everywherewolviern is only human partly because he doesnt always act like a ravge beast  he has a loving side to himrouge is not sassy  she wasnt when she first found out about her powers now she became that way and people who have read the comic books would know thatthis movie was a start and it was a very good start  it could have been better if they had the beast and gambit and pyro like they wanted but the money was not put up by fox  just like they wanted the danger room in there tooas for comparing it to the batman stuff you cannot  batman was one character it was easier to make it and make it where you understand him and where he is coming from  is based on many characters and therefore take longer to developed when they have to share the screen with others batman movies were good up to two  then they lost out  so i hope it never compares to batman since batman droped after the second one  if handled right will never dropthe in this movie stay with the charters that are true to the i am a big fan and i see it  there was not enough development but no one seems to understand how long the movie was and how many people were in the movie  you barely got to know magneto  they didnt tell you that he has two children and that a mob killed his wife  that his two children grow up to be against their father  one being on the advengers scarlet witch and one on one of the xteams quicksilver  they didnt tell you that profesor x has a step brother who is very strong and named the juggernaut  they didnt tell you that cyclops has a brother and they were split in the adoption process  that the person over the adoption place cyclops was at was owned by mr sinister his nemises in years to come  they didnt tell you that storm was a goddess and that she is claustrophobic  they didnt tell you that wolviren was an experiment and that sabertooth was a part of that experiment but when wolviren escaped he made sabertooth lose out on it they didnt tell you that mystique had a real child and his name was nightcrawler  that she has a best friend named destany  there is so much that could have been said to make you care for them but that is too much in the time that was allotedthis movie was as i said a great start  and batman it is not because they are the,fantasy

what a waste of a great comic book series  there hasnt been a great film made about a comic book superhero since chris reeves superman films these guys needed a better script and a better director  bryan singer doesnt know how to direct big budget action special effects pictures  the casting isnt the best and the plot is dull as can be  the dude who plays wolverine has some good one liners but thats about it  patrick stewart and ian m were good choice for their characters i have to admit  but this piece of crap film making still doesnt work  but if you are easily amused you will probably dig this,fantasy
 the movie manages to be an deep as the comic book which is quite a comment when one compares the comic book medium prior to stan lee and his mutants after a surprisingly effective scene when a young erik magnus is forcibly separated from his parents in nazi concentration camp unleashing his intense magnetic powers the action moves to the home of marie played by anna panquin  as a young teen with a love of travel she confides her dreams to her boyfriend who kisses her  instead of lovely moment maries boyfriend passes out and suffers a seizure  marie is one thousands who are mutants people born with unique genetic gifts that emerge in adolescencein washington dc senator edward kelly burce davidson advocates a law requiring mutants to register themselves  kelly in tense public meeting produces a list of known mutants and even enlists gun control supporters to outlaw mutant weapons in our schools  very few young people will appreciate kellys list and its subtle reference to mccarthyism  in the audience a much older erik ian mckellen leaves the auditorium as the throng applauds the senator  erik is then confronted by charles xavier patrick stewart who suspects that his old friend will take action against humankind spends nearly half the movie introducing us to the world of the and create the setting  the film also uses the beloved character wolverine hugh jackman to introduce us to the rest of cast  this makes the film slow moving for fans of the comic book who are already up to speed  soon the discover eriks aka magnetos plan to destroy a united nations conference and make the first strike in a new race war between humans and mutants director bryan singer manages to weave the vast backstory of the into the film without boring fans or overwhelming newcomers to the and the xavier school  singer manages to coax an exceptional performance from his players including ian mckellen with whom he worked with in apt pupilthe only people who may be disappointed with are the die hard comic book fans who cant appreciate singers handling of a complex and yes sometimes unfocused screenplay a exciting adaption of comic book without the comic book feel,fantasy
i thought this film was okthis was more chatpacked than actionpacked which i found very surprising for a movie of this genre the talking slowed it down considerably and i found myself becoming rather bored sitting through the film i chalk this down to expectations of nonstop diehard actioncharacterizations of wolverine and rogue were very good i liked wolverine and sabretooth they were played well especially sabretooth with his pointed fangs and roars too bad he doesnt have a lot to say anna paquins rogue was interesting it is nice to see her as a confused teenager before she became the rogue we know in the comicspatrick stewart played xavier well additions of other shadowcat iceman etc was smart i especially liked toad a mutant i dont recall having seen in the comics magneto should have been made more evilintroducing the x men this way obviously sets the sights for x men part ii iii etc so i shall be very curious as to how the sequels will be handledconclusion fans of x men comics will love this film roll on remy le beau gambit,fantasy
i needed something to take the foul taste that mission impossible ii left in my mouth and glory be to bryan singer for doing all that and morebeautifully crafted and shined ohsoclose to perfection this is surely as good as they get fans of the story will catch the odd inside joke here and there but with its great cg and intense but not overdone action sequences this a film for one and for allhowever where this movie really made my cup of tea was the interaction between the characters all are woven into the story so appropriately and so well that the director seems to rarely miss a hit with the audience with the emotion he seeks to drawthough this isnt possible without the talent to carry it off theres no evidence of miscasts here special mention to hugh jackman as logan making what may have just been a good show a great one along with none other than dunes gurney halleck star treks jean luc who else more appropriate to cast as the charismatic noble and fatherly charles francis xavier than patrick stewart a sin it would be not to mention the gorgeous icing upon the cake in the form of netherlandss famke janssen as dr jean grey combining a sense of professionalism and underlying vulnerability with those sultry eyes to ooze femininity over the screen angelina jolie has a lot of work to do in tomb raider to top this actthe only drawback of this film it makes you scream for more more particularly between the characters though sequels have tainted reputations of being unable to live up to their predecessors but in my mind bryan singer can do no wrong as i await the next chapter with baited breath,fantasy
not one of the best superhero films but a long way from one of the worst while with imperfections and better was to follow in the franchise is a good film and a solid start though with a yettoproperlyfinditsfeet feel is wellmade the special effects while not mindblowing are great the film was slickly shot and edited and the dark moody visual style worked wonders michael kamens music score had those grand mysterious rousing and haunting qualities that really add a lot to the films atmosphere apart from the odd cheesy moment the dialogue is smart and taut with some subtle humour that thankfully did not feel out of place and bryan singer shows that he does know how to direct an action sequence tell a good story and not let the special effects overwhelm everything a solid directing job indeed the story while simple compared to what was to follow in the succeeding films is compelling and doesnt try and take itself too seriously or like a joke the character exposition was nicely done on the whole and doesnt drag things down too much cyclops storm and toad are underdeveloped but wolverine and especially magnetowho actually has depth to him rather than being a clichd villain are interesting characters the relationships between the characters were also believable wolverine and rogues was a standout and the story didnt feel like it was second fiddle to the action sequences which werent big and bold as such but were tightly choreographed and performed with spirit and passion admittedly though the statue of liberty climax while strikingly filmed is on the silly side at times but it was fun too the cast are mostly very good apart from a stiff james marsdenhe and famke janssens chemistry was very bland a monotone tyler mane and halle berry and ray park also felt a bit bland hugh jackman however shows great charisma as the lead character wolverine and has a powerful screen presence rebecca romijinstamos is a sexy and icy mystique anna paquin did bring a feistiness to rogue and famke janssen is fine patrick stewart and ian mckellen promise much on paper and both of them deliver stewart brings a cool classy command to the screen as professor x but even better is mckellen who is certainly menacing but gives magneto a sympathetic edge to conclude a good film and a solid start to the franchise 710 bethany cox,fantasy
i am a huge fan of the especially the cartoon versions sorry comic book fans i can respect some of the changes made wolverines outfit xaviers chair the limp look of magneto but other changes are not acceptable i cant believe storm did not have any moments where she flew about fighting baddies storm walking to fight baddies is pretty lame i also wish the fought together as a team near the end in a climactic fashion maybe to take down sabertooth instead of wolverine alone then a mediocre teamwork scene the script acting and effects are decent but it never lives up to its inspiration in any sense i guess bryan singer director just doesnt think big enough for this franchise,fantasy
the had the potential to be a great film but it wasnt fox budgeted 75 mil for this film and singer was able to produce detailed sets hire decent actors and have great special effects in this movie for that money amountmy first grievence of this film is lack of plot the movie utimately spends more time introducing characters than advancing the plot i agree character introduction is important for the nonfans of the comics but singer should refer to other comictofilm movies like batman1989 for how to introduce a character and still have an abudence of plotthis leads to my second grievence the lack of quality even when a plot was present a few minor spoilers wolverine crashes through his car and immediately gets up and heals but later when he is hit by a log he is out cold for hours until he arrives back at the mansion since the focus of this movie is on wolverine he shouldnt have big plot discontinueties the protaganist of the story was magneto a good choice for a first movie but his method of evil was a doomsday device that would turn the worlds population to mutants wow that is hoaky if you want to use a doomsday device in your movie watch star wars and pay attention to the death star scenesmy final grievence comes from knowing a little about the comics some major spoilers why is wolverine getting beat up by sabertooth without putting up a fight rouge has had her story line completely changed why is jean grey so old you never get the sense of magnetos power and that he only spares the out of respect for xavier although mystic can fight she is generally outclassed by all of the and avoids physicall conflict with them she uses her cunning to foil the why is iceman one of the original members of the just a kid maybe this one is just me but wolverine seems calm and rational it doesnt feel like wolverine,fantasy
this was far busier than it needed to be stuffing in drama morality and comedy relief since neither of the former two motifs can be taken seriously we have to look at this as a comedythe way this is centered on jackman and way he is directed to play this puts me in mind of eastwood in coogans bluffthe attempt is to insert a smart aleck into a fish out of water situation and just let him crack wise at every opportunitythe problem is singer didnt understand coogans structurein addition to the defined jokester that movie had defined targets remember the ludicrous pigeon toed orange peel and both were at a distance from the audience this movie cant distinguish the targets from the audience the moral is we all have to get along with each others differences and the audience is expected to empathizethe morality play propped up by stewart and mckellan is a sortof mlk versus malcolm x philosophical debate its not offensive but it is unnecessary the whole point of it dissolves like the erstwhile senatorone item of interest is the cameras movement around jackman during the statue of liberty fight it rotates through 360 degrees in slow motion and only at the end of the shot do we find our perspective againif only there had been more of these film ideas and less comic book flatness and pennyante moralizing wed have had something to remember,fantasy
in the near future where children are being born with a special xfactor in their genes giving them special powers and making them mutants the seeds of a new holocaust are being sewn by senator robert kelly the situation brings fellow mutants and former friends erik lehnsherr aka magneto and professor charles xavier into opposition while xavier seeks to stop the hatred toward mutants peacefully magneto seeks to even things out with a machine that would speed up the mutation process in all humans making everyone equal to stop magneto xavier brings together a special group of mutants called to stop him  two mutants with dangerous powers logan and rogue arrive at xaviers retreat seeking refugethis is one of the few comic book adaptations that delivers fully  ignore the fact that this takes liberties with the comics by changing costumes and leaving out characters  the changed costumes are better  darker colours making it feel more realistic rather than bright spandex the missing characters maybe a disappointment but the film would have been too packed for any characters to come through  the basic story is exciting and allows plenty of room for great set pieces  the mood is perfect singer delivers a dark vision of the near futurethe script is pretty clever taking the uss natural reaction to mutants and putting it onscreen  this is a country that doesnt accept other nationalities readily of course some senator would try to make political points out of hatred  the fact that both magneto and xavier are both flipsides of the same coin trying to deal with the same problem makes it very clever  not merely a bad guy and a good guy setup  the action scenes are the best though and are very stylishly done by singer  its clear he likes his  characters and their powersthe cast are roundly excellent  stewart and mckellen add great class in the two fatherly roles and both give good performances  hugh jackman is the best of the rest it was here that his star started rising  in fairness it helps that he has the best character in the whole film in the dark mysterious wolverine  does anyone else think he looks like a young clint eastwood  paquin is good as are janssen and berry  the bad guys are ok in terms of looks but they dont really have any character  they are merely henchmen  given the screen presence of ray park when he did his recent heavily madeup bad guy his toad is a bit of a disappointmentoverall this dark comic book action movie is excellent for a blockbuster its main problem is that it is far too short and really leaves you wanting more  hopefully for 2 singer wont take the batman route and lighten the mood to make happy meal merchandising deals easier,fantasy
one nice thing about this is the casting of mckellan and stewart despite the latters adventures with the stupid startrek he is an intelligent actor as is mckellan they tower over the amateurs in this film as their characters should about bad acting can we be spared from ms berry in the futurethe photography is overloaded on face supercloseups and the tone is suitably dark none of the sets thrillwhats awkward about this attempt is how muddled all the conspiracies are thrown into the same blender are nazi mass murder nazi experimentation radioactive fallout mind control us wartime mutant experiments to come more explicitly when we find out about wolverine religious righteousness in the senate oneworld governments the hidden and the evil mutantswhoaresometimesmerelymistaken are there supposed to be bad guys whats the central struggle theres not enough intelligence here to put shades on the real driver its paranoia in the comix which are far more intelligent and nuanced than this film how can that bethe ultimate marvel film should come from dr strange give it to ridley scott to direct kenneth branagh as the doctor dark intelligent spooky kafkaesque,fantasy
this is a great action movie it has a great story line it also has great acting it also has great special effects 74 is a good ratting but this is such a good movie 74 is underrating it x men united is better x men last stand is better x men origins wolverine is also better x men first class is also better wolverine is also better x men day of further past is also better x men apocalypse is also better this is one of the best action movie from 2000 see it it is a great movie it is better then the dark knight ans that is not easy to do this movie is a must see i give it 9 74 is underrating it this a great movie,fantasy
 was not the first superhero film ever made of course but without doubt it was the most important of all even blade having released before it was that popularized and much the genre even more for their animations halle barry patrick stewart ian mckellen hugh jackman anna paquin james hughes ian mckellen ian mckellen ian mckellen ian mckellen marsden famke janssen and etc all are well on paper highlight patrick stewart ian mckellen and hugh jackman the direction is from bryan singer and he commands very well the effects are very good unfortunately the movie sins for example enjoy evil good characters such as cyclops which is very important in comics some dialogues are weak but its a good superhero movie note 74,fantasy
not only did bryan singers first film pave the way for following films to come in the franchise but it really set the way for the modern era of superhero films the very first film really told people that comic book films could mean something and that they werent just goofy films these films could relate to the real world and thats why it works so wellcowritten by bryan singer  tom desanto is the first time a superhero film truly played with real problems we face in society the film plays with the ideas of racism and discrimination throughout as soon as the films opens thats why the comics and the film works wonderfully the way that the people and mutants fight  in politics or in handtohand  is fueled with passion and true hatred for one anothershot with a knowledge of the comics and a true passion to make the film successful bryan singer directed this first film so well its quite mesmerizing how well singer shot this given it came nearly 17 years ago the sequence of logan waking up and exploring the mansion is done to perfection and the quick editing makes it to me a tense scene i also love just how small scale singer keeps the film it all takes place within a somewhat contained area and it really allows the films characters to hold it together and boy they sure doit seems like marvel as always been great with casting because x men has a pitch perfect cast patrick stewarts professor xavier is just pure brilliance ian mckellen as magneto is menacing and brilliant at the same time hugh jackman as wolverine is pure badass he resembles everything the character is and matched it to a tee the supporting cast of famke janssen james marsden halle berry and anna paquin make the film so much better their conversations really bring life into the film and their banter is hilariousanother key component to why singers first works so well is how well he treats both sides of the characters i feel the comparison between xavier and magneto and i feel for both sides and thats important because most films dont allow that to happen the technical aspects of the film are pretty 5050 in some parts of the film  wolverines claws storms powers the fighting between wolverine and mystique  the effects look really good for 2000 but some parts  wolverine flying out the car window  are pretty bad and some dialogue can be a tad cringy but works overallbryan singer should go down in history as a director who really allowed the superhero genre to take off to where it is now allowed itself to resonate with the audience on a realistic level and thats why its one of the best comic book films to date the direction from singer is beyond its time the effects while iffy sometimes bring in realism and the characters are so brilliant and truly make entertaining,fantasy
its hard to believe hugh jackman has been playing wolverine for 17 years now logan is just around the corner and its time to take a deeper look at all of the times jackman has graced the screen as the legendary comicbook character 2000 hasnt particularly aged as well visually as some other superhero films but the story is just as relevant as its always been its nice to go back and watch the beginning of it all again after two separate trilogies and a few spinoffs and just like in every other film it always comes down to charles and erik professor x and magneto have probably the most fascinatingly complicated relationship in comics charles wants everyone to get along and make peace with the humans while erik has always believed humans will inevitably turn on mutant kind what makes the dynamic so great is that neither are 100 right the only major problem with erik is that he usually involves killing even in 2017 we are having issues with accepting people who are different than us thats what sadly makes these films so relevant and timelesswith that said there are certain aspects of the film that are more than dated storms inconsistent accent is awkward at best and halle berry doesnt really add anything of value at least in this film sabretooth and toad are nothing more than pawns for magnetos use some could even say mystique is one as well but at least she has some cool action sequences mystique adds to the plot with the senator but i dont understand the reason for toad or sabretooth perhaps there just wasnt enough time to cover their motivations in a breezy 105 minute film on the good side of things anna paquin gives a strong turn as rogue famke janssen brings an appealing gracefulness to jean grey and jackman as wolverine may have been the most brilliant casting in any comicbook property the early films hold up because of the incredible characters and not necessarily because they have the most memorable stories or visual flareits always nice to see how far characters have come and see where it all started for the widely popular franchise this is where the countless continuity issues began when the team first suited up and where jackman first donned the claws it doesnt have the narrative scope or the dazzling visuals that the films do now but it will always hold a special place in my heart where it all beganstory is still relevantcharles vs erikdynamics between charactersbut really whats the point of sabretooth or toadberrys accent7810,fantasy
 may have come out fairly early in the recent superhero renaissance but it still holds up as one of the genres best blade was the first serious modern superhero film but was the one that made them popular for the first time since they stopped making superman films audiences got to see heroes using superpowers fighting others with superpowersthe film was also one of the first to deal with some deep themes it is in no way a simple good guy versus bad guy story that usually populates the genre magneto is every bit as developed interesting and sympathetic as the heroes possibly more so and singer is able to use his own experiences being a homosexual to enhance the mutant problems so that it becomes an excellent allegory for current events that still remains true to the vast comic book historythe story is presented as an origin story but its not like the numerous other origin stories like blade and tim burtons batman theyre already heroes and can start with the action right away the wolverinerogue relationship works wonderfully i dont quite know why they didnt just use jubilee as it is in the comics but rogue works just fine the loganjeanscott love triangle starts off great though i wish they went further with it in the sequels though the really terrific relationship is the xaviermagneto friendshipturnedrivalry which out shines everyone else it really added a whole other dimension to the movie that quite honestly no other superhero movie has been able to matchthe movie does have a bit too much exposition sure there is a lot needed to be explained but there are a few too many sections of the movie where its just long speeches by jean xavier etc there is plenty of action more than many other origin movies and they all work well that you can forgive the long expositionthe movie is nearly perfectly cast wolverine xavier magneto jean rogue and senator kelly are exactly like they are in the comics now i can hardly read the comics without thinking of their voices to match the dialogue mystique is good but she is better in the sequel i liked cyclops though he has progressively less to do in the sequels which is disappointing since he is such an interesting character storm is fine here but berrys subsequent rise to fame and insistence on more screen time drags down later movies i loved mane as sabretooth but the character is given so little to do and honestly he was portrayed more interestingly and faithfully in the wolverine moviethe movie isnt just a terrific superhero movie but a great movie in general singer really goes above in beyond in his two movie that its a real shame the next two had to be so overstuffed with characters that everyone became uninteresting theres a faithfulness and intelligence thats missing from too many other superheroes x2 united may do everything this movie did better but its still a wonderful movie that ill happily watch any time,fantasy
this film has everything you need to start off a movie series on the right foot the action is tremendous and the characters were great the casting choices were just so on par with james marsden as cyclops famke janssen as the sexy yet timid jean grey and oh my lord ian mckellen as magneto not enough for you the very awesome patrick stewart stars and halle berry who i usually find dismal was pretty decent in this movie hugh jackman looks pretty bad ass as wolverine and he can carry the role quite well tooi believe bryan singer did a really good job with this film and the score by the deceased michael kamen was simply riveting through outnuff said,fantasy
possible spoilers is one of those films where you wonder how anyone couldnt like it it is really one of my favourites the director bryan singer is perfect for the job he creates a darker version of the comics perfectly even though its pretty dark there are lots of great humorous moments my favourite line of the film is wolverine you actually go out in these things cyclops well what would you prefer yellow spandex anyone who is a fan of the comics would get the jokethe visual effects are awesome theyre even more awesome when you think about the budget of this film 75 million which is certainly a lot but in hollywood not so much thats also half the budget of origins wolverineveteran actors patrick stewart of star trek tng fame and ian mckellen of lord of the rings fame each deliver great roles while at that time newcomers hugh jackman halle berry famke janssen and james marsden each bring tons of charisma anna paquin who is the youngest oscar winner of all time isnt limited as rogue my final word is that this is a fast paced film that you can watch over and over without getting old1010,fantasy
 is one of the most beloved comicbook series of all time and the 2000 film directed by bryan singer really shortens the whole thing up but still gives us a really good kick ass filmthe cast in this film are great hugh jackman was born to play wolverine for he brings out the character so well almost making him real i also liked patrick stewart as jeanluc picard i mean charles xavier the fight scenes in this film are also something to talk about my favorite of the scenes was the end fight on the statue of liberty totally awesomei also enjoyed the character development in this film be sure to check out how wolverine became wolverine and see magneto being taken away during wwii in the end is a very exemplary film and is one of the best comicbook films of all time it is also the reason why we see good superhero films today do you think that superhero films would be so popular these days if this film was not in existence,fantasy
in the future a race of humanoids called mutants born with unique powers or looks when reached adulthood but the human race misunderstands them and mistreats them badly so a good and powerful mutant named professor charles xavier patrick stewart who has telepathictelekinetic abilities has formed a school for the gifted or mutants to control their powers and help mankind however there are some terrorist mutants who are hellbent on destroying the human race such as magneto ian mckellen who thinks mankind would never accept mutants as he leads some mutants to kill off humans a runaway mutant girl with the power to temporarily absorb peoples energies and mutantss powers named rogue anna paquin meets up with a canadian mutant named logan aka wolverine huge jackman who has an adamantium skeleton that is unbreakable and has powerful claws including the power to selfheal and senses like an animal of course they get attacked by a vicious mutant brute named sabretooth taylor mane but gets saved by three mutants named storm halle berry who has the power to control elements and weather cyclops james marsden who has lazer eyesight he can control and of course jean grey famnke janssen who has powers similar to professor x only not as strong rescue the two mutants and takes them both to the mansion of the professor the two new mutants join the secret team of mutant heroes called who are sworn to protect all humanity from the bad mutants as magneto with shapeshifting deadly beauty mystique rebecca romijinstamos sabretooth and toad ray park plans on mutating the entire human racean excellent adaptation of the ever popular marvel comic books created by jack kirby and stan lee from the 60s to now that made marvel comic book movies big again back in 2000 starting with 1998s excellent blade movie bryan singer of the usual suspects and apt pupil fame is a big fan of the comicsanimated series from the 90s as he wanted to bring the magic of the comics on the screen yet he succeeds he brings the huge metaphor on discrimination of a different minority group that was presented in the comics and show the film took years of development hell with richard donner originally gonna direct it but instead now serves as executive producer of the saga and was originally gonna be produced by james cameron and carolco pictures all had original rights before fox which i think is the right decision to have for a studio the acting is excellent including some of the action sequences and character development including an allegory of trying to accept a person who is different then usa must see scifi action movie with its even better sequel,fantasy
the popular comic is finally brought to life bryan singer brings us a very innovative film that is a fantastic way to start the series the main challenge here was getting the right actors to portray these unique characters we are not let down patrick stewart is professor x ian mckellen is magneto james marsden is cyclops along with halle berry and famke janssen the performances are top rate most definitely and hugh jackman is dope as loganwolverine i dont think anyone could play him the way hugh does the writing is very well done and grabs you from the beginning till the end a rare feat these days and while there are bits of comedy it does so while maintaining the dignity of the characters presentedthe action is well paced and incredibly well done the shots are simply magnificent the music is also very original and offers something new for the hero genre a nice touch rest in peace michael kamen and im glad to own the soundtrack in short this film is great but some criticize its shortness is its major problem luckily fox has released the extended cut 15 solving this dilemma as an intro piece to a much bigger universe it does fine,fantasy
 is set in the near future where evolution has gone haywire strange genetic mutations have begun to reveal themselves  normal people including politicians are scared of them their powers  what their existence means treated like freaks  outcasts mutants are shunned by normal society  senator kelly bruce davison is trying to get a law passed in which every mutant has to be registered  therefore controlled not everyone likes his idea  evil mutant magneto ian mckellen who can control metal objects with his powerful psychic abilities wants to wage a war against normal human beings as he believes mutants are the future however professor charles xavier patrick stewart runs a private school in new york for young mutants  also leads a team of mutants known as who use their unique abilities for good  are determined to stop magneto  his evil plans to wipe out the human racedirected by bryan singer this along with spiderman 2002 really kicked off the whole marvel comic book superhero trend that has continued with the likes of iron man 2008 the incredible hulk 2008 punisher war zone 2008 from the marvel stable  hancock 2008 hellboy ii the golden army 2008  of course the mega hit the dark knight 2008 this year alone to be honest i am not a huge fan of the comic book superhero genre  i personally just dont think characters designed to be drawn in 2d make the transition to live action film that well with the possible exception of the blade trilogy of films  the spiderman franchise i just cant get that excited by them here in the film concentrates on only some of the characters the actual comic books contained more  evil mutant bad guys for them to fight with the main focus of the story being wolverine who goes from shunned outcast into a superhero the script is alright but i really cant raise any more enthusiasm for it the plot about magneto bombarding politicians  world leaders with radiation to turn them into mutants is rather basic actually is more of a character driven film but as i said i just dont think characters like the translate to film that well there are obvious allegories  references to racism intolerance  acceptance too just to try  add some dramatic weight  give the audience a moral message to think about the mutants  their powers can often look silly some of the cgi computer effects dont do them any favours  its hard to relate to them in any way as people at only just over 100 odd minutes at least its a lot shorter than the average two hour plus superhero film it moves along at a decent pace  it tells a reasonable story but i must say i couldnt get into it i couldnt get into the world of the  what they were about  i did lose interest in the film  its plot quite quickly although i did manage to watch it all without becoming boredthe special effects are generally very good as one would expect theres plenty of cgi ranging from the impressive to the substandard playstation game graphics i was also a bit disappointed in the villains sabretooth doesnt do much mystique is very blue while toad just looks daft  if i was him i would be very upset if i saw the immense  useful power mutants like magneto  wolverine had  i had to be happy with pale green skin  a long tongue the final climatic battle is set on the statue of liberty  is quite good as are all the setpieces but i couldnt honestly say they were much better than quite good i only saw it last night  the only scenes i remember are the ones at the train station  the final fight apparently 20th century fox originally approached tim burton to direct by turned it down imagine how that tim burton style might have turned outwith a supposed budget of 75000000 was fairly low budget for a summer blockbuster which usually have 100000000 plus budgets although set entirely in the us the film was shot almost entirely in canada the acting is ok patrick stewart  sir ian mckellen add the distinguished weight while hollywood starts of the day halle berry  hugh jackman get plum roles as is a film that i cant say i loved  yet i cant say i hated i just found it watchable  not much else nothing more or nothing less there are worse films out there to be sure but if your not a comic book superhero fan than you can live without seeing followed by x2 2003  the last stand 2006 while two money grabbing spinoffs origins magneto 2009  origins wolverine 2009 are due out next year,fantasy
american dream can be defined as a social idea whereby one can attain a prosperous and material life through hard work and good ethics it works upon the basis that there are equal opportunities for all to pursue ones own dream without any restriction the american dream becomes an aspiration for many immigrants whose hopes were torn apart by wars injustice or inequality in their homelandsuperman lives like a model immigrant and encompasses most of the traits denoted by the american dream white american with a humble background working hard to integrate into the society his ability to fly is a metaphor of the american dream such that one can get what he wants and always reaching for greater heights superman shows us that it is possible to have all the freedom in the world to pursue ones dream but only within the boundaries of justice and righteousness his character is consistent outwardly as clarke kent the journalist as well as inwardly through his secret identity of a superhero he knows and lives out his mission all of us can contribute to our society through the utilization of our talents and skills in a positive and wholesome mannerwith we see the social phenomenon of teenagers who grow up in families who believe in the american dream as well as those egmagneto who embark on a journey to settle in the land of the free only to find that the dream is as misguided and distorted as it can be the power that these superheroes possess is a stark reflection of their inner insecurities fears and hopes we see a potentially talented bunch of heroes who are unclear of their mission and constantly fearing the unknown as opposed to what superman is furthermore as there are no equal and just methods in handling the issue of mutant discrimination the mutants existence comes under a threat that is driven by the fear of the mainstream humans these circumstances do not allow those who are different to pursue the american dream freelyin my opinion challenges the american dream such that not every american will equate a consumerdriven material life as the ultimate goal there are more important social issues such as discrimination and social inequality to be address to limit and standardize how one should live in the american dream simply neglect those who have a different purpose and calling in lives as there are no strict definition of truth justice and the american way the characters in have learn to redefine and live the american dream by their own terms in another way they learn from superman how to make judgment about what is right and wrong and eventually do what is right in their own justificationin conclusion not everyone needs to adhere to the american brand of freedom managed to raise the question if america is as just and free as it seems then why does one need to work hard to fit into the society why cant they gain acceptance based on who they are,fantasy
i just watched the first film again just felt like it and i have to say it far outweighs the other two the film has an enormous amount of exposition several key characters to introduce and this is expertly executed by bryan singer the characters are in no way unbelievable and from the opening scene which depicts a young magneto arriving at auschwitz in 1944 the film grounds itself in reality it is for this reason alone that i prefer the first of the trilogytoo much in cinema now we have directors and fans alike sharing the belief that for a sequel to exceed its predecessor it must be louder bigger and ultimately have more but so often this more amounts to a detrimental effect on the realism and impact of the original is this the reason why so few sequels exceed their prequel i believe so weve seen it in films like matrix revolutions the lost world jurassic park the disastrous terminator 3 rise of the machines and more recently the lord of the rings the two towersit could be argued that the lord of the rings the return of the king was superior to the two towers but neither one had the same impact on me as the fellowship of the ring this ultimately amounts to the fact that fellowship like the original film were films that were made with the intention to tell a story not with the intention to thrill an audience when a story is told well when invigorating and believable relatable characters are properly introduced its very difficult to fail it feels as if the first of these films has one singular voice that gets the message across whereas the others have several voices all shouting at the top of their lungs hoping to be heardessentially my hope is that one day filmmakers will realise that not everyone wants to see more explosions or have more meaningless characters paraded in front of them in order to appreciate a filmsimply tell the story well and the rest will fall into place after all it did in the first one,fantasy
see i like this thrilling and well done film but in no way will claim that this is a masterpiece or a serious social commentary the idea is clear and straightforward  there are mutants among us they are different they are the others people hate them are afraid of them and want to get rid of them right the film is about how unique and different we are all and that we all have to be tolerant and correct but the very meaning of tolerance was distorted and misused so much these days that it is almost a wrong and bad term now anyway the film is well made the video effects are impeccable and the characters of hugh jackman halle berry or ben kingsley are very good but still even with all this in mind i watched this film not as a any serious or deep attempt but only as a quick uptempo and highly entertaining fairy tale i am sorry if i hurt any of your feelings but this is what it is nice upbeat goodlooking work and that is all,fantasy
 was the first superheromovie that made me go nuts i mean characterswolverine xavier magneto mystique cyclops sometimes even storm sorry berryhaters were just right just right just as right as harrison ford as indythat said it doesnt take a lot more to love the film but the plot is quite ok and there are some truly innovative scenes xavier taking control of sabretooth wolverine at the start and at the end with mystique cyclops getting his glasses taken offgreat stuff great also plenty of those little things that show how seriously singer takes the original materialwhat this movie lacked was given to us by x2 this was mainly a buildup  movie and my god it worked well gotta love itsinger is my idol,fantasy
i dont know what i can say about i liked most of the performances and really enjoyed hugh jackman as wolverine there were a lot of exciting action sequences and the picture looked good visually but what lowered my expectations about it was the weak storyline involving magneto ian mckellen using rogueanna paquin and her mutant ability of absorptionhis plan was to let rogue absorb his magnetic powers in order to change many of the world leaders into mutants so then they wouldnt pass the mutant registration act this would then likely kill rogue which was one of the reasons why magneto wouldnt do it himself he did it earlier in the movie to someone and was nearly killed doing so i dont know how his magnetic powers with the help of the machine he built would be able to do this it was never really explained and the ending was over too abruptly i was expecting more an never got it still had some good moments though i just wish the story couldve been done better it was almost like it was just thrown together because the writers were running out of time or something the sequel was much better and even more entertaining,fantasy
the have one of the richer history in comic books when someone took the decision of made an saga they were playing with fire anyway this first installment in the series turned out great we have a rooster formed by some of the founding members in marvel universe continuity along with more modern characters this modern characters have appeared in the comics for more than 25 yearsthe decision of have superheroes without their individual uniforms could be controversial but the need of simplify the costumes is logical 10 superheroes and villains fighting each other all wearing different uniforms it would turn out been a big confusion for standard movie goers the uniforms of the cinematic version are adequate and eyecatchy of course there were more things changed magneto is not a charles atlas 60 years oldman because it is almost impossible to find someone that could fit that psych du rol ian mckellen as magneto wipe out the doubts using all his talent as actor patrick stewart is charles xavier the brotherhood magnetos team even seem to be fugitives from the panels of comics examples tyler mane as sabretooth rebecca romjin stamos as mystique and everyone else it is unfair dont speak about the rest of the cast because everyone has something interesting to offerthis heroes and villains are deeply motivated even bad guys have serious motivations that lead them to act on the edge one of the reasons that make the mutants so charismatic is that they are not adventurers they fight for their ideals for what they think could change the world for the better besides the moral side they choose the team behind the adaptation respected that aspect a quintessential aspect that made the succeed all these years the drama is unavoidable because we need to understand what make each stood for fight this time the center stage of the story is focused on wolverine and rogue two mutants that are not sure about which side choosevisually this is not a mix of cinema and videoclip like many others blockbusters it has many moments of drama and suspense in all the transcendental good films the star is the director bryan singer made a superb work presenting clearly difficult scenes an example would be how charles xavier uses his power against magneto and the brotherhood singer can be satisfied because he achieved the hard work of create something that stands strong in both the commercial and artistic fields,fantasy
 2000  hugh jackman patrick stewart ian mckellen famke janssen james marsden halle berry anna paquin tyler mane rebecca romijnstamos ray park bruce davison slickly produced silver screen adaptation of the cult marvel comic book series of reluctant mutant superheroes united to defend humanity from a rogue element of mutants from taking over the worldexcellent production values and crafty camerawork by newton thomas sigel are equally impressive with the state of the art special effects and a game ensemble particularly jackman in a starmaking role as the lone wolverine and paquin as his kindred spirit rogue the plot only suffers in its choppiness and constant explaining whos who and whats happening still not bad with some much welcome comic relief in the dialogue between rival good guys wolverine and cyclops marsden and hey who can bad mouth a film that features janssen and berry in skintight leather and a buck naked ok so shes blue and scaly romijnstamos dir bryan singer,fantasy
sigh  its at times like this after two years of writing reviews that i wish i could go back and rewrite some of the old reviews just to punch them up a bit  oh well how times changeamerican society loves comic books or graphic novels or even just the daily strips in the newspaper  we love the bizarre notions of reality that can be created with the pen and watercolors  heck just about every culture loves them  names like dark horse dc and marvel are thrown around to the cult following around themwith film we have a more fluid medium  ang lee had a chance with hulk since he already had made a visually sound film but that project had mixed results  tim burton had the visual look accomplished by the time he made batman returns but then let schumacher destroy the series  raimis spiderman lacked his usual visual flair probably brought on by studio executives who didnt want him to expand like in darkman  superman was pure donner but donners problem was that he didnt have a model to follow other than the prior cheesy series  stephen norrington is atrocious and guillermo del toro is questionable at the moment im waiting to see how hellboy comes out  i wont even mention the teenage mutant ninja turtles or men in blackdespite all these branches the genre really boils down to two camps  there is the lighthearted fare of spiderman and superman reliant on truth justice blah blah blah  then there are the pessimist dark films blade and spawn fall into the wannabe sections of this genre  batman returns marks the high low pointits as though the studios think they cant make a truly pessimistic graphic novel and be successful  so as in the case of the first movie here we get everything to us at 50 power  more emphasis is given towards what we know of film rather than the comic books themselves  how else do you explain thes costumes or professor x as a weaker dr trevesperhaps one reason why so many of these latest installments dont work is that they dont create the right environment  the batman movies though they boiled down to pure idiocy by the robin still created a world both detailed and ugly and reminded you that the world was real fake and not pure fake  thats another nail against these movieswhat do i consider to be the best comic book movies  mystery men darkman batman returns robocop and raiders of the lost ark  they annotate the genre except returns with their own stylessinger did better the second time  there he used the characters as themselves much like kerschner did with empirefinal analysis   cinematic dud,fantasy
i wont waste time on this movie review i just found that i did not care about any of the characters in the filmwhen the pyro character decided to not sit at the kids table that was the point i felt it was just too much too many heros and if you do not follow them you have no idea what each can do and whyit started off badly for me when another immature person thought it was ok to in danger people to make a political statement it went down hill from therei am not fond of characters that have what appears to be no limits to what they can do it was in a word childish,fantasy
i have a friend that critics a lot of movies saying that it doesnt happen much but i did never really have that felling about a movie until now to begin im not really a fan sure i saw a couple of times the cartoon but never red the comics or played the games i red from a couple of comments that a big problem of are the characters in first place there a lot of them and second they have complicated backstorys because of that the weak plot spends a lot of his time introducing us to them but at the end we dont really know much of them they just remain one dimensionalthe acting is very good stuart mckellen and jackman are great the rest of the cast was good and credible some people criticised halle berry but that is stupid i mean she had only a couple of lines and her character was bad written so she did her best but i must admit the line do you know what happens to a toad when its struck by lightning the same thing that happens to everything else  what is thatto sum up is not a bad movie its very complicated to bring mutants on a realistic way on big screen and it did if you ignore the weak plot you have good entertainment,fantasy
i discussed this film with a very good friend of mine  he loved it i hated it  he has told me that i must write a review for this film and find something good to say about itso here goes  hugh jackman ,fantasy
first off patrick stuart acquits himself well andthough his costume design lacks the menace of his comic book counterpartian mcallen is a good villain the rest of the actors are suitable the story begins well untill you realize the exposition will go on for quite awhile and your feet start doing the double cross shuffle the first scene is a prime example of how a backstory should be handled concise dynamic it sets up magnetos internal conflict skillfully sadly given the conflicting writing styles of the scripts many collaborators the opening is in a much better class than the remainder of the feature whoever wrote it  should have been allowed to do all of it but the rest is leaden stuff they wouldnt play on lifetime its a waste of one of comicdoms richest mines  this problem could have been solved by going back to very beginning of the comic when the only members were cyclops angel beast iceman portrayed as an apprentice here and marvel girljean grey this not only eliminates the amount of origin stories but also allows for better character developmenta wasted halle berry as storm for instance serves no purpose other than as convenient vehicle for cool lightning effects this in addition to allowing for a greater number of sequels to play out over the next decade only professor x wolverine and magneto are done any justice rouge whos strength and infectious sense of humor are absent is portrayed even more poorly than storm the movie also lets you down in the critical action department the trailers promised an adrenaline rush on par with the matrix a kick in the pants the most fun you could have legally well it turned out to be no more than a cock tease  to borrow a crude but apt expression the film boasts only one one truly kick ass fight between wolverine and mystique if the story was well written this would have been excusable but it aint i hate to keep hammering a movie i wanted to like so much but the costume designers made a grave misstep as well in sapping the flare out of thess famous costumes since most of the characters were  written as mentioned only their ethnicities and gimmick of course distinguish them by the end in which they all don identical leather uniforms not that such a monotonous color scheme would have worked anyway but this just made everything worse on the plus side the film also has one genuinely funny exchange between rivals cyclops and wolverinechow do i know youre the real wolverine wyoure a dick c okay and treats the material with a degree of seriousness not seen since the tim burtons batman movies for all of its manifold failings the movie remains a hopeful sign of better things to come,fantasy
this movie sucksthe film is barely faithful to the comicshorrible character developmentand when it comes to the story well lets just say that the markers of this movie didnt care a bit about the story and cared more about the action sequences then the actual story,fantasy
how can the same man who directed the taut and surprising the usual suspects have been involved in a film this banal is a plodding pointless unexciting and wasteful film wasteful because the excellent cast is given absolutely nothing to do plodding and pointless because well it is every scene is a few seconds too long every plot point telegraphed a few minutes in advance there is simply nothing fresh in nothing to distinguish it from any bgrade action movie except for the special effects and the film leans on so heavily on effects that i dont doubt that the plot was an afterthoughti was never a reader of the comic book series so i cant compare it to that but i can recall around 1988 when terry gilliam was attached to this film and my comicreading friends were beside themselves in anticipation of how gilliams visual sense would bring the world of the to the screen well 12 years later this is the flat unimaginative film we got instead,fantasy
 has some decent special effects and directing but it is wasted due to a lack of a progressive plot  movie goers want to see a movie that moves along in thes case the movie moves at a snails pace and the only character the audience genuinely cares about is wolverine  they should call this movie wolverine and friendsthey should have kept this one in comic book format  lets hope 2 has a more exciting and explosive plot  isnt that what comic books are for,fantasy
i thought this film couldve been a little more developed even for a assumed prequel considering the circumstances of it being a movie based on one of the best comic books ever  still there are many things to like in this film  the action the characters the visual and special fx and someother things  it is a must see but fans of the comic book might be a little confused of the characters being kinda young rogue in this film is a teen and in the comic book series she is an adult and being underdeveloped note look for ray park darth maul as toad  a,fantasy
probably the best bigscreen movie from a marvel comic although thats not saying much  its basically wolverines movie all the way and newcomer hugh jackman was excellent in the role  also patrick stewart and ian mckellan as dr x and magneto were great too  as for everybody elsehalle berry is all wrong as storm not exotic enough james marsden is a good actor but hes totally miscast as cyclops famke janssen sp is given nothing to do as jean gray and anna paquin is too whiny as rogue  the villains dont fare much better  sabretooth is laughable toad is too powerfulthe others i cant even remembermystique did make an impression though  so all in all its passable summer entertainment hopefully the sequel will be better,fantasy
bryan singer shows with this movie that he feels a little embarrased that he has to direct a comic book movieas a result he has made completely different than the original material of the comic bookfirst of all the casting is almost all wrongian mc kellen as magnetto is one of the worst choices that could be madei respect ian mc kelln cause he is truely a great actor but that role simply didnt fit himmagneto is a powerfull and menacing force and that feeling we never get in this movienot onceall the actors who play the are inadequate and are a disgrace to the original material with one exceptionpatrick steward was born to play professor xthe movie feels slow and boringthe action sequences are sparce and boringthe effort to make an antiracist message out of this movie is blown out of proportion and feels quite cheesyi have to dissagree with the woodspider man has finally done it right as far as comic origin movies gosam reimi wasnt afraid to make a movie first for the fans of the comic and then for the casual movie audiances unlike bryan singer who did the exact oppositei am really happy that spider man is going to crush at the box officeits not that is a bad movieits actually a descent onethat bothers meits the fact that the director had the most spectacular comic book heroes in his hands and made such a boring and unexciting film out of themdescent film but much much worse than spider man and batman 12,fantasy
passable but not great adaptation of the popular comic series once the decision was made to adapt this story from comic to live action rather than opt for the obvious path of creating an anime version the question had to be asked what is the live version trying to achieve that an anime cant it wouldnt be the special effects  cgi is so good by now that live action and anime can produce similar end results only the palette and textures are different the answer must lie in the acting in the ability of human beings to provide emotional depth and subtlety that animation and voices cannot doesnt quite make it in this regard which is a pity given some of the names on the cast sheetin fact some things such as action and fight sequences in this genre are still best done by anime a number of such sequences in this film look like manga frames brought to life its impressive but ultimately weird the fight scenes are cranked up to such a bizarre level with odd camera angles and exaggerated violence that they look frankly unbelieveable particularly when noone actually appears to die in this film if they lose a fight they just get belted for miles out of the frame and disappear if the camera happens upon them sprawled on the deck they get up and wade back into the brawl if it doesnt they seem to just quietly disappear from the film oddian mckellen and patrick stewart have both done better work than their roles as the two mutant leaders doing their own version of the war of the roses check the actors birthplaces and your english history much was made in australia of nice guy hugh jackman landing the plum role of wolverine apart from a simplistic study of macho posturing he brings little to his role it must be said my favourite from this film is anna paquin all grown up and looking just a bit like claire danes which is no bad thing we first see her upstairs in her suburban whitebread house her moms piano tinkling downstairs a nice touch and this films single delightful moment anna gives a brave and layered performance in what is admittedly the most interesting role of rogue the mutant with the poison touch a few more performances like annas and this could have been a great filmto summarise the film does enough to pique the interest of those unfamiliar with the corresponding comic series to give it a look but only just i cannot speak for existing fans of the comics,fantasy
after much hype i finally got around to seeing  some of the effects and set peices were alright but i somehow was left wanting more at the endthis movie appeared to be a starting point of a possible franchise as the characters were introduced to the viewers without any real story to themi was left wondering what mightve been hopefully a sequel will be more than this brief exercise610,fantasy
wooooh this had to be it the first cartoonbook that was done properly with lots of astonishing action and a good story was it the expectations were high because of the reviews but the movie was not so intelligent or action packed as they told us lots of movies get bad really bad reviews but this one got very good ones are they mad it was an immense disappointment and an uninteresting silly movie to watch,fantasy
since i grew up with the cartoon i expected this movie to be close to the same quality  granted some things in cartoons just arent possible in real life i still found this movie inadequate in comparison with the comics and cartoon show,fantasy
the first of the movies tells the story of how they all met under charles xavier to fught the evil mutants who follow magnetothe movie is okay it is not a masterpiece but a fun entertaining superhero flick the cgi is of course a little bad because of the time the movie was made but in my opinion that could have been handled a little better maybe the rating is 6 however that is because it didnt bring me any value whatsoever besides pure superhero entertainment,fantasy
i had seen many years ago and thought it was meh i recently rewatched it with my kids because i thought they might like the series and liked it more than i did the first time it feels much less bloated and selfimportant than so many other superhero movies i also just think its cool that each person has hisher own unique abilities especially when they work together to stop bad guys heroes like batman and iron man as far as i can tell are only good at beating people up and wouldnt be much if it werent for all their gadgets and costumes but all of the actually have actual powers that set them apartand good grief i think hugh jackman is sort of silly most of the time but can i please look like him as i get older dude is rippedgrade b,fantasy
the original date to 1960s american comic books and were created by the recently deceased stan lee along with jack kirby the lineup here is somewhat different but will be more familiar to the younger generation who will probably miss the joke about yellow spandexas usual with films of this nature the plot is both predictable and fairly irrelevant a supervillain and his henchmen are hellbent on either world domination or destruction on a massive scale and the good guys are here to see this doesnt happenwith this film also it is probably best not to read too much into the origins of the characters and any political allusions ie about people being alienated hated or even murdered because they look different or are differentwhere scores is of course with special effects and it does so grandiosly unless of course they really did destroy the statue of liberty in the climatic finale,fantasy
note i may not rewatch when i go through the series in the futuregood movie great origin story some outdated cgi but they use it sparingly a few other small outdated things but still enjoyablevery creative in how the use their powers in different situations very creative in so many other ways like magnetos prison there are a few small things you could pick on but i think this is a good standalone superhero movie about 8 viewings,fantasy
 is a great start to the franchise the action is great and the cg is really good brian singers direction is great hugh jackman patrick stewart and ian mckellen are perfect and the rest of the cast give really good performances however its brought down slightly by some bad dialogue in the third act,fantasy
an absorbing action film faithful to the original marvel comics wolverine is made the feature character but all the other characters get good exposition it has a tight narrative but the story is quite straightforward given the interesting themes at work there isnt a great deal under the hood a lot of the appeal is surface with good use of special effects and a good ensemble of acting talent,fantasy
do you know what happens to a toad when its struck by lightning the same thing that happens to everything else iconic simply groundbreaking one could say it kicked up a storm im here all day honestly the 90s were not particularly kind to the superhero genre so naturally many watched the start to this franchise with trepidation fortunately this was the seed for the superhero supernova that followed and its pretty good dated and slightly unfocused but enjoyable nonetheless mutants are in hiding from the rest of humanity where a school of mutants must stop a maniacal mutant from turning the rest of humanity into mutants its all very mutant theres plenty of imaginative powers that are replicated from its source material storm can manipulate the weather cyclops harnesses a powerful laser beam and wolverine has a skeleton made from an invulnerable metal oh and toad with his long tongue useless in combat but im sure that comes in handy in other departments bowchikawowwow it makes for some exciting spectacles particularly the third act that adds variety to the action however its the social commentary that powers the narrative humans debating to give equal rights to mutants can be metaphorically transferred to modern society especially in racial context its a shame that this theme is underdeveloped and put aside for the action but there is an underlying sense of justification for both sides of the argument the acting is decent particularly jackman with his brutal physicality my god and mckellen with his epic voice although paquin was considerably weaker in comparison shes unable to express her emotions well as she whimpers everything but ehh she was young i guess theres so much information to take in as the script builds a world filled with turmoil and superpowers that assimilating everything is quite an achievement its a building block for the sequel but this first instalment is entertaining enough to bypass the dated flaws,fantasy
featuring a studded star cast is effectively paced with a good balance of exposition character development and special effectsenhanced action neither the plot nor the character relationships are difficult to follow and the movie avoids the trap of spending too much time explaining things that dont need to be explained fandom is likely to be divided over whether the picture is a success or a failure many comic book lovers will be pleased to see the heroes brought mostly intact to the screen by a group of filmmakers who are concerned about maintaining the characters identities and dignity others will grouse about missed opportunities and will cringe at even the most minor missteps but with a project like this theres no pleasing everyone,fantasy
now i know its quite an unpopular opinion for someone to think that the first installment in the franchise isnt that great but i dont feel much for this film its short but feels long its dated but feels modern and its poorly written but strongly structured what is this film this movie is so out of the map but its just another film starring hugh jackman thats just adequate what is this strange patternwhats the story they are children of the atom homo superior the next link in the chain of evolution each was born with a unique genetic mutation which at puberty manifested itself in extraordinary powers in a world filled with hate and prejudice they are feared by those who cannot accept their differences led by xavier the fight to protect a world that fears them they are locked in a battle with former colleague and friend magneto who believes humans and mutants should never coexistokay lets start this review with a good aspect the special effects although the opening credits look really dated and cheap the rest of the effects are surprisingly really good especially for its time this was back in 2000 where cgi was in its early stage and still developing but for early cgi this is very nice to look at it also makes the action scenes look very exciting and amps up the fun aspect of the film the story itself is pretty bland like an avengersbeforeavengers story but as far as those stories go despite being pretty short this makes a pretty decent crossover film not that its the best or anything but it does give us enough background knowledge on all the characters before pursuing into the climax of the film as for the acting the only performance that legitimately stood out for me was hugh jackman as the wolverine and even he could sound pretty bland sometimes this isnt really a movie known for its good acting or anything but more to admire the technical aspectin conclusion is a nice kickoff to the franchise but as a standalone film its okay the action and effects are good but the acting excluding hugh jackman and the writing can be done a bit better if you like maybe youll like this even though i dont make any promises overall it didnt quite mutate perfectly but at the very least its fine,fantasy
x men is kind off with some scary scenes like when wolverine by accidentally stabs rogue thats mostly the scariest part in the movie thats how i think this is scary but mild horror,fantasy
 is a little slow to start but it soon gains momentum and pulls together a wellmade superhero movie this film paved the way for marvels meteoric rise in hollywood it stays true to the characters and doesnt try anything too crazy with the storyline its a straightforward origin story with excellent visual effects and a good ensemble cast hugh jackman i apologize for doubting you could be wolverine,fantasy
this movie is about a young girl by the name of rouge who first discovers her powers after taking a dose of her boyfriends energy she is then taken to some fight club where she meets logan and then later on professor x recutes her as an memberthis is a very good movie as it was the beginning of hugh jackman and patrick stuarts careers as logan and charles xavierthe acting was good and so was the camera angles and movementsif you like the comics then you will enjoy this movie,fantasy
i hadnt really paid much attention to the franchise in my younger years i did not watch much of the animated series and did not pay much attention to the comic books then this movie showed up and i decided to watch it a small sampling of the characters that dominate the mutant world of marvel comics but it was decent for the time and i had not watched any bryan singer films until still after hearing that x2 was coming in 2003 i knew i had to do a little backtracking and thought this was decent it was good for a start some big names and it was the first time i became aware of australian actor hugh jackman who played wolverine this might also have been the first time i enjoyed watching sir ian mckellen also responsible for gandalf from lord of the rings and the hobbit but hey if youre new to and dont know where to start give this a go then go read the comic books if you want more and if youre interested try the others the movies i meant,fantasy
what bad can i say about the film that kicked off modern superhero films in general other than its extremely dated the visuals are very old the dialogue is awkward and the costumes while cool couldve been more comic inspired especially after seeing what we have now other than this the performances are fantastic hugh jackman patrick stewart famke jansen james marsden halle berry anna paquin and ian mckellen clearly did their research and deliver only the best portrayals of their superherovillain counterparts the action is also really cool and just seeing these characters on screen for the first time is pretty amazing while it doesnt stand the test of time well still deserves some love for launching what we have now and giving us a fun ride that would later be surpassed by its predecessors,fantasy
 is packed with a talented cast of actors from hugh jackman anna paquin halle berry patrick stewart and ian mckellen adapted from the popular marvel comic and directed by bryan singer the usual suspects its full of themes like tolerance and prejudice which are conveyed very well in the film the stigma these mutants face in their daily lives are very similar to our own and we can all connect with them to some extent which is the real driving force behind the film although it has some visually awesome action scenes there is a lot more to it than that there are some great story arcs focusing on the vulnerable sides of these characters rather than just their superhuman abilities its also great how it deals with the political side of things mutants can indeed be very dangerous which the politicians are quick to judge by labelling them as weapons deep down they are just like everyone else  they want to fit in with society and abide by their laws ian mckellen and patrick stewart are really good in their roles they really play off of each other here magneto mckellen can control all forms of metal he is an interesting villain as he is more of an activist who fights for mutant rights though his methods can be extreme he is just doing what he feels is fair and its easy to empathise with him as he is older and been through some bad things in his lifetime charles xavier stewart can read peoples minds while also manipulating them he has also seen his fair share over the years but he still chooses to do good by giving mutants a place to live he is all for mutants and humans living amongst each other but magneto sees mutants as the next stage in evolution wolverine was born in the 1880s he has retractable claws and can heal at rapid rates played by hugh jackman he is a lost man who makes a living as a cage fighter until hes pushed away once more he meets a girl called rogue who can cause harm to whoever she touches they are both welcomed to xaviers school for the gifted discovering that they are not alone there are a few nitpicks to mention that wont sit well with everyone  the ending gets a little silly as it has a lame fight scene complete with and a cheesy one liner from halle berrys character do you know what happens to a toad when its struck by lightning the same thing that happens to everything else and some of the makeup effects look dated but forget about all that because its full of interesting characters a great storyline a nice music score and some brilliant special effects is a film you can sit through again and again,fantasy
before the i cant recall any superhero movies that had garnered a large cult following from start to finish we were introduced to a number of heroes from wolverine to cyclops to mystique to rogue it has enough dialogue and scenes to let us know who these heroes and what their powers are without any direct lines and a playful amount of banter between all the characters for the first movie in this series of superhero movies it did a really good job,fantasy
what was supposed to be the love story behind this it was like a love triangle  not that it was a romance story buti didnt understand who liked whobut that doesnt matter it was a pretty decent movie overall besidestheir making a new one in 2019 along with the other great stuff coming out that yearso i guess i could fastforward 20 years worth of because why the hell not,fantasy
hugh is a stud dont know why he asked the rock to get fit he was fit in this movie i get why famke n james are in it  disturbing behavior,fantasy
this is a decent movie there are a few too many errors for me to fully enjoy it without yelling at the screen but overall i enjoyed it the characters are interesting its shot well the plot is coherent and fun not the greatest movie but entertaining,fantasy
i didnt know what to expect from this film i was never sure if i liked it or not it just seemed like it couldve flowed better  other comic book movies like first 3 superman movies and the first 2 batman films blow out of the water but isnt all that badit has several good parts,fantasy
spoilersthis moviemakes me glad the are a thing this is an awesome movie and bryan singer earned my respect when wolverine and rouge are recruited by the professor x cyclops jean grey and storm they fight against magneto and his brotherhood of mutants to prevent him from turning the world leaders into mutants only after mutantfearing senator kelly was killed because his cells were fighting against the artificial mutation process im glad bryan singer had these characters portrayed seriously and by some big name actors to do so i love the way he makes these characters relatable however i thank the good lord the sequel was even better,fantasy
there have been some attempts to adapt comic characters to the big screen the most successful adaptations so far were certainly blade the vampire hunter 1998 and blade ii 2000 subsequently the first adaptation of along with spiderman 2002 led marvel to transform his studio marvel films in a specific producer to adapt their characters with distribution of paramount pictures with the granting of the film rights of the purchased by 20th century fox in 1994 scripts and treatment of the film were ordered until finally bryan singer  suspense acclaimed the usual suspects 1995  signed to direct in 1996 was released to positive reviews and was a financial success starting the trilogy and beginning a resurgence of superhero films is a film that despite all the success made at the box office worldwide divides opinions bryan singer is an uneven film but it fully works as a starting franchise the script written by david hayter is extremely didactic since the first line of text when explaining about genetics and mutation evolution even when professor xavier explains to logan and the public which is charles xavier school for young gifted which serves as a front for these young people learn more about themselves and about their newfound powers moreover the characters are constructed of onedimensional without further development all personalities and special powers of each of the characters were very explicit but it is very little explained in the past of the characters except with the vampira character we get the impression that the film is short takes just over 90 minutes nothing is satisfactorily developed and the first hour of life is uneventful except for a few moments it is clear that lacked at least thirty minutes dedicated to a better development of these characters and to increase the action scenesone aspect in which singer was largely responsible was to give the right tone in addressing these characters to the movies the director tried a story of a superhero group a science fiction and fantasy film more seriously and merging and political aspects of our contemporary society in this context special newly discovered superpowered beings it is precisely this relationship scenes of our society in direct conflict with a new variation of the human race and all moral and philosophical conflicts is this discovery that guide the whole narrative structure of production the trial of the by the worlds leading authorities and that decision can affect the mutants and magneto plan that considers humans as a lower stage in the evolution line is a well explored conflict synger hit the tone of the story giving a science fiction air and focusing on marginalization of mutant minority creating an interesting parallel with the struggle of real minorities such as homosexuals for example and the peaceful and respectful coexistence between different religions political positions etc bringing an appeal for the production that made possible the identification of the work with your audience perhaps for being openly gay and jewish the director singer brought in his heroes the bitter hatred for being excluded from societythe fans were not disappointed as the relevant visual effects with the manipulation of particles such as fire ice lightning wind and others i emphasize here the battle in the train station the individual struggles of mystique against wolverine and storm against grocho and the final scene of the statue of liberty allied to photography newton thomas sigel costume louise mingenbach john myhre production designer are in perfect harmony in the allstar cast famke janssen jean grey james marsden cyclops halle berry storm are great supporting cast already patrick stewart and ian mckellen veterans are sovereign in opposition as the leaders of both sides of the mutants and the highlights are even anna paquin rogue and hugh jackman the embodiment of wolverine delivering a visceral performance animalistic and at the same time human besides the similarity with the original mutant design jackman exudes an undeniable charismawhat is missing in this production is a grandeur it deserved either for lack of a larger budget either for lack of boldness of the writer and director the great action scenes only occur even in the final half hour of production missed scenes that leave the affected public compared to current superhero film disappointed by its weak and lacking action sequences of emotion moreover it is clear the aging effects and the soundtrack of michael kamen is disappointing not far heard a marked trail differentiated and personalityeven just using the concepts of comics and the essence of the characters the production is not very faithful in many ways after all the true original members of the team have only cyclops and jean grey the uniforms were all replaced by black clothes that look military uniforms  etc this was certainly a worthy introduction to the characters in this new media and made room for a new niche in hollywood from there the productions coming from hqs dominated movie screens and became the highest grossing in history,fantasy
this is a very good movie based on the comics sir ian mckellen does an excellent performance as magneto and patrick stewart also makes a great performance of professor charles xavier hugh jackman does his best as wolverine and hes my favorite member i sometimes wish though that i had magnetos powers so that i can lift cars during traffic rush hours lol we see great action in this especially when storm is fighting sabretooth and toad cyclops is cool too also it was a very good idea at the end to have magneto in a prison made of plastic since lifting plastic is not part of magnetos abilities a good beginning to the movie franchise here,fantasy
in the world where you have a super hero movie every year or sometimes even up to 4 deadpool batman v superman captain america and x men apocalypse is an instant scifi classic combining impressive special effects with an involving plot to create a truly memorable cinematic experiencelacking the tongueincheek camp of the later batman films and other recent comic booksturned movies draws the audience into its world of mutants and superpowers and prevents it from becoming tacky or absurd not to say that there isnt any humor in the film in fact it delivers some of the best one liners in a film this yearit is a rare thing for an action blockbuster to feature great acting but with a cast that among others involves both patrick stewart and ian mckellen is bound to be above average both stewart as professor charles xavier and mckellen as magnetodeliver stellar performances and their on screen chemistry is compelling as they play two old friends turned arch enemiesthe rest of the cast deliver solid performances including hollywood newcomer hugh jackman as wolverine oscarwinner anna paquin as rogue and another rising star rebecca romijnstamos as the seductive but deadly mystiquea classic tale of good versus evil with heroes baddies and great special effects i dont think its going too far to say that is destined to be mentioned in the same breath as star wars and other alltime scifi greats,fantasy
 is directed by bryan singer and is the origin story of the x men a team of mutants that turn superheroes in order to stop a mutant named magneto that is preparing and attempting to start a full on war between mutants and humans when magneto and a few other mutants threaten civil society as we know it the must put aside their differences and fight to stop an all out war between the two classes of people mutant and human is the first successful marvel film and its easy to see why although marvel films have been better in a way paved the way for every other marvel movie to come from spiderman 2002 to guardians of the galaxy 2014 with likable characters great direction and fantastic special effects is a very enjoyable film in whole and works in every genre of film it was going for be it action superhero and even a scifi offers some amazingly relatable characters that the audience immediately feels for in each and every situation although this was my favorite feature of the film i feel this is where its biggest weakness lies as well although characters like wolverine professor x rogue and magneto are very wellrounded most of the others arent we get to know a little bit about jean grey cyclops and storm but not too much all in all we know that jean grey hopes to be much like professor x when older but thats about it we also know that there is conflict between cyclops and wolverine due to their mutual affection for jean grey but nothing else about their charactersthe characters of mystique sabretooth and toad who are the mutants working with magneto arent given much depth to either although its cool to see mystique transform into other people but we arent given much if any information about her character on a personal level sabretooth and toad are both characters that have special powers but no personalities they both feel as if they are basically the grunts of magnetos team and dont really serve that large of a purpose in the moviethe direction by bryan singer is actually quite amazing every action scene as well as exposition scene is so nicely filmed in every way all of the action looks very nice with no quick cuts or shaky cam to be found bryan singer did an excellent job with the camera and made look very good the special effects are probably the best thing i could say about the cgi throughout the entire movie is revolutionary from mystique shapeshifting to wolverines metal claws coming straight out of his knuckles theres not a single shot in which the audience might call out fake due to the amazingly impressive special effects littered all throughoutthe acting is also very impressive hugh jackman as wolverine as we all know is a perfect casting choice and he does fantastic in his role both ian mckellan and sir patrick stewart as magneto and professor x play two age old rivals magnificently and are very believable as life long friends all of the other smaller casting choices such as anna paquin as rogue are also chosen very well i must say however that i didnt like sabretooths character or the actor who played him tyler mane although he was a good casting choice for the character mane didnt really impress me with his acting abilitiesanother complaint i have which may be small is a small portion in the film in which a couple different characters do certain actions that dont fit their personalities but solely to advance the plot their actions are necessary as called for by the script but their nature and deeds dont match up this only occurs at a specific time thats tough to talk in depth about without spoilers but its still present and stands out as a negative on the scripts partcomprehensively is a great film it stands out as a landmark in the superhero genre of film and contains much enjoyment in it despite it being flawed i would recommend to anyone who enjoys superhero or action movies,fantasy
i remember when this film first came about and i caught my first glimpse of the trailer trust a fewfear the rest and i was immediately blown away and then i watched the actually film and again was blown away for me around 70 of the movie works for me and that is more than enough for a first effort particularly when dealing with the the main plot hole for me was the lack of explanation when it came to magnetos grand plan what exactly was this machine and how did it actually work powered by magneto to be fair i saw this as more an intro movie so i was more than willing to overlook it on this occasion casting and character portrayals were pretty solid with some major standouts and a few duds the chemistry between stewart and mckellen was superb and they carried theyre roles well mckellen just pips stewart for me jackman was very faithful to the character of wolverine and reigned it in enough to keep him interesting and multi dimensional rather than cartoonish paquin portrayed a very different rogue and once i got over my inital fanboy disappointment i rather enjoed her performance and she brought a lot of depth to the character romijin was also a major scene stealer with her alluring mystique janssen played the tore jean grey well but her character did come across a little flat at times as did marsden although he has kinda nailed that annoying scott summers quality mane  park done well also and i was delighted to see both characters brought to the big screen ok they were pretty just lackeys but its a comic book film so it has to be expected it was nice to see both actors having so much fun in their roles for me personally the biggest let down character wise was halle berrys very weak storm now to be fair storm is my favorite of the so i was thrilled to say the least when i discovered she was going to be in the film i was expecting a strong african woman who kicked ass and was not to be toiled with instead i got a rather weak character not physically i mean as she did have some of the best action set pieces in the film but as for the actual character halle brought nothing she had no real voice god that awful accent or presence whatsoever which is just a crying shame it wasnt all on halle as i feel singer could have done sooo much more with the character what a missed and failed opportunity i should also mention that singers biggest flaw was making wolverine pretty much center stage really had a knock on effect on allowing other characters to truly shine and other plot avenues to be explored having said all of that i truly thought the was a triumph with its sleek look and excellent action set pieces it has most certainly paved the way for the comic book films we see today,fantasy
 is a title that is given for a bunch of mutants who have various superpowers ranging from reading others minds to self healing the movie exceeded my expectations as it did not feature too much action and had just the right amount of character development and emphasis on plotthe movie features a stellar cast comprising of veteran actors like ian mckellen and patrick stewart hugh jackman made his hollywood debut in this movie and his gritty role as wolverine is one of the reasons why he is one of the biggest movie stars todayall the aspects of the movie gel together to give us a complete entertainment package that does not verge towards being pretentious or silly the primary antagonist is magneto ian mckellen whose aim is to obtain marie anna paquin and use her mutant powers through which she can leech out the powers of another person through physical touch to transfer his own powers to her in order to power the machine that artificially induced mutationdue to its short runtime of 104 minutes the film flies by and the result is a satisfying ingenious piece of work that does justice to the marvel comics on which it is based also the special effects are exhilarating to watch and are not excessive unlike some of the modern superhero movies,fantasy
 the movie that started off a franchisethe 2000 movie with an allstar cast namely patrick stewart hugh jackman ian mckellan halle berry started off a movie revolution reinventing the franchise as we knew it foreverrogue anna paquin is a young girl whose mutant powers prevent human touch for fear of harming anyone she touches on the run from her human family she meets logan jackman a mutant with the name of wolverine however magneto mckellan has other plans for the young rogue and its up to xavier stewart and the to get them both to safety before its too latewith cgi ahead of its time and acting that will stick with you for long afterward is definitely a movie to watch a total of 910 for this movie i recommend this whether youre a marvel fan a fan of one of the many talented actors involved or just a fan of scifi this is an amazing movie that you will want to watch more than once,fantasy
 was the longawaited comic book to film adaptation of the popular superheroes of the same name for years fanboys debated who should play the iconic roles of the mutants superheroes therefore when it finally came to production casting was always going to be an issue as a soso fan of the source material i cant really say how well all the mutants were transferred but most of them seemed pretty faithful  mosthowever what let it down for me was the fact that its called  ie plural there are numerous mutants  some fighting for the noble charles xavier the themselves and those fighting for the dastardly magneto known as the brotherhood therefore because there are multiple stars in a ninety minute movie you cant really give them all the screen time they deserve wolverine hugh jackman is arguably the fans favourite so he gets much of the screen time the others are just kind of there for him to bounce off ofbasically its good superheroes versus bad superheroes so if you generally like your superhero movies then you should get something out of thisof course it was made a fair few years before marvel superhero movies really took off therefore it does feel a little dated compared to todays modern thor iron man and avengers filmsi have my own grips with  i never approved as sir ian mckellen as the villain magneto i always thought the baddie should have the body of arnold schwarzenegger and the facetemperament of al pacinos scarface having an english nobleman as the supervillian just didnt seem to work for me  he wasnt physically intimidating for me sorry sir ianbut overall most people liked it and it spawned numerous sequels and spinoffs i can watch it every now and again its not too long and it fills a void if im in the mood for something light,fantasy
i am doing a superhero franchise review and it isin 1994 20th century fox and producer prawan singh bought the film rights to the andrew kevin walker was hired to write and james cameron expressed interest in directing eventually bryan singer signed on to direct in july 1996 thought not a fan of the comicbooks singer was fascinated by the analogies of prejudice and discrimination it offeredjohn logan joss whedon ed solomon christopher mcquarrie and david hayter wrote the script with hayter receiving sole credit production began in september 1999 in toronto canado and ended in march 2000the film was released on july 14 2000 to positive reviews and critical success and spawned a reemergence of superhero films and it would prove to movie studios that superhero films could succeedthe film introduces us to wolverine and rogue into the conflict between professor xaviers and the brotherhood of mutants led by magneto magneto intends to mutate world leaders at a united nations summit with a machine he has built to bring about acceptance of mutant kind but xavoer realizes this forced mutation will only result in their deathshugh jackman was the perfect choice of wolverine and this film would lead him into being in the sequels and two spinoffs and other movies including van helsing and prisoners patrick stewart plays professor x and ian mckellen plays magneto and they were also really good casting choicesanna paquin was the perfect choice to play rogue  marie and this would lead her into playing in true blood as the main character which ended in 2014 and my 25yearold sister watches the show but i dont famke janssen and the rest of the cast were all cast perfectly in this film as their rolesthe action sequences were amazing and there is less cgi in this film because some of the visual effects are really amazing and this film only had a 75 million dollar budget and i really liked the way this movie turned out and the story is not actionpacked but i will say it is really amazing but there is just one major flaw this was 2000 and it did not make me feel any emotion for the characters except for wolverine and roguethe musical score is really good and i think michael kamen did a really good job with his theme but i like john ottmans theme in the next filmoverall i like but the one thing that had me confused is that the story is not actionpacked enough and it does not make me feel any emotion for the characters except for wolverine and rogue is the reason why we have superhero films today like batman begins spiderman iron man the dark knight the dark knight rises man of steel 300 blade watchmen and of course both the avengers and avengers age of ultron810,fantasy
the movies have become so big and the characters varied that its actually kind of a surprise just how effective the first movie is does its job pretty well it establishes the origins sets up the world and makes it palatable to the mainstream its got a killer opening with wolverine up north and senator kellys mutant registration act as mccarthy witch hunt the rest of the movie isnt dull but its hard to top thatits certainly not without its quirks the blinding error of casting the oddly sedate halle berry who bears none of storms regal presence is only offset by the spoton choice of hugh jackman as wolverine and there are a few spotty effects due to the lower budget but thats nothing although whoever wrote the do you know what happens to a toad when its struck by lightning line should be ashamed of themselvesbut really when all is said and done it makes for both a good comic book movie and solid summer entertainment710,fantasy
now as a kid i grew up with the 1990s animated series and of course it made me a fan of of course read the comic books when i cani remember getting for christmas and it remains one of my favorite movies based off marvel comics is the first of the live action motion pictures and the series has been interesting to say the least but you have to be a fan of to enjoy and appreciate itthe start of the film begins with professor charles xavier patrick stewart narrating how mutants are createdmutation it is the key to our evolution it has enabled us to evolve from a singlecelled organism into the dominant species on the planet this process is slow and normally taking thousands and thousands of years but every few hundred millennia evolution leaps forward that is the start of the film and it is enough to get your interestedthe plot of the film centers around the as they try to fight for humanmutant peace but senator kelly bruce davison is determined to prevent this from happening which leads to magneto ian mckellen and his brotherhood of mutants with sabretooth tyler mane toad ray park and mystique rebecca romijn to begin a warbut the jean grey famke janssen cyclops james marsden storm halle berry will not allow itbut then once new mutant rogue anna paquin comes into the picture it leads to her being protected by loganwolverine hugh jackman it leads to learning how she could turn the tie in the war between the and brotherhood of mutantsas the plot goes on you see more of how rogue will serve more to the plot then you would expect and how wolverine relates to the other members of the is just one of the films that actually did something right sure it didnt hit every note right but it is still a strong filmthe film feature a strong plot that holds your attention from the story of the filmmusic in the film is superb as michael kamen made a powerful score and each piece of music helps tell the story of the film along with each scene get it own score to help move the film the cast was pretty strong as casting patrick stewart and hugh jackman were the right picks for professor x and wolverine the cast each brought something to the table of the film is just one of my favorite films of marvel comics and if you enjoy comic books films then this one would be right up your alleywith strong plot powerful performance it is hard to past this one upi give an 10 out of 10,fantasy
this is the one that influenced so many superhero films like spiderman 1 and 2 iron man 1 and 3 and captain america thank you very much bryan singerno really this movie is quite entertaining the special effects are a little old and cheesy for this day and age but this is still a landmark film nonetheless it not only started a whole genre of superhero films but also started hugh jackmans mainstream cinema career before les mis totally fancified him plus the thought of captain picard working with all the was entertainingthe dialogue faltered in some places like the infamous scene where storm asks toad you know what happens to a toad when its struck by lightning the same thing that happens to everything else otherwise this movie was a hugely immense success since it succeeded while the superhero industry was butchered by superman iv captain america the 1990 one cool your britches and the fantastic four yeah there was actually a worse f4 film than the 2005 and 2007 ones,fantasy
rating710 is a comic book film that makes the transition well and comes out in the end being one of the most memorable superhero welcomes with a fine cast and some crazy super powers manages to mould together some of the best elements we want to see to engage us in a way not seen before this very much i felt the movie to be solidly a pretty good film and here below is why i thought sothe story is exciting yet allows a certain amount of calm moments that create tension throughout the whole plot does seem to ride a long well and the ending doesnt come too fast nor are we bored of one scene that goes on too long because well no scenes are too long it has great action and although the effects dont do great justice to the awesome things going on it still puts you on a bit of a thrill ridehugh jackman as wolverine is good in this and really introduces his character in a gritty and angry way patrick stewart is good as professor x and along with ian mckellen brings in two completely different roles but both acted to the same great way i wasnt too keen on halle berry as storm she felt awkward and over dramatic at times even at times feeling like she had only one liners which were just badly timedbryan singer is the real mastermind behind this and really impresses with his first he directs it fairly well although could have been better it is written very well and this for me was one the major highlights i said about the effects before and i know they werent great in reflection on the time this movie was made but they dont enhance this movies reputation if anything at times it drags it just a slight bitmy main criticism is the lack of true action quite a bit of talking which can be good at times but too much throughout the middle and even the end feels like it needs a little injection of fighting the acting is good although there are some people in it i would have liked to have seen more mostly the students or teachers who although seen are never quite explored in depth like those such as wolverineif you want a good old comic book superhero film then this is by far for you it isnt quite similar to many others but still manages that great thing where the characters are well represented and the budget is used very well i think if you want a lot of fighting and i mean a lot then avoid this there is some but as previously said it isnt abundant and even sometimes the effects can take away the adrenaline rushoverall i give this a 710 and felt it to be solidly a kind of good movie that never quite gets too near to being good well to be good but far outreaches just being ok the franchise starts well here and seeing this as if i were in 2000 would definitely fill me with some hope for the future with the marvel seemed to have really hit the major big time much later than when this film came out and so i feel that this movie really represents the beginnings of what marvel had and have to come,fantasy

the is the first action movie in a long time that doesnt overload itself with special effects in an effort to give the audience its moneys worth this is a film more about ideology than fistfights though it has a few im not an fan but that doesnt matter the characters have a 35year continuity in comic books but the movie never assumes that you know thatwe are sometime in the near future when man is facing a new stage of evolution mutants live as outcasts on a fringes of society each one of them has an extraordinary gift to say walk through walls or change shape a senate hearing is being held to decide whether or not to catalog these freaks of nature before they begin figuring out that crime pays the antimutant stance is taken up by the mccarthylike senator kelly bruce davison the story centers on a girl named rogue anna paquin whose fate is positively shakespearean because whenever she touches someones skin she drains their life force freeze tag must have been hell she runs away and meets a fellow mutant a drifter named logan hugh jackman who has an extra skeletal structure made of a substance called antimantium which includes knuckleblades which retract apparently with great pain the two get into an accident and end up at a private school run by a wheelchairbound psychic named charles xavier patrick stewarthis school provides a safe haven for mutants and teaches them how to use their powers in a positive way at the school we meet the professors confidants cyclops who has deadly laser beams for eyes storm who can dredge up bad weather and dr jean grey who moves objects with her mindxaviers nemesis is a holocaust survivor named magneto ian mckellan whose has the power to bend steel he is positive that a war is coming between humans and mutants his plan is to use a machine to turn all humans into mutants his small band includes a blueskin shapeshifting femalien named mystique rebecca romjynstamos the wookielike sabertooth tyler mane and toad phantom menaces ray park who lashes his tongue like a bullwhipthe first hour of spends a lot of time developing characters thats good because there is a lot of ground to cover i was genuinely interested in these characters and their powers and i was glad that writer david hayter had patience enough to spend some time letting me get to know them if the first hour seems too talky consider how many action movie these days contain almost no dialogue that isnt thrown in to string the action scenes togetherafter a tedious jukebox light show like the awful batman and robin i was happy to see a comic book adaptation that settles down and tells a story unlike batman and superman the are darker superheroes hunted and hated outcasts living in the shadows i like this approach i get a little tired of cities where superheroes are seen as minor celebritiesi also liked the intellectual battle going on between professor xavier and magneto its a battle of the mind and of ideas instead of machines and muscle is a smarter film then you might expect when i see a film based on popular characters that im not familiar with i try to see if the movie can tell me what the appeal is pokmon the movie teenage mutant ninja turtles and mighty morphin power rangers failed to generate much interest from me but i can see why people would like the they are smart clever they have individual personalities and theyre kinda cool,fantasy
59 one of the first big budget comicbook movies to be hit with both critics fans and general movie goers alike that more or less started this whole comicbook film making machine that continues to churn out hit movies to this day hugh jackman is now proved to be the ideal wolverine and it was clear from this very first edition to be the case as he not only looks the part but he has the right personality for the character too here the focus is very much on character ideas and plot proving the sole target audience need not be children a good watch if a little unremarkable but the best was yet to come from this series,fantasy
bryan singer has given life to stan lees in the best possible wayit was entertaining and also interesting in all aspectsthe wolverine is much more than what he appears in the comicswell done hugh jackmanthe casting was splendidstewart and mckellen were truly getting us to think what are they really friends or enemiesthere are two group of mutants who are fighting for the same causethe difference is their approachthe movie gives fair share of incomplete puzzles which may be answered through the sequelsthe screenplay was good and the story was oki would say its a good start to a great seriesim eager to watch the upcoming sequels,fantasy
bryan singers straightforward adult approach to is to be commended like tim burtons treatment of batman singers approach to the subject of super heroes is as dramatic as it is superheroic the perfect blend both batman and have humorous moments but the humor is not out of context and its certainly not the kind of goofiness that we find in say the batman tv series of the 1960s and all too many of the subsequent attempts to bring superheroes to the big screen both patrick stewart and ian mckellen lend the proceedings a gravitas lesser lights could not have in fact the cast from top to bottom is solid the black leather look that has been de rigeur since burtons batman is on display here as well and it works in this world of mutants with extraordinary powers like many of the characters on the xfiles the characters in are all treated realistically despite some truly comic bookish super super powers the cgi are beautifully integrated as well note the cgi actually looked better on the big screen than they do on television in an age when genocide has become the norm the death toll in gaza has today passed 1100 its genuinely sad to see magneto staring up at the statue of liberty and musing america was going to be the land of tolerance,fantasy
 is an spectacular cinematic achievement the way comic book movies were meant to be seen with respect and a surrendering belief to the comic book world a belief is natural for real fans of the comic universe is a realistic take on comic book heroes the story of the is ultimately one of the best reasons to even film a movie in the first place of any kind addresses major relevant societal issues entirely through just as the original comics in a simple to understand and positive way bryan singer and company did wonderful work to create the movie the actors and actresses are xcellent hugh jackman is the wolverine and nobody that is nobody could have done better hugh is feral and warmhearted as logan patrick stewart epitomizes charles xavier professor x patrick stewart the mastermind ian mckellan is too ideal as magneto displaying a real understanding and connection to the character getting patrick stewart and ian mckellan for these roles is a perfect world come true halle berry does a great job of acting support from the side and not becoming too much of the focal point in her portrayal as storm if im not noticing halle then the movie really holds up believe me anna paquin is such a naturally very gifted actress and she fits the role of rogue beautifully famke janssen really personifies jean grey acting as one of the noticeably more interesting characters of the viewing rebecca romijn is really the perfect mystique and she certainly has the perfect body for mystique and if anybody ever needed an actor to play cyclops we could only hope james mardsen was available marsden is very solid very good the other two stars ray park and tyler mane are as good as any playing as toad and sabretooth has a smartly shown story developing sharply from scene to scene smart action with very good special effects a great visual experience it has an impressive score the mutants abilities and their mutant powers are truly awesome thank you brian synger and company thanks to the great casting of the cast and to the cast themselves and of course a true special thanks to stan lee the creator i love the it is one of my most interesting and favorite things to think about and imagine and adore that is i love the xmeeeen is great and very appreciated by the fans x2 the sequel is a really special film and even better than the first much better,fantasy
after watching this movie i remembered writing a review i deleted on how biased it was do to the comic book devotion yes its biased but at the same time i forgot that the story was actually good following the first appearance of the you get superheroes who look act and dress like the 1960s comic counterparts the short intro of the films and its origins were spot on sure magnetos helmet looks funny from the traditional romanesque one sure the origin of wolverine doesnt portray him as the beastly one we all love but the tame trimmed down wolvie from the pages of 1970s alpha flight jean grey was probably the best portrayal here revamped characters are a must but not required although some like the mystique works for the better sure sabertooth was a good portrayal but without costume while rogue was just a little girl with powers or a makeshift jubilee devoid of the past incarnations and southern roots but with a few of these changes the characters and movie would have been perfect the mutants though really were mutants in this film and not superheroes cyclops is spot on storm is okay too yet clearly a line between mutants and superheroes are drawn here maybe even throw in juggernaut magnetos assault on the mansion overall good movie with no overplay like how casting for a russian black widow as scarlet johansson in the iron man film and other minute details marvel films in general will be entertaining but never perfect to their comic book counterpart yet will come close but then again i havent read the ultimate marvel series line yet the cartoon of deadpool was revised accurately wasnt it it seems that the dc and marvel film industry should just stick to cartoons but nobodys perfect to see the movie from a 90s perspective in growing up with comic reading is a must but the traditional 60s story lines work well too the scifi fantasy shakespearean aspect worked well but not too well a good cast and great scene distribution will be overlooked by fans yet characters may not be with a little biasm i give this along with every marvel film a meh nuff said,fantasy
structurally is all over the shop its building brooding hour and a half of character and conflict is stretched out to an awkward length during which things unfold but sporadically before having everything land at an overall base in which a finale of good vs evil can predictably play out but the getting there is enjoyable enough if a little scattered and episodic the fun the film has with its lead refraining from taking either side even though there are those in one camp so desperately wanting him to join them keeps the film from descending too quickly into that aforementioned battle small relatively inconclusive subplots bulk up the runtime and make us feel more gets done that perhaps does the sense of the franchise being set up is certainly prominent in this first edition in flirtations and meek romance between characters rivalries between others as well as an entire backstory shared between the two most powerful characters in the whole film is only hinted at but not fully explored regardless from its muddy and grotty opening during which an individual whos rendered an outcast by a superior force suffers at the hands of human beings right the way up to its climatic fight on liberty island during which a similarly desired extermination of a race must play out the 2000 film an adaptation of a comic book series of the same title workswe begin with mercifully one of the films very few expositional moments during which an american senator explains to a crowded room just what the mutants are and what threat they may or may not pose the the view being to take away their right to hide as mutants and make themselves known were in and like everyone in that room informed on what everyone is and the general proceedings later on we get a sense of how important this issue is to everyone when the item is placed relatively high up on the united nations mandate at their annual meetings the film provides us with a lead in the form of hugh jackmans wolverine a mutant with the power of invulnerability of which many will rightly point out there is usually little to no peril when revolving a text around an indestructible lead although he does come with a sort of secondary power in the form of indestructible metallic blades which shoot out of his knuckles when provoked wolverine come across like clint eastwood came across as blondie complete with gruff voice and nary a cigar too far away so as to easily light up and chomp down on a fresh one now and again in the process struggling to find much compassion and rarely ever being anything but cynical of what or who might be around him his introduction after the brief political speech sees him forebodingly dominate his human counterparts in the outback of canadian snowy nowhere as he persists in winning tavernset cage wrestling matches in providing us with wolverine as a lead we are spared having the film revolve around someone ready to accept his role as a mutant and thus are granted the chance to observe an arc dedicated to coming to terms with ones identity on top of future ideas linked to where one comes fromthe leader of a large proportion of mutants is a certain professor named charles xavier stewart whom has set up a base disguised as a school for the gifted in order to bring in young mutants so they may learn more about their powers and how to control them under his tenure cyclops marsden storm berry and a certain jean grey janssen have prevailed the mutants on this side of the ideological fence retaining generally normal humanlike features in their basic appearance and that each of them are either very handsome or rather attractive in general as they complete with xavier inhabit this rather beautiful isolated locale of an academy on the other side ian mckellens magneto inhabits a very dark dingy base of operations with his office taking on a very ugly metallic cubist form while his minions are these abnormal creatures whom carry disfigured scarred bodies in the likes of hulking sabretooth mane an ugly blue lizardtype shape shifting creature named mystique romijn and the well toadlike mutant named toad park despite being a victim of a proposed purification himself as a young boy at the nazi death camps it is magnetos goal to himself purify human beings as mutants so a more developed species can take over before we supposedly wipe them out a kind of rooted hatred of humanity after what happened all those decades ago its an interesting move from director singer to ask us to root against this character given what we saw him suffer through at the beginningthe fitting element to the conclusion during which a un meeting is taking place in new york city and magneto wants to mutantanise the members is that the final fight unfolds on the statue of liberty itself a piece of iconography symbolising liberation freedom and freedom of choice  the key thing being that magneto is out to sabotage these things in reaction to the popular pass that mutants must surrender their own freedom of choice to remain in the dark we only need to be told once where the fight is unfolding and a number of exterior shots during this climax only serve to emphasise the point at its worst is the equivalent of watching a series of slightly interesting battles between expensive action figures giving a makeover by way of a computer as numerous deadend sub plots worm their way to nowhere but these complaints minor and rarely happen at its best its an interesting and genuinely fun romp about at the most three conflicting ideologies during which oneupmanship is the rollicking order of the day,fantasy
batman superman and several other comic book icons had been coming to the big screen for years but none of those movies really required the sheer ambition that was necessary to bring such a beloved and complicated ensemble style book like to film i dont think that was quite as good as the first spiderman or batman movies but it succeeded admirably in putting together the world and characters necessary for its sequel x2 to be such a great moviei think that bryan singer and the producers made a lot of good decisions with this movie focusing the story on the relationship between wolverine and rogue was smart as were most of the casting decisions the film adaptations of the various characters and their powers were not perfect but they certainly could have been worse the special effects were great for their time toofor all those things that it does right though i still consider it to be only slightly above average maybe the reason that i dont love the move more is because ive seen it so many times that it has little left to offer me i dont ever remember thinking it was amazing though even when it was new is a decent comic book flick but it pales in comparison to its much better sequel,fantasy
 is a pretty decent superhero action flick it benefits from some good performances from stalwarts ian mckellen and patrick stewart  who both lend the necessary gravitas to their respective roles  while hugh jackman is charismatic as the central character wolverine the story itself is not all that good though the origins of the arent really detailed and maybe could have been while magnetos villainous plan at the centre of the story is quite mediocre at best like a great many action films gets bogged down in its final third the big showdown being not terribly interesting however i admire the fact that the film was short many similar productions are overlong without any real excuse a movie like benefits from this fast approach and didnt as a result wear this viewers patience thin overall it was an enjoyable enough ride with decent acting and some welcome humour although admittedly i know nothing of the comic so its impossible for me to say how this compares i guess thats a good thing superhero films arent really my cup of tea but this one was alright,fantasy
i like the effort but the result is subpar here the of marvel comics are given the big screen treatment ala spiderman and they actually employ a competent director with a feel for the source material and quite a talented filmmaker to boot brian singer manages to give us the correct visual imaginings of wolverine storm psyclops jean grey etc the convoluted plot leaves this a tragic mess fortunately singer made a competent sequel that manages to take a poor first outing and make it into a very balanced smart part 2 unfortunately he went too comic booky for the third and final installment rendering the trilogy one of the most uneven productions in modern cinema blah to great to yuck amazing,fantasy
everyone these days talks about how great spiderman batman begins or superman returns is but they forget about the one film that made superhero movies popular again back when came out i was blown away id never seen a comic book movie have so much substance the action was fantastic and this brand new talent named hugh jackman was destined to be a starthe story revolves around a school for gifted youngsters the general population refers to them as mutants but theyre really just like everyone else some of these mutants use the special power theyve been given for good they learn to harness their abilities and let them come out only when it is necessary these extraordinary people are led by charles xavier played by patrick stewartof course theres another side to all of this there are those who are using their unique traits for evil because of all of the hatred toward the mutants the villains want to make everyone in the world a mutant their leader is erik lensherr played by ian mckellan who is the perfect foil to stewarts good natured characterour main characters are that of a wide eyed girl anna paquin and a battle hardened soldier hugh jackman both come to the school for gifted youngsters looking for answers or possibly a new life like the audience theyre new to this world of mutants and arent sure of what to make of their super powersthrough the course of the film we run into many other mutants both good and evil each one has a purpose and theres a reason for their inclusion in the movie its easy to have a favorite character and im sure youll have one by the end of the movie the fun and adventure is pretty infectiousone thing ive noticed about is that it seems to have been overshadowed and tossed aside because of all the other great movies of this genre that have come out since many people think that the sequel to this was even better but true fans know otherwise each character while we may not see much of them has their own little scene youll remember them for something they do even if they have just a few minutes of screen time is the perfect superhero movie it has everything you want in that category and more the fact that it ends up being an allegory for something in todays society only adds to the greatness of this story you dont have to love these kinds of movies to love and thats one of the reasons why i loved it so much i just wish they could make them like this all of the time,fantasy
 is a movie that really imposed me because of its spectacular charm and adventurous plotsthats really a genius masterpieceit inspired my creation and innovationas well as an excitement of the imaginative futurethe director spited this movie into threeand make a fabulous end in each onewhich draws our attention and make us to see the sequeli think i get a lot of ideas from this movieand i hope it could continue giving me new onesthe most favorite character of mine is jean greyshe had a strong power and potentialjust like his fatherif you want to know about the details of this moviego rent one and enjoy it,fantasy
ive never really been a fan of comic bookbased films but ever since i saw spiderman 1  2 i believe i have become a fan of comic book films i love the spiderman movies and so when came on i felt like i just had to see it and astonishingly i enjoyed it i love the action and the fight scenes theyre so amazingly choreographed and sequenced and i love the fact that theyre so interesting to watch without being bloody and graphically disturbing theyre cool i loved all the characters patrick stewart was great as charles xzavier and i loved sir ian mckellan as the deliciously evil eric lenshermagneto he is one actor who never fails at playing the creepy intelligent villains famke janssen as jean grey james marsden as cyclops halle berry as storm and anna paquin as rogue were all awesome as the superheros the and i enjoyed all their characters but i think hugh jackman as wolverine was the one characterperformance that stood out the most mr jackman was wolverine he had his look down pat and he was so masculine and confident and i found it hard not to like wolverine i believe he was my favorite character but i liked them all my favorite scenes were when the were using their powers and trying to save the world theyre so much fun to watch and it makes you anxious to know when theyre gonna use their powers and i also loved the fact that the action wasnt cheesy in this film most superhero films have cheesy dialogue and villains that have cheesy super powers but this film didnt have that i loved all of it is a great actionsuperhero film and any fan of comic books or films based on them should watch this and even if youre not a fan of comic books i think you will enjoy this one for the top notch performances i really enjoyed and im glad i finally gave it a view i had kept refusing to see it because i had no interest in comic book films but this one was great thanks for reading my review,fantasy
im a big marvel fan and of super heroes in general when i saw the cast for this i said thisll be good boy was i right all of the actors were perfectly cast in their roles ian mc kellens portrayal of the hate filled magneto was truly incredible stole the show halle berry was a perfect choice for storm got it down to a tee patrick stewart was spot on for professor x too the scene near the start between magneto and professor x in the hallway at the conference was so well filmed two powerful actors playing two equally powerful mutants facing each other and after a brief exchange of words i said to myself wow that was powerful the movie never dragged and concluded with another brilliant scene between patrick and ian they could keep making these movies forever and id never get tired of them roll on 4 hopefully,fantasy
the first adaptation of the brilliant comic book created by stan lee is perfectly translated on screen through the talented hands of bryan singernot only does have a stacked cast starring hugh jackmanhalle berryfamke janssenian mckellenand patrick stewart but it also has a lot of political and social commentary explores intolerance towards racism and homosexuality by using mutation as a metaphor for it and bryan singer gets his point across loud and cleareach and every character with the exception of maybe rogue is spot on and 100 accurate to the original comic book characters and each actor flawlessly portrays theirfirst lets talk cinematography it is absolutely stunning with a very science fiction matrix look and feel to it really creating a sense of visual satisfactionthe pacing is sort of slow but the action in the final few scenes is breathtaking and accompanied by great special effects that create the atmosphere that isthe fight sequences arent the least bit cheesy of kung phooey they are intense and really get your adrenaline pumping waiting to see whose power will be used nextthhis was one of the first big budget comic book movies ever produced before this was the first four batman films the superman films and spawn making look even better by comparisonmany argue that spiderman and spiderman 2 are marvels best films ever made but i disagree i think is above the first two spiderman moviesdaredeviland the hulk it is truly a work of art perfectly adapted from a work of artmy only few criticisms are the lack of action and that there werent many mutants in the film that i wanted to see beastangelgambitemma frostjubileeand nightcrawler but my craving for those characters would be satisfied by its equally brilliant sequel and its final epicthe last standoverall the greatest beginning to any comic book trilogy and perhaps the greatest comic book trilogy to date,fantasy
this is my favorite super hero movie it has good special effects good acting good costumes and and interesting plot i am not really a fan of super hero flicks ie superman because they are so corny especially with the capes and stupid costumes the x men have uniforms but they are not colored and they dont wear capes i like the idea of mutants it is really clever the powers are really thought out and their code names storm cyclops sabretooth toad magneto etc are very interestingi was excited to see this movie come out because i was only young and i liked the x men comics i loved it this movie showed that mutants are not out to save the world and defeat super villains they are there to protectthis is definitely one of my favorite movies,fantasy
this movie was a great combination of fantasyfiction which many teenagers enjoy reading andor watching and science of which there is enough to interest those who care but not enough to bore those who dontthe concept itself is a great idea for a movie genetic jumps in evolutions future course and not only in one direction but as evolution would naturally create hundreds of branches off homosapiensthe movie has a perfect amount of action and thrill along with a moderate level of romance and humor which shows that not all action nor all sciencefiction has to be serious and bloody but can be funny and relatively cleanallinall its definitely worth seeing,fantasy
apt though dry first installation of the underdog comic franchise delivers fairly decent introductions into these comic heroes lives the often stilted narratives delivered through mostly acceptable acting are thankfully offset by the practical yet glamorous nature of the special effects despite the tasteful implementation of effects the direction of the action scenes often feel disconnected alongside the mechanical script the film offers no real emotional connection to much of the fantasy save a few human comical moments instead of envisioning a movie we have a comic book come to life it is not terrible but if you are not a fan of the comic books do not expect to be captivated,fantasy
very well done i love toad particularly but i do have to say that i dont think sabertooth would have died from that fall thats just me though well chosen actors i thought that patrick stewart was great the way he talked and acted reminded me of his days from star trek amazing actor mystic was also amazingly well done the makeup and costume was well prepared i thought that storm was really underused they could have done so much more with her character not to mention i wouldve like to see more of halie berry hughe jackman did well as wolferine but i thought that they could have found someone else a little more burlytough looking the claws looked amazing and the was they showed his adamantium skeleton was great,fantasy
i think was a great movie with very good acting and directing from brian singer the special affects were awesome and the crew did a wonderful job on casting after seeing it i definitely cannot see anyone else who would have played xaviers part better than patrick stewart brian singer also did a wonderful job with the music and putting the story together to make people think that mutants with powers could very well exist in this world many people think that actresses and actors should be perfect with their looks and their features and there were a few in the movie that i noticed being a good director in my opinion is accepting people who may not have the greatest of looks or the greatest teeth and i applaud the director for this because i watch too many shows or movies who have people who look too phonythe make up and costuming was very well done mystiques costume took a very long time and it was very well done she looked as if she could exist in this world as a mutant the contact lenses looked as if they could have been real eyeseverything was done excellent in the movie all except for one tiny thing not all mutants are going to know how to do self defense some may know how to fist fight or kick someone but doing sumer saults in the air seems fake to me i can understand someone who may have the ability to jump like a toad but a shape shifter or a wolverine just seems fake to make all the characters perfect in fighting skills this is only my opinionstill the movie was great and was done well just wish they could have kept either toad or sabertooth alive as well not all villains who cant fight well should be killed and have the best fighter live,fantasy
in a year where action films have become the norm has taken it a step further the cake as one of the best films of its genre a movie based upon a television showa few things stood out stood out as awesome the first was the cast it seemed to me that the actors were chosen well because they were wellsuited for each of their respective roles patrick stewart looks the part of professor x hugh jackman makes me think we have found a second russell crowe and ian mckellan is truly devilish as magnetothe second thing were the special effects and the way they lifted the movie from good to extraordinary the moves pulled off by mckellan the appearing steps as the villains walk from one side to the other blew me awaythe plot is nothing new but the action sequences and special effects are truly two reasons to see i was impressed with hugh jackman because he reminds me of another actor who by coincidence looks a lot like russell crowe jackman has similar qualities as crowe such as integrity and honesty in his performancejackman showcased to the world the great talent he possesses in his breakthrough role in i must say that he stole the show from his costars jackman a relative newcomer to the land of films will become one of the hottest stars in hollywood real soon jackman is a star who has made a spectacular splash in and whose star has not dipped since,fantasy
 was the ultimate blockbuster debut film for bryan singer it had something the superhero films of the past christopher reeves superman films and the tim burtonjoel schumahcer batman film line were lacking a heart and soul marvelous visual effects and a terrific cast patrick stewart the leading man of the film was the perfect choice for a character like xavier i fell in love with his performance ian mckellen is great as magneto as well mckellen makes magneto not a comic book character but a misunderstood being hardened by events of the past hugh jackman was a great casting choice for wolverine the rest of the cast are superb as well bravo bryan singer and bravo patrick stewart,fantasy
finally they bring to the big screen and best of all they chose the perfect actor for wolverine to put it shortly the only complaint i have was the size of the team at the start 3 and then 4 with wolverine they could have have brought in others like gambit rather than ice man as rogues love interest great plot idea with magneto trying to make all humans mutants and good way for rogue to get her trade mark white stripe in her hair but they could have tweaked some ideas in the plot like having sabertooth and wolvie knowing each other and being rivals would be good but it was still better than most comics movies that have been brought outian mckellen was perfect as magneto and i hope they make more than just 3 and 2 spin offs i hope they bring gambit in one of them and have another with beast 810 well done bryan singer,fantasy
the film that brought comic book adaptations back into the hollywood forefront director bryan singers works for many reasons but mainly because singer and company take the entire premise and characters with the utmost seriousness and respect this film does not exist merely to wow audiences with effects and setpiece or bombard them with zinging oneliners both of which are present of course but singer also wants to elicit an emotional response form his viewers and he succeeds although singer perhaps crams too many characters into a film with such a short runtime which leaves the movie a bit topheavy he has effectively laid the groundwork for a likable assortment of characters this is also aided of course by the terrific cast that singer has tappedthe real casting ace is thenunknown australian actor hugh jackman who delivers a fierce and emotive performance that justifiably turned him into a major hollywood star when asked if his metallic claws hurt when they tear through the knuckles of his hands jackman replies every time and his somber delivery perfectly captures all of the physical and psychological pain that comes from being different singer also pulls memorable work from patrick stewart and ian mckellen although it must be pointed out that both anna paquin and halle berry are terrible inflicting completely unlistenable attempts at character accents upon us the film has so many characters and setups that the whole picture is a bit topheavy however is still one of the few film blockbusters of the 21st century to dig below surfacelevel aesthetics and it proved that audiences still respond to heroes at the box office,fantasy
i am in no way a comicbook fan but is one of my favorite comics and the movie adaption was incredibly well madewhat this film did right was to capture the essence of the original comic much like hulk the makers already set the mood right with the shot of the concentration camp at the beginning and the film retains this tone allthroughoutthe film also has a brilliant cast ian mckellen and patrick stewart pull off their roles as the two best recognised figures in the and marvel universe undoubtedly the actor who always makes my day is hugh jackman who is just perfect for the role of wolverine as such its rather a pity that some of the other characters have a harder time standing out but ones that definitely do are rogue and mystiquethe film is not unfortunately flawless despite its brilliant execution i always felt that the film lacked a certain amount of drama even though it is an excellent film i still think that hulk pulled it off better,fantasy
i thought that this movie was excellent i never thought much about seeing the movies until the third one came out the reason why i decided to see it then was because one of my favorite actors the beautiful ben foster is in iti think it is pretty cool of how the knifes and blades and spears come right out of the mutants whenever they want and need them to the school that they went to for mutants was really just like an ordinary school i thought the costumes and settings were wonderfuli also thought the acting was great directing photography and script two thumbs way up 10 out of 10 stars,fantasy
this is absolutely one of my favorite super hero movies i love the drama and the action scenes but its not to full of action like 3 was were their was more action then the story i think bryan singer is one of the most brilliant directors like when he directed the usual suspects that was a great movie i hope to see the superman returns movie the day it comes out just with the directors past it should be great i only wish that he would have stuck with 3 instead of going with the man who wheres underwear on the outside but back to the movie it was entertaining great characters great acting too james marsden cyclops is my favorite through out the hole movie so thumbs up to him i can honestly say that i will never get tired of this movie,fantasy
this is the first movie based on a comic book in the 2000s after this movie movies such as spiderman the hulk hellboy and other movies based on comic books came outoh about three times a year but the good thing is that at least the whole obsession was started with such a great moviethis is a great movie full of action and drama at every turn less action than youd expect it is a well made and scripted film only after seeing the second film will you notice how gray it feels it is sorta onetrack if you know what i mean but it is still a great movie,fantasy
 after seeingthe last stand in the theaters i was anxious to revisit the film that started the franchise lately x2 has been on television all the time and considering its the better film then ive seen it more often when i first saw in the theaters i was left with mixed feelings for the film i couldnt help but admire it for bringing to the screen my favorite childhood characters however i couldnt help but be underwhelmed compared to the pictures id had in my imagination all those years the first film in the franchise had an almost impossible task in front of it when it was made the scope and sheer size of the comic book stories is so huge its impossible to please all the fans of the series if the first film had started with the origin of the we would have had to wait through numerous films to see many of our favorite however to dive into the middle of a story that took place over centuries of time in the comic books risks alienating fans of the original story lines bryan singer had to make a choice remain 100 faithful to the comics or remain loyal to the central theme while manipulating some characters and stories to work in a film franchise either way not everyone could be 100 pleasein the end singer opted to reformulate some stories and characters i assume he did so in order to make it feel more current and to ensure that bringing some other mutants in for further installments in the series was easier to accomplish it is in this choice that my reservations for this first film were born when i first left the theater my mind was filled with thoughts like why does rogue not do anything shes supposed to and why did they not use certain mutants enough and couldnt this have been biggernow having seen where the franchise continued to move i can appreciate these changes a little more things in the first film felt surprisingly hollow to me when i first saw it in the theaters i saw that there were subtle allusions to the dark pheonix saga as well as a strong establishment of the mutant war however the sequels to the film have made me appreciate the subtlety of this first installment more begins the story of the in a time when mutant privacy is being threatened senator kelly played by bruce davison is leading the campaign that all mutants should be forced to register as such however two allegiances of mutants led by profesor x patrick stewart and magneto ian mckellen have very strong feelings against this campaign profesor x leads the in the fight to coexist with humans peacefully while magneto leads the fight to eliminate human supremacymeanwhile a young girl named rogue anna paquin who unfortunately is miscast in this role is discovering she has powers she cant control nor does she want after being taken under the wing of wolverine played to perfection by hugh jackman they find themselves under profesor xs protection but exactly who needs to be protected and from what the problem with this film as a stand alone piece is that there simply is not enough action i assume budget constraints kept the film from being able to unleash all the action we see inthe last stand however the lack of any real fight scene pitting a team of against an opponent is the major disappointment here action scenes clearly had to be created on a small budget and while some more intimate fights remain exciting wolverine vs mystique in particular the finale leaves the audience slightly underwhelmedhowever as an introduction to the series this film functions rather well those subtle allusions to dark pheonix and the mutant war i mentioned before dont seem as hollow now that i see they were actual seeds to future plots also the fact that this film a character study of rogue and wolverine more then anything gives additional weight to the future filmsall in all although the film seems boring as a standalone blockbuster action film it adds weight to what has turned out to be a compelling franchise it is a more personal film thenthe last stand and it is a more information film then x2 united although at first i couldnt fully appreciate it as an avid fan i have come to enjoy the original film for what it is a good if not great film that is a strong establishment of better things to come b ,fantasy
when x men came out in 2000 it was the first of the new batch of marvel comic book movies the x men series of comic books is apparently the highest selling series in the world according to creator stan lee and as such a movie was inevitable director bryan singer the usual suspects has delivered a movie that pleases the fans while bringing newcomers a lot of joywhen a us senator decides that all mutants in the usa should come forward and be registered magneto playesd impressively by ian mckellen realises that it would spell doom for mutants everywhere and so he decides that now is the time to fight back kidnapping the senator he builds a machine that can give any human mutant powers his plan is to use the machine on the upcoming world summit meeting and inflict mutancy on every world leader so that they can no longer distance themselves from the mutant population meanwhile magnetos old friend charles xaviar played wonderfully by patrick stewart and his loyal band of mutants the learn of the plan and set out to stop him joining them are young girl rogue who can kill anyone she touches and angry wolverine who has incredible regenerative powers and sharp claws that shoot out from his knuckleswhat is a mutant well every few thousand years evolution comes on leaps and bounds and a select group of humans experience changes around puberty some of the afflictions seen in this movie are the ability to control the weather laser beams emanating from a mans eyes and telepathyas an introduction to what would eventually become a trilogy this is a perfect film it has a lot of exposition because the makers obviously realised that it would be followed by more films in the series and as such it lacks any grandstanding action scenes the effects are top notch and the acting by the impressive cast halle berry hugh jackman famke janssen is as it should be indeed hugh jackman takes centre stage as the sceptical wolverine and his brand of hard edged charisma is pivotal to the films successthe action a train station bust up a fight on top of the statue of liberty is entertaining and at the time was amazing eye candy but since then the amazing action scenes of the last few years city wide destruction in war of the worlds huge battles in the lotr trilogy have pushed these rather meagre conflicts back a bit in essence x men seems simply like a teaser for its sequel and the upcoming x men 3in short this is a great film that has brilliant characters and a good dose of controlled humour wolverine tells cyclops to keep his eye open as well as solid foundations laid out by ever reliable pairing patrick stewart and ian mckellen bryan singer delivered a film that entertained and amused us all but looking back its clear that this was merely a film where marvel tested their products and waited to see if their comic book characters could work on celluloida great origin movie and remember that if this film hadnt been a success wed never have had spiderman or any of the other marvel films that have been produced710,fantasy
 was ok for me it could have done with more characters than just the four the movie starred storm halle berry gothika wolverine hugh jackman van hellsing cyclops james maderson sugar and spice jean grey famke janseen magneto ian mkellen lord of the rings and professor x patrick stuart star trek i thought the brotherhood members were fantastic me being the no 1 fan for comics and everything found the movie 810 which is really good the special effects were amazing and my favourite characters that they did the best job of on was toad and jean grey bryan singer did a great job on this movie it could have been better but it was cool the things i didnt like was the lack of and i missed rogues other power what she took from ms marvel apart from that a great movie which a family science fiction fan marvel fan and fan will enjoy,fantasy
with the comic book hype growing each year it is nice to see a story come to life without being cheesy or childish this movie brings the universe to real life in a very real way the storys heroes have their abilities yet never seem to exceed them in the cartoon or the comics they always go toe to toe with tougher opponents and seem to be able to take more damage than they should in the movie that isnt the case i was very pleased to see them use their powers in a real environment and it didnt seem fake to me i like the story they chose to tell in this first installment it did a good job with character development but it didnt have all the characters i would have liked to see wheres gambit why is rogue more like a jubilee in regards to her relationship with logan once i got past my disappointment i really enjoyed this movie it is definitely worth watching over and over again,fantasy
ill speak for all movies if producers could make a bunch of dark type comic movies why couldnt they make this movies look more radical more bizarre and more compromised with reality and real reactions i feel they are somehow infantileand too predictablebut i did like them im a comic strong fan i think producers can be more creative and be less afraid to make movies more intense and stronger people like me and im sure everybody will love themthanks for readingps speaking of marvel hero movies i strongly recommend spiderman seriescolored intense humor action blood yes blood that series doesnt have too much,fantasy
okay so it is a marvel creationi can cut it slack for that ha ha kidding kiddingsettle down marvel fans its true ive always been a dc fan but still are classic heroes at the finest and director bryan singer do an incredible job bringing the heroes to life in fact i think is one of the most well cast films ever period everyone is perfect for their roles everyone is exactly what you expect from them the story line is deep and intelligent and the action is amazing and non stop and builds to a good vs evil blow out at the statue of liberty how can you top that unknown aussie actor hugh jackman nailed the lead as loganwolverine certainly looks wise he had the part down cold but it was so much more than that he absolutely made wolverine he was exactly what the character was and always has been he is a great action hero and the part made jackman into a star and for good reason i only wish he did more action parts still he is and always will be wolverine his character gets the best story the best character arc the most depth and he pulls it off with incredible emotion and personality how could patrick stewart not be professor charles xavier he looked the part talked the part he was perfect he was just as perfect as jackman was for the role stewart exudes intellect and he is a great fatherly figure to them all the terrific ian mckellen plays the evil magneto hes the perfect villain because he has such great intellect a great history with charles xavier as friends and enemies and hes almost a misunderstood villain with seemingly pure reasons behind his madness famke janssen plays the telepathically powerful jean grey although she too plays her role very intelligent her performance is a little wooden and not entirely important she could have done a lot more with the character james marsden plays scott cyclops summers unfortunately cyclops doesnt have a huge role and its a great character on top of that marsden is terrific in the part his chemistry opposite jackmans wolverine is fun and hilarious at times as they banter and fight over jean greys affections halle berry is the star power as storm apparently she doesnt like how small her part is but i think she does a great job and she does have a significant role i think berrys performance as storm is actually one of her best she too completely embodies the character young anna paquin plays the naive rogue who finds her way to the rogue and wolverine have a heavy story together and jackman and paquin are good together in the fatherdaughter type role paquin is a little quiet but she looks very forlorn and you feel sorry for her character shes a little young to be playing rogue but still her character is important and shes good enough to carry it the rest of the cast mostly bad guys are fantastic tyler mane rebecca romijn ray park and bruce davison are all fantastic in their smaller but very significant roles romijn is especially intriguing under all the make up as the deadly and mysterious mystiqueable to take the form of anyone this is without a doubt her best role as wellif bryan singer had a hand in castingbravo to him for pulling together the absolutely perfect cast they all clicked together unlike anything ive ever seen on top that for an action film and a superhero film this has one of the best story lines i have ever seen there is no origins to cover per se but instead launches immediately into the brewing war between mutants and humans singer creates a future world where fear creates a chasm between them is a terrific action film and starts a great series so much potential for sequels and so much amazing story and characters its a must see 8510,fantasy
a all around awesome movie but perhaps could have had a little bit more action the story line is also a little  as i should say simple but the movie itself kicks behind some of the actors including hugh jackman patrick stewart and ian mckellan did a terrific job as their characterit had a whole lot of action and kept sort of close to the comics singer did a fine job as he may continue in the future this movie should make fans of proud and carry on with their assortment of likings to iteverything about this movie is very well thought out along with being organized the music i must say though might need a little working on but the movie still rocks i enjoyed it very much and hope singer can make another good movie soon well done singer,fantasy
 is based off the famous marvel comic about the conflict between average human beings and mutants charles xavier is a mutant who runs a school where mutants can go to learn and be safe however underneath the cover of the school he has a strike force he calls the sworn to protect humanity from any threat the consist of cyclops storm and jean grey on the other side of the spectrum is magneto an evil mutant who believes in mutant superiority and leads his own team the brotherhood consisting of mystique toad and sabretooth when magneto attacks two mutants named wolverine and rogue xavier must find out what his old friend wants with them is a good movie for anyone who is a fan of the comics or the 90s cartoon series but people who just want to sit down and enjoy a movie might not like itthe acting is really good all of the actors involved bring their characters to life with good results hugh jackman made a surprisingly good wolverine even though he was a complete unknown at the time halle berry is a great actress and she made a really good storm even though her screen time was a little under what it could have been by far the best acting job in the movie is ian mckellan who tackles the role of the evil magneto his voice is ice cold and it makes magneto seem even more threatening that he already isthe action scenes are great especially the climactic battle at the end bryan singer breathes a new life into the and makes their cinematic adventures look as if theyre taking place in the real world rather than the comic book world the only problem with this first movie is that its basically a two hour introduction to all the characters if you think about it not a whole lot happens in this film the plot isnt that deep but instead it focuses on establishing the characters and where they stand dont get me wrong this isnt a bad thing the movie is still good but like i said its more appreciated among fans of the source materialso is a good comic bookaction film albeit a little underdeveloped and should be viewed by all fans710,fantasy
the comics is given a slick and realistic make over that not only brings the mutants powers to the big screen but also makes them believable mutants are people who are feared for being different the movie first focuses on wolverine and rogue who end up joining the in an attempt to stop magneto a mutant terrorist who wants to destroy the human racethe movie is smart with a great plot and a great cast ian mckellen and patrick stuart are brilliant in this giving great performances hugh jackman plays a tough although slightly taller wolverine it introduces the well and there is a lot of character development especially between wolverine and rogue anna paquin the love triangle between cyclops jean grey and wolverine brings in tension and a lot of funny scenes between cyclops and wolverine the special effects are also great considering there wasnt a huge action movie budget on this with great lightening sequences for storm the villains are also interesting with the disgusting toad frightening sabertooth and mystique who has some spectacular scenes i wont give away the ending but it all comes together with a bang and leaves room for a sequel,fantasy
  based on the comic book series that began in the 1960s this bigscreen adaptation is more of a variation on a theme than an outright recreation it entails the mutant race who are rejected and persecuted by society because of their abnormality the second contending rift exists between the mutants trying to help the human race and those striving to extinguish them the story begins with a young woman anna paquin trying to find her place in society upon discovering her internal mutanic structure she is taken in by the good guys and in the climactic point the opposing force wants her for their own purposes i took as a simple entertainment of cool handonhand combat and impressive special effects and really enjoyed it,fantasy
like spiderman ive never read any of the comics but i am a big fan of the cartoon and a very good cartoon it is too all of the characters are well fleshed out with their own distinctive personalities and pasts this is where my knowledge of the series comes from and when i learnt a film version of the was in the works it elicited mixed feelings from me because a tv series allows for development of all of the characters i didnt see how it could be done within the confines of a 100 minute filmstill it has to be said that bryan singers works far better than expected even if some of my fears were justified for anyone not familiar with the characters the are mutants they represent the next stage of human evolution the film doesnt include all of the but it does have some of the most important ones there is cyclops james marsden who can shoot energy beams from his eyes wolverine hugh jackman who has a metallic skeleton metal claws that sprout from his knuckles and remarkable healing powers storm halle berry who can control the weather and jean grey famke janssen whos a telekineticthe leader of the is professor charles xavier patrick stewart a very powerful telepath who wants to bring peace between humans and mutants but there are some mutants who dont share xaviers dream and the ringleader is magneto ian mckellan a mutant with the power of magnetism who has amassed his own team of mutants mystique a shapeshifter sabretooth a feral mutant and in the case of toadwell his name speaks for itself hes got a nasty tongue too magneto is a survivor of the holocaust and he has no intention of letting mutants become the victims of persecution just like the jews were he has developed a machine that triggers mutations in human beings and his first testsubject is senator robert kellysenator kelly believes mutants are a threat to mankind and has played upon peoples fear and mistrust of mutants to turn it to his favour when kelly is kidnapped by magneto the machine turns him into a mutant but kellys body rejects it killing him in the process all this is unknown to magneto who is planning on doing the same to the un summit before they impose a legislation on mutant registrationpowering the machine would mean killing magneto so he kidnaps a young mutant called rogue anna paquin who can drain the energy out of people with a simple touch and a mutants power too magneto will transfer his power to rogue who will power the machine hidden inside the statue of liberty and bring about magnetos future of a mutant dominated society its up to the to stop himas i write this review feels a bit cluttered singers direction is excellent and the camerawork is sharp and astute but is quite a juggling act not only is there magnetos scheme to contend with but there are far too many characters and not enough developmentsome are afforded massive screen time like wolverine and rogue which isnt a bad thing because jackman and paquins acting is superb but storm and cyclops are shortchanged patrick stewart was born to play professor xavier embodying the characters trademark serenity ian mckellan is perfectly cast as well he makes magneto into someone who isnt really evil just passionate about keeping the future safe for mutants he doesnt want history to repeat itself and he is genuinely regretful about rogues sacrifice for his planalthough some of the casting is inspired others are badly miscast james marsden is annoyingly bland as cyclops and halle berry is all wrong too she has none of storms majestic grace as the mistress of the elements famke janssen makes an impression as jean grey even if she is a little subdued but i sense great potential in her something happily expanded upon in the sequelbut its hugh jackman and anna paquin that captures the attention jackmans film debut is a revelation he captures the feral attitude of wolverine to a tee and knows when to dial it down too anna paquin brings the right blend of teen angst and confusion at her growing mutant power in one ofs quieter moments she confesses to wolverine how she put a boy into a three week coma through a simple kiss her performance is dazzling because of the way her young mind comes to grips with the fact that she will never experience intimacy in her life i predict anna paquin has a very promising future ahead is most effective in exploring mutants burgeoning powers how they realise theyre different but theyre afraid to come forward it bears connotations with gay and ethnic minorities and shows why is filled with possibilitiesthere are some great action scenes too wolverines fight with sabretooth and mystique magneto flipping police cars about and toads impressive gymnastics the climax at liberty island is perhaps slightly disappointing compared to the sequel anyway and the film is more enjoyable if you have a working knowledge of the characters beforehand but bryan singers film is a good start and leaves things open for the next welcome instalmentx2 is a more tightly plotted film and feels more epic in scale it was the same with spiderman 2 whatever shortcomings the original had theyve been eliminated from the sequel but still succeeds as an engaging superhero film and leaves the door open for many sequels to follow,fantasy
move over superman batman spiderman and the incredible hulk the are here based on the marvel comicbook heroes created in 1963 by stan lee and jack kirby the movie is mostly just thatcomicbook material but its done with such remarkable visual style you might not notice its want of substance in fact resembles a lot of todays action movies it involves a boatload of good actors in stateoftheart technical wizardry and at its core lacks heart as gertrude stein is supposed to have said of oakland theres no there there in typical comicbook fashion both the premise and plot of are quite simple but the filmmakers have done their best to muddle them up making the first hour of patchwork developments a chore to piece together heres the idea mankind according to evolutionary theory has taken millions of years to mutate into the species we are today but what if those mutations could be effected in only a few years would not the result be a race of beings with possibly extraordinary powers compared to mere homo sapiens without explaining how these instant mutations could occur the story line assumes such things have already happened resulting in a world of the nottoodistant future being inhabited by growing numbers of mutant people with unusual capabilities actually it just gives the writers a flimsy excuse to let loose a bevy of superheroes and supervillains on the world without having to explain how they got that way even still its the great series brought to life love it wolverine is the best,fantasy
simply put this movie was amazing the director of usual suspects continued to show his talent with this movie every actor that played in this movie nailed their characters role jackman played an excellent lone bad following the old cartoon video with the exception of lacking a few characters and where magnetos machine is this movie is portrays the plot line of the cartoon like no other spiderman daredevil hulk punisher etc all these superheroes were revived to movies simply put because the hit the box office like a ton of bricks the reason being is before this movie we had flops like the phantom batman forever batman and robin and spawn bottomline is cinema with this growing trend of superhero movies would be a pile of crap had prove that these films are a force to reckon with,fantasy
when i look back at the summer of 2000 theres really only two films that come to mind ridley scotts gladiator which i loved and bryan singers which in my opinion was the best comic book movie adaptation at least at that time even beating out batman for the top spot seemed to deliver just the right amount of bigscale action humor and scifi imaginings that made the film accessible to anyone whether they were diehard comic book fans or not and at that particular time i was not but now i am a huge comic book fanwhen i was really young around four or five i used to be into superman and batman so i was more of the dc comics type of kid i watched those old 40s max  dave fleischer superman cartoons the george reeves 50s black and white superman tv show and of course the christopher reeves films and both the batman and superman animated tv series of the earlymid 90s which i still love heck i even watched the 60s batman tv show with adam west remember back before he was the mayor of quahog i didnt really get into batman until tim burton came out with his film in 89 but despite all of these things i still wasnt a comic book kid i never went out and bought or read comic books but it wasnt until i saw bryan singers and to a greater extent sam raimis spiderman that i became a real comic book fan so for me is kind of a turning point in my interest with comic books and superheroes has a number of things working for it first off the film is under a hundred minutes and is very quick paced never slow or dull second the casting is well excellent hugh jackman is spoton perfect for the character of wolverine who was always my favorite even before i saw the film hes a tough character whose rough around the edges but with a tender heart but dont mess with him because hell tear you a new one literally then theres professor x for xavier played by none other than patrick stewart honestly though could you even image for a second for anyone else in this role because i certainly know i couldnt then theres the bad guy magneto played by the great sir ian mckellan needless to say hes great as well a villain evoking both coldblooded menace and intelligence then theres the rest of the cast which includes james marsden famke janssen halle barry anna paquin rebecca romijn insert drooling sound here tyler mane and ray park all of them were great well all except halle barrys wig and fake accent but other than that its hard to see anything wrong with this cast and i for one am glad they decided to change the costumes a bit because wolverine just wouldnt have looked as kickass as he did if he was wearing yellow spandex like in the comic books but i thought the looked great in the black leather costumesthe plot of in case youve been living under a rock or just havent seen the movie before is about two mutants wolverine and rouge who are rescued by two storm and cyclops and brought to a school for the gifted run by professor x it seems as if they are on the edge of a war between humans and mutants magneto has an evil secret plan towell i aint gonna spoil it for ya youll just have to see the movie but isnt just a big summer action flick filled with computer effects no is also wellacted and wellwritten any popcorn flick can have special effects but not all of them deliver the solid performances and smart dialogue like does and on top of that the film is also dark stylish exciting and at times surprisingly funny i couldnt have asked for a better comic book movie and it still holds up after many viewings many years later this is excellent summer fun thats not dumbed down and people of all ages young and old and both male and female alike and both fans and nonfans can enjoy,fantasy
i saw this at the cinema on the day it opened in the uk i was quite excited about an x men movie and at the time i was left disappointed i have since seen it again and find that its actually quite good but it suffers from one major flaw that luckily the sequel doesnt and thats that it feels like a pilot for a tv showstill the action scenes are well done and everyone is cast great one of marvels best adaptations so farlets just hope the third one lives up to the first 2 this is one of those rare times that a sequel is better but you really need to see this one in order for the series to make sense and really its not a bad film,fantasy
what bryan singer has done to bring to the bigscreen is both smart and fun to watch instead of making about nothing but big mutant action hes managed to make a good action movie with a good plot and puts everything in the movie together nicely and with some style in a few areasconsidering the mutants included in this movie singer has done if i may say so an excellent job in selecting the actors and actresses for each role as far as bring their character to life jackman does the best job as logan or wolverine as hes better called by fans paquin does a good job at capturing the confused and seemingly stressed feeling of rogue but patrick stewart is the smartest choice in particular even though jackman does the best at being wolverine not only does stewart have the perfect look for professor xavier but he also has the right personality and attitude a kind of knowitall but helpful and notso geeky kind of personality makes him one of the more believable characters ian mckellen is a great choice for magneto not only is he the smartest choice for magneto but mckellen creates a charming and calm kind of feeling towards his character which even as a baddie he manages to make the audience like him all the other performers of do their part to bring their mutant role to life and they all do it successfully and almost perfectlys plot is actually one of its better elements yes you could go on saying how cool each of the mutants were how great the special effects are and how cool the vs battles were but to talk about this movie and not mention it having a good plot is almost an insult the thing i like about this movie is that it takes its time to let the audience understand everything thats going on and the movie takes what some might call a risk in not being so involved in the action sequences and using up a majority of the viewing time to let the story of the movie flow and lets the action and performers go and unfold the events that happen throughout the film but since i dont want to spoil the simple but more than aboveaverage plot for you ill keep it on the downlow from now just know that if youre looking for a good plot in you wont be disappointedthe action in isnt that much of a focus of the movie as the plot is but not to worry the action is more than satisfying and most of the time pretty cool the special effects in this movie arent used in a way that itd make the king of cgi like king kong and titanic are but theyre nothing short of impressive and make the action sequences much more stylish most of the action is thrown out near the end and it all leaves a good feeling with the audience to make them feel satisfied and to have gotten a good share of actionbut even with all that ive said in it just doesnt seem to rise to that mark to make it an oscarworthy film its not that the movie lacked anything not at all everything in the movie was pieced together right but its just one of those movies that doesnt give the viewer that wow or now thats a stunning masterpiece impression once the movie ends but instead comes out being a great movie that only lacks the beyond belief factor that the biggest movies deliver but by no means is a bad film theres absolutely nothing that i could say was particularly wrong with the film its only when you stack it against the best movies that it comes short and almost seems to want to challenge those films in some way,fantasy
all in all its a good flick whether you were a fan of the comic books or never read thema few lame lines aside its pretty well put together and the characters are likable including the evil doers effects are solid as wellit really comes down to whether you like the genera of comic book films or not now there have been some particularly crapolicious ones this isnt one of them its pretty obvious that marvel comics were heavily involved with the crafting of the moviesso this and something like sin city may turn you around about the genera of movies hey its a helluva a lot better than pretty much any movie that is based on a damned video game,fantasy
bryan singer introduces us to the world of in a mostly successful way the film is properly cast  with a special mention for patrick stewart as professor charles xavier one of my favorite actors and hugh jackman as loganwolverine however the other areas are less than par including a silly costume for magneto  whats with his helmet and a soso score by the late maestro michael kamen fyi i do enjoy his scores for the die hard and lethal weapon films but in this case it was not very memorable if you want to see a great movie i suggest renting the sequel x2 which was properly done by bryan singer for this outing however an above average 7 out of 10 for a good introduction to a memorable superhero series,fantasy
evolution has created the next link in the chain people who have special powers they have been classified as mutants by the normal population who fear these different people greeting them with trepidation rogue has only realised she is a mutant after she place her boyfriend into a coma she takes peoples energy on the run she runs into wolverine another mutant with fast healing abilities and three retractable blades on each hand the two are attack by an mutant sabertooth on unknown intentions rogue and wolverine are saved and taken into the care of professor xavier with his protgs storm cyclops and jean xavier has been fighting for equality between mutants and people but a former friend magneto has the opposite idea magneto want superiority over the human race believing mutants are the next ruler of earth magneto has devised a plan with his henchmen sabertooth toad and mystique that will make people think differently about mutants is a faithful adaptation of the comic book series without ever falling into the pit of over the top sensibilities bryan singer has played it on the lower keys where the characters come to the fore front instead of the action there are a lot of character in yet it doesnt over load you they may not be fleshed out a lot but your still are able to understand them and attach yourself to them the most developed is wolverine who has a lot of past to uncover yet it still would have been nice to have more depth on the other charactersthe action is kept on the low down there isnt a lot of it and it soars in that respect with action and special effects kept to the minimum they have been able to develop the characters and the story as the special effects are used a lot it allows the scenery to come forward and the scenery is visually rich and detailed has a real quiet tone but from this the subtexts really are uncovered there are a lot of ideas and morals beneath the surface acceptance tolerance bigotrysocial stature and that fear that everyone has when they dont understand the unknown there are some great scenes between rogue and wolverine that elevate this from just am action film and really humanise the story there is a sense of realism to the story reflecting a lot of the racial intolerance in humanity at our current times shows what great casting can lead to all the actors perfectly fit their roles with a lot of unknown actors showing some great talent hugh jackman is great as the rugged wolverine famke janssen wonderful as jean same with halle berry as storm anna paquin shines as rogue james marsden also great as cyclops ian mckellen and patrick stewart both are great in their roles ian as the determined magneto and patrick as the humble xavier is one of the better comic book adaptations as it goes beyond the action and delves deeper to bring a very deep and meaningful story with so much subtext to explore,fantasy
i have never read an x men comic nor even heard them referred to in any medium until this x men movie came out so i was really involved in the background exposition which is most of the movie and is mostly a set up for the sequels it was a bit much to start with the real environment of nazi concentration camps in 44 and then somehow leap to the near future rather than making the whole thing futuristic but im sure other folks know if thats based in the comicshugh jackman took over the whole movie in a starmaking turn halle berry surely wont be able to use this as an audition tape i hope she at least made big bucks because she had zero to do james marsden fans will be similarly disappointed though patrick stewart and ian mckellan get to sleepwalk and still emotethe siblinglike relationship between jackmans wolverine and anna paquins rogue is surprisingly touching marred by an unnecessary ending comment that now she has a thing for him that he has to condescendingly put down hey whats the matter with familial affection these days as a motivatorthe fight scenes were a bit ho hum   it was like a sesame street lesson in cooperation as each set of mutants gangs up on enemies to use their super mutant powers together i kept thinking how much more intense and scary was the statue of liberty scene in hitchocks the saboteur compared to this climaxthe music was bombastic but effective the only song really heard is lucinda williams in a bar jukeboxoriginally written 842000,fantasy
when you look at in really was a risk when it was first released in 2000 big budget superhero movies hadnt been successful in ages the last attempt being the abominable flop batman and robin as well incorporated a huge cast most of which were big name actors almost all of whom needed roughly equal screen time to make the story work all in all it seemed a lot to juggle to make worklucky it seems then that a director was attached to the project who actually knew what he was doing brian singer whose credentials included the usual suspects a heist thriller known as one of the most brilliantly executed of all time and apt pupil detailing the life of an exnazi trying to incorporate himself into an ordinary lifestyle seemed like the kind of director who would pass off a comic book film as too lowbrow but singer instead embraced the deeper themes of the story such as societal prejudice and exclusion and played them for maximum effect and it worked seems surprisingly grounded in reality considering it features characters able to blast laser beams from their eyes and control the weather the viewer can almost picture themselves inhabiting a world where parents are afraid of their children going to school with the mutant kidssinger also comprehensively explores the comic backstory of the characters and brings this into effect and yet for all the comic book trivia incorporated into the movie the plot never sags or seems overcrowded such traits as professor xavierpatrick stewarts paternal instinct towards cyclops james marsden his first student are expressed in only a couple of lines and yet become definitive and clear to the audience we also see such characters as pyro shadowcat and colossus who made larger appearances in the second movie take cameos as if to see which comic fans are paying attention truly a classy directorial move theres also several knowing winks to the characters backstories the what would you prefer  yellow spandex line being the most obvious as well as several cheeky and intelligent touches such as wolverines middle claw and keep your eye open comment to cyclopsit also helps that singer has managed to assemble a stellar cast to bring the much loved characters to life the movie built solid careers for relative newcomers hugh jackman and rebecca romijn and certainly brought halle berry more into the commercial spotlight but the movie not only features many well known actors but also manages to perfectly capture the essence of the age old characters hugh jackman seems born to play wolverine every gesture every move he makes is purely in character this also seems to be the case for patrick stewart who makes a pitch perfect professor xavier trainer and mentor to the famke janssen is a superb jean grey giving more depth to what could have been a character written with very little to do james marsden also brings the overly strict cyclops truly to life his back and forth exchanges with the defiant wolverine are comic genius and straight out of the comics halle berry may not have been the most economic choice for storm as her behaviour regarding the 2 sequels proves but she does bring a certain credibility and truth to her character ray park also proves that despite being constantly cast for his stunt skills he most certainly act playing a truly edgy and gross toad who in the comics was a simpering moron rebecca romijn gives a dangerous edge to the shape shifting mystique despite almost certainly being cast for her stunning looks displayed in full glory as she is never clothed with only a few tastefully placed scales leaving tantalisingly little to the imagination wrestler tyler mane also makes a menacing and genuinely frightening sabertooth but in this cast full of standouts if one had to pick the single most affecting performance the only contender is sir ian mckellan as the humanitarian villain magneto again it only goes to show that good casting counts for so very much what could have been reduced to a campy ranting performance by another actor is instead morphed into a dignified cultured and genuinely angry villain mckellan seems to build layers of repression and injustice into his very soul with the truthfulness he projects his hatred for humankind and their intolerance for anything different from themselves in fact if it wasnt for hugh jackmans brilliant performance mckellan would easily walk away with the film unchallenged as is the picture still belongs to him but its an extremely close thing the exchanges between magneto and wolverine are dynamic you could swear you feel the very air crackling with intensity so in the end theres really nothing not to love about  an incredibly truthful intelligent and relevant script is brought to life in a remarkably tasteful and affecting manner by a truly skilled director the tremendously capable cast bring their characters to life in a truly satisfying way and its all tied together by a truly enjoyable and powerful score by the late michael kamen all in all the tremendous success of served to birth other successful superhero films such as the spiderman series and the recent batman begins but even if viewed as a stand alone proves a superbly enjoyable and very solidly made film910,fantasy
i have just finished watching my dvd of this movie with my kids who sat enthralled and quiet mostly all the way through it i dont know why but i enjoy it more the more i watch it  which is unusual for most movies dont bear up to repeated viewingsthe fact that there were distinguished actors and a good script not to mention a bit of humour now and again along with brilliant special effects means it earns a 10 in my book i look forward with anticipation to x man 3 which i was pleased to see in my search on imdb is planned for release in the future i hope it does as good if not better business at the box office as the first two i also hope it manages to keep its high quality of acting and scripting  along with the special effects,fantasy

this is one of the few movies that i paid twice to go see it for the second time in the theatersi remember being riveted to the screen from the first scene magneto as a child in concentration camp bend the steel gate out of its shape all the way to the end of the movie it was that exiting it sounds weired but ive felt a strange kinship to the mutants when i was watching the movie the story just sucked me in and made me feel that close to the characters now thats good story tellingthe casting was perfect each character was represented faithfully it sent shivers up my spine when i saw cyclops and storm appear for the first time in the scene they looked awesome you have to keep in mind that many of the casts in this movie were little known until theyve made it big in this movie and it takes someone with an eye to recruit all these talents to create a believablebryan singer said he had little regret about how the movie came out because he was rushed to make it for the 2000 summer release but anyone who can manage 75m and turn it into a celluloid gold like this gotta have some talent first time is always the hardest and he did a crazy good job in my opinionim giving this movie a 9 only because i gave 10 to x2 which i felt had better attention to the props but i would have happily given it a 10 if it wasnt compared to anything elsea landmark epic in cinema history if you ask me,fantasy
this adaptation of marvels mutant superheroes took many by surprise building  improving on the success of the first blade98 film and paving the way for the most successful marvel adaptation spiderman2002 like the better adaptations of comics properties this found the core element which defineds success especially since 1975 when the books were revamped a minority within the human race persecuted by the majority struggling to overcome prejudice and ignorance as a comic book began way back in 1963 but the film depicts a mixture of characters from the sixties and later ones introduced in the seventies chief among equals is wolverine a loner and antihero who may go either way in choosing between 2 sides of the mutant camps one led by professor x stewartthe benign faction the other by magneto mckellen the radical side or wolverine may choose neither  he is a loner after all and the true xfactor in this intrigue the film scored a triumph with casting hugh jackman as this badtempered mutant in the 11th hour he was an unknown complementing the strengths of wolverines own character and fit the role splendidly he brings a muchneeded energy and intensity to the entire picturemany viewers regard the sequel x2 as even superior to this intro which may be true but theres a raw energy here that cannot be duplicated in a sequel here is where a strange new world was first brought forth to an audience a nearfuture where fantastic beings were a somewhat natural outgrowth of mankinds evolution if you discount possible influences of the atomic age which isnt mentioned here the creation of a whole new world landscape is a daunting prospect but director singer and the writers pull it off using the established comics lore instead of disregarding itof the other characters mckellen shines as the main villain making stewart appear stiff by comparison magnetos is a tragic history as shown more complex than most comics villains but hes also a superpowered terrorist and does not engender much sympathy his henchmen are all fine with the bluecolored female shapeshifter standing out a bit of the heroes rogue paquin has the most interesting role besides jackman the one area the filmmakers failed in is the jean greycyclops romance this relationship evolving over the many years in the books had the capacity for great things on film  scott  jean were meant for each other soul mates if you will none of this comes across in the film jean is made the older woman for some reason and marsden miscast as the brooding cyclops lacks any depth halle berry probably criticized most as storm isnt really given a chance to be good or bad in the role most of the time you just stare at her apparent beautyit was a pretty exciting film it could have been much worse all comic book fans at least breathed a sigh of relief afterward,fantasy
ive been reading comics since before my voice got low and girls started getting prettier i have a solid run of 240 straight plus hundreds of others from other xrelated series reading comics is pretty much the only thing from my old life that i still do so when the movie came out i was ready to geek out as much as any star wars fan waiting in line for a prequeli was also trepidatious that the movie would stomp all over that which i had loved for years as hollywood had done with every other comic book movie to have come out before however i was very hopeful that this one would be different the reason bryan singerbryan singer the director of the usual suspects one of the coolest movies ever if he couldnt make a good movie then it couldnt be done for years there had been talk of an movie and for years i didnt want it to happen then they got bryan singer and i was cool with itwhen there was talk for years about an movie there was always a consensus regarding one person that needed to be cast patrick stewart as professor charles xavier because no bald cap would do we needed a real live bald guy i was surprised he took the role since he already played one iconic fanboy character i figured hed be tired of going to conventions by now but play xavier he did and he did so flawlessly singer filled the cast with another esteemed british actor ian mckellen to play archfoe magneto oscar winner anna paquin as rogue big star and eventual oscar winner halle berry as storm famke janssen as jean grey james marsden as cyclops supermodel rebecca romijnstamos as mystique a wrestler and darth maul a good blend of solid actors and cheap talent to fill out the cast better than dolph lundgren as the punisher i saythe only problem was casting the main character they had someone cast but he went and broke his hand right before shooting so they cast some guy no ones ever heard of hugh jackman to play the most important role in the movie and he does so flawlessly jackman is wolverine a performance so pitchperfect that it just might be the best portrayal of a comic book character on film ever better than christopher reeve as superman better than tobey maguire as spiderman the first time i saw him on screen stopping a guys punch with the sound of clanging metal echoing through the theatre i marked out like a guy in a storm trooper outfit seeing yoda fight count dooku then jackman growls and sneers and snikts he had me at snikt no wait he had me at bub or at every time ahhhh so goodsinger and cowriters tom desanto and david hayter do an excellent job in wrangling 40 years of mythology into a manageable 15 hour movie he manages to show each of the 10 main mutants of the film showing off their powers in interesting ways along with other background mutants like iceman and pyro and hints at larger stories and origins surrounding them he wisely plays down on some of the larger sciencefiction elements of the series mythology and focuses on the core myth surrounding the protecting humans who hate and fear them it is the most resonate theme of the film and the mythos and the one that best gives a film purposesadly the film is far from perfect an hour and a half is not long enough to sufficiently develop the characters leaving the film to operate at a breakneck pace to get its business out of the way even with the fastpacing it drags during the origin stories portion or at least it does for nonfans it was just fine by me while the audience awaits the next battle and in true comic book fashion their is some really lame dialogue at times not revenge of the sith lame but still pretty lame do you know what happens when a toad is struck by lightning ugh another problem is that favourite characters go underdeveloped or unfeatured such as my favourite cyclops while the movie focus on wolverine xavier magneto and rogue but those are the choices that need to be made in a movieoverall i lovedlovedloved this movie when it came out loved the tension between wolverine and cyclops loved rogues longing for human touch loved magnetos handling of the police and now watching it 5 years later i still love it of course im seeing it all through my colouredglasses which are ruby quartz,fantasy

comic books have always been more about surrealism than action when jean paul satre wrote about being chased around pariss streets by giants crustaceans they gave him a nobel prize for literature but if you write a story about a person who dresses up as a spider or a bat to fight crime you are considered somehow low brow was the first comic book to change that it arrived a time in american history when issues such as race where still being debated seriously and the future of humanity was first seen to be in the balancethe who were mutants with powers were doing what humans do making choices about how to use their new power do they use it for good or ill even if you have read a lot of other comic books you will see this exact same story line copied over and over againso the movie starts on the moral heights by showing us the depth of human depravity the nazi death camps for jews here we meet magneto and there is little more that needs to looked into to understand his characterthe brilliance of this movie continues particular by focusing on wolverine one of the most loved characters in the series he is like many of the favourite comic book characters he doesnt really want to take sides however he is not a bad person and will fight for those he cares about rather than causes and purposes he is most like us in this respectthrough his eyes we learn about the and what they hope to do he is a fun character and gets all the best lines all the hero work and best fights are down to him as welli love super hero stories because it is the great metaphor for the scientific age we are now gods and we have to choose to make the world better or maybe we can spend our time caring about whether we have cool clothes and an ipodhaving read the original movie script online i can see the difference between the final product and the original it is a pity they didnt put as much time or effort into x2,fantasy
i first saw hugh jackman on the london stage in oklahoma  this guy is extremely talented in all aspects of acting singing and dancing at the highest level his performance in bfo was outstanding and he won the much coveted tony award for his outstanding performance together with other awards  the fred astaire award for dancing for example he was also nominated for the lawrence olivier award for oklahomahowever i digress  i was only able to obtain a dvd player last xmas and my son gave me quite a stack of films to watch with all top notch actors however knowing i did like science fiction he pointed out that i would really enjoy and 2 so i thought okay i will watch that first  after all patrick stewart was in it well i nearly fell off my chair  rubbed my eyes  and watched all over again there large as life was hugh jackman in a film shows you how dozy i was i had assumed he was a stage actor visiting england and involved in broadway only big mistake i made look what i had been missing for ageswhat a great evening that was for me and i thoroughly enjoyed the film and say that it was very well put together and the stars acted their roles with conviction but hugh jackman with his great talent did more with wolverene  very clever on characterisation is our hugh  and gave us many faces to this character like love humourwith good one liners the tortured mind of not knowing who he was and why he had become the way he was  he made me think that he was in fact a good guy completely taken over by evil but would not quit till he found out who he was and how he would put his life back together again the fighting scenes were excellent but i do hope that the directors out there give him a fair chance  he leaps out of the screen and makes you notice him either with strength or gentleness dramatically pathos  you name itwell off i went and bought as many of his films as i could  which was not easy but i only need paperback heroes and standing room only and i am waiting for his next film which i hope will give him the box office acclaim he so richly deservesi look forward to seeing this young man in some exciting roles that can test his acting strengths  and he will deliver and we will not only have a mega star to watch but a damn handsome fella as welldeadly hedley,fantasy
 is an interesting enough movie but unlike movies like batman and spiderman it has to focus on the whole team leaving individuals slightly downsized there are a few interesting action sequences like at the train station and at the statue of liberty sadly though for a movie about mutants they dont show off their powers much the casting of magneto and xavier was a masterstroke but the other characters just dont work out the same storm is seemingly almost completely ignored and sadly stays the same in the sequeloverall could have been worse could have been much better 275 out of 5,fantasy
im a big fan of everything marvel so i had high hopes for the needless to say it live up to my expectations though apparently not to those of many critics it had its strong points i always enjoy when theres a strong verisimilitude that is the integration of fictional elements into a very real feeling world these were particularly strong with the opening scene as well as senator kellys speech and the special effects were perfectly satisfactory for the filmone issue people may have had was how much more there was of a story and less usage of their powers etc well i feel that the is really more about the human element and the powers are not so much gifts but curses that they have to learn to live with just as the people who are antimutant have to learn to live with mutants if there was one weak point it was the running time but for a potential sagastarter it seems almost perfect not too long just enough to give us a taste and leave us wanting more then swoop in with an exceptional sequel and fulfill our desires i highly recommend this to comic fans and movie fans alike,fantasy
i learnt to read on comics not cartoon for petes sake i can see you rolling your eyes at the statement how can she be objective right well when i learnt they were finally shooting it after talking about it for years i decided i wouldnt go see it a bunch of muscle men and models in tights fighting bad guys around no thanks ive seen batman to me no one could or would make the effort to capture the essence of what set comics apart from others anyway the family spirit within the team the metaphoric crystallization of hatred and intolerance as a defence mechanism thru the mutants storyline deep three dimensional bad guyswhen i saw the trailer i was mildly curious no tights no widely known faces the action seemed reasonable but not designed to overrule the story after i saw it i thanked whatever god is responsible for bryan singer and his remarkable translation of the characters and story on screen sure rogue could kick ass a little more but using her and wolverine to introduce the audience to the mutant world with skepticism and subtlety was a great ideacasting is nearly flawless jackman is tough and expressive with few lines and a rather small part exmodel famke janssen proves yet again she is a real actress who will hopefully explode in x3 as the phoenix stewart and mckellen give life to the memorable old friendsennemies relationship my only regret is halle berry in the part of storm angela bassett would have made a goddess out of the rather simplified movie character in no timeit was believable touching entertaining and left you wanting more what else can you ask from an action moviekudos mr singer,fantasy
as anenthusiast from holland i find that people underestimate the message that something so clearly unrealistic can convey sure the science of it all is nonsense nothing about it is real except for the characters a good writer can take an unrealistic story and turn it in to a reflection on the human condition like orwell and huxley is essentially about racism bitterness the corrupting influence of power and the fact that altruism isnt easy people will not hesitate to judge you before they know you despite your personal efforts the first thing that i liked about the movie was that it succeeded in shedding the comicbook image the characters were neither pretentious nor overthetop they gained a dimension ian mckellens role as the bitter machiavellian mutant is a brilliant creation if you were oppressed wouldnt you try to prevent it from happening again even if that means oppressing or killing someone else ive never been in his shoes but his by any means necessaryattitude is not helping mutantkind let alone the world he is a man who believes in what hes doing because he thinks that if he doesnt the world will never be a safe place for mutants hes not a villain out to conquer the world he thinks hes saving his race i like to think this is a subtle reference to the understandable but utterly counterproductive feud between the israeli and palestinian peoples perhaps a call to end all wars based on historical retaliation hugh jackman is great as the lone man without a past wolverine his snappy oneliners come across even with the bad hair day i also liked the fact that anna paquins rogue is not the token southern belle with the supermanact like in the comic but a shy girl as one would expect being handicapped myself its nice to see a guy in a wheelchair run the show after seeing kevin spacey in the usual suspects bryan singer is my hero the patrondirector of all those who are physically impaired jeanluc eh patrick stewart is the big wise guy its always interesting to see how the bad guys outsmart the greatest psychic in the world too like all characters wheels is just a human being in spite of his aweinspiring feats of mind control now for the embarrassing part storm is supposed to be a leader a badass chick who knifefights and rips out hearts if she has to sorry halle but the oneliners do not work for you that is the only thing i wished they hadnt changed the rest of the adaptation really added depth to the universe of all of the other marvelmovies are eclipsed by this milestone in superherocinema and the sequel was even better,fantasy
mutants with all sorts of powers like lasers that come out of their eyes and claws that come out of their hands are set loose in this fantastic comic book adaptation i would normally yawn at this type of film but i actually really enjoyed it it must have been because i liked the characters in some films the characters just cant be related to so its difficult to enjoy the film has a fantastic cast too with hugh jackman as a fine wolverine and patrick stewart as a fine professor x halle berry is adequate as storm and ian mckellen is a sufficiently malicious magneto it is also worth seeing this film for its climatic action scenes and appealing special effects look out for mystiques transformation powers too all in all i think that bryan singer has done a very good job and has made a very watchable film enjoy 810,fantasy
 possible spoilersi love this film is a great film if you havent seen it yet you have to it is very entertaining and will keep you watching until the end i didnt see this film as soon as it came out i only saw it recently and i loved it hugh jackman is an excellent choice for wolverine and plays him very well its up to him storm halle berry cyclops jeane and dr x to stop magneto toad mystique and sabertooth from turning all the humans on the planet into mutants with the most recent and youngest addition to the i wont tell you what they can doyou can find out for yourselfthe special effects are great especially since its a few years old the plot is really good and if you like this oneyou will like the next,fantasy
this is an awesome ride the movie has great characters and actors to play them ian mckellen as magneto was very good and patrick stewart as professor xavier was a very smart thing on their end to do i think hugh jackman played the role of wolverine to very near perfection ending with the list of characters therethe action is great and the effects are decent they have this one part spoiler here where they pit wolverine against mystique while in logans wolverines form they did that so well however the whole movie is not innocent besides the action and typical profanities in movies today there are some other problems there is some crass mention of male genitalia logan uses one of his claws to give cyclops the finger while this may fly over the heads of many people those who do catch it may have a problem with it toad also has some gross powers like when he throws that stuff jeans face those who know what it is check out its color may get a little queasy knowing just how sticky and strong it is but the biggest problem in my opinion is mystiques figure i know that scientifically speaking this is more sound then what the comics have but she is very nearly totally naked they put on just enough prosthetics and had most of her scenes dark enough so as to get by with pg13 rating barely though so overall i still love this movie its a great actionscififantasy movie fantasy because evolution is an unproven theory and its a bogus theory but just make sure you watch out for the crudities of this movie,fantasy
this movie is much better than i was expecting i thought was going to be some dumb sci fi movie i dont really like sci fi movies but this movie was excellent it was hilarious at times the relationships between the characters was extremely funny and very real life like the way scott cyclops and logan wolverine acted toward each other was outstandingly funny i absolutely loved the movie it is one of my favorite movies i definitely recommend you to watch it and see what you think if this filmi also recommend you to watch x2 also it is very good too only personally i like better the ratings on x2 is higher o well they are both excellent films and i think u should watch them both 8510,fantasy
as you may know from reading my spiderman 2 review i am not very fond of comic books besides batman but i have to admit this movie was okay i am not new to the universe nor have been for a while like i said with two comic book crazed sisters in particularyou cant help but pick up a few things or little shards of information the visual effects were okay i didnt hear much music but for me the plot was a bit dull i was not very fond of the whole mutant thing but now that i have gotten into it more it truly doesnt matter to me i think they could have started it out a bit differently maybe have gotten a better actress for rouge for me the biggest error was the newer incorrect toad and the bobbyrouge romance also im not saying halle berry is a horrible actress but she just wasnt the right one for storm the best actor choices were patrick stewart and ian mckellen i love seeing scenes with both of those brilliant actors in them overall out of ten id give this movie a seven the best thing i can say about this is that most of the errors go away when you see ian mckellen play our favorite villain magneto,fantasy
in the year 2000 the comic book movie was all but dead the but being the blade movies  director joel schumacher in making the spectacular flop of batman and robin had seemingly doomed the genre  but a new champion arose a marvel champion in the form of director bryan singers long had marvel been bequeathed the short end of the stick with dc comics making all the successful movies  the box office success of opened the doors to sequels adaptations of spiderman the hulk daredevil the fantastic four punisher and spurred dcs efforts to revive its ailing batman and superman franchises singer more of an arthouse filmmaker than a commercial one had assembled an all but perfect cast to play his legendary comic book characters patrick stewart a personal favourite since i count myself a diehard trekker as professor xavier the mutant who sought cooperation ian mckellen soon to play gandalf as his opposite number magneto who believed mutants must make their own way breakout star hugh jackman as wolverine haunted by flashes of his unknown past anna paquin as rogue the girl for whom physical interaction with others was impossible famke janssen as jean grey xaviers telekinetic right hand james marsden as cyclops the brave field commander of the bruce davison as the misguided mccarthyite senator kelly who saw the light before his end rebecca romijn as magnetos henchman mystique and perhaps the only fly in the ointment halle berry as weather god storm and for all of this is only an average film  it isnt nearly as actionheavy as most comic book movies and it is burdened by introducing so many characters  i rate it a 710 but for all its flaws it revolutionized the comic book movie genre making the making of greater films like its sequel x2 possible,fantasy
in a year where these type of films have become common place has taken the cake as one of the best films of its genre a movie based upon a television showa few things about stood out as awesome the first was the actors are wellsuited for their roles patrick stewart looks the part of professor x hugh jackman makes me think we have found a second russell crowe and ian mckellan is truly devilish as magnetothe second thing were the special effects and the way they lifted the movie from good to extraordinary the moves pulled off by mckellan the appearing steps as the villains walk from one side to the other blew me awaythe plot is nothing new but the action sequences and special effects are truly two reasons to seei was impressed with hugh jackman because he reminds me of another actor who by coincidence looks a lot like russell crowe jackman has similar qualities as crowe such as integrity and honesty in his performancejackman showcased his true talent in his breakthrough performance in i must say that he stole the show from his costars jackman a relative newcomer to the land of films will become one of the hottest stars in hollywood real soon jackman is a star who has made a spectacular splash in and whose star has not dipped sinceenjoy this movie to your hearts content,fantasy
one of the best comic book movies created this has since spawned a superior sequel but this really set the scene there is a great bunch of interesting characters played well and in hugh jackman hollywood has a potential new action man who can also act while the action can sometimes not have the punch many fans would like it is still good and fairly big scale but you cant help feel that the makers were reigned in for this outing the story is interesting and the characters are likeable ian mckellan is superb and he makes his lines very memorable with his delivery patrick stewart is perfectly cast and also like mckellan really gives the film a class that many comic book adaptations lack hugh jackman is superb as the charismatic and interesting wolverine while famke janssen and anna paquin also impress many fans may feel disappointed at cyclops miscasting and limited role although he is somewhat rectified in the sequel the ending doesnt quite thrill as much as it could but this is still a worthy movie to watch ,fantasy
the emotionally powerful introduction in the concentration camp is matched by the finale which confirms there was more to this film than just green screen acting and cgi the film deals with the treatment of minorities in democratic societies and this is singers most explicit demonstration of his philosophy magneto is clearly the malcolm x character here and xavier is the robust martin luther king the finale scene is pure genius and heres why before this film neither actor ian mckellen and patrick stewart knew how to play chess singer hired a local chess master to teach them  in order to symbolize xaviers superiority over his rival he employs whats known as a pawn assault gaining check mate using only his weakest piece  singers mastery of the technical and emotional side of the story is the key to this films success,fantasy
the last well acted scifi movie was in 81 with blade runner x man though the story is predictable offers a delight to the viewer thirsty for quality the special effect are mere accessory to the director every picture are perfectly painted action sustained special effect credible actors beautiful cinematography exquisite lack of good music thoughquality comparable to ai interpretation a little less academic than ai which makes the film very interesting until the endcant wait for x man iii this time ill see it in theater,fantasy
having never seen a comic book adaptation at the cinema i settled into my seat and expected a few hours of pretty soul less antics many had tried to put one over the greatest comic book movie of all time superman the movie but where that film had heart verisimilitude and great effects most of the others only seemed to succeed at the great effects part how this presumption was shattered right from the get go it calmly faded in to a world war 2 camp and we see eric magneto as a child using his powers the look of horror on the faces of the army men is subtle yet brilliant then we go to the present day and the film just gets better and better with wolverine we have one of the best movie characters of all time hugh jackman is absolutely superb anna paquin is wonderful too playing a teenager whos tormented by her changing bodily functionssomething everyone can relate to when growing up overall this movie simply kicks ass i came out of the cinema and it was the first time i had ever left the auditorium and wanted to walk straight back in for the next showing it was that good since the release many have complained that the action scenes dont really deliverbut the beauty of this film is that first and foremost it makes you care for the characters when these are put in the tiniest bit of peril you want them to succeed so although the set pieces may not be as hard core as some people had liked it didnt really need them to be and when you take into consideration that the budget wasnt exactly large it shows that the director had his priorities right 5 stars out of five,fantasy
this is really a fun film much better than i had expected it to be when i first saw previews at theatres after spiderman had really impressed me and i had learned that had a ranking of 73 on imdb i decided to give it a chance well it paid unbelievable that this was done by the same director who also made trainspotting the characters were very believable for comic characters and the story was quite thrilling anyway if hollywood listened to what i say id tell them to stop here and not continue the recent comic bookmovieoverkill unfortunately hollywood never listened to what i said,fantasy
i know im probably in the minority with this view but i found the original movie more enjoyable than the second outing i find it better because of the introduction to all the characters and a more rounded storyline when one of the lead characters bites the dust at the end of the second movie i couldnt help thinking that theyll be back in x3 so why should i really careanyway back to which is set in the present day and focuses on a new breed of humans who have mutant powers the mutations take various forms which means the mutants have just about every power you could imagine the normal humans are somewhat uncomfortable and take the forlorn decision to marginalise the mutants the mutants themselves are split into two bands the goodies being led by xavier patrick stewart and the baddies led by magneto ian mckellen most of the action is focussed on wolverine weaving and the film is good fun 810,fantasy

i love this series of comic books and i was not disappointed with the movie although the character development i had hoped would be rich was almost nonexistent and there wasnt enough movie here to satisfy it is 104 minutes long and needed to be at least two hours to enable some decent character development while they tried they fell short of what i would deem acceptable in this areaother than that this movie was very well done the action sequences were rousing the portrayals given were a good start in the right direction the direction itself proved to be inspired and the sets were creativethis whole production was executed in a manner which lent the darkling feel of mystery captured in the comic book and some aweinspiring cgeye candy sequences made this film appear to be more than it should have beenthe casting is one element which gave this movie its incredible success but the effects and story were the products of a great and loving care devoted to the production of this movie and it shows with each and every scene this is a classic good vs evil story with some romance loads of action a great story and wonderful creative characters it is pure scifiaction fanboy delightlet me also say that i highly recommend the 15 edition with over 5 hours of features interviews and exclusive new extras it is a bargain at the asking priceit rates an 8210 fromthe fiend ,fantasy
adapted from the most popular comic book on the planet and starring two shakespearian actors a virtually unknown australian and directed by a man better known for a dark edgy crime thriller this really shouldnt be good but it is in fact it is fantastic from beginning to end bryan singer makes what has to be one of the best comic book adaptations to hit the screen in years perhaps the finest since tim burton brought batman to the screen in 1989 what works so well here are the factors that should bring the film crashing down hugh jackman as wolverine is fantastic showing what a great star he could make his perfect american accent and the wonderful dark edge mixed in with humor and sincerity for rogue make him the most perfect choice for the characterin fact casting here is perfect which is a miracle for a comic book that is not made up of one primary superhero like superman batman and spiderman are is an ensemble and singer casts actors perfectly in their parts patrick stewart is undeniably the only actor who could play professor x likewise ian mckellen as magneto anna paquin shows what a talent she can be in her more older years as marierogue while famke janssen adds the glamorous as doctor jean grey the remaining x men characters of scottcyclops and monroestorm are played well enough by james marsden and halle berry but dont really get a chance to shine in the same way as the others do mainly due to the fact that the script has to accommodate so many characters but thats why this film works so well singer and writer david hayter have saw fit not to bombard the film with action sequences and flashy special effects they let the characters come to life have the audience care for them and when they have done that then they bring out the action in the shape of the statue of liberty finaleas the first part of a movie series works a wonderful treat the script is strong the acting is first class and bryan singers direction of the actors is fantastic as are his visual touches which are very similar to comic book framing actors are film to one side of the frame while the remainder is taken up with the background touches like this show what a great director he is visually even better the action is brilliantly handled the liberty finale features a storming fight sequence between logan and shapeshifter mistique who has taken the form of logan himself it is a fun sequence that is also grippingscarcely a foot is put wrong in this superb film which ranks as one of my favorite comic book adaptations,fantasy
i just watched this for the third time and it still manages to impressa great script strong characters and a very powerful underlying message makes this so much more than your usual 2 dimensional comic book adaptationsthe fact that the good and evil characters are so blurred is the key to the success of this film and its sequels special effects dont rule this film they simply allow the characters to really performhopefully the producers will recognise the reasons for this films success and not lose the darkness in endless sequels based on big stars and silliness batman anyoneoverall a huge thumbs up here,fantasy
its a big nice and funny mistake in the end of the movie a goof never mentioned by nobody its big because it came against all the action of the movie its nice because its a mistake made by the producers and the writers  same kind as the heroes of the movie  ordinary people make to x  men and its funny because no fan of this movie  and the team  did not discovered all the movie its based on the evil actions of magneto his power and his casque which block xavier to read his mind and also the movie its based on the idea that ordinary people treat as ordinary people well the are not professor charles xavier can read minds magneto seems to have same powers so they cannot play chess chess its minds sport each player cannot build a strategy in chess because the other can see what is in his mind however its a very good movie ,fantasy
this is a pretty decent film though i probably wouldnt have enjoyed it so much without having seen the second one first  director bryan singer tries too hard to explain the characters to what he must assume is a very confused audiencefor example after mystique has already established that shes a shapeshifter by doing exactly that magneto mocks senator kelly by smirking ive had mystique here to keep you company  she takes so many shapes  this isnt really necessaryand im speaking as someone who knew next to nothing about the  the other issue i have with this film is that sabretooth is boring and wolverine is an irritating jerk  yes i know hes supposed to bebut couldnt he have been rude without being so annoying  all in all its a halfway decent movienot nearly as great as x2 which focuses on plot rather than backstory,fantasy
 succeeds where so many other movies that are based on comic books fail they dont stay true to the original story or look although this is hard to do with a film bryan singer and the cast of have done it may not feature all of the but those that do make it to the screen do not fail to impress the best mutant and best acting by far is by wolverine as played by hugh jackman jackman makes the character his own and i cant see anyone else playing the role halle berry famke janssen ian mckellen and patrick stewart all turn in flawless performances lending depth to their characters without decending into camp the special effects are dazzling and the cinematography helps make this film candy for the eyes with the success and quality of its sequel and no end in sight i smell a franchise on the way bottom line is a great movie hands down you need to have this in your collection if you like comic books or actionscifi movies,fantasy
bryan singer and an exceptional cast far exceed my expectations with this big screen translation of the famous comic at first i had serious doubts about the look the actors and the script but once i saw the movie i realized that certain aspects of the comic had to be sacrificed for the story to be believably set in film in our reality yellow spandex wouldnt workas cleverly pointed out in the movie ian mckellen while my favorite actor wasnt my first choice however he excels at his role as alwaysif everyone wanted this movie to exactly mirror the comic then it should have been a cartoon as it is this was supposed to be real life and certain realities had to be maintained all in all an excellent movie that far surpassed my expectations cheers to the cast and crew,fantasy
this movie was awsome hugh jackman made an great woverine he rocks ive watched this movie 10 times and im not tired yet of it i think the 2 one will be even better,fantasy
and of course it would be the wear leather suits  the story focuses on wolverine hugh jackman a mutant being recruited to the a trained mutant superhero team by prof xavier patrick stewart  their enemy magneto ian mckellan an allpowerful mutant who is trying to end all human life in america not only makes a good action movie but a highlyemotional drama wolverine is confused about his past rogue anna paquin is confused about her future the entirety of this movie isnt action but dramagreat stylish comic book film 810,fantasy
heres the concept to make a good blockbuster dont use your story as an excuse to flaunt your special effects budget use your special effects budget to help tell your story bryan singer the director of the cool 90s neonoir the usual suspects must understand this  because his adaptation is one of the finest superhero flicks ever made the classic characters and strong performances give the movie much of its zing  dig hugh jackmans instastar turn as wolverine  and help elevate it above the rest of the bigbudget pack,fantasy
i give this movie an 8  i give it credit for being the first movie to get the public into comic book movies again  what about batman  batman was followed up by a string of such lousy sequels i think it the whole franchise eventually annoyed people and it wound up hurting the genre rather than helping it  made these movies fun againi think it was a good movie but it was a little bit too short and i still wish they didnt have a generation gap between characters that isnt supposed to exist  the whole concept of having a machine that makes mutants was a little silly toothe good points of this movie far outweigh the bad and there is a lot of great acting  hugh jackman was born to play wolverine  i am looking forward to seeing more of these movies in the future and will be one of the first people in line for the 3rd movie,fantasy
stan lees adaptation of the famous comic book series has come to life in bigger ways than ever imagine throughout the years the like any of the marvel comics have touched people in a way that we recognized discrimination as mutants they are discriminated for who they are without people giving them a chance to live in societythe film starts in poland of 1942 the beginning of the holocaust where as many of the jews are being sentenced to live in concentration camps to die a young boy by the name of eric discovers that he can control metallic objects with his own hands as he tries to reunite with his parents but after years of being torture and escaping the holocaust he grows up to be magneto an older eric played by ian mckellan who wants to tell his old friend and rival charles xavier patrick stewart that he wants to destroy mankind after what humanity has down to him and those of generationslater on through the film fans are introduced through the following characters wolverine hugh jackman storm halle berry cyclops james marsden jean gray famke janssen rogue anna paquin sabertooth tyler mane mystique rebecca rojimn stamos and todd ray parkthe film itself plays true to the comic book where mutants are fighting to survive in a world of prejudice and anger professor charles xavier patrick stewart is the head of westchester academy a school for the gifted and talented but a school for the young who have special mutant powers from a girl who can walk through walls a boy who can manipulate with fire and another student who can turn objects into ice his former students storm cyclops and jean gray assist professor xavier in teaching those kids who cant afford to be taught by normal people professor xavier also takes in a new student rogue paquin who was abandoned and taken in by wolverine newcomer hugh jackman who was attacked by one of magnetos own mutant named sabertooth mane yet xavier makes a promise to wolverine that he will do whatever it can to find out what magneto wants with himmagneto mckellan has his own team called the brotherhood consisting of evil mutants mystique toad and sabertooth where he wants to kill all those who treated humanity evil especially sen kelly bruce davidson who wants to run the registration on mutants where they would be targeted down to deaththe film itself is incredible the cast is hot and i was glad to see that somebody brought the idea of to live and with all of the actors being true to the characters,fantasy
excellentgoodfairpooras a fan of the i was joyed to see these characters up on the big screen but as a movie fan i was disappointed what disappointed me is that this film is only an introduction to the characters and the world nothing more the plot is good for magnetos first scheme but the film really has no moments the only moments are its characters there is no moment that captures the imagination of its audience all that the film is is an introduction as a fan i enjoyed it but as a movie fan i didntrating 2 stars,fantasy
as i said in my spiderman review making a film based on a comic book is like shooting yourself in the foot  do you cater to the guys who not only know all thes storylines they also know the issue the artist the writer and all the personal stats with given staff  or do you cater to the guys whove never heard of theusually the best bet is to shoot somewhere in the middle    give just enough for newcomers to grasp the plot and characters and lace the rest of the film with subtleties and references that the hardcore fans will pick up on  this is where the film falls and bryan singer has found a pretty good blend of the twothe other major issue is changing things while crossing over from one media to another  films dont have the luxury liberty and scope a comic book universe has  liberties have been taken with the world some a little disappointing rogues inability to fly and strength sabretooths role while others are appropriate we dont have yellow and blue spandex outfits  typically things have been left alone wherever the filmmakers can get away with it on this mediumthe casting was very well done  though people i didnt like ironically are for characters i never liked cyclops for example  ray park surprisingly makes toad an interesting character even though ive never really cared much for his character enough to read too deep into his character jackman mckellen stewart jensen fill their roles well  i personally loved seeing the live action standoffs between old friendsrivals magneto and xavier ive always been fascinated with that conflict for some reason and it is very accurately reportrayed for the filmbryan singers direction and visual style while definitely comicbook oriented its not campy or cheesy  its surreal but its as though the real world is only tinted to a slightly different perspective unlike batman and robin where the spectrum is screwed over and the word camp is practically written across the screen the full 2 hoursspecial effects are pretty decent mutant powers pretty well accounted for though not to the extent as they are in the books    but again different medium  the plot i think all people can pick up on and i think hardcore fans can see these characters playing it outand music provided by veteran composer michael kamen whose themes surrounding magneto rogue wolverine cerebro are haunting with a romantic flair that few composers can tap into  kamen really taps into the heart of the conflicts and doesnt go overboard with a cheesy theme  its heroic but not over the topoverall this production does really good with what it has  definitely worth looking into  the only real flaw i have with the film is the kiddie nature of iti have claws that come out of my hands but i never really kill anyone with em and you never really see any blood  kinda like the old ateam shows where thered be lots of gunfights but no one ever gets shot  make the movie for adults and itd be as perfect as a comic book film can get,fantasy
having now spawned a hit sequel the first so it has been said of many more the original film possesses a solid balance of action sequences and wellrounded characterisation  director bryan singer has cleverly crafted the story as an allegory for prejudice and racism that still exists in modern americathe film begins in world war ii in a nazi concentration camp where a young boy segregated from his parents by german soldiers causes hysteria when he discovers an ability to manipulate and weld metal with his bare handsflash forward into the near future and the us senate is debating a motion detailing the segragation of mutants  human beings born with special abilities or powers  overseeing this debate is professor charles xavier patrick stewart an aged telepath who believes that mutants and humans can peacefully coexist  the good professor runs a school where young mutants learn to develop and control their unique abilities  also keeping watch is his old friend erik lensherrmagneto ian mckellen  magneto does not share the professors beliefs and is all too aware of the corruption and cruelty of the human race as experienced during his time as child prisoner of the nazis  in this he devises an ingenious plan which he hopes will teach humanity a lessonthe storyline and writing are excellent taking the professor and magneto as two individuals conceiving two vastly different solutions to the same problems of fear and prejudice  where as the professor believes in a peaceful resolution and contented coexistence the bitter magneto practices hate and revenge  loosely tied in with this is the role politics plays in creating the kind of atmosphere and social climate that produces individuals like magneto  the story is carefully laid out and structured and the ending leaves more than one loose thread hanging for tying up in future filmsthe performances in the film are all enjoyable and distinctive  patrick stewart is quietly dignified as the professor and ian mackellen gives a very sympathetic portrayal of magneto  you do feel for him in spite of his actions  australian hugh jackman plays wolverine who heals fast and sprouts slashing metal blades from his hands  wolverine is a hardbitten but sympathetic loner with a mysterious past who functions as the films answer to han solo providing a line in both sex appeal and wisecracking humour  anna paquin is rogue who can drain the life out of anyone she touches  paquin conveys well the confused and vulnerable aspects of this characterother notable characters include famke janssen as telepathic jean grey and rebecca romjinstamos as seductive chameleonic mutant mystique although we could have explored james marsdens cyclops and ray parks toad a little bit more  star wars fans will be quick to spot a nod to parks turn as darth maul in the phantom menace in this moviespecial effects and action sequences are kept restrained but good setpieces include a fight in a bar a sequence at a train station and the finale atop the statue of liberty  the sequences make good and convincing use of flomo and cgi effectsalong with spiderman released two years later this is a fine modern example of how to make a fantasy action picture entertaining and exciting without compromising the need for characterisation  a pity this films sequel did not follow its predecessors example,fantasy
do you know i think if bryan singer named his recent film x2 x1 no one would have cared because if truth be known x2 is far better and superior to the original i think both fan boys and cinema goers in general would agree with me on that one if not im so sorryso anyway i think the major flaw is the same thing i had problems with the matrix reloaded you cant win my praise with cool special effects because that was the only good thing abouti dont see why every comic book film must start at the very beginning just to do introduce everyone what are those misty corners in the background for flashbacks ha ha ha ha i am only jokinga weak film room for improvement and boy did they improve610,fantasy
having never seen a comic book adaptation at the cinema i settled into my seat and expected a few hours of pretty soul less antics many had tried to put one over the greatest comic book movie of all time superman the movie but where that film had heart verisimilitude and great effects most of the others only seemed to succeed at the great effects part how this presumption was shattered right from the get go it calmly faded in to a world war 2 camp and we see eric magneto as a child using his powers the look of horror on the faces of the army men is subtle yet brilliant then we go to the present day and the film just gets better and better with wolverine we have one of the best movie characters of all time hugh jackman is absolutely superb anna paquin is wonderful too playing a teenager whos tormented by her changing bodily functionssomething everyone can relate to when growing up overall this movie simply kicks ass i came out of the cinema and it was the first time i had ever left the auditorium and wanted to walk straight back in for the next showing it was that good since the release many have complained that the action scenes dont really deliverbut the beauty of this film is that first and foremost it makes you care for the characters when these are put in the tiniest bit of peril you want them to succeed so although the set pieces may not be as hard core as some people had liked it didnt really need them to be and when you take into consideration that the budget wasnt exactly large it shows that the director had his priorities right 5 stars out of five,fantasy
i didnt know what to epectfrom this film i was never sure if i liked it or not it just seemed like it couldve flowed better  other comic book movies like first 3 superman movies and the first 2 batman films blow out of the water but isnt all that badit has several good parts,fantasy
 out of i used to be an avid reader of the comics  every month id dash to the comic book store eager to purchase the newest issues the had two running series of this clashing team of mutants  like everyone else i had my favorite characters wolverine for his interesting antihero but honorable qualities and psylocke who simply oozed sex appeal intelligence and could alternately kick any guys ass in handtohand combat  what more could you want from a ladybut i wasnt completely sold on the movie when i first heard of it particularly with unknown hugh jackman in the lead so it was with cautionary anticipation i approached this film  hell i was so cautious i didnt even see it until it came out on dvd but in the end this was an enjoyable hourandahalf diversion and probably the best comic book to film adaptation since tim burtons batmanas expected spends a large portion of its running time as a setup for both its characters and future plotlines  but for those curious patrick stewart stars as professor charles xavier virtually the worlds most powerful mutant with the ability to read and control minds  he heads a school to teach other mutants to develop their powers the heads of the classes being cyclops james marsden jean grey famke janssen and storm halle berry  two newcomers arrive after an attack in the woods logan aka wolverine hugh jackman and rogue anna paquin  their enemy is magneto a powerful mutant who wishes to make the world a place safe for mutants even if it means the destruction of the human racealmost all comic book adaptations are actionadventures and while certainly qualifies as such many might be surprised that the movie spends more time developing its characters than placing them in dangerous situations  i was pleasantly surprised and given that these characters were interesting the pacing never flagged and the buildup to the actionpacked finale kept the film moving with surging momentumin a movie like this the cast is probably the most important aspect of the production and the two most important characters to cast were professor xavier and wolverine  screw up casting these two roles and the whole movie might have been in jeopardy  but thankfully the producers didnt screw up and these two parts were casted perfectly  patrick stewart makes for an honorable and gentle xavier exactly the way everyone imagined he would be its not as if though casting stewart was ever question of if but when he actually looks like xavier  hugh jackman is the real find totally cool and badass as wolverine but also with a downtoearth quality that makes him so appealing  i think were all glad production on mi2 ran overlong or else wed have seen dougray scott in this partthough i did mention the film spent most of its time developing the characters the fact the cast is so large leaves a lot of them adrift most particularly james marsden as cyclops and halle berry as storm  janssen is a passable jean grey though she seems a bit too old for the part  anna paquin however is very good as rogue a teen who finds herself coming to terms with her powers  she and logan have this daughterfather relationship going which means she also has the double role of the character jubilee whos actually nowhere to be seen which might be a good thing i recall she was incredibly annoying in the comicsthe villains dont fare as well each of them barely given any dialogue except for magneto  as the master of the metal ian mckellen is fine but looks hilariously silly in that costume and helmet of his  tyler mane has the physique for the part of sabretooth thats about it  ray park has the role of toad whos a bit different from how i remember him in the comics didnt he secrete gunk from his hands but its only slightly less lame rebecca romjinstamos is in blue makeup for all her screentime as the shapeshifting mystiquethe action sequences are exciting without ever being truly memorable  in fact some of the fight scenes could have been staged and filmed a bit better but its understandable why filming such fights would have been difficult considering these mutants battle with a variety of powers  the wirework during the wolverinesabretooth battle islacking maybe a little too matrixish for my tastesthe only real problem i have and its a biggie with is how unbelievably short it is  most comic book adaptations focus on one character and run for over two hours  this ones got over a dozen and its barely an hourandahalf sans credits long  too much feels left out too much is left unfinished but i guess thats why we have sequels,fantasy
i did enjoy this film but looking back now i feel it was some what disappointing the special effects are great but the major flaw in this film i think is the script it didnt quite excite as much as it should have the casting was correct in my view they all did a good job with what they had luckily the sheer popularity on comic book films has helped this film get a follow up and what a follow up it was6510,fantasy
ive never been an insane fan of the i did like it i watched the saturday morning cartoon and had some of the videogames and a few of the comics overall i was more of a batman fan but this film certainly has made me enjoy the moreit wasnt until earlier this year that i came to like this movie see when i first saw it in the theaters and pretty much everything in the film had been shown to me from numerous making of specials in tv and i was angry because i beleved a rumor that there was 45 minutes taken out of the film so i thought the film was ok but over the years i saw this movie in the theater once again and then a few times on video i finally bought it on dvd and then it all clicked on how to look at this film this film is basically a semiserious scifi film using comic book materialwhen the film first came out it was kind of odd to see such serious themes of prejudice and love triangles in comic book films but with the new wave of comic book films like spiderman and daredevil applying real human themes to people with superpowers isnt odd anymorenow when i watch this film i notice how good it actually is the fact that it can even balance and hold so many lead characters is a marvel no pun intended the actors were supurb and in the little suttle things they did we could tell so much about their characters there are no onesided characters for those who look i give most credit to anna paquin who portrayed the sad story of rouge who do to her powers would never be able to physically touch anyone againi also love how the film is filled with unexpected cameos from other mutants you can have a lot of fun trying to guess if that girl with the yellow coat in the background is jubilee or if that fat kid is the blob should be credited with not only being the film that started the new wave of comic book movies but also as one of the most entertaining films to be based off a graphic novel,fantasy
i didnt see this movie in the theaters when it was first released and now i am so regret i didnt see it at the movies  this movie has so many special effects that it would have been a lot better if i would have gone to see it in the movies  anyways i rented this movie like a year after its release and i totally blew me awayi have always been a fan of the series the old ones evolution is kinda stupid so i know quite a bit about the story line and the characters and this movie didnt disappoint me one bit  it is very well written and the characters are portrayed excellent  especial mention to sir ian mckellen whose performance of magneto was the most convincing performance in the whole movie  patrick stewart was excellent too the director of casting did a great job nobody could have done that role better than him hugh jackman was pretty good as wolverine too just like in the comics a bada guy with a bad attitude but with good intentions  anna pakin was great as rogue too she was still insecure of her abilities and she shows her emotions fear insecurity very well  james marsden was ok as cyclops he could have done way better though  i was a little dissapointed not to see some of my favorite in the movie like gambit thus movie would have been even better if gambit would have been in the story  well the plot is great the dialogs are even better some people say they were cheesy i really dont think so or maybe it was that the performance was so good that i dont even noticed  the music was very good too and also the directionwell i definitely loved this movie its one of the greatest movies that come from a comic especial mention to superman i  ii batman i  ii and spiderman  this is a mustsee whether you have seen or read the comics before i highly recommend everybody to see it 12 out of ,fantasy
before the blockbuster release of spiderman in 2002 the marvel classic comic came to the big screen this is a good movie that tells us the origin of several members of the it deals with the fact that these mutants are outcast from society and considered dangerous second class citizens by the majority of the nonmutant society while really they are just people trying to cope with their differences and trying to make it in an unaccepting world throw in a couple of bad guys and it makes for some good action not only do the have to fight society but fellow mutants that have chosen the use their powers against society i only have a minimal knowledge of the comics but from what i can tell their transition to the big screen is pretty successful the actors all play their roles well and the story is interesting enough to hold your interest between the special effects and action scenes  out of 4,fantasy
this is an intriguing moviethe adaptation from the series is disrespectful the script is poor the production awkward at times overall everything is a little stupidand surprisingly all this ends up into a nicely entertaining movie which leaved me with an impression of quality and dignity how the hellwell its another demonstration that good direction bryan singer is definitely an excellent filmmaker with a good cast may compensate for poorly written movies think about the line america was going to be a land of tolerance of peace  a stupid cliche that would have sounded dumb in many mouths but then in ian mckellens mouth it sounds great what an actor and the rest of the cast is brilliant too with the exception of hale berry portraiting a very little convincing tornade this girl is beautiful and very sympathetic but she simply shouldnt actthe magic of singer and his actors craftsmanship turned into a finally very nice movie what would have been total crap in the hands of some of hollywood filmmakers well done,fantasy
i was satisfied when i saw i was expecting more but was satisfied with this first live action film just for once i wish they would just say to hell with it and make it a rated r flick like it should be why because most of the time pg13 action can get rather boring for example when wolverine fought mystiquethe longest fight in the entire movie it didnt have that impact as in the comics but the sequences appeared rather slow and dull its disappointing of how they misrepresented wolverine who in the comic long before he even met the was a warrior and assassin but in the movie as a weak untrained fool the movie started out pretty interesting then it dragged and the ending wasnt that great either i think they shouldve stuck to the original comic team of cyclops beast archangel jean grey iceman and wolverine better to have the original instead of nitpicking and trying to fit in characters who dont even belong in the same place and era like for example rogue who happens to look like a teenager also sir ian m is a little too old to be playing magneto i just hope the sequel will be a major step up with longer more intense fight sequences and less boring chit chat 6 out of 10,fantasy
i may not know a lot about the comic books and its characters but i must say that this movie was pretty sweet  all the characters were just right especially ian mckellan and patrick stewert  this second is going to be even better than the first 8 out of 10,fantasy
i love this movie it is good directed and all actors have great performance in i loved the soundtrack michael kamen is a god he has been made a good music for this movie my favourite mutant is all of them they are so unique and if you love the movie you will love them all the good guys and also the bad guys 10 out of 10,fantasy
 is the longawaited film adaptation of the highly popular marvel comics characters about two rivaling groups of mutants the first group is led by professor charles xavier patrick stewart he is a sort of humanitarian as he believes that there is a way for mutants to coexist peacefully with normal humans without the threat of violence who have since come to fear them he runs an academy where mutants come to learn and control their extraordinary powers the other group of mutants is led by erik magnus lensharr aka magneto ian mckellan magneto who is a survivor of the world war ii holocaust believes that mutants should rise up against the oppressive and fearful human population who resent him and other mutants like him the films main plot revolves around two new mutants the first is logan better known as wolverine hugh jackman who carries a longburning hate for the world as he is also the font of intense anger and his primary weapons are razorsharp claws that come out of his hands the other is rogue anna paquin who can absorb the powers of other mutants and has run away from home after a particularly disturbing incident with her boyfriend some of the other mutants include jean grey famke janssen who has the ability to read minds storm halle berry who can control the weather cyclops james marsden who wears a visor to control the powerful beam of energy that is emitted from his eyes sabretooth tyler mane who has highly feral instincts toad ray park who gets his name from his abnormally long tongue and green skin color and mystique rebecca romijnstamos who can alter her shape at will remains to be an astonishing adaptation of the comic book though i have never read the comic books i grew up on the animated tv series video games and memorabilia such as trading cards and action figures bryan singer the usual suspects shows here that he is a truly great film maker and i am looking forward to the sequel that is going to be released on may 2910,fantasy
as a fan of i was very surprised at how good it was after seeing how much they changed the costumes and which they were using and how they pretty much changed the real comic history i was a little nervous but this movie blew me away it had great acting especially from hugh jackman who nailed wolverine dead on great special effects and a thought provoking story what i liked about this too was the fact that the bad guy wasnt a true bad guy magneto though a true villain wasnt like your joker or green goblin or anything like that he wanted equality though he wanted it in a very foreceful way he wanted everyone to be equal in a land of intolerance it was a great way to set up the saga of the it wasnt like your regular comic movies where its part of the movie discovering the powers of these characters and the rest is nonstop action this story has the action but more story telling and drama than anything bryan singers approach was great and i am anxiously awaiting x2 next month thusfar this one seems great and has a very thought provoking story next to the original tim burton batman movie has to be the best comic movie ever made,fantasy
along with spiderman the first superman 1978 and first batman 1989 movies is one of the best of the comic books to have been successfully adapted to the big screen the cast was well chosen especially hugh jackman who perfectly portrays wolverine after having viewed the trailer for 2 im marking may 2 2003 down on my calendar,fantasy
good superhero action movie that introrduces the great things cgi can do for the genretries to stay true to the comic but could have done better in this departmentalso the rogue character was not well portrayed and some costumes could have been done better like wolverine and magnetoalsothere was not enough minutes 90 min as this great comic book story needed more time to be told properystilla good movie overall and a great teaser for the new things coming for this movie genre due to cgi technology only for fans of the genre and big fans of the lead actors,fantasy
 is by far my favorite movie i myself was never a big fan i knew a few facts but i never really watched the show or read the comics bryan singer has done an excellent job with mixing the comic book world with our world making it near believable keep in mind that this movie was not solely made for thecomic book fanatic but also for the general public such as myself however there are people out there who will be pissy and nitpick at every little detail has also evolved over the years so they cant complain that every little thing isnt consistant this is just another link in thes evolution the actors picked for the parts were amazing who could have been a better cast you couldnt picture any other actors playing these parts the movie was excelent i have watched it again and again and i have only spotted one flaw i am very anxious to see the second one this movie is a mustsee for anyone,fantasy
everything about this movie makes me want more that and the fact that the running time is a little over 90 minutes the characters are wonderfully cast with the possible exceptions of hugh jackman and halle berry special effects were excellent script was decent for a comic book film my favorite line  i thought you lived in a school makes me laugh every time cant wait for the sequel,fantasy
this is diffenietly the best comic book turned movie ever the characters are great especially wolverine sabertooth and toad this has some of the best special effects i have ever seen the acting is very good the actor who plays wolverine is really good and should be in more movies i am really glad they are making a new one but i cant wait till they have apocalypse in an movie and also have juggernaut in one too but this is a great movie and i recommend this movie to anyone who likes action movies even if you dont know anything about the comic book you will stay love this movie,fantasy
this movie is one of the reasons why marvel is on a roll stan lee is a genius and bryan singer is at his best hugh jackman and patrick stewart were perfect for their roles i just cant wait to see the sequel im a bit disappointed though that none among archangel havoc and gambit wont be on it maybe on x3 i hope so,fantasy
while this movie isnt anywhere near faithful to the comic book it delivers and keep the spirit of the comic book in mind  and that is what truely matters  there is no way on earth that someone can translate the comic book over exactly without alienating large parts of the masses or making a completly stupid looking movie see some of the 80s marvel movies if you have your doubts  i assure you those will be hours of your life you will never get back  good job singer keep up the good work you have my full confidence that you will deliver on x 2,fantasy
 is a very entertaining adaptation of the comic book cartoon series with appeal for fans and nonfans alike the film isnt as bright or exuberant as i thought it would be but it does keep you thoroughly entertained for its 95 minute running time the cast works well together for the most part patrick stewart is the most obvious pic for professor xavier and does a good job bringing some class to the film sir ian mckellen is brilliant as thes archenemy magneto newcomer hugh jackman closely resembles the hero of the bunch wolverine and manages to be a superhero without wearing yellow spandexstrangely i imagined someone older like meryl streep or jessica lange in the role of storm as she did look middleaged in the comic thankfully halle berry is a very welcome addition taking on the role of the character anna paquin is the teenage heroine rogue she doesnt look like much of a heroine and is more suited to the melodrama genre but she does well in her role im not going into any more detail on the rest of the but they were all pretty good in their contributions the film tries a bit too hard to avoid camp while it was very enjoyable it could have been a bit better if it was more colourful much of the film was taking up with introducing the characters so the end battle scene was only a taste of what will come in the sequel x2 which is due out later this year aims for a lower note of popularity than spiderman and superman did but its still every bit as enjoyable at an hour and a half the film is a bit short but what the film is good at well overshadows its minor faults overall is a great and distractive little movie definitely the best blockbuster of summer 2001 very enjoyable highly entertaining effortlessly rewatchable what else can i say 7410,fantasy
the is great motion picture entertainment with its restrained pacing and devotion to character development it also moves beyond mere entertainment and explores deeper issues such as tolerance for the most part the special effects are convincing an exception is a scene where a ship landing on water clearly appears to be a model the cast is first rate but jackmans wolverine clearly steals the show now that halle berry has become a bigger star her role in the sequel will no doubt be expended my favorite scenes were the philsophical exchanges between stewarts xavier and mackellans magneto this movie was great on the big screen but the impressiveness of its panoramas and special effects diminish somewhat on dvd even on a big screen tv still a terrific movie that provides more than escapist entertainment 810,fantasy
based from a comic book and i just want said well done to bryan singer to make this movie alive with powerful visual effect when i saw this movie and the entire movie looks like it focus on wolverinehugh jackman and prof xpatrick stewart thought that magnetoian mckellenwant wolverine but in the end it show something else that i even did think about it a good visual effect after spiderman and well cast and i hopefully the sequel will be better than the first one and i gave this movie 810,fantasy
a usual action where in the end the bad guys get what they deserve but still not a total waste of time if it is taken as simple entertainment movie then ok but films based on comic books will never get more than few points from me,fantasy
i thought this was all in all a good movie i managed to get to see the premier when it came out i now own and have watched it many of timesthe good hugh jackmen as woleverine good job in choosing a nobody patrick stwert as xavierand also sir ian and magneto the special effects were great and the fact that if you know the comics they show alot of characters from the comics as kind of cameos andor minor partsthe bad using rogue as the jubilee storyjames marsden as cyclops they needed to get someone olderno beast he is one of the original hes also the smartest second to xavier also no gambit a fan favoritealso there werent enough action scenes this made the films pace a little slowall in all this film deserves an 8 of 10 its well executed but has some flaws that could easily in some ways be fixed,fantasy
this is simply one of my favourite films  i love the comics and this is a good representation of them  there are certain things that dont go along with the comics but it shows a bit or originalitybrilliant i think the followup film will be brilliant too  cant wait,fantasy
this movie mainly focuses on wolverine and rogue  cyclops jean grey professor x storm are also present along with a few others doing brief apperances  the villians are magneto mystique sabretooth and toad  as you can see as much as i liked this movie there were quite a few characters and its short running times meant you really couldnt dwell on anyone to long  and as good as this one is the next one sounds as if it will just to many characters period  the people who made this one though were smart enough to focus on wolverine and he was the best character in this one  i was disappointed to see iceman a student at prof xs school seeing as how he is one of the founding members in the comic book but this movie unlike spiderman doesnt really follow the comic book much at all except for their powers and in some cases not even then,fantasy
i have very interesting tastes in movies  but among my favorites is one called is the story of mutants with mainly some sort of psychic ability the story revolves around rogue a runaway who teams up with wolverine rogue as the unique ability that when she touches someones skin she sucks the life force right out of them the evil villain in this scifi movie is magneto who can control metal he plans to make all humans mutantall in all the acting could have used some work but the fact that the story line totally rocked made up for that fact this has been written by marcus little sister not him so if i have stuffed up dont blame him,fantasy
this was a decent movie  there is really no other way of putting it  it wasnt the best it could be but it didnt suck either  it was a good attempt  ill warn you now of possible spoilers listed throughout this reviewwith a sequel being filmed as i right this and a director already in talks for a part three has the makings of a very successful franchise the first was essentially a trailer a sign of things to come for marvels mighty mutants  bryan singer shows off a pure talent in this film  with a short shooting schedule and a lackluster budget singer managed to create a film truly worth watching  he took thes central theme and well centralized it  throughouts long comic book history the theme of tolerance has been lost to flashy costumes and overthetop villains singer brought this theme to the forefront with a thoughtprovoking movie that entertains on multiple levels  what could have been a campy mess in the hands of most directors was made into a downtoearth serious movie what could have been a special effects extravaganza without a plot was instead made into a characterdriven storythe movie itself could have been better but what movie couldnt  a little more action wouldnt have hurt not to mention a longer film  with such a short movie you have very little time to care about a single character only the characters at the storys nucleus professor x magneto rogue and wolverine are given personalities  the rest of the characters are seemingly just there  the plot was interesting enough although it too took a backseat to wolverine and rogues fatherdaughter like relationship magnetos cheesy plot was actually not as corny as it could have been having survived the holocaust you could see why he wanted to make the worlds powerful like himselfthe cast was nothing short of exceptional  hugh jackman is wolverine there is no other way to say it  he truly nailed the role  mckellen managed to display so much in his comparatively small amount of screentime his eyes displayed the pain and anger felt by the character of magneto patrick stewart portrayed professor xavier as i had always imagined him to be in real life  honorable mentions to the rest of the cast who came together well in such a short period of timein short was a decent standalone movie but an exceptional start to a franchise  kudos to bryan singer and the cast for bringing us a realistic sciencefiction movie if there is such a thing  710,fantasy
i remember this has a cartoon in the early 90s i was very excited when it was going to be a live action movie and i was not disappointed the characters come alive well its well directed by bryan singer and well acted by everyone including patrick stewart has professor x who plays the part with a lot of charm and compassion i first thought james mardsen was a bad choice for the cyclops but he played the part pretty well famke janssen was just quiet in the role of jean grey halle berry should have had better lines playing storm ian mckellen was excellent has magneto but its hugh jackman that clearly steals the picture as wolverine his performance has the charming rebel is very well acted the special effects were awesome spiderman did just has good at the box office i hope daredevil and the hulk and also 2 do just has good,fantasy
i absolutely loved this movie im not normally a fan of action but i couldnt help loving this film i dont know if it was because of hugh jackman or james marsden etc or because the story line was actually asking me to think but this film definately won me over i cant wait for the next installment do not let this one slip by without a watch1010,fantasy
i rented this movie not hoping for much but let me tell you that was the best at everything it did the acting was great the action was nothing short of perfectionit also had a lot of funny moments that made it even betteri give this movie two thumbs way up,fantasy
this movie kick so much asses and really brought the superhero genre to a new heightthe way they changed the charactors are just perfect seriously i think this is so so so much better than the cartoonthe cartoon evolution was very disappointing to me cause like many other american cartoons it is flooded with poor dialogues and shallow plotsbut this movie was a huge surprise to me anyhow i think it couldve done much better if it didnt try to stay true to the old cartoon also there are some very poor dialogues and stupid battle scenesi like the way they changed rogue weak and victimized and wolverine dark and a nice guy the ending although sort of unbelievable and clumsy but i was deliberately touched when wolverine sacrifices himself to save rogue i think wolfy sees rogue as his only familythis movie goes into my all time favorite and id recommend anyone to see this,fantasy
i gave this movie a ten this ten is based on many grounds i will start with the musical side of the movie which i found to be perfect for every scene involving the music the score to this film if well worth buying as a soundtrack another major factor in giving this movie a ten was the casting i have looked over many of the comics and stills fromt he cartoon to figure out what they looked like and i must say that i found the casting thorough and impressive i think the only character in this movie who didnt look like the original comiccharacter was that of toad but his makeup and outfit was well put together and made disgusting yet sexy in some way ive heard many a complaint about the original comiccostumes not being used but i figured that if the original dresscode had been followed it would have ridiculed the movie to put out a specific hurray to the cast then it would have to be two characters in particular patrick stewart as prof charles xavier and hugh jackman as logan  wolverine this movie feels like for me like a springboard to the next an introduction if you will put alone it makes no sense but seen in the bigger picture together with the forecoming xfilms it will undoubtedly make an even bigger success than it already is see this movie i command thee,fantasy
 is an utterly xcellent movieive been an fan for more than 25 years and when i heard they were making this moviei had my doubtssay goodbye to doubts and hello to one helluva moviei always thought patrock stewart was the only actor to play professor x and he does an excellent job bringing him to lifethe casting was literally flawlessspecial notice goes to hugh jackman as wolverinei was concerned about this unknown from australia playing one of my all time favorite characters but he totally blew me away he is wolverineanna paquin is superb as rogueshowing lots of the talent that bagged her an oscarfamke janssen and halle berry as jean grey and stormwhoa babyi love sexy babes who can act goodjames marsden is good as cyclopstookickass potrayals on the villain side toorebecca romijnstamoswho makes blue look both cool and incredibly hot as mystiqueray park as the ever mobile toadtyler mane as the hulking sabertoothand especially ian mckellen who is a perfect magnetobryan singer directs with flash and panachethe fx are greatand michael kamens score is awesome 10 out od 10 i want to see spiderman when it hits video and cant wait for x2 to hit theaters next may as stan saysexcelsior,fantasy
ive seen x men like ten times on tv and i regret not seeing it on theater the fx amazing the performances are superb specially for a scifiactioncomic book film with a shining mackellen the cast itself is remarkable mixing hardcore action performers with awardwinning actors bryan singer is a notthatyoung talent ive seen most of his movies stephen kings apt pupil  the best crime movie except for the godfather of course usual suspects and he shows his good taste for the visual here if you dont like the fact that sometimes it doesnt follow the comic book or the beloved cartoon screw you or dont like the plot blame stan lee but the plot while not intelligent or subtile is very real after all its nothing else than martin luther king vs malcolm x ironic isnt it the fact that magneto is malcolm and not professor x its a tremendous film that deserves a sequel oh right itll have one no surprise after all it left everything prepared for oneby the way it did had character development i can come out with some sort of profile about em those who didnt see it have no perception at all screw you too and the silver and gray lighting in some parts of the movie are delightful to the eye special mention for the x women famke jansen halle berry  rebecca romijn are in my hot list of the hottest chicks that adds a couple of points to this films ratingoh dont forget to see the sequel so that it becomes a sheer success and we may have x3  x4 it actually looks darker not the lights the plot and violenceaction and will luckily bring us a better prospect bout the x world and the x guys themselves itll be great to see more mutants than the first one shame they still wont bring my favorite gambit yetrating 1210 yeah i gave it a 9 before but to be faithful to the comments,fantasy
my brother saw this film for the first time when i was staying withmy cousin so unfortunatly i didnt see it in the theater when i gotback he ranted and raved about how good it was i was a skepticuntil i was the movie when it came out on video earlier then mybro had expected it we made our parents buy it was i everhooked first of all what girl wouldnt be drooling over wolverine inthat fight scene and all the other stuff i was just soooooosurprised i am a huge scifi fan so that hooked me as well iunderstand that the movie is different from the show or the comicsbut i didnt really get into the show or comics until after i saw themovie so it didnt really matter i recommend this to any personwho loves scifi or or somebody with a prejudice maybe itcould open their mind rock on,fantasy
an entertaining film that includes the social commentary of the material comics cartoons that it is based on  hugh jackman was perfect as wolverine i mean nobody else could have played the role better  i also liked ian mckellan as magneto and patrick stewart as charles xavier although halle berry might not have been my first choice as storm she did a decent job nonetheless and i find her to be very talented,fantasy
i have seen this film thousands of times but 1 thing bugs me when u see magneto at the  start he is in poland and he speaks polish then suddenly he speaks english i dont get it but  near   the end of the film he says he first saw the statue of liberty when he was bout  9 in amercia so y didnt he have an amercian accent any explanations please tell me from mike,fantasy
i happen to be a very avid reader of comics and i have leaned towards the xtitles as well over the years and though i never dug deep into the soap opera that is i had a firm enough ground that i knew the characters and where they came from  people criticize this movie because they say it isnt faithful to the comics  how  the only thing that wasnt faithful to the comic was hugh jackmans hair wasnt standing two and a half feet off his head which mutant powers or not i dont think that its possible even hair bands in the 80s couldnt pull that hairdo off and im certain a few of them are mutants poison david bowie etc  okay jean isnt a doctor in the comics but other than that the characters were faithful to their comic counterpartsthe story while not taken from a comic story arc was just as good as any story that the comics could come up with  i respect the fact that someone wrote an orginal story for the movie because if they had taken from an actual story such as the phoenix saga then the hardcore fans would have nitpicked the movie to death  im a comic book geek but i know how to lighten up and let a movie be a movie  the movie was more or less like a year one story arc introducing the movie audiences to the charactersthe actor choices were great as well  for years i always said that patrick stewart should be professor x hands down  i was so happy when he got the role because he did a great job  hugh jackman played an awesome wolverine and ian mckellen and his cohorts were perfectly cast as well  my only question mark was halle berry as storm  she could have done so much better in her character especially with that horrible accent she usedthis movie helped to redefine marvel movies and its about time too  after the punisher howard the duck and the fantastic four movies showed hollywood that marvel can do it and they continue in with the spiderman movie  watch the film and even if you arent a fan of the comics its still a fun and enjoyable movie,fantasy
i saw these movie many years after watching the entire animated series i was a fan of it and wasnt dissapointed at all by these film the big problem about it is that it has too many character and too short time every character of the has a very very big story behind them and it forms their attitude for the person who has to write the script is very difficult to put in one and a half hour the life way of acting problems and powers of what nine characters you may focus in a couple of them but all of them need their moment on the screen and that is why this kind of movies can result in disapointment the movie is good because its loyal to the characters origins but then it also has the artistic originality a film should ever have anyhow that just isnt enough to those who know the characters to the bottom of themselfs i liked it maybe because in that year most movies sucked but nevertheless it is more than acceptable,fantasy
 is a movie people just watch because of the famous comics couldve been a big disappointment because of the numerous of characters involved and how you have to zoom out to get a braoder vision on all the characters and not just one however did focus more on rogue and wolverine which saved the movie in my opinion because it would be dull to switch back and forth from all the characters to show their powers thus the movie did enhance its performance by making  the story more unique and just following rogue and wolverine moreall in all the movie is still good if you are a hardcore fan and still worth watching if you have no idea of what are,fantasy
 was well put together with the exception of creed aka sabertooth who was made up to be more animal then man and more brainless then he is in the comics wolverine was perfectly done most of the plot and charectors were done to perfection and were a perfect match to there comic book originals all in all the vision of this movie was perfect,fantasy
this is what has started the comic adaptions of the twentyfirst century but what this great comic adaption has done is spanned the existance of the godawful spiderman and since they are making a sequel that makes it even worsebut lets talk about this movie the cast is great no one could have portrayed the better hugh jackman is wolverine patrick stewart is professor x ian mckellan is magneto tyler mane is sabretooth ray park is toad and anna paquin is rogue and let us just thank whoever it was that had the idea to make the cast wear black instead of the pathetically designed costumes of the cartoon series the action sequences are pretty intense and some of the younger fans might want to stay away for a few more years because for some reason they find it all way too scary even with the laughable spiderman some children found willem dafoe as the green goblin somewhat frightening hugh jackman perfectly portrays wolverine he looks exactly like the cartoon character the sequel will probably ruin the great reputation that this film had and so will the sequel to the horrid spiderman but perhaps the greatness of will keep it from being dismembered by the sequel in a few months but until it is let us all enjoy it while we can gets 55,fantasy
this film is absolutely brilliant bryan singer has done an excellent job remaining respectful to the original material but still managing to give the story and the characters a unique flavoursinger puts together an amazing cast led by two british greats patrick stewart plays prof charles xavier teacher and leader of the sir ian mckellen plays prof xs alterego the master of magnetism erik lehnsherrmagneto they are joined by hugh jackman as wolverine famke janssen as dr jean grey and halle berry as storm  the good thing about the casting in this film though is that it also includes relative unknowns such as james marsden cyclops and tyler mane sabretooth  singer employs ray park the stuntman who found fame as darth maul in star wars episode 1 the phantom menace and later as the headless horseman in tim burtons sleepy hollow as toad the model rebecca romijnstamos as mystique and the largely underrated bruce davidson as senator robert kellythe storyline is brilliant and believable singer has managed to make a film that is really entertaining and which includes all the best marvel traditions with amazing special effects dazzling locations and a witty script as well as creating a story that is thoughtprovoking and quite intellectual mckellens magneto almost becomes an antihero as the beginning shows him as a young boy in auswitz watching his parents being carted off to the gas chambers  obviously this sets a mindset within lehnsherrs psyche which drives him to desperate measures when he sees the kind of prejudice directed against mutants of course hes a mutant as well as a jew by people such as sen kelly  the extreme nature of magnetos beliefs are illustrated by the opposing view of lehnsherrs old friend prof xavier  the storyline tells us and anyone familiar with the comic will know how xavier and lehnsherr were once close friends but were pushed apart by their increasingly differing views on how to approach the hostility towards mutantsthe story is well crafted and the script clever the characters are wellrounded and interesting and singer draws well from the marvel comics remaining very true to the essence of the charactersall in all this is an excellent film and i highly recommend it810,fantasy
unlike other recent comicfilm crossovers like mystery men this latest foray into turning a popular comic into a movie had a nice balance between being an action movie and being a comic book movie taking place in the not so distant future the movie follows the exploits of a group of mutants known as the mutants are people who have evolved over time and have special powers one group of mutants the led by professor x patrick stewart believe that they can coexist with the human race another group of mutants led by magneto ian mckellen believes that a war between humans and mutants is imminent he has an evil plan to rid the earth of humans and let the mutants dominate the world it is up to the to stop him along with professor x who has the ability to read and control peoples minds there is dr jean grey who has telekinetic powers storm who has the power to control the weather and cyclops a man who has the power of energy in his eyes on the side of magneto who has the power of magnetism there is the barbarian sabertooth toad a man with well a large tongue and the ability to hop really far and mystique who has the power to shapeshift into anyone we also meet rogue a girl who takes the energy of any person who touches her skin and wolverine a man with amazing regenerative powers and claws that come out of his hands professor x believes that magneto wants to kidnap wolverine but cant figure out why but he soon realizes that its not wolverine that magneto wants its rogue that magneto needs in order to carry out his plan to rid the earth of the humans like i said earlier the movie has a nice balance between being too cartoony and being a solid action film obviously this is no ordinary group of people so making it into a regular action movie wouldnt work and if its too cartoonish you end up making a movie that seems really cheesy thank god they didnt have wolverine in his yellow and black spandex so i applaud bryan singer on his ability to mesh both worlds i found the story to be simple but i think that was necessary this movie is more about the characters than the story for those of us uninitiated in the ways of the it was a good way to get to know who these people were and what they could do rather than throw them into a convoluted story line that would have had to make you think and not pay attention to the heart of the people on screen i had heard of wolverine before but i really didnt know much about any of the other characters so it was nice to get a little background on them and see what powers they had and not have to be worried about some strange plot that would take away from the movie i thought the special effects were good but that is the one thing i was expecting from this movie i thought that the special effects would be good that there would be some cool hardcore type music but thats it what i found was a movie with characters i cared for and music that was actually kept to a minimum generally i find that in these types of movies whenever there is a big fight scene or something cool happening there is always loud music punctuating the scene here i found a few scenes where there was silence in the background which actually punctuated the scene more than any piece of music could i thought the sets were nice especially the giant room that professor x used to try and track down mutants and i thought the actors did a good job with the characters i had my doubts about hugh jackman playing the brooding wolverine but he won me over with his performance so overall i thought was a pretty good movie not as good as the original batman but a whole lot better than most if not all of the other comic book movies made in the last 10 years it had a lot of cool scenes very cool characters great special effects and some good fight scenes it kept a very even tone throughout not too serious not too funny and the story was there to help the audience get to know the characters so that we will all go back and see the inevitable sequels in the years to come,fantasy
years of anticipation had finally come to an end i was so excited to see this movie and i thought it was just great an all star cast that did not disappoint too much and a director that held the project with high regard each actor to me did a splendid job with their character after years of following the story line in the popular comic book series i was happy with the resulting movie and series pending sure really diehard fans may be disappointed with a few details but the way i see itimagine if there was a real group or similar issue in the world and they made a movie or comic book about it now imagine what you see in this movie as the real and the comics and cartoons as what was done with them marvel has finally come through with great films,fantasy
when i first heard about an movie being made i was sceptical that any film studio could take it serious enough to make a good film the last movie i liked made from a comic book was the first superman made in 1978 after seeing though i was pleasantly surprised  bryan singer did a wonderful job turning one of my favorite comic books as a kid into what is now one of my favorite science fiction filmsthe only flaw i saw was the casting of halle berry as storm i think singer knew this too because she only has two lines in the whole moviei cant wait for the sequel next year hopefully my favorite character pheonix will make an appearance now i just wish singer had done this years spiderman 710,fantasy
all my life ive watched exactly one episode of the but when i heard that a live action film was being created i wanted to see it the special effects are quite nicely done and its the kind of movie where you can be yelling out loud at the charactersand if your anything like me you appreciate that although the movie was enjoyable it offered far too little in the way of closure that was disappointing now im going to have to see the sequel but i cant help not wondering if maybe the answers to the questions that were left open in the movie have already been established in its more animated forms i will probably never take the time to see so perhaps the sequel is being filmed for people like me,fantasy
the real standout are wolverine and rogue the story is simply about mutants getting along with humans professor x is trying to make a better world with humans and mutants magneto wants no parts of this he wants everyone to turn mutant and be on his brotherhood of mutants i really loved this movie and i thought every actor gave it all to there character especially hugh jackmanloganwolverine i really thought they went to far off base with the actor but hugh fit wolverine perfectly i really mean that the movie is colorful and full of action the fight sceens are flawless and when wolverine put outs his claws i was very impressed the movie is funny at times and very real to the comic book real life actors on the big screen protraying comic characters its really great bryan singer is the only one i know that could keep this francise going i really love this movie maybe because im a big fan but im telling you it works you will not be dissapointed a must watch out of 4 stars i give it 4 stars really entertaining,fantasy
patrick stewart is an outstanding actor in this movie including the other one that done an outstanding job  good job to all of you logan has great hands with blades that come out for protection is so neatful  the college students from the professors place is held for mutants that have such great powers like i have ever seen before  they all just look really cool with uniqueable powers,fantasy
simply stated this is one of the best movies adapted from a comic book growing up i have always read comics and was never a big fan this changed my outlook on this team of outcast mutants a great cast great action and a solid story make this a must see for any diehard comic fans or scifi junkies and for those of you who scoff at this i even recommend it for those who dont dig theses types of films damn it was just a really fun flick thats what movies should be right,fantasy
i saw this film last night and have to say that it was appalling  after reading everyone elses comments on here i thought id check it out it is safe to say that everyone who ranted on about the god damn being good has clearly never seen a good movie and for that fact would know one if wolverine smashed it into their collective obsessed skulls retarded direction from singer who was the main reason i watched this film after the usual suspects  the scene where wolverine crashes his mobile home and lands in the snow has a fight and is rescued by a member of abba and cyclops was so shoddily done that it made me laugh  the one redeeming feature was hugh jackman who deserves to be a star granted the special effects were stunning but what the heck was going on  slow slow slow storyline you may of well as put wolverine on a john deere lawnmower and told him to visit his dying brother  at least the straight story was exciting i feel as though the cult following this film has got especially after the readers nauseating insights about the characters means that this film will be seen again and again allowing theophilles to invade there own space well into the next year awaiting the sequel  word to the wise how do you think wolverine got hairy palms  point made,fantasy
well i saw the movie early the night before it debuted in theatres employee showing at main place  i didnt want to say this i mean i really didnt want to say this but the movie is pretty good let me clarify that i was expecting a steaming heap of the horrid and so my expectations were low  i still believe its pretty good though i really only went to see it because my two favorite actors are in it mckellan and stewart so i couldnt pass it up  i was pleased though hugh jackman did a good job as wolverine  now he is too tall for the role remember that wolverine is supposed to be five feet two inches tall but his facial expressions and his attitude were right on  his martial arts were good and he held his own acting wise  they never got in to his bezerker rage and he was cuddly enough to befriend the children onscreen and in the audience but that didnt make the character suffer  he was still gruff and slightly only slightly foulmouthed  even the hair was close many have criticized rogue but they did her quite well  the actress anna paquin is among the youngest oscar winners ever the piano so naturally her acting was good  i have the first appearance of rogue and this was pretty close to the young rogue  right down to the green riding hood they eliminated some elements of her past but that helped the story stay clear not convoluted patrick stewart is professor x  perfect  cerebro was likewise deadon ian mckellen was amazing as magneto  he was just perfect  i never was comfortable with the bulked up magneto of the nineties  hes tough but looks his age he played the part with dignity and actually looked right even when flying around  his costume is sort of a combo of the original and his costume does anyone remember that magneto was the headmaster of xaviers school and thes leader for a time back in the 80s even that helmet is practical its not a supervillain thing he uses it to block professor xaviers powers rebecca romijnstamos sp made a good mystique i was skeptical but she was fine the team is only unofficially called  basically they all wear uniforms and battle fatigues with the xaviers school for gifted youngsters symbol on it  somewhere along the line the kids started referring to them as makes it more grown up no   in fact these folks are treated like action heroes not superheroes  they seldom even wear the uniformsthe story isnt perfect and wont win any awards for best screenplay but is pretty tight  there is the occasional scene where i found myself saying why or that was pretty contrived but for the most part i was pleased  i wont reveal any details because i dont want to include any spoilers  i will say  that occasionally the slowmo fight scenes got irritating luckily this technique was rarely used bobby iceman drake or should i say ice boy was all wrong why even have him in the film if he was going to be a bowl of nothingthe rest of the xcast ie cyclops storm and marvel girl was good they made a fine ensemble without falling behind the main leads  the other villains sabretooth toad did well  i liked sabretooth almost in spite of myself  i didnt like his lion roars but the presence was there  toad was pretty funny  it was nice to hear ray parks voice for once and it was cool to know that at least one of the actors did their own stunts  of course he had in contacts again  will we ever see his true eye color the directing was great  it certainly had that usual suspects feel without being derivative  i think singer is another great one again without mckellan and stewart it might not have been so good  but if youre interested in seeing a good action movie see this one hey its less comicbookish than the patriot,fantasy
i love ive read some of the comics watched the tv series on fox and even have a couple of the video games so when the movie came out i knew i had to see it and i wasnt disappointed the movie portrayed the as they should and not altered like many movies are the special effects were awesome especially when mystique changes into other people or thingsthe only quarrel i have with this movie is that from the very beginning i could tell that there was going to be a sequal and it seemed like that the only reason was made is so that their could be a sequal dont get me wrong i like sequals austin powers 2 was a great sequal but left too many things open or unexplained also i hope that in 2 there are more characters like beast gambit or morph,fantasy
i dont know what it was but something about this movie just disappointed me ive been reading the comics since 1991 and have watched every single episode of the old fox cartoon and i have also read most of the tpbs from the 80s so it can be said that i was realy anticipating this movie sadly it left me disappointed cyclops who is my favorite character wasnt really fleshed out as much as he shouldve been and in my opinion had no chemistry with jean which is a big no no jean and storm were a joke compared tot heir comic book counterparts magneto rogue and wolverine were my only favorite characters in this movie and im not really a huge wolvie fan they were the best written characters and also the most close to their comic counterparts i did not like what was done with mystique sabretooth and toad at all ive never really liked toad but sabretooth is a character with so much potential and one of my favorites in the books here he is reduced to a dumb witted lackey which totally goes against everything the character stands for just like bane in batman  robin he was severly butchered the direction was alright and ive always been a supporter of patrick stewart as professor x since the early 90s although he really shows his age in this movie and ive always pictured the professor as someone in his late 40s not someone in their 60s this is one movie in which the sequel needs to be a serious improvement over i hope they finally nail it with the sequel unlike superman ii and batman which are two of the greatest comic movies ive ever seen this movie has problems fleshing out its villains and even its main characters so there is no one to really root for like batman however the action scenes are very poorly filmed and sometimes even hard to follow i dont know but i was seriously hyped for this one maybe that is why i felt so let down all faults aside im still buying the special edition dvd when it is released,fantasy
i gave this a 10  i thought is was a great triumph in the comicbook to movie crossover  as for most crossover problems i wished they had put all of the comic characters in the movie  the effects were great wish there was more on the evil aspects of the characters   all in all is was a great movie  go and see it ,fantasy
i just finished watching the movie and was blown away by itkudos to bryan singer for doing such a wonderful jobonce againmrs has showed the world what a gifted man he truly is by presenting to us such a fanstastic comic book adaptionthe person who i really was impressed with was hugh jackmanloganwolverinehe is a very good actor and to be honesti cant wait to see him portraying another character in a different moviehes the one to watch patrick stewartprofessor x and sir ian mckellanmagneto wereof course at their usual bestjames marsdencyclops did a fine job as wellframke jenssenjean greyhallehoneyberrystormwere perfect although i did wish they gave girlfriendberrysome more linesits coolshell get them next timei loved everything about this moviemystiquemeeeyowwwand wolvie fight scene was one of the best that ive seencheck this movie outi think that it will appeal to both fanboys and noncomic book fans alikethanks bryan for your hard work,fantasy
personally i loved this film i am a big fan of x men especially rogue and gambit i was dissapointed when gambit wasnt in the film but i heard that he was going to be in the second one maybe thatll make things more interesting i dont get why they made rogue a teenager in the comics and tv series shes usually the strong one in the movie she seemed so helpless i like anna paquin and i think she did a good part playing the sweet innocent rogue but in the second one i hope they show the clash between rogue and ms marvel i loved famke janssen she did a great got playing jean grey james marsden also did a great job playing cyclops i just wish that the movie wasnt so centered on wolverine and rogue hugh jackman did a great job and is on his was to becoming a big star halle berry carried out the role of storm great but the story line couldve used a little more work other than that it was great,fantasy
the first time i saw this i didnt think much of it but now i love it you may not like it first time through but its a thinker the special effects are outstanding with every but you really have to think about it after i read the book and saw the movie again i loved it this is one movie you dont want to miss and i even hear that they are making 2nd and 3rd sequels you dont want to be without this one 810,fantasy
miss this if you like the comic  excuse me but wasnt there a character called gambit in the series and didnt mystique turn out to be rogues motheri hate to bad mouth a movie but if they wanted to base it on a comic book they should have stuck to the story,fantasy
when i first heard they were coming out with an moviei was over joyedi was wondering whod be in itwould rogue be apart of brotherhood of evil mutants like in the comic serieswill liv tyler play as psylockeand will wolverine be played by a good actoronly the movie could tell me thatan what a dissapointment it wasanna paquin as roguei was thinking that natalie portman would be wellsuited in that rolehugh jackmani have to sayhe played wolvie with a sexappealing charismai got to remember to rent out swordfish and someone like you when they come outbut what really got me mad was that the movie barely followed the comic book seriesand that was the whole entire reason i went to see that movie with my friendof coursethere is some bonus points for this filmgorgeous guys like hugh jackmanray parkjames marsden and sexy women like halle berryfamke janessenand rebbeca romijnstamoskick ss special effectsbutthis all a veneer that piles on over the fact that this movie can never be better than the comic book seriesmaybe the second installment will be betteri do hope psylocke will be in itif soi hope liv tyler plays it and not somebody else,fantasy
i thought this movie was great i am sooo obsessed with movies its my hobbie and when i saw the trailer for this i wanted to see it i didnt know i would like it that much but i did alot my parents own a movie theater so i worked there that summer i preveiwed it the night before it came out and loved it i went to go see it a second time the next day whenever i went upstairs to make popcorn i would watch it and i would go see it when i was of duty i saw the movie 7 times in the theater and the day it came out on video i bought it i know your thinking major dork but i cant help it all the characters were made for the part exspecially patrick serwart hugh jackman and ian mckellen they all look and act the same as in the tv show and comic book the guy that wrote the comic bookforgot his name watch mall rats to see him is a really good comic book writer so is kevin smith also mallrats clerks dogma and chsing amy anyways getting off subject let me tell you alittle about the castpatrick serwartprofesor x you may have seen star trek i think thats where most people know him he has been in lots of other movies to though he was sooo perfect for the part of prefessor x ian mckellanmagneto a long time great actor my grandma really likes him so you can see how old he has been an actor and a very good one at thathugh jackmanwolverine we come to him who is my favorite if you dont know him from you may have seen someone like you or swordfish which hallie barry was also in he has won many best actor awards in australia he was in oklahoma and he was gaston in buety and the beast look for him in the the fall for his new movie with meg ryan called kate and lepold also he was in people for one of the 50 most beutiful people he wouldnt sit by tyler mane when they had lunch so he could build up a tension between them james marsdencyclops you may know him from gossip or disturbing behavior those are the only two ive seen him in he had to be lead around the stage sometimes because he couldnt see very well rebbeca romanstamosmystique she is a model and of coourse everyone knows her husband john stamos who played jessie on full house it took 810 hours to put on her costume hallie barrystormyou might have read about her when she got in her accident her most recent film is swordfish ray parktoad of course everyone knows him as dauth maul from episode 1famek jansonjean grey look for her in men in black 2 in summer of 2002tyler manesabertooth i dont know anything else he has been in he still did the part very well though anna paquinrouge she won an acadmy award for the piano and she was in fly away home well thats all the characters they all did a great job personally i thinkif you have seen the extra footage at the end of the tapethey should have used that footage it went into more detail and told more about jean grey and the love triangle going on for evryone to know the sequel is coming out summer of 2002 hopefully we get more about logans past brian singer is still directing it yes all the charcters that didnt die in the first one will be in the second one also there is also plans if the sequel goes well to make a third one i know everyone got goosebumps when wolverine risked his life for rouge and the music that was playing was so touching lol of course i was so happy when he didnt die of course not he was the main character some poeple will say that the movie was to much about wolverine it may have been but the sequel will be about someone else i think it was good he was the main character because it really gave his careor a boost if no one noticed some other in the movie were kitty and jubille gambet was also going to be in it and beast but wasnt i think they are going to be in the second one though anyways i know ive gone on to long please email me if you have any questions about any movies or if you just want to talk about them i know that half the poeple that go to this site wont even read this thing im just glad i got to write about it i think everyone should see this movie its very quotable i should know i know every word of it  thanks for reading bye,fantasy
alright i started writing this review and it was pretty bad but im not intending for this to be a bad review was a very good movie my only problem is the fact that its a very good movie for someone who hasnt been loyally giving their money away on comics merchandise etc for the past almost ten years i as a fan for a while of the actual comic book felt almost betrayed by how they portrayed the characters they being writers screenplay people and whatnot the actors i believe did a fine job with what they were given they were so very untrue to the characters but i do understand why i understand that you cant pack alomost 40 years of character exploration into and hour and a half i also understand that they were trying to open the up to new audiences but to me this kinda feels like people who dont already follow the dont matter its all about getting new people in shrug but what can you do i would definitely recommend this movie while i admit i whine about the falsities of it it was very good but hard core fans should know that it wasnt very true to the books i for some reason was expecting it to be now something were very accurate which i would mention but i dont want to spoil it but there are some very inaccurate points to the movie i was very suprised though i thought the actors did a great job i know i couldnt have made the movie any better and i know they did the best with what they could but hopefully the sequel will side a little more on the already true fans side and maybe have more than 5 in it and maybe have the budget to let them use their powers more than once or twice its a good movie check it out but be warned  thats all for my ramblings,fantasy
the pondersome task for the folks at marvel and 20th century fox is to produce a movie that will satisfy the fans of the comic and those that havent the foggiest notion of what the story is about this made for long and protracted explaining all throughout the screenplay this also meant that a lot a times the action came to a deadening stop more often than not movies have to give the audience breathing room but this film gave too much to the point where things started gettingwelldull the performances were okay with halle berry being the standout as storm patrick stewart underplayed his role to the point of casting a wooden pall over the character ian mckellan was good in his role as magneto he showed wonderfully sublime selfcontrol as his character could have beened hammed up badly they made a wise choice using sir ian in this rolea mention might go out to parents who are contemplating bringing the kids theres a few scenes that are more than slighty graphic in their violent content i was frankly astonished to see parents with toddlers in their arms in the same theater some scenes could be a tad unsettlingoverall while the film did not live up to its farflung hype which ones do it isnt terrible either just a bubble over average,fantasy
i am huge fan of rogue and gambit but i was quite disappointed with singers protrayal of the mississippi maurader i understand that he wanted to show her as a teenager possibly to connect with teenage fans but nobody really knows what she was like at that age everybody knows her as the strongarm of the and when the sequel is made with gambit in it by the way how is their relationship supposed to work unless the ragin cajun is a youngn too but other than the misrepresentation of rogue i thoroughly enjoyed the movie i especially loved the tension between cyclops and wolverine  and the addition of oneliners added solely for xfans what would you prefer yellow spandex made it just that much more identifible the story was well written  could have been better if gambit was in it and the cast except for ms paquin as rogue was superb i could go on about the praises but let me just say the sequel is highly anticipated,fantasy
seriously this was about as obvious as scream 2 i mean it was a great movie but my point is it was in the making longer than freddy vs jason anybody know if theyre still planning to make that it no surprise and no surprise that theyre making a sequil i suggest they stop there though because if history serves the third and forth movies in a comic book to movie series suck,fantasy
well just to say this was the best movie i have ever seen  i have been an fan for years so of course when i heard about the movie i counted the days till it came out  i feel the director did an excellent job of telling the story of the patrick stewart and hugh jackman did great jobs of fullfilling the roles of prof x and wolverine  i recommend everyone see s this movie  i cant wait for 2,fantasy
well when youre adapting a comic book classic like into a movie you really need a perfect director a talented cast a brilliant script great special effects etc and provides all that and more my favourite character is of course wolverine who is played by the brilliant hugh jackman with his amazing acting and amazing handsome looks the guy was always going to be a star and of course he is see his other movies someone like you and swordfish they are both brilliant other favourites of mine were james marsden from the brilliant gossip who plays cyclops anna paquin who plays rouge and patrick stewart does a really great job as professor x the rest of the cast are also really good including rebecca romijnstamos who is unrecognisable as mystique the film is absolutely brilliant and i like many other are waiting for the sequel which i hope brings back all the cast and the brilliant directing of bryan singer i give a 910,fantasy

this really is a great movie i saw it a long time ago but decided to rent it unfortunately they didnt have it for rental what so i just bought it it figures hehewhen i first saw this about half a year ago i thought it was really disappointing and just ok which is halftrue i cant lie to you the plot really stinks in this movie its a major drawback but the awesome special effects make up for it the costumes on the characters were fabulous ingenius i was very impressed by the style and overall appearance of the movie it was very classy very hardcore very intense now that ive seen the movie again i have to say that its better than when i saw it the first time i didnt really want to see it the first time but now that i went out and got it voluntarily i have retained a sense of openmindednesshugh jackman as wolverine is destined to be a star heck he already is one hes been in three movies i adored this one someone like you and swordfish with a handsome roguish dashing look about him charming good looks and charismatic persona hes bound to be on the cover of ever magazine in the near future girls are already crazy about it him and he has a strong fanbase its not hard to see why as the strong intense neverletyourguarddown wolverine and the distinctly more human logan hes just oozing with sex appeal i cant think of anyone else who could have played wolverine better he said in a quote that it was either him or val kilmer i was like they were even considering someone else anna paquin while sincere and very real in her emotions really disappointed me im not a big fan of hers in the first place except for her cute role in fly away home but i didnt see any magic onscreen while i was watching this movie i really dont tap into the chemistry between logan and marie all i see is a brothersister type relationship nothing more while she is a very human very sweet girl i dont think we deserved to see that much of her in the moviefamke janssen wow loved her shes such a controlled actress its scary you dont see much of her in the movie to which im very mad about but the scenes you do see emit such a poised passionate heroic yet restrained woman who has a lot of back history i hope we explore in the sequel famke is a gorgeous actress and is very direct and very honest i wish they gave her more screentime the love triangle among logan jean grey and scott was something im glad they went into and if you have the tape at the end you can see an expanded version of that scene in logans bedroom this is one of the most interesting storylines in the movie and im eager to see how rogue gets thrown into the mix if she does at all im thinking she might personally i love the loganjean grey pair i know that the storyline will probably turn out to be scottjean but im very content and proud of my couple shipper fetish djames marsden great role for him he like famke doesnt get much of a chance for screentime in here but hopefully he will in the sequel i dont like him much as scott look to the love triangle diatribe but he did play a good part as cyclops i loved the throw of words he shared with logan stay away from my girl hes a great actor and very handsome too but i do have a slight hostility toward his character getting in the way of my loganjean lolpatrick stewart exceptional who couldve played professor x better nobody im so glad they cast him he shares many of the same traits as famke ironic since in the movie they share the same type of power poised intelligent and controlled such a great actor whos able to look at you and direct an emotion so powerfullyi liked this movie when i saw it a second time the action scenes were phenomenal but i felt the movie had something missing perhaps we will see whatever it was in the sequel,fantasy
the first time i heard about the movie i wasnt too interested but after i staarted watching evolution i wanted to see the movie  i finally saw it today and loved it  it was way different than evolution and the actors really fit the roles  famke janssen  jean gray was probably my favorite  i would recommand this to anyone who is a fan or someone who just wants to see a great movie,fantasy
  the next phase in human evolution has given rise to a select group who possesses a wide range of unusual abilities telekinesis superhealing and morphing are only a few examples  unfortunately there is a movement among the normal people  afraid of what they do not understand  to have these mutants register so they can be identified tracked and their powers documented  two mutants emerge as leaders with radically different agendas  one seeks peaceful coexistence with the rest of humanity  the other dominationwhenever a book is adapted for the big screen there is bound to be controversy over casting or content  legions of fan were livid with the choice of tom cruise for the role of lestat in interview with a vampire to a lesser degree this has also applied to comic book adaptations spiderman superman we wont even touch batman but none approaching the level of debate which raged over  it was not just a question of who would be cast but which characters should be included what they should wear people were livid that the characters would not be clad in body hugging spandex how close they should be to the comic book characters etc  consequently i would be stunned if anyone is totally happy with all the characters  i know i wasnttoad gets far too much screen time and his prehensile tongue schtick quickly grows tiresome sabretooth isnt very menacing they couldnt find a bulked up behemoth with a little more screen presence kane  from the wwf comes to mind and the maydecember relationship between jean grey and cyclops doesnt jibe  i did however think hugh jackman was superb as wolverine delivering the right balance of pathos and rage  patrick stewarts xavier is a cool as ice he got a lot of practice as captain picard on star trek softspoken diplomat  finally sir ian mckellen is almost regal in his portrayal as magneto the wonderful gentleman villain with a nasty disposition but couldnt they have given him a better hat  i bet thats why he has such an attitude problem  but youre probably wondering what about the movie itself  all in good time rather than go for a gaudy comic book look dick tracy or a decaying and depressing landscape batman has a realistic feel it takes place a few years in the future in a recognizable new york  the story is engaging and accessible examining the concept of intolerance  although here it is not skin color in most cases or religion that is the focus  which captures headlines everyday and is quite simple to grasp   just to ensure that the movie doesnt get too heavy there are quite a few clever puns and oneliners sprinkled throughout to provide some levity   and lets not forget the actionthere are several excellently choreographed action sequences most notably the battle between mystique and wolverine  the experience is heightened by excellent cinematography stop motion and slow motion photography and impressive special effects morphing technology continues to improve will not satisfy everyone but it does deliver a finely crafted story good acting and is without a doubt one of the best comicbooktoscreen translations to date and there will be a sequel,fantasy
i really enjoyed this movie  i only went to see it out of curiosity i am a star trek fan and will see anything involving patrick stewart and most of the rest of the star trek cast  i had never seen the animated series and knew nothing about the  i found it to be very exhilirating  i havent enjoyed a movie this much in quite a while,fantasy
this was a great movie ive always loved the comics and cartoons but the movie was the best i especially liked jean grey she was my favorite in this movie i only wish they put gambit in this movie if there is a sequel coming im sure theyll put him in it overall i thought this movie was fantastic i gave it a 10,fantasy
what can i say my favourite heroes have been brought to life on the screen and i sure love it anna  lovely patrick  great hugh  sexy and got talent no one could have played the role of wolverine any better now i will have to wait a long time before i can see the team save the world once again  or something even greater a sure 1010,fantasy
i have to confess has never been my favorite marvel comic booki prefer thor silver surfer and fantastic four  and there have been so many bad movies based on marvels characters that i skipped seeing in the theater  but i bought the video and watched it five times over the holiday break  now i cant wait for the next one ,fantasy
i am one of the mild fans of this bryan singer film it is amazing and amusing but i have a question for the diehard fans  where are the canadian folks in this movie that dashes around northern america  the two mutants at the top of the good versus bad pyramids dr x versus magneto were portrayed by british shakespearean veterans who sort of look age 60  or so  however if the setting of the storyline is supposed to be distinctly in the near future wouldnt such a hero and villain patrick stewart and ian mckellen respectively both be 7075 years old to have survived the 1944 concentration camps and the immigration past miss liberty in 1949 as adolescents in full bloom of their mutant psychic powers  those two talented actors pronunciation and diction still isnt quite generic to most peoples ears but both veterans have carried major studiotv credits so we can understand that casting  however  australian anna paquin and brit hugh jackman as well as the actor portraying toad are also a bit heavy on the accents in my opinion  the trucker and the canadian bar patrons in early scenes seemed to me mere generic gladiatorwwf crowd versus any representative inclusions of those north of the us border in other user comments previous to mine several are asking about sequels and omission of favorite characters  for me the germane question isnt about wholl be featured next why singer or executive producer stan lee chose these particular xpersons good and evil or was enough attention to believable special effects equipmentfight scenes paid  i want to know if and when the us senate bans mutants or herds them into konzentrationkamps will they flock to the canadian rockies where wolverine seems to have been shifted  rating 8 of 10 violence mild offensive language  minimal disturbing events  moderate for under 12 age group,fantasy
this movie rocksjames marsden and hugh jackman as cyclops and wolverine are great and patrick stewart is a dead ringer for prof xalthough some main characters are mia gambit and beastthe remaining people are just wonderfulyou have to see this movie it is the best film ever,fantasy
the movie has a few changes but for the most part it remains true to the comics some changes are cyclops is younger in the movie wolverine and sabretooth dont know each other in the film in the comics they worked together in team x st john alerdyce is a student of professor x in the movie but not in the comics as an avid fan i appreciate the directors keeping the characters and plot believable to comic fans and making changes to keep the characters from looking stupid ie leather costumes instead of spandex this is a difficult thing to pull off but he has done it well,fantasy
bryan singer said that this movie was driven by characters rather than by action  with that in mind i was surprised to discovered that the film was more impressive and faithful to the original comics in regard to the action scenes than it was in regard to characterization  despite the modest budget by blockbuster standards manages to deliver well choreographed action scenes reminiscent of the comic book it is often visually impressive though the score is pretty weakthe characterization ranges from great to poor  ian mckellen performance is the best and truest to his character magneto berrys storm is uninteresting  stewarts xavier and paquins rogue are twodimensional compared to their complex comic counterparts jean grey cyclops and wolverine are at times as multifaceted as in the comics  ray park is surprisingly good as toadmy advice if you like the movie buy some reprints of the comics of the 70s and 80s to see the at their best,fantasy
this was an entertaining film but one that could have been better  while it didnt seem short if they added some character development for some of the characters who just take up screen time  and either develop the perfunctory love triangle or get rid of it  the story itself is rather simple as well  people hate mutants and want to pass a bill forcing them to register themselves  the mutants are divided into two camps  the first group believe in peaceful coexistence while the second believe that people must be destroyed  the performances range but that is as a result of their parts  berry marsden jansen and romainstamos are limited by their roles but still give a solid go of it  anna paquin as rogue while doesnt disappoint isnt incredible  rogue is not a teenager so her character isnt completely true  it also limits the flirtatious relationship between her and wolverine played by hugh jackman  the film belongs to him  hes great to watch  fun while not incredible though it should have been nominated for an oscar in the sound and makeup categories,fantasy
i went to see with high hopes and i was rewarded yes the storyline is slightly unoriginal and this could be called a classic franchise but the key to enjoying this film is in the translation between ink and fullmotion video visually the film is rich and embodies all of the characteristics of the comic series i think the important thing about it the thing that you dont realise youre enjoying is how the film moves just like you imagine the comics to the characters movements gestures and pace are all perfect as are the sets backdrops and locations just my two pennethworth,fantasy
this movie rocked  i loved it   i was hesistant when i first heard that they were making an x men movie but once i saw it in the theatre it blew me away  and hugh jackman was perfect as wolverinelogan  he is so sexy  everyone in the movie did a great job  patrick stewart was the perfect choice for professor x  and i liked the scenes between cyclops and wolverine they were so funny it was great  and i couldnt buy a copy of the movie fast enough  i even have an x men video game and it is so cool  and im really looking forward to the sequel  this movie was so awesome and if i had to choose which power that one of the characters had i think id go with storms powers being able to control the weather  would be so neat  this movie definitely deserved the 1010 rating ,fantasy
 has got it all plot great fx great actors great acting script crew its the full package even with 75 millionthe acting was the best thing about the film hugh jackman was amazing as loganwolverine famke janssen was perfect as dr jean grey patrick stewart was born to play professor xavier and ian mckellan met with his destiny with his role as magento plus lets not forget anna paquins rouge halle berry shouldnt have played storm she doesnt fit her role dont let a golden globe fool you james marsden is waaaay to young for cyclops and you hardly notice him the fx are great and with lauren shulerdonner producer and bryan singer director on the xcrew you got yourself a perfect adventurescifi flick leaves batman and superman in the dust if you havent seen yet you are missing out on the greatest comic turned to a film ever see this,fantasy

i was a big fan and was excited to see the movie being released especially with patrick stewart  i was underimpressed with the storyline there were many better ones to choose from in the comic although there were some good plot twists  i liked the effects and makeup costumes but felt that they should have been more true to the comic  overall i would recommend this movie to scifi lovers but warn fans that they will be slightly disappointed i am not sure yet whether i want to have this movie in my collection,fantasy
 is a great movie pact with a pretty good plot considering its a comic book movie for instance the anology between magnetto in a concentration camp at jews and in present day the anger towards mutants being the reason why magnetto doesnt trust normal peoplep the special fx is also very impressive i give this movie a 9 only because the character development is a little underdeveloped but theyll probably fix that in the sequel,fantasy
growing up with comic books i never really became a fan of until the cartoon came out the movie has a simplistic story so nonfans fans children  and adults alike will understand it the casting was good patrick stewart had to be pro x halle berry was the only disapointment she had few lines and when she did they were bad do you know what happens to a toad struck by lightning the biggest surprise was hugh jackman i didnt expect much from jackman but now i think he will be the next big actor i just cant wait for the sequel,fantasy
superman is the definitive comic book film but in 2nd place comes ive never read any comics so i was really surprised by this picture its certainly moving in the right direction and expect a decent sequel lays the foundation a bit like superman but whereas superman 2 was a step down 2 should blow away the originalthe has interesting superheros they have powers which have a bad side they are not perfect i really like this idea it makes the films franchise last longer and the potential of sequel ideas is infinitethe acting in the film is excellent hugh jackman as wolverine is excellent steals the show in my opinion james marsden and halle berry didnt have a lot of meat in the picture i think the sequels could sort this outthe editing of the picture was the major disappointment the 2nd act was disjointed and the progress of the picture was hampered this was an editing error can be sorted out when and if a special edition cut appears storm cyclops toad and sabertooth have no depth i think a bit more work on them in the sequelthe screenplay isnt bad hard to judge when the picture is obviously edited harshlythe direction is nice i think singer has put in verisimilitude which make us believe just like superman the moviethe widescreen framing is pretty good unwatchable in pan and scanoverall a good start despite the 2nd act being disjointed,fantasy
i thought this film was rather good for a comic book remake especially coming off the heels of batman which hopefully has been put out if its misery for goodthe fx is top notch as well as the fight scenes which rivals that the of the matrix however the plot is a virtual connect the dots very easy to predict the next scene ten minutes in advance given that this is a comic book adaptation im willing to cut singer some slack seeing that im not exactly expecting citizen kane material here plus theres a lot of setup so to speak so maybe singer will do better in iisame goes for characterizations or lack thereof with the exceptions of prof x stewart wolverine jackson magneto mckellen and rogue paquin everyone else comes off as movie set extras with their onedimensional demeanors especially toad sabretooth cyclops and storm coupled with flavorless oneliners speaking of which storms berry do you know what happens to a toad line fell flatter than a mat dropped from a ten story building i was sitting there thinking is that the best she can dooverall a good project for singer  co but it cant touch superman i  ii,fantasy
i think this is the best movie ever made  ive never read an comic book in my life and the movie was still really cool  i think that brian singer did an amazing job  i love famke jansen and halle berry  hugh jackman did an awesome job,fantasy
a good director and good actors even oscar winners cannot help this weak plot i find it almost boring i just watched it for a second time on dvd and i had difficulties finishing it which hardly ever happens even with movies i have seen lots of timesthere is absolutely nothing special about this movie even the last batman sequel was more entertaining i was told this is the first in a series and special care was taken to build up all the individual characters what characters except wolverine and mystique who have some depth and are admittedly cool all the other superheroes are pathetic cyclops storm or just ridiculous toad even mr xavier himself is not much of a superhero and patrick stewart bends backwards to give him some life waste of an actorthe story line is utterly predictable silly and one more time a waste of resources like so many other movie versions of comic heroes why not just take some of the original comic story lines and turn them into a movie frank millers return of the dark knight outclasses the combined production of all the screenplays for the batman movies where is the daring genius to turn neil gaimans sandman into a decent moviei like comics i like movies and sometimes i like them both put together but x men is one of these movies i would like to unwatch and get back my money and more important my time,fantasy
what a great movie a great great movie a marvellous well thought out carefully crafted well characterisedfirst third of a movie i admit  if the movie had everything in it id expected itd be 15 hours long i was just getting settled with the flow of events and the style of presentation whenthe credits rolled come on guys make the sequels quickly damn quickly more of this  i can see a movie saga outlasting even the great star wars,fantasy
a true rarity  a big budget overblown scifi movie that actually makes sense works pretty well and doesnt bore you to death  taken from the marvel comics classic series about superhero mutants protecting society from the bad guys which include evil mutants  patrick stewart anchors the leads as professor x and anna paquin gives a very understated very attractive turn as one of his new finds  only two complaints  a pointless subplot involving the abduction of a congressman and a sort of antiseptic or formula quality to the story that prevents real emotional involvement paquin excepted  but the fact that it passes muster in other areas puts in well ahead of most of the genre,fantasy
 has been one of the biggest comics to ever hit the super heroe industry  to make a movie about it great idea though to ruin it bad idea the movie takes the story of the and totally destroys it  if a movie is based upon some other story it should follow that story not make up little other things because of money complications  and if you cant live up to that story because of money then dont make the movie  also they got to remember that theyre making movies here not comics  i dont know how many movies they plan to make but theyre starting off pretty slow and it could lead to many sequels  so why not just make the a little longer but also include some other enemies and other good guys and make some good fight scenes  not like the crap horribly coreographed fight scenes in this movie  also the wolverine and sabretooth fight at the end should have been 10 times cooler,fantasy
i did not look at the reviews before i watched this dvd  i came to the conclusion that it was f a r better than i anticipated it to befor a start it was wellpaced and not crashbangwollop from the start as some super hero movies tend to be  neither was it tedious or dialoguebound like mission to mars  overall there was a quite serious feel to it but it was well tempered by tongueincheek moments and the unavoidable camp overlaywolverine was by far the best character  a sort of old fashioned nononesense cowboy character  he echoed my view of cyclops who appeared glib and overconfident  talking of cyclops we could have done with seeing more of his special ability  this was my favourite character in the 60s comic mags but was more mature and aloof than the slick collegetype we saw in this film  storms effects were more a sort of storm in a teacup and as for roguepleeeeze a sort of wildcard and handy for the plotthe baddies had some interesting characters  so magneto was a survivor of a ww2 concentration camp  an interesting if not obvious analogy between jewsundesirables and modern day mutants  didnt think much of the snarling dude but toad was brilliant  im not sure how he could have a stereotyped london accent when brought uphatched in north america but what the hey  his demeanour and accent made him a sort of dickensian villain  almost loveable  the part where he did a little jig during a piece of naughtiness was excellent  the way he was dispatched was patheticyes  not a bad film  get the popcorn in some nice cold popbeer sit back mutate and enjoy       710,fantasy
the movie here is very refined there is less action than i hoped and less complications its just like a feature length translation of a cartoon episode but in the compilation onlyhugh jackman in the lead role is a standout but more credit should be given to the two veterans ian mckellan and patrick stewart after the dodgey turn of the obi wan role in spawn and the rather lacking performance of kris kristopherson in blade it is great to see two such respectable actors as mckellan and stewart commiting so much quality and belivability to something this trivialthe story is extremely concise but all round the performances make this more a character based work it was great to see park staying present in his off the wall job as toad did you notice the pole move he did at the top of the elevator shaft an evident reference to his previous and most famous film role as darth maul he has 3 hits to his name now though his casting as the headless horsemen can almost be taken as an insult he does not get half the credit he deserves for his talent of mixing action and characteri wanted more wolverine action easily the best character of the series i suppose the lack of fight scenes in general though made this more a kids experience and gave more light to the characters i look forward to sequel i suspect they did with this what was done with the toy story pair have just enough of a good thing in the original to make the sequel twice as entertaining i suspect they will toss in all the action scenes and enjoy greater success with part ii the latest craze seems to be beating originals mi 2 toy story 2 star wars i hannibal and the mummy returns has already topped its originals domestic tally and is showing strength overseas deserves a 7510,fantasy
i thought this movie was very cool the special effects were nice hugh jackman as logan was cool i loved this movie if you havent seen this movie before see it if you have see it again i give it 1010 i thought this movie was really good its got humor action and a little bit of sadness in it this movie does not disappoint,fantasy
when i was about 6 or 7 years old i collected cards comics and toys  i even watched the cartoon  i loved it because it was such a great original idea  therefore when i saw the first preview of the movie i was thrilled  everyone was perfectly cast in their parts  the acting was great because everyone was their parts  i mostly enjoyed famke janssen as dr jean grey and james marsden as scott summerscyclops  famke is just a great actress whom i admire for her ability to play people of all trades you may remember her as evelyn price in house on haunted hill  she does great in all of her movies  and for james this movie is a great stretch for him  he has almost the fewest lines i believe ray park takes the fewest but even without lines his acting is great  he too can play many different types of characters  the movie is about a young girl roguepaquin who after discovering her powers runs away from home  while on the road she meets a drifter loganwolverinejackman with similar problems as her  they are alike in the fact that they are gifted  so after getting on the road and after having a proper aquaintance they run into some trouble  they are taken to a safe place where they meet many people with gifts  while there rogue comes familiar with robert drakeicemanashmore  logan meets the creator professor charles xavierstewart and his task force including scott summerscyclopsmarsden jean greyjanssen and ororo munroestormberry it is explained to him that their nemesis erik magnus lehnsherrmagnetomckellen and his confidants raven darkholmemystiqueromijnstamos mortimer toynbeetoadpark and victor creedsabretoothmane believe that there is a war brewing between mutants and humans and it is there duty to keep balance with humans and mutants and stop magneto overall its a great movie  perfect acting perfect casting everything was perfect  all of my expectations were met and even conquered  there are a few injokes that relate back to the comics  hilarious  everything is believable about this movie  this is one of the best movies of the summera,fantasy
as a long time comic book fan i looked forward to the movie and it fulfilled my expectations  my favorite character is wolverine and hugh jackman fit the role even if he was an aussie  tho i was disappointed that sabretooth barely had any lines  this is one of the best comic book adaptations next to batman and the crow  i look forward to the sequel,fantasy
though in general comic adaptations are very bad this one are not im not a big fan ive read a few i find this movie to be one of the best i have ever seensinger the usual suspects delivers a powerful cast the heavyweights mckellen and stewart are always good but the one that stand out is hugh jackman his character logan or wolverine is a bar jumping heart breaking and fighter with a heart if gold that in every line shines with selfconfident an insecurity at the same timebryan has also mellowed down the super hero aspect and concentrated on the fact that it is hard to be unusal and differenti gave this film of course a 10 and i am looking foward to a sequel which will be or i hope directed by singer,fantasy
the film was very entertaining with hugh jackman particularly good patrick stewart was very well cast as prof x etc etcbut i did feel at the end of the film that the whole adventure didnt amount to much because the most of the film was taken up introducing the characters and then the whole scene with the mutant school this was inevitable i suppose because it was necessary to make all the right introduction as a movie separate from the comic books but i did feel slightly unsatisfied when it finishedmaybe this was intended because it seems certain that there will be sequels but i would have liked to see a slightly longer story,fantasy
 is a fun thrilling movie that gets your adrenaline pumping and your brain spinning at the same time  it works very well combining special effects good screenwriting and excellent actorsbeing both a viewer of the saturday morning cartoon and a reader of the comic books i felt that the film succeeded in generating new publicity and attention towards the genre and still pleased the experienced fanspatrick stewart ian mckellan newcomer at the time hugh jackman and anna paquin are all convincing as mutants with extraordinary and powerful mutant abilities like superhealing retractable claws mindinvading telepathy literal magnetism and other powers  also the underlying themes of accept those who are different and teamwork is the best method are sure to please both parents and youngstersthe film works because instead of always resorting to meaningless violence mi2 im looking your way surrealistically shows the concepts of love diversity persistence and suffering  i liked how each member of the team must learn something about their lives before they can work efficiently wolverine about his past rogue about running away from her problems etcetera  overall i thought this was an exceptional film no doubt thanks to writerdirector bryan singer that entertained thrilled and interest me  worth 9 out of 10 dollars,fantasy
i say relievingly because theres always an inner fear that lies silent in our hearts when a piece of pop culture especially comics and novels is put on the big screen doesnt disappoint as others have its a truly good movie i suppose for avid fans which i am not the movie may lack certain key characters or twist facts nonetheless the movie was great in its own right without judging it on preconceived ideas and notions what i loved most was that the director took the movie seriously so adults could enjoy itwith or without the kids brian singer scores well in taking fantasy and putting it in a real life world so we could relate to it betterso overall a solid film a great base for a sequelanother danger area for a good 1st movie however if singer gets the nod again as director im sure well get another winner,fantasy
i am a devout follower of the in comic form and was thoroughly excited when i heard of this film are one of the best comics ever produced by marvel and certainly the first choice to lead marvel back into the film industry yet this film still wasnt perfect many of the scenes were impressive a lot of good acting and familiar charcters that diehard fans will recognise allinall this film was designed to introduce the world to the it doesnt have a lot of the deep story or plot threads that are evident in the comics but it provides the base for a sequel whoich will inevitably come considering that this was done on a smaller budget than usual this is a good film the use of littleknown actors helped can you imagine some big name star ie keanu reeves as wolverine though the story seemed to be centred too much around wolverine and rogue good start for marvel i think,fantasy
this movie is the perfect example of a summer blockbuster done right all the elements were in place there was a welldeveloped storyline 30 years in the making and directorcowriter bryan singer from the usual suspects spends enough time on character development and story that the movie does not adopt the feel many scifiaction films do of simply being a vehicle for destructionthe action is good but not overwhelming and the better parts are based on the interpersonal relationships between the characters the acting is very good the movie has one actor from about every other extremely popular scifi movie series the two leading mutants are patrick stewart aka capt picard who is perfect for this role ian mckellen gandalf in the upcoming lord of the rings trilogy is also quite good as the evil genius magneto i really liked ray parks also darth maul character toad the only bad guy other than magneto with any personalityanna paquin and hugh jackman are very good as rogue and wolverine the central characters here though if youre a familiar with the comics paquin will look a little strange until the end rogue is portrayed as too much of a kid here for my tastes but it doesnt detract largely from the story the other are fine as well the relationship between wolverine cyclops james marsden and jean grey famke jannsen from the bond series while im at it provide the wittiest dialogue halle berrys storm is sort of removed on a personal level from the other and her dialogue is the worst among them but the makeup and appearance of her character more than make up for itoverall this was a really enjoyable movie well worth the two hours it ran and has me looking forward to the sequel,fantasy
the movie is one of the best movies that i have seen i love hugh jackmans representation of the broding wolverine and oscar winner anna paquin was marvelous as rouge she i think would be good in anything she did and i basically loved the entire movie so much that i spent over thirty dollars just going to see it at the movie theatre five times i also have watched over one hundred times since i bought it twice on tape because i broke one tape i know the movie by heart and i just think that it is a really good movie and i am looking foward to the sequels thanks for reading,fantasy
not because i consider this a good film because like the first superman its all buildup and never seems to arrive and even the action isnt that good so hopefully like the superman films number two will be much better,fantasy
its a pretty good fun movie especially if youre into that scifi comic book stuff  it gets a little hokey in spots but nowhere near as far as something like starship troopers which may just be trying to be campy on purpose  the acting from ian mckellen  patrick stewart is very good the rest are ok  special effects  audio on the dvd at least make this a good rental or buy to test out your system,fantasy
i love marvel comics and am pretty much a fan of the  this movie does a pretty good job with what they had to work with  the thing about making a movie based on a comic book is that you have too much to be able to put into a move  so the next question is what do you cut out  i think they did a good job with getting magnetos group together  i think that most of us fans would have liked a little more origin story line for the and what about the original like angel and ice  man  for this to be truly successful it has to be a series,fantasy
as far as comic book adaptations go there seem to be two kinds of film the good ones tim burtons batmans and the hideously bad ones superman iv batman returns batman forever etc the 2000 adaptation of belongs in the former category thanks to some excellent casting and a well thoughtout storypeople have criticised the film as deviating too much from the official canon i kind of suspect these people are the same geniuses who levelled the same criticism at batman so i will run the following question by you all suppose that you had some kind of trait that made you extremely different from the rest of the populace would you be running around in multicoloured spandex parading around like a hero or would you be having deep crises about how you react to other peoples fear as a sufferer of a presentday equivalent of the mutations shown in this film i know what my answer is the modification of the story to show rogue as a young woman who has only just discovered that everyone she touches is severely wounded by it was a master stroke not only was it great to see how human the mutants really are more so than the normies in this film as a matter of fact but casting a delicate intelligent young woman like anna paquin in the role was a perfect capitalisation on the writing coupling this with the way wolverine is shown as the result of a horrid military experiement who is now just trying to survive as best he can was a brilliant idea too hugh jackman was a perfect choice for the role as a man whose past combines pieces of these two characters histories in a more figurative sense i found these two actors utterly believeable in all respectsthe only thing wrong with the movie in my view is that the think tank which made these excellent moves with the good guys ran out of steam when the bad guys were written mystique toad and sabretooth just dont have the same level of character development allocated to them as wolverine rogue cyclops and storm mystique gets one line in the whole film the rest are her pretending to be someone else and toad is merely there to provide excuses for gratuitous special effects shots capping that off is the fact that magneto is shown as a survivor of the holocaust who takes on the same kind of attitude as the nazis granted he is being somewhat provoked by the section of humanity that is afraid of mutants but once again my experience as part of a small percentile of the populace that has had outright lies told about it by the rest tells me that more motivation would have been required for magneto to become so like his real enemyaside from the uneven development of the characters however this is another neargreat modern adaptation of a comic book it works on numerous levels and is extremely pleasant to watch,fantasy
this movie was like a glass half fullas much as i do not enjoy debating whether a glass of milk is half full or half empty in this case i have no choice but to join in and declare that this movie is like a glass half full as we were only able to catch glimpses of what this movie is fully capable of showing uspersonally i believe the decision to move the story along at a brisk pace with hardly any pause has cost us in that we are unable to get to know any of the mutant heroes in depth  and there were lots of them  they were therefore reduced to cardboard mock ups providing thrills and spills at the whim of puppet handlers and the movie suffered as a result since the story was now completely plot driven and relying on set pieces none of which were ingenuous or originalthere was great potential for characterisation in this movie as well as great potential for a much stronger themeinstead the theme appears to have been buried and forgotten much in favour of putting bums on seats and i mean twelveyearold onestake the case of wolverine for example a character begging to be explored in full  instead we were teased a lot about his past but learnt nothing   or professor xavier or rogue  i am not impressed with the reason magneto turned bad either  i understand his paranoia but it is no justification for his subsequent actions  i expect the real reason is probably on the cutting room floori have not read the comics and i hate it when comics are adapted for the movies as virtually no one would be fully happy with the final outcome but even though i never heard of before the movie what i saw here was great potential but suffering as a result of the commercialisation of hollywood  i long for the old days of hollywood when movies were work of art that could entertain for generations  isnt one of these movies i suspect a reworking of the movie and its underlying theme could benefit us but not the moneymen,fantasy
this movie was a lot like the comic books it was awesome the uniforms were awesome too there was good directing there was good acting by hugh jackman and patrick stuart it was worth seeing i didnt really find anything wrong with it at all dont listen to all those haters out there theyre just tasteless jubilee iceman and shadowcat made an appearance in the movie go see it now you will go see you will not argue you will not remember anything after this jedi mind trick is over,fantasy
first i must say that i have never read an comic so my critics refer only on the filmat the beginning the entrance sequence in the concentration camp i though i was in schindlers list but not in a scifi movie and i waited in vain for an explanation for that phenomenon and there are some more problems that ran through the whole film is no typical popcorn movie because the suspense is too low there is too less action and there were better special fx in other films it is also no final speech for more tolerance towards minorities because this aspect stays surface and although there is always the talk about war between humans and mutations the plot stays empty and finally this film takes itself much to serious there are no jokes no gags no sense for dark humor as we have seen it in blade for example and then the socalled great cast well the actors do a solid job but great patrick steward performing the leader of the bunch is nothing else but playing captain picard in a wheelchair ian mckellen is a great actor thats right but if you wanna see great performances watch his other films i dont know why halle berry stays in the background with her role and otherwise why wolverines part is so important although hugh jackman is a much better actor then russell crowe from the rest of the cast  famke jansen james mardsen anna paquin  you get the usual quality you would expect but none of them has deserved an oscar for their rolesnow there are also some good points about its very difficult to make good comic adaptations without compromising yourself to much and being ridiculous director bryan singer has definitely made one of the better comic adaptations although this film is still too overrated in my opinion 610,fantasy
there was so much prerelease buzz surrounding this movie  as a result i think that going into the theater i expected too much from this movie i thought this was going to be a movie that would rival the matrix i thought that i was going to walk out of the theater feeling so inspired by the movie that id want to go to a store and purchase action figures and im 25 years old well i wasnt disappointed it just wasnt as good a movie as i had hoped it would be what can i say about hugh jackman as wolverine he did a great job he was excellent in that role i liked seeing ian mckellen as magneto it was great to see him play a villain i also liked seeing patrick stewart as dr charles xavier they both were perfectly cast i especially liked their chessplaying scene together i didnt like halle berry as storm though she had little screen time and any attractive black actress couldve played that character i didnt like the mystique character all that much either and why cast rebecca romijn in the role although she kicked some butt she was just basically there to be looked at and to wiggle her nicelyshaped body i wish anna paquins character rogue wouldve been given something to do all she did was spend her time moping i wouldve liked to see her extract the energy from one of the villains but i liked seeing anna all grown up she has come a long way from the cartwheeling little girl in the piano i also think that the jean gray character shouldve been given a lot more to do with her telekenesis but i certainly enjoyed seeing the very beautiful famke janssen in that role much was said about this movies special effects prior to the movies release i found the visual effects to be rather fakelooking they were certainly disappointingnothing that we havent seen before in fact the fight sequences themselves the moves that the characters had were a lot more notable than the visual effects the movies biggest plus that for an action movie it actually had a story and that the director focused on the story i thought that the ending was very interesting and so was the music that accompanied the final scene overall is good as a summer movie and its a good way to spend two hours it did rekindle my interest in comic books reading them not collecting them hopefully the sequel will be much better i would like to see a different set of mutants with superhuman abilities that are even more amazing its going to take a lot to top the matrix,fantasy
putting the worlds favorite comic heros into a live action movie is a challenge indeed  is a favorite because of the difficult social themes of adolescence tolerance difference achievement bigotry  top notch science fiction forms the background of the thoughprovoking comic series  the film succeeds in placing interesting characters in stunning settings while facing disturbing social problems  it also succeeds as a highly imaginative action flickthis film includes a very strong performance by hollywood newcomer hugh jackman well supported by superstars like patrick stewart halle berry and fellow rising star anna paquin who is perhaps best known for her childhood debut in oscarwinner the piano s visual effects are stunning as expected  but the one thing that really surprises me is the nearprefect casting  famke janssen is beyond perfectly cast as jean patrick stewart and ian mckellen seem born for the roles of professor xavier and magneto and the naturally radiant halle berry is wonderful as storm  the scenes shared by jean jackman as wolverine and james marsden as cyclops are very human and the script and direction manage to inject a lot of clever and lighthearted humor into a relatively dark plot,fantasy
when i learned that was inproduction i was looking forward to seeing that bigbucksandquality movie but when i watched it i was pleased at the begging then i started thinking why storm and cyclops have so small roles why some scenes that were on the first draft were wiped out in the shooting script and finally why the romance between wolverine and jane grey i mean just tell us were will it leads oh yeah i forgot there is going be a sequel so the result is that are not a selfcontainted movie because singer was strugling to make this a franchise so there is no point in making this film without a sequel but this is a very well directed movie it has the greatest art direction since the terminator 2 film wolverine is played very nice by hugh jackman magneto is played very good and professorx too but singer is strangely very attracted by magneto so in all the movie although magneto kicks asses he is consider to be a sociopath thats just not what magneto must be considered to be anyway despite of these weaknesses is a well made thank god it is no batman  robin crap and i hope the sequel is a better movie pscyclops and storm must have bigger parts in the sequel ps2natalie portman would look nicer in the part of rogue,fantasy
there are three wonderful performances in this movie hugh jackman is awesome as wolverine patrick stewart is calm and commanding as xavier but the heart of the film is anna paquins rogue the filmmakers decided to make rogue a real person rather than the fake cartoon version some fans still dont get the fact that making rogue real gives the movie depth ignore them paquins rogue makes this movie a film worth watching and thinking about rogue is terribly tragic because she is a real teenage girl with a tragic situation and paquin is brilliant as rogue see this film the scenes between paquin and jackman are truly touching trust me this is a very well acted film see it,fantasy
i may be slightly biased ive watched the cartoon since i was eight and i thought that the movie was a very good adaptation even though bryan singer didnt stick exactly to the story he helped people who had never seen the cartoon or read the comic still be able to understand the movie the only part that was miscasted was anna paquin as rogue you can only take so many puppydoglooks despite the fact that i few important characters are missing the movie is still good and ive even heard talk of a sequel,fantasy
oh mythis was badreally badi rented this thinking patrick stuartian mckellen it may be goodwrongthe plot was absolutely terriblethe acting wasnt very good eitheri found myself at times questioning the moviei was never a reader of the comic bookand i may have seen the cartoon version of it maybe once or twicebut this was badcomic book stories do not translate into good moviesthis is a perfect example,fantasy
im not an fan but i was overblown by this movie the cast setting costume storyline and everything else is perfect i guess bryan singer really did a good job herehugh jackman is perfect as wolverine and i could not imagine him playing other role nor another person playing this role wolverine is not my favorite character though but obviously hes the directors favorite because the whole movie revolves around himjames marsden is the perfect cyclops unlike other peoples suggestion he would be great playing spiderman too but somehow the role goes to tobey maguireother casts also suit perfectly into their alteregos i dont see any flaws in this areathe storyline is perfect not too ordinary not too draggy it would be hard to achieve the same standard should they decide to come up with a sequel or sequels,fantasy
hugh jackman rules where was gambit where was beast otherwise the movie was great i thought the actors did a great job and it tied many of the plots into the movie i cant wait for the sequel the fight scenes were great and i loved the chemistry between wolverine and cyclops and jean grey i liked iceman too the movie was just a good action movie not the greatest film but a fun popcorn movie hugh jackman rules my friend a hugh jackman fanatic said so  out of ,fantasy
one of the coolest action flick of the latest time it was almost better than the matrix great actors and some cool fights i always did watch the cartoons but i found the movie better i hope there will be a sequel to this movie whit wolferine again the coolest of them all watching this movie makes you wanne be a mutant your self  maybe the wasnt a great storyline but it did workt for me and the biggest and wours thing of the movie was that its so short i could have watch it for hours and hours,fantasy
good comic movies are few and far between and none of them have ever really been marvelbased  sure blade wasnt too bad but it was nothing like the original superman or batman movieswell has changed all thati was excited about this movie but not expecting too much however as i sat through the movie i felt that goofy fanboy smile creep across my face as i realized that this movie got the point what the were all about not a good mutantbad mutant battle but individual people and the prejudice mutants face  every doubt or concern about the directors previous lack of knowledge of the series or even casting choices for certain characters faded as i took everything in  they got it all righthugh jackman was a perfect wolverine as was patrick stewart for professor x  actually the entire cast really played their parts well and seemed to understand their characters personalities  even the cyclopsjean greywolverine love triangle was added as was the cyclopswolverine rivalry  everything from wolverines bub to cameos from iceman jubilee and shadowcat kept me satisfied  i so wanted to be taken seriously and it was and finally a new comic movie has finally been given respect the special effects just added more to the overall excitement and the plot and dialogue sounded like a comic book entry take that last comment as authentic i know they have sequels lined up for the future and i pray that those new movies will be shown as much care as this one  still this one is a fun ride and it gives me hope that a spiderman movie might actually be decent after all  i cant wait to get this one on dvd,fantasy
x men reminded me so much of mystery men but without the comedy  this is no critisism because both film are good and have there own merits x men is about the struggle between battling mutants who all have super human powers patrick stewert is the leader of the good mutants and ian mckellen plays the bad guy why are  the bad guys always english the story is fairly good although you cant help but think this is just a precurser to a sequal because it takes a fair chunk of the movie just to explain who the mutants are and what their supernatural backgrounds are special affects are very good as you would expect and the sound is quite amazing as long as you dont take x men to seriously you should enjoy it 7 out of 10,fantasy
ive been reading all the different comments about the movieyes its not true to the comics  yes its riddled with inconsistancies and goofs  yes the beast wasnt there although i was a little disappointed with that ommisionbut if you look at the movie from a neutral view i thought it was a fanastic movie  to take a movie and rip it apart because it isnt true to what has been laid before it for canonical reasons is ridiculousi went into the theater not expecting anything  because if i did go in and started to compare the movie with the comics and the animated series i feel i would have lost the whole point of the experience the special effects are just that  special  no huge cg stuff except for mystiques shape changes but the sfx we subtle i actually did double takes on some of the scenes  come on didnt you kinda freak out when the girl walked through professor xaviers door  its visual effects like that that make a lasting impression on moviegoersi have yet to see a movie that takes a booktv series and does it justice on the big screen with the exception of hunt for red october  but this movie comes awfully close,fantasy
after seeing 4 sub par incredible hulk movies and seeing captain america which may have been one of the worst movies ive seen period it was nice to see a marvel comic based film that appeared to have had some effort put into it this premise was great because its difficult to disagree with the villain magneto on his stance and his bitterness is understandable great performances by the cast and pretty good special effects the ending was a little dry and kind of didnt add up but all in all it was an enjoyable film i cant wait for the sequel,fantasy
i was very disappointed upon seeing the film having waited for so long which is not to say it was a bad film just not what id hoped for firstly the film was way too short with the minimum of plot and character development secondly what happened to gambit and the beast also rogue was nothing like the sassy suthern gal of the animated series rather she was a whimpering puppy i suppose if you have never heard of the then this is a worthwhile introduction otherwise i would wait for a sequel with more characters and a halfdecent plot having said all that the action was excellent and the acting was generally of a high standard though barring a few exceptions the film wasnt particularly original or gripping 710,fantasy
id been looking forward to this movie for months before it opened due to the casting of ray park alone and then one day i woke up and suddenly realized holy crud this is going to be a comic book movie and until opening day i had an uneasy lump in the pit of my stomach telling me that all comic book movies are doomed to suck but actually succeeded in breaking the curse and turned out to be rather intelligent and extremely engrossing the acting is excellent on all accounts but one that means you halle berry and combined with good special effects and great directing on the part of brian singer manages to overcome a fairly weak plot magnetos going to unwittingly kill the worlds leaders oh no why not just ask him to postpone another year until dubyas in office and everybody is subsequently happy overall a great movie thats even managed to get me started watching the cartoon and reading the comics,fantasy
i hadnt read the comics although ive seen the cartoons the made a great leap from comics to the big screen               the general plot was simple enough but with enough umph to make a good job of it  the special effects were excellent and the acting from wolverine and rogue was especially good  halle berrys and famke janssens wasnt all too good  the screenplay was great but the direction was a tiny bit poor               basically if you ever liked the comic or the cartoon then this is a must but if you never did then id try to persuade you to,fantasy
a certain amount of scepticism was my first reaction when i heard of the making of this movie it has been tried several times to bring comiccharacters to life and somehow its never been a big success when i heard of the casting of actors like patrick stewart and ian mckellen to play the roles of xavier and magneto i also became aware singer was trying to bring some real acting in this movie and not trying to make comicbook copies only the result is even better than i expected hugh jackman anna paquin and the two great actors mentioned above make this movie worth watching the story and plot havent disappeared amongst the special effects and even some characters are deepened and you feel the tension and involvement with characters story and people all in all not the best movie in the world but due to good acting a fairly good plot a nice story and some beautiful scenes as well as not too much and too heavy aggressive scenes this movie has become one of the better comicbook films and guarantees almost two hours of fun and entertainment four stars out of five i would say,fantasy
i began reading comics again in 1982 after completing my 2 year national service and entering law school it was the that revived my interest having picked up paul smiths final issue the one with mastermind on the cover at the corner shop back in the days before speciality stores even existed in singapore i have stopped reading for a long time now though i did check out chris claremonts disappointing return to the book that made his name that title has failed to excite me since the 80s but thanks to bryan singer that sense of wonder has returned the movie has been talked about for too long as the bestselling comic book of all time the weight of expectation was considerable furthermore as the comic industry as a whole is in a crisis much has been invested into the movie as the event to save comics no doubt about it is an unqualified success given the inherent difficulties in putting together a plausible film dramatisation of superheroes singer has managed to deliver a movie guaranteed to please both fans and casual moviegoers alike much of this success is clearly owed to singers clarity of vision to be faithful to the universe as the young director himself stated in an interview thus we are spared cringeworthy moments that dragged down the superman  batman movies not to mention the risible movies previously attempted on marvel characters reb brown as captain america anyone in this respect the casting has been superb notably the rather fortunate circumstances by which aussie hugh jackson ended up as the canadian wolverine originally the role had been won by dougray scott but an accident on the mi2 set forced scott to withdraw leaving the way open for jackson having witnessed scotts tepid performance in mi2 and jacksons dynamic turn as wolverine its fair to say that the movie lucked out patrick stewart  hugh mckellen bring their wealth and talent to the meaty parts of charles xavier never professor x and magneto mckellen is particularly memorable consigning to history the awful comic book movie villains of yore hackmans luther  nicholsons joker the plot is tight the motivations logical and the effects are incredible ray darth maul parks toad has to be seen to be believedthe rest of the cast perform their scenes competently without fuss except maybe for a sorely underused halle berry she does look good though with storms patented white hair but its jackson and mckellen who steal the show matrix proved last year that moviegoers could assimilate comic book concepts and storytelling thats what it was folks establishes that the source material can certainly stand on its own now if they could start people reading the damn things,fantasy
most of the movies i have seen this summer have been a disappointment this one was not  having been a marvel comic book reader when i was young i thought it would be real hard to get the look and feel of the on film this film got it right  not since the first batman film has anyone made a really good comic book movie they make everything look good even the storm  it may not be the best hollywood movie but for a summer blockbuster it is very entertaining,fantasy
this is my favorite movie ever ive never met anybody who doesnt like it i have it on dvd my cousins have it on vhs everyone likes it great cast brian singer really did a great job i give it a 50 thumbs up,fantasy
there are three rules for movies that are adapted from comics  first the movie must spend time covering the back story of its characters for newcomers such as i before it launches into its first adventure  but secondly the movie must do this quickly enough that it doesnt turn off longtime fans of the comic who are likely to be the movies greatest critics  thirdly the movie must serve as a flagship for sequels  that means it has to leave us wanting to know and see more about the characters succeeds all three accounts  although there are more characters than in most super hero movies writerdirector bryan singer and writing partner tom desanto introduce good guys professor x dr jean grey cylops storm rogue and especially wolverine efficiently and satisfyingly  they do a similarly good job helping us get to know the chief villain magneto but less so with the other bad guys  wed like to know more about sabretooth toadand particularly mystiquebut alas theres not enough time to do so finally the film left me wanting to see to see a sequelparticularly to find out more about wolverinethe acting for the most part is good  patrick stewart professor x and ian mckellen magneto are both strong presences  famke janssen and james marden are fine as jean grey and cyclops respectively but halle berrys looks horrible as storm and her acting matches her looks  anna paquin is nice as rogue but we sense well see a lot more of her in the future the breakout star of the movie however is hugh jackman as the feral wolverine  like most comic strips strives for something deeper than just super heroes doing their thing  the theme of the movie is intolerance  thats evident from the first scene set in a nazi concentration camp to scenes of sen robert kelly bruce davison trying to pass laws requiring mutants to be registered  the movies point is that like other humans there are good and bad mutantsall in all not a bad start for what is likely to be a longliving franchise,fantasy
ive never been an comic book reader but i did know that the were a large collection of mutants with a wide array of super powers some worked for the forces of good some evil so when i heard that this stew had been made into a movie my first thought was that this would be a mess i could imagine the moviemakers wandering all over the map without focus making a real hash of things what a surprise when the movie proved my fears groundless what could have happened an unfocused mess didnt happen and the chief thanks belongs with the screenplay it made the movie  its tight well crafted and focused its not played for camp but straight up with lots of help from a talented cast and direction makes for a very entertaining fantasy film i recommend it highly when fxsupported escapism is needed,fantasy
i am a big fan so when i saw this the first thing i thought was wow finally there was a movie that didnt completely destroy a comic ie batman 3 there was only one thing that i could complain about and that was the choice for magneto granted ian mckellen is a good actor its just the fact he doesnt seem imposing enough to be thes greatest foe,fantasy
i have read some of the criticisms that people have made on this movie  i do agree that more could have been done to explain the characters in this movie  i do not agree that this condemns the entire movie  if people are worried that this movie will not appeal to people who have never heard of the they are extremely wrong  i know this through firsthand knowledge  i took friends of mine who have never even heard of the and who never really got into any kind of comic books as children  they were pleasantly amazed at the quality of this movie  as we left the theater all i heard from other moviegoers were nothing but good statements about the movie  those people that have criticized this movie are not looking for enjoyment in a movie but rather some kind of artistic value  this movie was for entertainment to the masses not for some kind of ecoaward to the minority of the population  sit back and enjoy and forget about reading between the hidden lines,fantasy
 felt more like the pilot episode of a tv series than a featurelength movie this may because the movie basically introduces the characters and doesnt do much beyond that theres very little story here what story there is ends so quickly that you cant help but wonder where the rest of it is in truth this story with its ensemble cast would probably be better suited for tv where over a number of episodes they could get into all the characters this movie focuses mostly on wolverine and rogue and avoids the other cyclops and the rest seemed more like extras than starsas for the translation of the characters to the big screen hugh jackman is excellent as wolverine patrick stewart and ian mckellan do pretty well as professor x and magneto but some of the other characters dont translate so well toad and sabretooth chewbacca didnt look too threatening as villains as for the other they looked okay but ill have to wait until the next movie when they actually do something,fantasy
yes ive read but im not a hardcore fan and hardcore fans will undoubtedly have problems with the movie  i thought that most of the changes were well thought out and beneficial to the movie though  rogues powers that were stolen from ms marvel dont appear in the movie and neither does her constant whining about being forever denied the simple joys of human touch  anna paquin makes the character more real by getting the tragic part of the character through to the audience but not hammering it into them with the overblown melodrama the comic has been known for rogue is a much more likeable character in the movie than she ever has been before though the name rogue is still stupid being a holdover from her days as an evil mutant and so named because she steals powers from others  it made little sense in this context but if they didnt call her rogue your average fan wouldnt have known who she wasstorm was also made likeable in this movie a herculean feat to be sure she lost all of the melodramatic lines that made her stale in the comics and came across as more of a real personthe special effects were great considering the limited budget they had to work with  they didnt overdo any of the power effects and chose to use them sparingly but use them effectively  the scene where cyclops blew the roof off of the train station was beautiful and the fight on top of the statue of liberty has got to be one of the best movie fight scenes ever just for the setting if for no other reasonon the other hand i didnt feel that mystique was changed in a positive way  i dont know what the deal was with her costuming and no mention was made of her relationship with roguewolverine was well done though this comes from a guy who has never much liked wolverine  hugh jackson certainly looks the part and plays it well though he is too tall  one is left to wonder why his claws are straight at the end of the movie after magneto has repeatedly twisted and bent them its clear that wolverine doesnt like cyclops from their first meeting but what isnt clear is why  the rivalry between them could have been expanded on and explained a little though the love triangle is still basically there  i have always said that jeans real mutant power is the ability to make all the male fall in love with her and it seems that hasnt changed  the point is that cyclops doesnt seem to really do anything to make wolverine dislike him which causes wolverine to come off as a jerk but then maybe that isnt all that inappropriatecameos from kitty pryde bobby drake and jubilee were appreciated by the comics fans though i was hoping to see their involvement expandedi understand that singer wanted to include nightcrawler but budget limitations made it difficult  maybe the sequel will throw him in  i can only guess that the hellfire club will be the adversaries next time aroundanyway i thought that the movie was as true to the comic as was efficient and the changes that were made were mostly good choices  hardcore fans are being a little hard on it,fantasy
the first thing i have to say about x men is this  alarm bells were going off in my head the very second i first heard about this movie  the reason is that the world of x men the comic book  animation series is lets admit it right now one of the most elaborate science fiction universes this side of star wars  how can you possibly please the newbies and yet not alienate the long time fansand this isnt meant to stereotype but you know how deadserious scifi fans can get  i should know sort of being one myselfwell it turns out that nobody needed to worry  amazingly this is not only one of the better movies of the year a phenomenal year for highprofile bad movies its also one of the smartest  i like how they focused on character development as that is the strength of the original comics as well  and i liked how several characters from the comics were given cameos of sortstwo little details i have to pick at here  im not sure that i liked how they killed off the most interesting antagonist and in an unnecessarily gruesome scene at that  also make sure that you get to watch the bonus scenes at the end of the video  they clarify a lot of the various subplots so i cant think of why they were cut out at allotherwise this movie was excellent and i highly recomend it even if you dont like comic book movies  this one will win you over,fantasy
i used to read the comic books when i was a kid i had my favorite characters and my issues many people have done the same to see these characters come to life was amazing personally i always liked wolverine the best and jackmans portrayal was uncanny his ability to capture the brooding loner attitude was perfect marsden jensen paquin and stewart are equally good the only true complaint i have about this movie is berry performance she had none of storms leadership qualities as she does in the comic also i missed some classic players as gambit beast and my other favorite jubilee now although i understand that gambit came after the original beast was professor xs 1st mutant jubilee was named in the cast but i could not find her in the film perhaps in the sequel these characters could be featured more also rouge was from georgia not missippi all in all i give this film they lose one for accuracy,fantasy
i am a true fan  this movie was a ridiculous impersonation of decades of legendary entertainment  it made little attempt to stick to the comics or cartoons not even with the costumes  in fact cyclops made a joke about the yellow spandex that many of us wanted to see  instead of appearing modern and futuristic the came off as cheap and pathetic  the real disappointment was that of rogue who was portrayed as a mewling weakling barely out of a training bra  rogue whose powers include flight superhuman strength and the draining of powers couldnt even free herself from the seat of a car  this is not the fault of anna paquin whom i feel acted just as her part was written  hugh jackman wolverine was also outstanding in his role  he managed to show the wang leather of wolverine along with the caring side usually reserved only for those he trusted morph and jean  james marsden cyclops played the jackass to a t  however jean and storm couldnt have been more useless had they stood around and played pattycake  in her fight with toad storm quickly walks away and pauses to hold up a hand as if she were expecting a highfive instead of a boot to the head  jean uses her powers to float a needle across the table and to shut a closet door  oooh  all of the women save mystiquewho could scarcely be called a woman with her lizardlike appearancewere pathetically well pathetic  also the movie was lacking the spice that was provided by characters such as gambit nightcrawler and beast  there was more chemistry between jean and wolverine than that of her and her husband  this movie was carried by the appearance of patrick stewart whom i felt was the obvious choice for the allseeing professor  fifteen minutes into the movie the only reason i had for watching was to count how many mistakes were being made  and i lost count,fantasy
i had some serious issues with on many levels first off i feel that too little time was devoted to explaining the mutants and their origins and abilities the only two people we learned about were wolverine and rogue throughout the film questions arose why does that guy sniff the air what does that guy shoot from his eyes further the entire effort came off as a bit forced to me everyone seemed bored just being there and if youre a fan of the comic there are far too many holes to allow granted only so much can be shown in a 90 minute movie but this film begged for a bigger budget and a longer running time try again,fantasy
let me say up front that im not a devotee of the comic book series and knew very little about the story prior to watching the film however i was anxious to see the movie as it had received a lot of publicity during its theatrical release and the trailers for it looked enticing after watching the movie on dvd i was impressed with the special effects and the surround sound employed but the story left much to be desired the idea of a race of mutants living amongst us and possessing extraordinary powers has a lot of potential i felt however that a much of that potential was wasted by the seemingly lacklustre story it certainly seemed as though the premise of this film was simply to introduce the characters and then create the setting for a hopefully better sequel for me the lack of resolution in this movie made it seem too much like a part1 rather than a movie capable of standing on its own merits watch it and see for yourself definitely worth a look on a rainy saturday if only for the fx510,fantasy
the film was very good for what it was   a comic book adaption which has been proved many times to be a risky business eg batman and robin one of the major problems ishow do you create an hour and a half long movie which has to incorporate about 30 years of comic book characters making it all understandable to people who have never heard of the but keeping it true to the comics all the while having an interesting plot line somehow this got done  admittedly if you are a massive fan of the comics some of the introduction is just repitition to what you already know but this cant be avoided  there are a few references to the comics what would you prefer  yellow spandex refers to the comic book costume but this doesnt take anything away from the movie if youve never seen a comic book beforethe actual casting is terrific  it does seem that halle berry who plays storm is just in the movie so lovers dont complain wheres torm   she doesnt actutally have a lot to do and what she does do in the movie could easily have been given to another characterframke janssen does very well in portraying her relationships with her teacher prof x her lover cyclops and her  well whatever wolverine is to her  interesting to note nothing mentioned about phoenix  possibly setting up for a future part in a sequelspeaking of which it seems very likely that a sequel will be done and after using this film to set up all the characters hopefully a more established plot can be madeanyway well worth seeing unless you hate scifi  fantasy  action films or if you love the comics so much youll hate seeing rogue as a young girl instead of a woman,fantasy
i mean these guys are cool but not better than themagnto is ok but not the besthe is played by ian mckellen sabertooth is very good with his cat like agility he is one mean guy he is played by tyler manemystiqe is cool because she can morph into other people toad is the bomb with his leaping ability he is one very cool character he is played by the man ray park,fantasy
i was actually surprised how much i enjoyed this movie  i dont usually like comic book movies even if the special effects are amazing which they definitely were in this one  this movie kept me entertained and interested almost the whole way through  the story line wasnt amazingly intricate but it was plenty there for a movie of this type  not too much unnecessary violence but plenty of opportunity for the to display their powers in entertaining ways  i hear theres going to be a sequel and honestly cant wait,fantasy
marching orders for the director make an entertaining actionheavy liveaction version of the comic book  spend a lot of money on costumes makeup and even more on special effects  be true to the comic book as much as possible  and above all take it seriouslywhats really amazing is that director bryan singer succeeds but the movie is still not the a adaptation that was possible  batman gave us the kind of reinvented actionpacked movie we were really after  and while a very very good film is by no means a great film  the only reason i can conceive of is just that singer is no better than his script  the screenplay for the usual suspects won an oscar and it was a great film the screenplay for apt pupil was amateurish and not at all thought out or researched and the result was a below average film  public access made little sense to me eitherfuture generations may have their own opinion of this movie or none at all but its nice to see someone made a decent movie out of these historical characters  considering the alternative spawn whoops ive gotta give these guys an a for effort but their movies a b810,fantasy
this movie rocks its so cool and it made me laugh too i was very impressed about how they used so much special effects i hope to soon see a sequel to this movie really soon they picked very good people to do the parts as well and that made it very interesting i love the movie,fantasy
as a comic fan i dont really like the books i used to like the classic stories but not the current stuff from that point of view i loved the movie though it featured some of the modern characters it was loyal to the classic theme the new costumes looked good and the cast was superb nice action scenes decent plot a great popcorn movie,fantasy
now this is what a comic book movie should be like action adventure fight scenes special effects sweet superheros with awesome superpowers has lifted the curse from marvel comics this film was amazing this is what star wars episode 1 was looking for in introducing characters to the world but we all know it fell short story runs like this mutants are outcast to the world and a senator robert kellybruce davison has taken it upon himself to be the leader in getting rid of these mutants trying to breech the gap between mutants and humans is a professor charles xavierpatrick stweart who runs a school for mutants but his best friend a mutant named magnetoian mckellen wants to rid the world of humans and for mutants to rule the world so its up to xavier and his team to stop them this is totally a comic book film from the get go the cgi opening the special effects the costumes the high powered action its like the pages were glue to a movie screen there are great performances too huge jackman is well on his way to hollywood action star thank you john woo for running the mi2 taping past when it was suppose to be done i liked dougray scott in that but i dont think that he would have done wolverine respect like jackman does rebecca romijnstamos is very cool as mystique she doesnt say much but has onscreen presence she looks gorgeous and she can fight this film lives up to and blows way beyond the hype finally we have a film lives up to its word this is a comic book fantasy that goes down with superman batman and blade as one of the best comic book films of all time is phat and a great thrill ride,fantasy
the movie was well thought out for the group it was aimed at to entertain the actorsactresses did a very good job  the one and only one actress that added any class to the movie was halle berry this is a person that has proved herself time and again as a very fine actress she deserves to be in a better class of movie than this,fantasy
i realized about 10 minutes into this movie that i at the tender age of 27 was not the target audience for this movie  this movie is for people who have played the video game heard about through conversation or was under 15 if this describes you then i suggest this movie  it is cute endearing and sometimes eventful  for people who have read the comics and have seen the evolution of the i doubt you will enjoy this  where is the nearly psychotic wolverine  in this movie we get a strangely compassionate watered down milk toast version  like everyone else in this movie the movie wanted to sell merchandising appeal to fast food restaurants and teenagers  it never wanted to explore the darker side of the comic  the part that makes it distinctively i want to see an rrated movie  unfortunately the popularity of this cheesy version will prevent that from ever happening,fantasy
 is the kind of movie that takes you in journey you will never forget is the kind of movie takes its cause very serious and for that reasons i think is one of the best films i ever seen first of all this film takes a 30 years of comic book title into a little more than 1 hour and 30 minutes that was a challenge that only a serious competent and talented director will ever accept in other words bryan singer bryan does a hell of a job in this masterpiece of cinema he introduces you into a very particular universe and makes you really enjoy it the first two scenes are impressive he takes you into a very dramatic and complex world and you like it then he takes you into a school that is full of mutant teenagers and you enjoy it he takes into a very actioned fx and fun world and you like it thanks to a very competent crew that knew how to shoot the scenes the light the actors the director of photography really knew and understood the for the direction the acting the cinemathography i think  the movie whorts 10 out of 10 the only mistakes where the middle of the script and the senator kellys death out of ,fantasy
i have seen this movie about three times and i love it  i used to watch the animated series when i was a kid and now i have seen the movie  the special effects were cool  i especially enjoyed rogues character and how anna paquin portrayed her anybody know if there is going to be a sequel,fantasy
 is a great scifi action film i am a fan of the comics and i did watch the incredible cartoon series from 19921998 bryan singer did a great job at staying true to the comic as best he could like the fact that he kept in the bitterness between scott cyclops summers and logan wolverine over jean grey there were a few things i didnt like like how rogue was a teenager with just the ability to absorb others memories and powers instead of the voluptuous women with also super strength invulnerability and the ability to fly which i hope they solve in a sequel because rogue is my favorite super hero out of them all besides just i also think they could have chosen a better set of villains besides like toad but thats really minor and i dont care to much nonetheless i thought the casting was incredible patrick stewart is the spitting image of professor x so was hugh jackman as wolverine and halle berry as storm basically everybody was besides the minor things i didnt like overall it was an incredible film,fantasy
i had no idea what the was  and 10 minutes into the film we realized that didnt matter  we rented it and instantly fell for it all  wonderfully directed the acting superb a compelling story line  everything that makes a movie  no matter its genre a great movie  see it,fantasy
what on earth are patrick stewart and sir ian mackellern doing in this daft film   mind you at least they have some onscreen chemistry together which is more than can be said for anyone else  hugh jackman is another russell crowetype moody australian but without the charismacant say the plot meant anything as it was the most rediculous load of monkey nuts ive ever heardbryan singer really needs a proper film to work on so he can reproduce the magic that was the usual suspectsi didnt hate it but was more bored really  guess you have to be a fan of the xblokes even though a few are women,fantasy
not sure what made me pick up this film though mostly positive comments from friends played some role was pleasantly surprised and thought that ian mckellan and patrick stewart magneto and xavier together elevated the film to solid territory where lesser actors could have destroyed the film liked the way the film took its time getting to the action as again a lesser film would have had more  and suffered for it a solid 355 stars,fantasy
 was a very well made film easily making it one of my favorite movies of all time the special effects were out of this world and the story was very well played it was very faithful to the original comics while still making it seem like a fresh idea i dont want to give away the ending but this motion picture is just set up for a sequel i hope there will be one my favorite character was loganwolverine played by hugh jackman he is one of those actors who really gets into character making me to believe the story is actually taking place my other favorite was mystique i enjoyed the effect when she changed shapes exceptionally convincing performance i also enjoyed this movie because patrick stewart who is one of my favorite actors of all time played prof xavier a part that was just made for himbut i mostly enjoyed this movie because the story was very well planed out and performed i blame the director for such a creative and inspirational piece sequel please,fantasy
good  follows storyline nicely  good choice for wolverinebad  choices for cyclops magneto and rogue could have been betterhoped that there would be more action  the sabertoothwolverine final battle had so much more potential  magneto looked silly being a little old man in a helmet,fantasy
having come to this movie with only the scantest of info about the comix and other preceding media ie theres mutants in them thar hills i thought this was a decent action flick with decent characters  i dont see it as worthy of either the earthshaking kudos or the flat dismissals it has garnered here as elsewhere  but the important question is am i the only person who thinks hugh jackman has a career because he looks an awful lot like clint eastwood circa the good the bad and the ugly,fantasy
ive not seen a comic hero from my childhood brought to the screen with this kind of devotion to the original since superman 1978making the real was equally difficult more so in many ways its darker edgier and certainly more political they had to handle the balance between reality and potential without getting lost on either side all this while injecting the sense of human issues that were at the heart of many sagas the series was never black and white it was all about shades of graythe film creates a believable present day or near future controversy on which to hang an us versus them battle it introduces the characters in a way that people who dont know the stories can get swept into things while leaving those with some background information confused about what where and why its a comic book within three minutes everyone knows the who and has some idea of the howit was very well cast with the exception of halle berry as storm she is just not sufficiently emotional unfortunately shes also left to handle a big lets make a point scene of the issue err movie were left not really feeling her pain about being an outcast mutant which makes it impossible to feel much one way or another from senator kellys apology i also had a feeling in a couple places that patrick stewart might have suggested some changes making the dialog a bit forced at timesmany people have commented in a negative fashion about the ending all i can say is they dont know or appreciate comic books its a comic book picture and has a true comic book endingcomic books have served as philosophy 101 for our nations youth for many many years and this film does justice to this series and its values comic series based on superheros were nearly always about the conflict of good versus evil and while the battle was nearly always won the war was far from over that meant that most or all of the high echelon bad guys were dealt with but the progeny of evil often skipped away most often hurt in some way to surface again in a later issue or against some other hero occasionally the hero suffered a serious setback just to keep the whole game appearing honest the ending wrapped up this battle in a rather tidy way leaving the war far from decided,fantasy
contains spoilers bewarethis movie was fun to watch  but i came off of it feeling like there was about an hour to go  its something that irritated me  this movie had the potential to go further but they didnt  104 minutes 9 of which they devote to credits  if you view the dvd version it lets you add 10 minutes if you want  but unlike many deleted scenes ive seen these scenes at least some of them im glad they did delete because they didnt integrate too well into whatever plotline there was  the plotline was so thin i coulda written it  lets see magnito plans to turn us all into mutants the ending sounds like a rip on xfiles  lock the bad guy in a plastic prison they didnt really miscast anyone except my brother who is a purist whined about paquin rogue that rogue should be in her 30s  but how are legends created  a little variant is needed from time to time  like william wallace and bolts of lighting from his ase  it was nice to see paquin the piano again  looks to be the next claire danes at this rate jackman was beautifully cast  cant find a better man for the role of wolverine  berry was fun as storm  that scene she had with the rather wet senator was rather fun but again this movie was too short  all they really had was one plot and that was too thin of a plot  you shouldnt be making a single comic book into a movie  combine a few of them will ya  at least they got judge dredd right on that one rentbuy the dvd obviously  you cant watch these types of movies anymore on vhs because all the goodies have been sent to the dvds610,fantasy
every once in a while movie studios and directors get it right when they are making a movie based on comic books this is one such film  this could have been captain america httpusimdbcomtitle0103923  all over again,fantasy
awful i saw this movie six months ago in july of 2000 ridley scotts gladiator was big at the office i like actionhorrorfamilydrama films but scary movie was a bomb then came out this has got to be patrick stewarts worst performance ever mutants and other mutants trying to take over the world and others trying to save it hugh jackman james marsden ian mckellan halle berry bruce davison famke janssen and anna paquin especially look properly embarresed bad acting dialogue directing make a very bad film see magneto in the statue of liberty in new york use magical powers what awful special effects based on the popular marvel comic books filmed in panavision what a wasted away film if you want to see this years worst film see and you will see,fantasy
i used to watch the cartoon series so i was very interested in how a movie about it would be  it was better that i could have dreamed  eventhough i missed gambit beast and julilee the rest of the characters were greatcyclops was not as bossy as the cartoon character wolverine was a little warmer and funny and i love this rogue better  i am glad that she did not have that southern belle voicethat senator who was like joe mccarthy was menacing as well as the villans the fights and the special effects were great as welli would recommend this movie  when it comes on video i will probably buy it,fantasy
this summer i looked at the movie as just another movie for all the little kiddies out there but when i watched it on video with my family this thanksgiving it just blew me away it is much better than it looks and has an extraordinary cast of talented actors i found that the actors were perfectly matched with the characters and the black suit actually worked very well who would want to see someone dressed in yellow spandex anyway overall the performance was spectacular and i cant wait for the sequel,fantasy
i was incredibly impressed by this film despite its mediocre reviews in the local newspaper director bryan singer truly captured the themes of loneliness and isolation that many experience in society today even without mutant abilities the struggle against prejudice was also another key element in this remarkable film i was amazed by the haunting opening scene as well as its continuing effect on the rest of the film also compelling were the relationships between the characters and how in a remarkably brief amount of time they had formed genuine bonds the performances of ian mckellen patrick stewart anna paquin and hugh jackman truly stood apart from the rest finally i think that this film demonstrated than anyone can find acceptance all they must do is find the right group of people in a society bound by internet access cell phones and pagers we must remember that there are people who feel left behind who we must reach out to this film reminds us that everyone deserves our respect and therefore we should not judge others simply because they are different,fantasy
i used to read the comic a few years ago but ultiametly lost interest however i decided to see the movie to see if marvel had finally managed to create a decent liveaction adaptation of one of their superhero seriesthe incredible hulk wasnt exactly true to the comic and who can forget the disasters of captain america the punisher and the fantastic four as it turns out theyve suceeded in putting together a great film which works far much better than the superman and batman films featuring great acting and sfx you cant miss this one,fantasy
finally i have seen a great movie based upon a television show in a year where these type of films have become common place has taken the cake as the best film of its type in 2000a few things about stood out as awesome the first was the actors are wellsuited for their roles patrick stewart looks the part of professor x hugh jackman makes me think we have found a second russell crowe and ian mckellan is truly devilish as magnetothe second thing were the special effects and the way they lifted the movie from good to extraordinary the moves pulled off by mckellan the appearing steps as the villains walk from one side to the other blew me awaythe plot is nothing new but the action sequences and special effects are truly two reasons to seei was impressed with hugh jackman because he reminds me of another actor who by coincidence looks a lot like russell crowe jackman has similar qualities as crowe such as integrity and honesty in his performancejackman is so huge in this movie i must say that he steals the show from his fellow costars jackman a relative newcomer to the land of films will become one of the hottest stars in hollywood real soon this is a star who has made a spectacular splash in his breakthrough performance is a movie i wouldnt mind seeing again,fantasy
ive never really been a fan of the comic books and id only seen a few of the animated episodes so i didnt really know what to expect from the movie i came away impressedthe acting was topnotch im a big star trek the next generation fan when i heard that patrick stewart was to portray professor xavier i had mixed feelings i had no doubt that he would do an excellent job in the role but i was concerned that he might end up being an otherwise excellent actor in a lame movie a la sean connery in the avengers i was therefore very pleased to watch the movie and find that wasnt the case with stewart gave a stellar performance opposite the equally excellent sir ian mckellen magneto other good performances were put in by hugh jackman wolverine anna paquin rogue and bruce davison senator kellyturning a comic book into a movie is a dangerous endeavor again look no further than the avengers but pulled it off just right the movie takes itself seriously but not too seriously andfrom what ive heardit remains pretty faithful to the existing story without alienating the uninitiated it also makes the viewer think about important issues such as racism instead of just being a brainless explosionfilled ammoladen action movie yet the action is there and movie never gets too heavy or preachy on the issuesvisually is stunning featuring some really slick computer animation particularly wolverines claws and the scene where xavier uses the mindmachine to find rogue the sound and music complimented the onscreen action the plot and the explanations of the characters backstories were interesting and left things wide open for a sequeloverall is worth your money,fantasy
of course there will be a sequel this is better than any of the batman films and has a style that isnt too olda style and message that most people should be in touch withit says teamwork and this gem of a film will be looked back upon for those 2 of many qualitiestake it from a loner with friends and good taste you cannot miss this film,fantasy

when i first saw the previews for this movie last year i thought it was going to be another mildly entertaining batmanlike moviewith corny special effects and costumes that would never fully make the transition from comic strip to film therefore i was extremely surprised when this turned out to be both an excellent film and a visual masterpiece development of all the characters was done extremely well from rogues first experience with her powers to wolverines mysterious and haunting past the acting was also excellent with australian newcomer hugh jackman doing an excellent portrayal of wolverine i found his and rogues emotional chemistry to be poignant and showed a more caring side of his character also in the cast are such notables as patrick stewartxavier halle berry storm and famke janssen jean grey the special effects are eye popping and imaginative and include a final showdown on the top of the statue of liberty the only thing that slightly varied from the comic strip was anna paquins portrayal of rogue as a stoic waifish teenager instead of the voluptuous firey bombshell in spite of this left almost nothing to be desired this movie deserves a 99 out of 10,fantasy
when i first went to see this movie i knew lots about the and i thought that the movie would ruin it i found out that i was wrong this had some things to think about and some scenes that u could just sit back and enjoy such as the great ending,fantasy
never before have i seen a film that brings super heroes to life like hugh jackman is perfect for wolverine i have to admit that i havent read too many comic books and ive only caught the cartoon occasionally but wolverine is just how i imagined he has rage and attitude but the film shows that this is through frustration of not knowing the truth why he is the way he is he came across as such bad attitude but singer perfectly portrayed him as a real caring human at heartthe visuals were excellent for the budget that the film had not exactly mega bucks like titanic or gladiator but i dont think that it really needed big fx because the story line was so goodthe only mistake i think that was made with this film is casting james marsden as cyclops is a typical super hero film with one major difference it has a story and charaters that we can really relate to characters that we really care aboutthis is no batman and robin ,fantasy
i didnt really know what to expect from this movie would it be as violent and bloody as the original comic books or would it be as soft as the tv cartoons it turned out to be somewhere in the middle there is some real violence in the movie and wolverine does use his clawscome on he doesnt really have them just to open doors now does he several times it may sound weird but i would have liked the movie to be little bit more violent a bit more like the original comics what i especially miss is the dark feeling the original comics gavebut that also goes for batman spiderman the hulk etc my problems with the movie are that its really full of cliches and therefore really predictableexamplespoiler the way wolverine is introduced in the movie first he is shown beating a guy in a cage fightshows how tough he really is but then when the little girl sneaks along in his van he first kicks her outhes stubborn but then takes her alongheart of goldthe other problem is that the movie really focuses on the fact that there might be a sequel did you see any of the bad guys really die in the end no magneto is locked up mystique still livesvideo footage and toad and sabertooth are simply blown into the baya thing which toad especially should be able to survive since hes half amphibian the end is completely spoiled by this sequel thing i think its a pretty lame movie considering what great material they had to create a script with,fantasy
thewhat can i say  im compelled to give my testimony  i can truly say that the castcrew and directors were perfect for this movie  everyone did an exceptional job i was afraid that if and when they did make an movie that it would not live up to my expectations  but did it not only met them it surrpassed them and the action is out of this world  it has witty humor and riveting suspense that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the credits pop up in front of you  i would deffenitly recommend that you see the if the idea of the or the possibillity of human evolution sounds interesting to you or heck even if you just like to watch a great movie i bought it on dvd and it is great but dont take my word on it watch it for yourself and see if you dont agree,fantasy
 was pretty good watching mutants fight each other using their different powers is of course fun to watch but its little more than an eye candy super hero popcorn flick not something to stimulate the intellect like others have said here are complaints1 the acting has problems anna paquin who plays rogue constantly seems to have something large in her throat which means that she keeps gulping and gagging and distorting her voice famke janssen halle berry and james marsden were all wooden and did not portray their characters too well patrick stewart ian mckellan and hugh jackman were pretty good though2 lack of plot the movie is little more than a preview of things to come while trying to put in a subplot of magneto turning people into blobs after mutantinizing them3 character development very little except for wolverine and rogue4 the way the movie jumps from one thing to another without much flowthe good things1 the action very cool with special effects on maximum wolverine against mystique was great but storm giving toad that dumb do you know what happens line was the worst2 wolverines mystery obviously something to keep people watching and something well want light shed into in the next few moviesill be waiting for the sequel hopefully itll be better i give this a 7,fantasy
though highly imaginative with astounding visual effects explodes onto celluloid much the same way as most of the other comic book films with a weak and predictable plot and characters as two dimensional as their paper counterparts  this is not to say that it isnt entertaining because it is it is very high on filmmaking coolness and the action is intense and impressive  however it suffers from excessive form and very little substancethe science in this socalled science fiction story is laughable  if we are to accept the premise presented here suddenly over a period of about 50 years man takes a quantum leap in evolution and dozens of people develop superhuman powers with none of powers duplicated in any two mutants  there is no explanation as to what triggered so many drastic mutations it is just a sudden acceleration of evolution  well evolution doesnt work that way not even close  major evolutionary changes are generally separated by thousands or millions of years and it will usually be a single change in a species that elevates the whole species  so the concept is really more fantasy than science fictionlighten up you say  who cares if it is science fiction or fantasy anyway  it is just an awesome movie  thats a good point  however even fantasy films need a plot  trots out the same tired storyline good superheroes battle to save the world from bad superheroes as mere mortals helplessly look on  there is nothing remotely novel or interesting about the storythe film tries to make itself socially relevant with platitudinous comparisons between social injustice in human history and the persecution of the poor superhuman mutants  however the comparison is inapt since true persecution always flows from the strong to the weak and not viceversa as depicted here  feeling sorry for the mutants is like pitying wealthy corporate executives because everyone fears and despises them  they have the power  how much sympathy can we have for themat the risk of inducing a lot of impassioned email i have to diverge from popular opinion about how great this film was  this film was all sizzle and no steak  there was only one character with a shred of substance and that was wolverine hugh jackman  the rest were just cardboard cutoutsin 1995 at the age of 29 wunderkind director bryan singer directed a brilliant and exquisitely complex film called the usual suspects  he then burst into flames with apt pupil a dreadful film about a boy who became enamored with an elderly nazi war criminal who was trying to live out his life quietly in the us  after that disaster he went underground until  this film showed that singer is a stickler for detail and he knows how to make a stupendously vacuous action flick but it shows not a shred of nuance that would earn it the right to stand in the shadow of suspects that film showed that he has a certain directorial genius but we are not likely to see it emerge again if he keeps taking lucrative but shallow projects like thisthe acting well there wasnt much acting to be done  anna pacquin and hugh jackman had the only parts that werent utterly superficial  both of them did a good job actually conjuring up some emotions other than resolute righteousness  rebecca romijnstamos looked about as sexy as a human being could when covered in reptilian body armor and she said all six of her lines like a true professionalim being overly hard on the film  it wasnt bad  it was very enjoyable it just didnt deserve the raves that were doted on it  i rated it a 710 on the strength of the visual effects and the action sequences  these areas were an easy 1010  the screenplay was about a 310  its definitely worth seeing but leave your brain at the door,fantasy
i admit from the trailer i was convinced this would be another belowbelt low iq comic book to big screen adaptation in the vein of the regrettable batman and robin but i was pleasantly surprised  ian mckellan and patrick stewart were riveting  the rest of the cast was convincing and utterly attractive  singers direction was neither heavy handed nor needlessly fluffy  the violence was not extreme and the storyline left me wanting more  definitely one of the best films ive seen in 2000  worth the admission price,fantasy
i hear people saying that this is a movie that will intellectually stimulate them and all these great things now its a fun movie to watch mutants exercising their powers on each other but its really just a superhero movie that rushes from one thing to another with little flow to it the plot is a mutant named rogue runs away from her house after finding out that whenever she touches someone she takes away their energy she meets wolverine some mysterious character who has knives that come out of his hands and instant healing they get rescued by storm and cyclops from sabretooth and then they meet dr xavier who put rogue in his school and wolverine joins the team anna paquin who plays rogue seems to constantly have a huge gob of mucus in her throat which means that she keeps gulping and distorting her voice wolverine is too mysterious to connect with but hugh jackman did a good job playing him cyclops and jean greys romance was pretty strange since jean gray is old enough to be his mother patrick stewart was okay but he and magneto did not really generate their characters well the sfx were good but it was mostly just a preview with a little subplot to show fights which were pretty good i give this movie a 75,fantasy
this was a very well done film  as a comic book afficionado for years  i was excited when i heard the were coming to the big screen however i had reservations about how the general non comicbook reading public would take to it as is obvious by the success of the film my fears were for naught  they did an excellent job of preserving the feel of the characters from the comics without making them too cartoony for a serious moviethe plot development was well done also  starting in the concentration camps made it easy to see how magneto got set onto his path  many times cartooncomicbook villains are needlessly overdramatic  this wasnt the case with this magneto  you could even sympathize with his cause although his lack of respect for human life made it easy to cheer when he was defeated focusing on wolverinerogue also provided a nice continuity to the film that would otherwise have been absent  the filmmakers did an excellent job of portraying logan and keeping the character as true as possible to his comic book version,fantasy
in the world of movies profundity often creeps up in the most unexpected and unlikely of places  lets face it one does not instinctively turn to the superhero genre if one is searching for films with great thematic meaning and philosophical depth  yet provides just those qualities in the context of a thought provoking intelligently written and superbly executed tale of mutants searching for acceptance tolerance and affirmation in a world filled with frightened and often even hostile inhabitants much more than just a mere action film x men broadens into a study of the effects of prejudice done in almost allegorical terms  often when a theme has become played out through over exposure it takes a fresh approach to make it come alive again  yet another movie chronicling the injustices done to blacks native americans jews gays the handicapped and a host of other routinely aggrieved groups probably would not have the same impact as this film does  by creating an entirely fictional group to serve as the target of intolerance the filmmakers allow us see the issue from a novel perspective stripped down to its barest essentials as it were  since none of us brings to the film an innate prejudice against a group that doesnt exist in real life we are all free to see the irrationality fear and idiocy that serve as the basis for bigotry in any of its forms  how many movies of any genre can one say that aboutthe film begins appropriately with a scene recreating a factual example of bigotry in one of its most recent and darkest forms  as a family of jews in 1944 poland is marched to its doom in a nazi concentration camp  we discover later on that the young lad has survived the experience and that he is actually one of the first of a new breed of mutants being caused by a sudden leap in the human evolutionary cycle  it seems that these mutants begin manifesting their various differences around the time of puberty and that as the 21st century progresses and more and more of these special people begin to reveal themselves the world finds itself grappling with the issue of whether or not they should be denied equal rights and equal citizenship and even whether or not they should be allowed to remain integrated with the rest of society   in many ways i imagine that this film speaks with particular significance to the gay community since in contemporary terms that seems to be the group most often targeted with the kind of ignorant vitriolic claptrap we hear coming from the outraged normal citizens and opportunistic politicians in the film  the are a group of mutants women included by the way with superhuman powers whose twofold mission it is to prevent the worlds lawmakers from passing legislation against them and to simultaneously fight off some renegade mutants who have decided to take matters into their own less diplomatic hands  kudos to writer david hayder and director bryan singer for daring to explore such a profound theme in such an entertaining formatfor make no mistake about it  for all its profundity and thematic richness is first and foremost a stylish and enthralling comic book action thriller  even though the mutant heroes are essentially twodimensional characters at least they dont undercut the seriousness of their purpose by indulging in the customary wisecracking adolescent antics that have diminished so many earlier super hero characters in previous films of this nature  most impressive is that the villain possesses not only a credible motive for his actions but even the seeds of some long dormant goodness that allow for the possibility of his redemption somewhere down the road  and it is indeed obvious that this film provides a dandy setup for a potentially lucrative series of films to follow  the firstrate action stunt sequences and stateoftheart special effects contribute greatly to the entertainment level of the film  of the actors the standout is patrick stewart who as the mutant dedicated to building a bridge of tolerance and understanding between the mutants and the outside world brings just the right note of comforting civility and rationality to the roleyet for all its technical virtues as an action film it is the depth and breadth of its vision that separates from so many other films of its genre and makes it truly worthwhile viewing  as grateful moviegoers our appetite is whetted  and we eagerly await our next serving,fantasy
when this film came out local critics ex roger ebert gave it mediocre ratings i didnt see it at the theater i rented the on video last night and found it to be an excellent and imaginative scifi film  it was criticized for too much character development but i think the character development was necessary for those such as myself not familiar with the comic book the character development contributed to the plot rather than distracting from it the special effects were outstanding the cast was great and you had sympathy for the main characters even to the point of understanding why the bad mutants were bad i enjoyed the from beginning to end i would like to see this developed into a series,fantasy
wow this was one of the best movies that i have ever seen it was really really cool i am an avid comic reader so i had to go see this on the opening day i loved every bit of it i even bought the  dvd on the day that it came out and man oh man is this dvd sweet i am waiting for 2 if they dont make a sequel i will be very dissapointed i honestly think that this is the best comic book movie even if you are not a fan of comics you still should go and see this right away i can gurantee that you will not be dissapointed 1010,fantasy
i had zero expectations until i read the highbrow reviews careful chooser and seen every scifi flick since beginning of time  decided what the hey read the comics or not maybe worth watching  holy cow  forget superman  freeze batman  this is just a dang good flick  action suspense emotional development far exceeded anything ive seen in a long time  way creativetoo ok so u read the comicsyeah yeah  cmon do you think patrick stewart chooses lowlife media here  get a grip  and yet hugh jackman as wolverine absolutely steals the show  a tough thing with stewart in the cast  just watch it and hold onto your hat  what a blast over 45 female reviewer,fantasy
this is a perfectly paced family film which gives food for thought as well as visceral thrills bryan singers interpretation of the rich mythos has resulted in the first decent superhero film since the first two superman filmsthes strongest point is the fact that these superheroes are portrayed as very vulnerable and emotional as well as the fact that they are scorned for the gifts that they possess this turns the whole nietschzen ideal on its head and paints a more realistic portrayal of the superhuman even the villain magneto can be sympathised with a man twisted by his childhood experiences in a concentration campthis is an excellent film which doesnt require any previous knowledge of the to watch and will entertain all generations,fantasy
i enjoyed i didnt get lost or bored with it im not much of a comics fan but i did watch the cartoon i thought it to be more of a scifi movie than a doomed superhero movie it was true enough to the story that it made me happy the details that were wrong or left out of the movie where done so for obvious reasons  tame down the movie for the kids budgeting feasibility etc you cant have everything definitely a dvd buy,fantasy
pity the mutants so misunderstood so alienated and with enough power to destroy the rest of mankind this is the kind of theme that is sure to appeal to the adolescent mind keep the plot simple even if it wastes the talent of an academy award winning actress throw in a blue supermodel and star trek captain now you got a summer blockbuster with nerd appeal make sure you leave some questions unanswered like how to get a metal skeleton to setup the sequel for next summeri have my own unanswered question who played the part of rebecca romijnss stunt double was it an unrecognized shapely stunt woman or was it computer animation it getting harder to tell the difference between special effects and the real thing maybe next time they wont need the blue makeup to hide the animation,fantasy
brian singer has made it safe to go back to the cinemas and enjoy superhero films once more it had the right tone and casting patrick stewart as prof x who else could play it never read an comic and i could understand it although it could have used a bit more action i suppose it did need the set up of all the characters hopefully the bad guys will get more screen time in the sequelhugh jackman and nzs own anna paquin were a joy to watch  out of ,fantasy
 is the first attempt to bring marvel comics best selling title to the big screen directing the movie is bryan singer who made the usual suspects unfortunately there are several problems with trying to make a movie like this first of all the budget was very limited and due to the target audience the movie had to be toned down both in sfx and in aspects of violencewhen 2 characters that are supposed to be the personification of violence according to the comic squares off without really inflicting any damage on each other you could say something was lost in the translationtrying to make a movie based on thes 30 year old history would be impossible instead we have a plot that is designed to guide newcomers into the world of the unfortunately the plot that finally made it into the movie is quite stupid and somewhat sillythere is nothing spectacular here at all the villain and his followers are all simply evil and most characters dont ever develop any kind of depththere was also a shortage of time in making this movie and it shows the special effects are quite patchy and a lot of times it is painfully obvious that the action scenes are made using wiresthe casting is also imho wrong in most casesinstead of having wolverine as the scary pint sized psycho he is the hollywood version tall dark and handsome with a bit of attitude hardly distinguishable from hundreds of similar movie characters so he is a bit of a clichany chance of taking the characters or the plot seriously is effectively destroyed by having everyone dress in tight leather outfitsall in all considering who was making it and the potential a very disappointing movie avoid it if you can or at least wait until it comes on cable,fantasy
for the first movie it did superior it soared far above my expectations on what i thought it would be i went to see it with my dad and he is antisuperhero but to my surprise he loved it along with me this movie shined in my eyes whenever i saw a picture of it i would watch the trailer about every day this movie was great and i cant wait to get it on dvd,fantasy
overall an underwhelming effort compromised by an array of technical flaws they being an anticlimactic story arc laboured direction listless cinematography hatchet work edits and a vacuous music score what little vibrancy to be had from this leaden 104 minute indulgence in fanboy navel gazing is found in the energizing performances of hugh jackman patrick stewart and ian mckellan and just barely the novelty of the concept itselfcourtesy of stan lee perhaps if the film had been entrusted to a director experienced in the action genreor at least one with some notions of what a visual style isi might not have found myself yawning on my way out of the theatre,fantasy
one movie critic said feeble script  the movie is excellent i think that it is more like this movie is not for everyone but for the babyboomers born of the early 50s and late 40s who read the marvel comics as youngster might find this very entertaining and nostalgic were not among the most popular comics i think not as popular as spiderman the fantastic four the submarinerbut as an adult fantasy into superheroes with a heart edge and occasional good humor and the battles of light and dark forces id say the script too was worthy of the admission price and patrick stewart was great so were the story of the chief villain and everyone did a good job of actingrhodes,fantasy
nothing very special in particular  ok flick that has good special effects with a ok storyline that is somewhat similar to some other movies out there  about creatures called  that are mutants who are not trusted by mankind pg13 based on the comic book,fantasy
if you have not seen this movie you would be surprised to see how incredible it is  i am not an reader but i am familiar with the characters  i have to state that no other comic book character has been portrayed as great as this movie i was disappointed to what the dvd lacked it could have added a feature to discuss the characters in the movie  the movie did not have a commentary which i was looking forward to  if there was one disappointing flaw in this movie was halle berry playing storm  she did not present herself as the character of storm  however the rest of the cast was excellent,fantasy
this is a decent all around movie for teens preteens et al  while it does include a bit of violence come on blades protrude from wolverines hands what do you expect most of the fighting is the sort done by people who can control lightning in other words not realistic  also there is a thread of benicetostrangers running through the movie exemplified by wolverines driving rogue to her destination when she is caught hitchhiking at the beginning of the movie,fantasy
ive never read the comic books and had very little knowledge of the characters before i saw it  i really enjoyed it  the acting was for the most part superb and the special effects were amazing  the different characters were incredible  i was constantly looking forward to seeing what special powers the next one would have and thinking wow i wish i could do that the toad guy was a definite highlight  the biggest problem i had was that i wanted it to last longer  i wanted to know more about the characters but there probably wasnt enough time for all of that  the plot was basically very interesting and even sort of deep  it really gave you a sense of internal struggle  professor x was playing the version of dr martin luther king jr and magneto was playing malcolm x my suspicions of this were confirmed when i heard magneto say by any means necessary it was that kind of conflict  the bad guys really werent that bad you could understand how their oppression made them feel the way they did  i found all of the mutants to be very likablethere were some flaws  wolverines past was the most nagging one  they would show choppy flashbacks of his past and refer to it throughout the movie but it never went anywhere and was never explained  what was the point to show his angst visually or to make us look forward to a sequel hmm  also storm did say that really awful line do you know what happens to a toad when its struck by lightening  the same thing that happens to everyone else  that was significantly lame  in a few places details were overlooked like driving to a train on a motorcycle and taking the train home  where did the motorcycle go  eh,fantasy
 is a delight to watchthe entire film which is based on the marval comics is in my opinion the third best film behind films such as supermanthe movie and batmanadapting comic book characters can have its rewards and its dissapointmentscaptain america and the punisher bombed and was hardly releasedthe fantastic four was one adaptation that suffered so badly that it wasnt even releasedtheatrically or direct to video which is directed by bryan singer has the best cast that you could ask forhugh jackman as wolverine and patrick stewart as professor x were both good in the filmian mckellen was awesome as magnetohalle berry was pretty cool as storm and james mardsen is the right choice for cyclopslets not forget about anna paquin as rogue and the beautiful famke jansenn as drjean grey is the movie to see,fantasy
 sadly lacks the continuity necessary to have really been outstanding  the opening at the prison camp was excellent but then to shift to the pubesecent rogue was baffeling  the lack of background on xavier was i feel an error  strangers to the comic book series as i am were left with the feeling of trying to catch up all through the filmsic by the time wolverine rogue cyclops and storm all met i decided that perhaps i hadnt wasted my money on the dvd this with the addition of perhaps 1015 minutes of more material plus a less dark look would have made this an outstanding movie,fantasy
well given the hype of this picture i was initially let down on opening weekend but ive grown to love this film on the level of its respected depiction of the i credit director bryan singer and the brass over at fox for not turning this movie into a misrepresentation of the comic books while the films plot and characterdevelopment are thin it still achieves a level of humanity the loganrogue relationship and sense of fun the setpieces are brief but enjoyable many will complain that the specialeffects are inconsistent in their appearance but its understandable because the budget was only around 75 million and its made up for in the casting area patrick stewart hugh jackman and ian mckellan are the characters in this beautifullyproduced film good effort from all around 3 stars,fantasy

this has been my first time in a few weeks to check out this page last time i was here the ratings were at a ridiculously high level to my dismay they still areyup im one of the seemingly few who felt cheated on this movie for those wanting a little backgrounder i used to read comics i was a follower of the post inferno until claremont took his long sabbatical from the seriesokay so what disappointed me the characters apart from the fact that a few of these complex personalities are reduced to cardboard cut outs like cyclops man he is not a teachers pet like theyve portrayed him theres something really ironic about it all notice how all the good guys are young sexy prettyboys and girls and the bad guys are disfigured freaks of nature ok mystique was darn sexy but shes blue yah and this is a film thats supposed to attack prejudice make a little switcheroo  make the good guys pug ugly and the bad guys dicaprio look a likes and see what difference that will make aside from one brief paragraph from mystique none of magnetos lackeys uses prejudice as a motivation to join the other side in effect they just seem like horrible monsters bent on destruction cmon people give them some more human realistic motivationi also didnt like the action not once did my adrenal gland have to start pumping ho hum in general the artistic direction was subpar i absolutely loved singers fight club which had cinematic deviations galore in it was all formula stuff and very flat formula stuffand the script ok you cant do much for two hours but but do you know what happens to a toad when its struck by lightning just the same thing as everything else its prolly not verbatim but im sure ive made an improvement on that line which happens to be the worst one liner in movie history arnies mister freeze quips in batman and robin had more poetry than this and that is omygoshmygolly sadonesided story bad character translations hidden prejudices bad action shabby script thats why i think people whove rated this movie above a 7 should make second thoughts to tell you the truth im glad theyll be making a sequel perhaps all the problems of the first will be remedied and the name will be given the justice it deserves praypraypray,fantasy
im not one of those people who eagerly awaited the release of this film i dont read the comics i dont play the videogame i have i must confess been known to watch the cartoon but im no big fan of the x men which is why i wasnt expecting to be wildly enamoured with the film when i went to see it at the cinema i was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the film they could have just churned out another comic book adaptation knowing that a loyal fanbase would lap it up regardless of how good a film it was thankfully they did not do this and the x men is a film with many good points hugh jackman is excellent as the loner wolverine and he must surely be on the way to become a major hollywood player the music is moody and the special effects are what weve come to expect from an action film but what surprised me the most was the depth given to the characters and the love triangle between wolverine cyclops and jean grey was an element that should have been further explored the one big disappointment was the frankly abrupt ending but i suppose that paves the way for a sequel one that i for one will be going to seenow wheres the nearest comic book shop i think im going to become a geek,fantasy
 is a disappointing film its all setup and no payoff by the time the movie finishes introducing us to all the characters its already an hour into the film and then they tack on some cheesy ending i did like the actors though especially ian mckellan as magneto i will be interested in watching the sequels to this film because next time they wont have to waste their time with introductions and just get right into the story,fantasy
when i went to see the movie i was expecting one of those badmade specialeffectsdriven low on character high on action hiiiiggghhh  budged popcorn movies  i mean most of the comic movies are that way take batman however this movie went beyond my expectations  i mean it is a good movie  it has non of the specifications i mentioned above  its got character story a good plot and there really are some symbolic shots etc  i say go see this movie id like to tell one thing though  i think its time that hollywood realizes that the audience realises when it sees a badly made 3d computer animation  i mean the special effects werent that good  especially i couldnt stop laughing when i saw volverines summersault at the statue of liberty  which also exists in the trailer  however apart from the special effects i enjoyed the movie,fantasy
 achieves what so many other films of its genre fail intelligence style and a sense of morality yet the film always manages to retain an essential humour the cast is well placed especially hugh jackman as a moody yet likeable wolverine and patrick stewart as the sensible martin luther king jrof the mutant world  dr charles xavier the film stays true to the original comics  cartoons the general story is relevant the cinematography is beautifully executed by newton thomas sigel and both cast and direction strong but there is something missing the script builds the film up  up the audience wait in teethgrinding anticipation as the big finale rolls on upon the statue of liberty ny but the big finale aint so big and leads to somewhat of an anticlimax that leaves filmgoers asking what the hl also the story is very much centred around wolverine  rogue and leaves little for the other mutants to display sure the film is generally good but it lacks spectacularism however the one thing that left me hunting for bryan singer is the very ending where we find that magneto has lived and a movie that screams sequel ahoy i hate when they do that,fantasy
did anyone really watch this i mean really watch it or was everyone just so captivated by the special effects that they failed to see what a bad movie this was in all my days i have never seen such great visual artistry put to such waste no characters got any sympathy from me not even wolverine who was nicely played by the aussie find hugh jackman his character would have been great if the screenwriter had developed one for him instead we get another mad mutant guy with a troubled past and blah blah blah all the good guys fighting the bad for world domination and blah blah blah i even saw this movie for free and i feel ive been ripped off i couldve spent that 104 minutes changing the oil in my tempo,fantasy
most of us wanted to be super heroes when we were kids in super hero world ranking is extremely difficult superman has powers so in that respect hes cooler than batman who has gadgets almost all important characters in batman are some sort of split personalities and their world is much darker the x men are a happy hybrid cool and yet sometimes terrifying powers and the sense of alienation so 10 for them   the special fx are great 20    now the funny thing wolverinejean grey  thing thank god they didnt insist on that and rougewolverine thing  might seem familiar but for some reason i really didnt mind them singer skips the danger of potentially cheap tricks and leaves  me not only impatiently waiting for the sequel but actually wanting me to go back and see it again i cant remember when that happened last time and ive seen many many many  many movies many 30 great casting read somewhere that jackmans performance reminds of a young clint eastwood inclined to agree  40  im no film critic and i dont pretend to have a great taste in movies but this one i liked very entertaining go see for yourself ,fantasy
this first of what will most likely be many flicks revolves mainly around wolverine played by hugh jackman but still manages to include the other favourites like cyclops strom and jean grey casting crews did expert jobs in casting the roles for the movie except maybe for rogue and magneto otherwise the we have come to know and love have been faithfully adapted when moving to liveactionthe studios did take some artistic license during the crossover from comic to movie they made rogue at least 15 years younger they made mystique naked and magnetos screenself is somewhat less imposing than the original magnetic tyrant ishowever it is very easy to look beyond these trivial changes to see what could become one of the most profitable movie franchises ever with some subtle injokes and flatout funny parts combines humour adventure and action to fantastic effect,fantasy
this review nay contain spoilers from the first moment you watch the movie you get caught in it visually it catch your eyes and never let you go i was very happy with the approach the film has which reminded me of the one batman12 had which means that although the film is based on a comics book its not necessarily has to be silly and aimed for childrenthis is a very enjoyable and entertaining movie but its not flawlessa lot of things are simply left unexplained for example why and how the bad mutants joined magnet and not prof x or the fact that mistuiqe manage to pose as one of the boys in profx school and no one seems to notice there are 2 of them and i can point out some more things like this however i admit that maybe its better to leave it as it is because if you ignore these things you cab enjoy the film morei also think that while the good mutants are more 2 dimension the bad ones remain in one dimension one last thing a sequel is unavoidable lets just hope that fox will retain the same approach as in this film and will not try to cash on it and by that destroy it as wb has done with the batman films34 go see this movie it probably the best summer blockbuster youll ever see this year,fantasy
one of the things that made the marvel comics special back in the 60s was their quirkiness  spiderman agonized about the same stuff that other teenagers did  maybe not acne but problems with fitting in to the adult world superheroes with problemsthe have problems too they may have some phenomenal powers but theyre outsiders  they look human but their powers put them on the outside  feared and misunderstood they are targetstargeted by a senator as a threat to humanity they face the sort of persecution that supposed reds did at the hands of senator joseph mccarthy and huacthey are also the targets of the supervillain magneto ian mckellan  he feels that there will be a war between humanity and mutantkind  but he has a plan to swing the tide  all he needs is one special mutantmagneto is aided by a trio of mutants sabertooth toad episode is darth maul ray park and mystiqueopposing them are of course the the main group this time are wolverine rogue cyclops and dr jean grey others make cameos this time around like icemanbut what makes this movie more than just a special effects romp is the subtext  that has to do with fear and prejudice magneto feels that the mutants will be treated in the same way that his jewish mother was during wwii despised imprisoned and killed explaining to my sixyearold nephew about concentration camps was one of the toughest and most frustrating things ive ever donegreat performances from patrick stewart prof x and ian mckellan magneto also lift the film above the usual comic book movie faresome of the scenes might be a little intense for youngsters my nephew had his eyes covered during some of the scenes like the senators final scene but very little overt bloodshedgood stuff  looking forward to the sequel which they left ample room foreight stars  uncle steve says check it out,fantasy
i m not a fan of but i did enjoy this film it was pretty good and very entertaining this kind of movie big budget lots of special effects lots of hype could easily become a total turkey like battlefield earthif you like youll love the movie for a normal movie fan its just a stunning effectsfilled movie i give this 7 out of 10,fantasy
before seeing this movie ive read many reviews of the movie and they were all about how this movie sucked some critics even described it as a plastic heap of overrated garbage well i strictly opposefirst of all the movie had a quite decent cast  patrick stewart was right in his place and hugh jackman added a bit of freshness into the movie ian mckellen however was not as good as in his previous roles apt pupil as his character appeared somewhat too calm or even sedated but still the dialogue between him as magneto and patrick stewart as charles xavier were quite vivid and sarcastici also have to say that the effects were satisfying and from the middle onward quite surprisingly well fitted into the movie not too much not too little just to support the plot but the plot is another thing it is the only thing that seemed only a bit over the average intro was ok but somewhere in the middle the initial line of mutants fighting for equality was quickly replaced by mutant fighting mutant fighting humandirecting and editing were average but most people would say that is not important in action or scifi movies  matrix odyssey 2010 apparently noti am a fan of the comic book and therefore i can see that the adaptation is quite good the costumes are portrayed brilliantly look at the descriptions of the suits in the comic books and you will notice this personalities of the characters are a bit twodimensional that does not go for jackman and stewart but the interaction is though rare quite humorousto put all into place i give this movie an 8 out of 10 anybody should see this movie and you may find yourself getting interested into the comic book or wind up owning the movie like mebtw viewing the dvd version is a very good ideaall you fans dont miss it,fantasy
blame it on the media or whatever but i really looked forward to see this movie i even bought a 13 us movie magazine just because it featured it before it even came out here if i didnt have such high expectations it might seem better but i walked out of the cinema feeling a little ripped off and heres why 1 it is so damn short how could they do this to a huge blockbuster it should have been between 120150 minutes but not merely 104 minutes the story is way too much to be told in less than two hours this fault is forgivable at least they are making sequels 2 i know i shouldnt really say this since ive never heard of the comics before but i think the movie might have worked better with even fewer main characters look at batman and robin enough said 3 bad bad acting okay just storm noone else i have to mention 50 of my intention to see this movie was seeing halle berry donning a white wig too bad i didnt realize how was she bad she was so wooden and her woodenness probably wont be so noticeable if she wasnt so damn beautifulthats it reallyim quite impressed with anna paquin and i could really relate to her situation not in that way of course and hugh jackman and famke janssen were really pleasant surprises too ahill never forgot the naked mr jackman  he should be with rogue imhonow that i think about it more its just a little more than average with good visuals which proves to make the fans smile id love to see a more active and sexy rogue in the sequels the studio should have allowed bryan singer more time and i think it was the main reason why this movie was incoherent in places and looks hastily made still i look forward to sequels and i hope by then theyll make something that lives up to my expectations,fantasy
although im very interested in the sciencefiction genre prior to watching this movie i knew almost nothing about at all i went to the film expecting much afterall wherever patrick stewart acts he always adds that magical spark but the movie really exceeded my expectations ten times its quite basically one of the most successful science fiction films ive ever watchedbe it acting scenario or special effects this film is well equipped to please the audience in all areas i also liked the way were introduced since i knew nothing about them and for the likes of me certain information was necessary however an unbalanced introduction could have caused the veteran readers to get bored perhaps the movie manages to keep both newcomers and old readers satisfiedperhaps some may argue about acting for usually there is not enough space left to act in science fiction movies which by the way is not what i think at all just the usual comment i keep hearing now and then i really liked certain mimics of characters most especially wolverines when its the fiction genre youre talking about and again when youre dealing with characters who have plenty of super powers you have to balance the information of what they can do with enough data about their personality here the body language is a great tool and certainly it has been of a great assistance for providing a good insight about the heroes of this moviethe film at one point reminded me of blade which is also based on comics both of these films use similar techniques in my humble opinion to recreate the atmosphere on the silver screen and it works pretty wellwell patrick stewart is well he is a living legend for sure and in this movie he is as incredible as ever but for me the star of the movie was hugh jackman and most of the storyline revolves around him wolverine i am hoping to see equally successful sequels to this movie with the same castthe drawbacks none its flawless its beautiful its entertaining an all around adventurous trip in 100 minutes and gets my both thumbs up 11 out of 10,fantasy
first of all im not a reader of the comics i know most of the characters and some basic storylines ive seen the old animated series and i will watch evolution and ive read some issues but i dont read the comics im kinda new in the comic scene but i know enoughmy favorite is wolverine and i cant wait to see hugh jackman back in part two man was he good i also saw the original wolvie dougray scott in mi2 and although he was good he couldnt have been better then hugh so in a way mi2 has done something right in the endwolverine is without a doubt the main character of the movie singer has improved the concept of his claws coming out of the knuckles and being bigger they look staddier good jobfor the rest not the best plot ever but in this movie the plots not important its the characters that come to life the great music the strong cast and fantastic special effects this movie is about the best comic book adaption ever and its the start of a new line of such movies 2 and 3 spiderman spawn 2 come on part 1 sucked it shouldve been more like the comics blade 2 fantastic four etcetera what i really mean is that the stan leestyle was not in this movie i dont mean to disrespect stan lee after all he created it but his characters are always a little bit unreal and too happy and the uniforms look colorful and unrealistic thats why i like the new suitswhat i also liked were the references and quotes humor toad imitating darth maul and thus imitating himself the yellow spandex logans disbelief about the names and so on some details from the comics may have been changed or lost but the result is greatconclusion is an amusing fascinating and good movie thats made for a sequel if you havent seen the movie yet sorry for spoiling it and now get the hell outta your chair and go see it,fantasy
 isnt just a kill em all action flick with extravagant special effects the comic originated in 1960 is probably the comic where the characters personal growth is one of the most important parts of the storyline the characters in the movie has to suffer from racism from humans and protect them all the sameyou neednt be an avid fan to understand the movie  everything is carefully planted into the plot of course for those who are fans this movie will be a delightful feast the characters are brilliantly portrayed and true to there nature fans who remember toad from the comic will find his character a bonusalthough not all the traditional beast jubilee etc are present there are a few surprises for observant viewers rouges friend bobby can turn anything into ice  robert drake iceman from the comic in the scene where wolverine is in xaviers laboratory there is a girl that walks through the door could it be shadowcateven without all the analyzing the movie is still tremendous fun  some of the scenes were just so xcellent i actually got goosebumps this movie deserves to be seen by everyone from 7 to 70,fantasy
this was the most incredible movie not only of the summer but definitely one of the best i have ever seen it was sleek cool smart and stylish with genius directing and acting the fight sequences were incredibly choreographed this movie leaves you craving for more 1010,fantasy
even though i was not a huge fan of action comics i liked to read the when it came to greece in the late seventies of course there were the original and i see that several characters were added over the years so even though i had some background i was like many who went to see the movie without a deep knowledge of the complex plots the had evolved in the printed comic over the yearsof course like many people i wasnt sure what i would see because earlier adaptations of comics to the movies were horriblethe result was a very good movie that i believe will entertain both fans and plain folks i certainly enjoyed itthe special effects were just right and did not overwhelm i believe that the less noticed the better they are rightthe action scenes were great the characters developed except perhaps rogue a plot that promises a good sequel what more could i aski gave it an 8 but i have changed my mind i should have given it a 9,fantasy
ive been a fan of the for a long time now and i was dreading this film as being a terrible film trying to cash in on the name however i found this to be possibly the best comic movie cross over so far although the story line was not consistent with the comics the characters were captured down to a t from the things they said to the expressions on their faces i was amazed at how hugh jackman captured the compassion and aggression of wolverine and i thoroughly enjoyed this film from start to finish brilliant,fantasy
this movie delivers all  it has humour action and a really good story line to the characters  the first time i saw the preview i thought it wouldnt be that good because it looks very weird because of the costumes and because of the special effects but when i saw this movie i was stunned this movie is simply amazing that i quickly saw it again the next day  so if your looking for a good scifi movie is the movie that you should see,fantasy
well i had a lot of fears about this one because its so easy to do a mess of something you really really liked as a teen to anyone who read ever the comics its perfect they just changed or removed or modified some characters for pretty obvious reasons we have a teen bobby drake  iceman for one but the ones being there are excellent those under spotlight especially wolverine magneto and professor x are wonderful prof x is possibly better than the original horray to patrick stewart no spoilers no plot just enjoy the story oh and for those who didnt read the comics im so sorry for you why dont you give them a try after the movie,fantasy
i am beyond shocked at the reviews this film is getting here at the imdb  its no wonder the big studios feel comfortable putting out junk like this film because about 750 of the 770 reviews of are all glowingly positivewhy  this film is yet another example of a promising concept butchered but bad writing and even worse directing  regardless of what anyone might say bryan singer is a bad director  now before you go off saying but the usual suspects was an excellent film i will go on record in agreement with you but it wasnt the directing that made that film it was the writing  bryan singer just got lucky with that one and to prove it just watch his 2nd film apt pupilgee wasnt that an excellent film note the thick layer of sarcasm  a good director can take a poor story and make a great film as evident with steven speilbergs saving private ryanin any case moving on to the 2 hours of celluloid garbage otherwise known as the movie how can anyone say they honestly liked this film  beyond their names every character had absolutely nothing in common with their comic book counterparts which last i checked was the basis of this film and there is not one reviewer of this film who can argue otherwise  is this fact alone not enough to condemn the film  ive heard of artistic lisence but come on  youre supposed to use that in art design and most importatnly directing not in totally rewriting the foundational history of the marvel universe  but what could you expect after all bryan singer himself said that before a friend of his pitched this idea to him he had never read a page out of an comic  and it shows  bryan singer doesnt know what makes the comic series what it is and a lot of it is critical to the timelines and circumstances in which each is introduced to one another  the movie completely rewrites this timeline and character introductions in essence chopping its own legs off before it has a chance to stand up and runwhat about those who have never heard of the universe  read on for the rest pertains to you as wellnext is the action sequences  correct me if im wrong but are not action sequences by definition supposed to be exciting and entertaining eyecandy  if you agree then you cannot like the action sequences in this film  part of the reason they stink so bad is again the directing boring  bryan singer does not know where to place or move the camera to properly catch an action  coupled by the fact that this is perhaps one of the most terribly edited films in history you are left at the end of an action sequence saying what the heck when you should be saying wowplot  what plot  those of you who say this is a smart plot should recheck your iqs  you want a smart script go and see the matrix now there is a good movie  but dont get me wrong im not saying that should have been more like the matrix only that the matrix is heading in the right direction as far as comic book adaptations should go yes the matrix was a comic series and is a step backwardsback even past the horrible adaptation of spawnthe characters  every one of them sucked except wolverine  if hugh jackman was not as good as he was this movie would be rated in the negatives  important too is the fact that wolverines power was the only one effectively depicted in the film  the rest was just bad lightning effects and cablework  the effects in this film are very obviously subpar  and the costumes  need i repeat what i said about artistic lisence  many people mock the cheesy spandex costumes when all they have as reference in their minds is christopher reeves in the original superman  what about 1989s batman  that suit was beautiful  and even that old shortlived tv show the flashhis suit was excellent bottom line they should have kept the original comics suits after all if we as viewers are expected to suspend disbelief and accept the world of then why is it so far fetched for them to wear those costumes instead of the black leather in the film  as for the rest of the cast patrick stewart is the ideal choice for professor x but unfortunatley his part was terribly written  ian mckellan is a poor choice for magnetotoo old and feeble looking  famke jensen is a good jean grey but fell to the same fate as patrick stewart  james marsden as cyclops  since when does cyclops look like a teenager  how in the heck can we buy that he is involved with famke jensen  he looks to be more in anna paquins age bracket which brings us to her as rogue the worst casting of the entire film almost as bad as choosing bryan singer to direct  too young and pouty lookathowmanywaysicandistortmyeyebrows type of performance and overall look  halle berry as storm physically she fits the part but again same fate as famke and patrick  ray park as toadi dont even know why hes called toad since his character is completely different than the toad in the comic  same with sabertooth  toad along with tyler mane as sabertooth the second worst character in the film are basically throwaways in this film when they are so intergral in the comicsespecially sabertooth and his relation with wolverine which is nonexistent in this film  as for rebecca romijn stamos as mystique she certainly has the physique for the part but why is she nude  again with the costume issueis there anything good about this film  yes two things1 hugh jackman is an excellent wolverine and 2 the movie does endan interesting piece of information that most people are unaware of is that although had a big opening weekend gross of over 52 million it had one of the biggest secondweek falloff rates in history of 52 grossing only 25 million  unfortunately the studio still sees this as a strong showing and has no doubt begun work on a sequel  whats worse is that they will probably get bryan singer to direct it again  this is going to be the same as the scenario with batman forever when it grossed big numbers on opening weekend and then sharpy fell off on week two and joel schumacher was granted the goahead for batman  robin which as history shows was finally recognized as a piece of crap and bombed at the box office  this will happen to 2 unless they get their act together and tend to these aforementioned problemsjust imagine if these viewers give such good reviews to junk like this film theyll be speechless when they see mylets get it together people  start recognizing these films for the junk they are and perhaps then the studios will start making better filmsrating  2 out of 10because of wolverine and because it was filmed in toronto where i live and my friend worked on it,fantasy
i believe that is one of the best sciencefiction movies ive ever seen i really enjoyed all of them but i loved jean grey and her fantastic powers i recommend this movie to everyone you must see it youre going to love it too thats for sure,fantasy
let me first just say that i was a fan of comics when i was a kid and used to read them religiously so years later when i saw that an film was coming out i was ready to go straight away and relive old comic book memories i was also ready to be dissapointed judge dredd movie however i can say that this film lived up to my expectations in just about every single way the characters were as i remember them except for toad i dont remember him and magneto and professor x were both picture perfect this film is how i used to remember blockbusters being where heroes would do heroic things and bad guys were all powerful except for one thing and a rousing music score would be playing at all the dramatic moments everyone except anna paquin should be commended for their work on this film the director obviously had read audience expectations and satisfied them to the hilt one minor grip though i would have preferred that rogue had died at the end but thats just meall up an unqualified success,fantasy
ok ill start by saying that yes this comment contains spoilers  i believe they will be necessary to argue my pointnow i loved the movie but i have a few problems with it  first the good things 1 cameos of random collossus shadowcat pyro cannonball jubilee iceman yay to them  2 stan lee an absolute must 3 most importantly the movie was well done  it wasnt a joke or a flop like previous marvel movies  it did well at the box office it didnt use ridiculous spandex corny jokes well not many or cheesy special effects bravo to marvel for actually making something decentnow onto my main point  the movie does not properly represent the firstly the are not that dark there were far too few scenes that involved sunlight or even very much colorsecondly while i realize that spandex would look bad the dont wear black leatherthird and most important of these cons  the continuity is completely wrong  those who see the movie before reading the comic will get the wrong impression of who these people are how they met etc  the movie continuity in my opinion is not canon it is not an alternate continuity it is simply completely wrongoh also i feel that it was incredibly wrong to change mystique and toad in the comic to better match their movie counterpartsevidence here we go1 rogues name is not marie  her real name has never been revealed in the comic2 rogues gaining the white streak after touching magneto is also wrong she always had it3 rogue was supposed to be a villain first  she was raised by mystique and joined the only after acquiring her superstrength invulnerability and flight powers4 the roster was wrong  the timingorder in which people joined was wrong  if cyclops and jean are adults and are why not iceman hes only a few years younger  pyro shouldnt be there at all  if storms on the team wolverine should already be too they joined at the same time5 magneto and mystique and sabretooth were never on the brotherhood together6 erik lensherr is not magnetos real name  it was revealed that he used that as an alias7 mystique does wear clothes and shes not scaly8 toad does not have this strange tongue thing nor the green goop stuff9 henry peter gyrich the guy mystique impersonates for her attack on sen kelley is a redhead also his name is misspelled guyrich in the credits10 it just doesnt fit in continuity if jean barely has any telepathy and doesnt even have a codename like um phoenix then jubilee shouldnt be there  if kitty not katie is there then wheres lockheed on the other hand i find myself asking that rather oftenum i think thats enough kvetching for now  go see it go enjoy it but keep in mind that the movie is not anywhere near an accurate representation  go buy some comics ,fantasy
great show for anyone to see whether they already know about or not hopefully the sequels which are sure to come are headed up by the same director he did an excellent job of portraying the movie in a way as to make it understandable to anyone who watches it whether they are already fans or not,fantasy
when i first heard about i wasnt surprised that hollywood will make another trash just to get some money but when i heard some people saying my friendsneighbors etc that its a good movie and i should watch it in the cinema as it has very good special effects so i watched it and i liked it very much before i watched the movie the only thing i knew about that its a comic series as well as a cartoon and it didnt fascinate me very much till i watched it and it made me almost a freak it has a mysterious start introducing the past of the bad guy and the other characters and their abilities whoever wrote the screen play he can have a good mark for making such an elaborate character description the plot is quite good but has an impossible part ie genetic mutation every hundred years or may be i misunderstood this part but not counting this little mistake the plot is acceptable actually better than mi2s the movie asks a few questions at the beginning and leaves them not answered at the end and it made me to feel quite puzzled but may be the screenwriter and the producer thought of asome sequels for this movie and they will answer in the sequels  it has stunning special effects that almost made my eyes fall out of their place it was very astonishing to watch our heroes and villains using their special powers to fight with each other the action sequences where also good but not as good as matrixs but we dont have to compare every movie to the best one in the genre i could see that the director tried to reach that level by making a few slowmo effects and some good camera angles the action sequences were quite short for me as i suspected better like the matrix but the matrix is a different situation and that is is a comic adaptation and matrix is a cyberscifiaction copying a few from its ancestors while only from the comics and the cartoons i have watched all the batman and superman movies made till now and i think is the best one among them i can bravely suggest to anyone to watch this movie at least once and i promise that those who watch it wont make a mistake briefly this movie is exciting spectacular and a 100 action movie may be the best one along with the matrix,fantasy
i must admit as an 18 female i was a little bit apprehensive about his movie i had a little knowledge about the comic book characters from listening to hours  hours of my brothers chats about his fave comic book series i think i even caught a episode or two on video but i wasnt exactly whatd youd consider a fan just hadnt paid very much attention to it and so the idea of going to see this movie didnt exactly thrill me so i went to see this movie trying to be as openminded as possible and guess what turns out i really liked the film it was good pure action and not just junky special effects it had an exceptional story for an action film interesting characters solid acting hugh jackman was the standout and a very very original plot which as you know is a rarity these days above all else it was a fun and entertaining movie i watched it very comfortably with my two young cousins and didnt see or hear anything that upset me there is some sparse profanity and one semiobscene but very common finger gesture and of course since its an action flick there was some violence but nothing too scary gruesome for younger viewers id say this movie is suitable for the average preteen just dont expect the grandparents to enjoy this one itll be over their heads o bottom line if you want action skip mi2 and check this flick out instead its definately worth a rental or two,fantasy
it is a good thing when you dont walk disappointed from the theater i guess succeeds at this giving the audience thrill visualsound effects and beautiful people this applies much more to the male audience having cast rebecca romijnstamos at no point it underestimates the viewers intelligence keeping a somewhat coherent plot for such a genre the unbelievability factor is not that high pure entertainment which doesnt require a complete cerebral turnoff,fantasy
when i first heard that there was to be a full length feature film of the i was skeptical  when i read the cast list and saw only 1 name i recognized patrick stewart i was more skeptical still  but my whole family loved this movie  it had villains and heroes and loyalty and just a tinge of love and romance on the edges  my husband usually doesnt like kiddie adventure shows but he liked this one and said it had great special effects  the scenes between wolverine and rogue were my personal favorites because i like to see the gentle side of a rough character exposed  but there were plenty of other good parts and the casting was very good  my husband also said that hugh jackman was really too young to have been cast as wolverine and strictly speaking that may be so  but he did what he does pretty enough that it stole my heart and thats not an easy thing for an actor to do in these days of pretty boys like brad pitt and leonardo di caprio  it is acceptable for kids with no nudity and very little bad language  kudos to the cast for a job well done and invitations to those of you who havent seen this movie in a word go,fantasy
just got back from seeing this film with my 5 year old daughter who thank the gods  loves movies as much as myself and she loved this movie especially the fact that there were almost as many female mutants as male ones also the fact they kicked almost as much ass though personally i felt they were a little underusedhugh jackmanwolverine is a revelation he has the intensity physicality and the sheer presence to practically carry this film by himself fortunately he had the great ian mckellan and patrick stewart to give him some truly inspired support i would of liked to of seen some more development with the other and even toad mystique and sabretooth find out there individual backgrounds but with time constraints i suppose some thing has to be droppedthe plot itself is pretty basic but what it lacks in intricasies bryan singer and the cast more than makes up for in just plain old fashioned good story tellingone thing of note most northern albertan towns dont have cage fights in there bars also there are not alot of mountains in northern alberta either i was half expecting to see a sled dog team go by or possibly an igloo at the side of the road i suppose this is a hollywood film to rewrite a quote from the last of the mohicansisnt it hollywoods policy to make the world hollywood apart from that go see the movie the best summer film so far,fantasy
ive got all what i wanted special fx are wonderful i love that history is not advanced but is not trivial too unlike other films with sfx which have trivial screenplay or have no screenplay great film for people who like andor sfx my vote 1010  i love that,fantasy
im a little surprised by the high ratings this movie gets here its a nice and entertaining action movie with some great fx but there is nothing really special about it i enjoyed watching it but im sure i wont remember anything of it in a year,fantasy
when i first read that they were going to make an movie  i thought it will never work there are too many characters too many plots i thought that the only way it might work was to restrict the number of characters butwhich ones and what about the story i discussed these issues with some friends of mine wolverine storm cyclops jean grey xavier magneto sabretooth beast gambit mystique rogue and iceman were the most wanted characters and the story it had to be wolverinecentered after all he is the worlds favourite i was extremely nervous when i went to see the movie most comic adaptations to the big screen had completely disappointed me with the exception of the two first batman and bladeeven though i liked the crow its ending has nothing to do with the original comicbook as i watched the film the only thing i could think of was this is great hugh jackman is fantastic as wolverine stewart and ians interpretations are really cool and the othersawesome ok some might say what about beast gambit colossus nightcrawler etc well thats what sequels are forbryan singer did a wonderful job even if the character of rogue isnt exactly what i expectedand i just hope that the sequels will be as good or better than this one i hope to see more of wolverines mysterious pastand see the hunted down by yuo know who,fantasy
i was surprised to say the least when watching thei expected to see a scifi movie with no plot cardboard characters and poor acting but with great special effects well i was very pleased when i left the theater i thought this was a pretty good storyline and stunning visual effects so when i got home i checked the imdb oni decided then that i would see the movie again sometime i work in a movie theater so thats no problem and i did recently what grabbed my atention the second time i saw it was that the conversion from the comic book to the real deal was excellent the suspense is really nicely built up and the dialogues especially the ones with patrick stewart were goodcompared to another scifi movie such as the matrix it just doesnt quite hack it  but its surely one of the better scifi movies of the past few years,fantasy
it is common that when somebody tries to make a movie out of a tv series to just blow everything and confuse theaudience actually is a very good adoption of theseries with a delicate touch of adventure and good plotthis is the kind of movie the big cinema screens existit is obvious that a sequel should be expected for thisonehighly recommended,fantasy
that was a very good movie it was exciting and colourful too thats a must for scifi fans its not just a silly script made for children its more than this i compare it to matrix even though you wont be able to find many common parts but both are scifi and good ones too so if you are a scifi fan if you used to like the comics or animated series if you liked star wars if you liked alien series this movie will be your next favourite scifi movie 810 2 because of the genrenot a scifi movie is worth for over than 8there are few exceptions as alien so take this as a 10,fantasy
after much anticipation i finally got around to see this much hyped movie and believe me it did not dissappointfrom start to finish this was a fx feast every actor was perfectly suited for hisher role two actors stood above all patrick stewart as prof charles francis xavier professor x as the leader of trying to save humanity from disastershades of jean luc piccardand the enigmatic sir ian mckellensimply superb as the archetypal villian the all powerful magneto the others were well suited for their roles especially anna paquin as marie rogue and the gorgeous rebecca romijnstamos as raven darkholme mystique the seductive but deadly shape shifterfmke jenssen was quite good as dr jean grey one of her better roles since goldeneyedoes anyone remember the ghastly deep risingthe movie did however manage to convey a two very simple messages1 that people who are different are not outcasts to be shunned for the differences but excepted for what they are2 one should never judge all because of the actions of a fewa movie that everyone of all ages would love to see over and over again,fantasy
if you happen to check my movie rating on this movie youll notice i gave it a big emphatically high 10 there are a few reasons why1 the script and story was topnotch kept me interested from beginning to end in some spots simply being in mental anguish just waiting to see what was going to happen next2 the fight sequences with wolverine should be noted by themselves they were awesome and very well choreographed  the precision timing that was executed was very impressive to watch3 i cant forget special effects and oh man were they ever good the weather sequences from storm the train tearing apart and the gun sequence with magneto all scenes with mystique and who could forget the statue of liberty scenefinally the most important is no 44 the overall message that the movie conveys is important to admire appreciate and point out as well  i think it easily explains the draw of so many fans quite simply  that message is that of the profoundness and power that can be brought forth from universal acceptance or respect for our fellow man and woman which most assuredly helped drive all the numbers listed abovemy final thought on this is if you looking for a good movie to take the family to see consider the a definite worthwhile time  also if more people today in our own society could exhibit such profound and passionate humanitarian qualities as charles xavier the world without a doubt would be a better place for all of us to live inoverall rating 5 out of 5,fantasy
what a great movie weve got everything here action comedy plot insiders jokes great acting great directing and amazing visual effectsa few years back the 1992 animated series started broadcasting on tv in israel and i was hooked since episode one thats where i know from i never read the comics you could imagine my surprise and excitement when i heard they were making a movie ive waited a long time and finally yesterday was the premiere of the movie in israel of course i went to the premiere you think ill wait to see this movie even one more day if i dont have to waiting for the commercials to finish 10 minutes after the designated starting time i was full of expectations for the movie of the year and might i say  it fulfilled all of my expectationsthe movie started with the most beautiful computer graphics i have ever seen in my life 5 seconds into this and im thinking they should make a screensaver out of thisnot much of the actionpart in the beginning of the movie its more of the introduction of the characters magneto rogue and wolverine there is the introduction of the plot as well and im happy to say this is not one of those plotless action movies in style of bang boom credits rolenot to worry though the action will come the fight scenes in this film are so great because of two reasons one the scifi reality of allows the director to go all out when it comes to what the characters can do what makes the fights so awesome is the originality of the moves sure you could have a great scene with sylvester stallone punchingkicking a guy but isnt it way cooler when you see storm strike her opponent with lightning or watch cyclops fry a villain with a laser beam shooting out of his eyes the second thing that makes the fight scenes breathtaking is that the producers saved no expense with visual effects without which all the mutant superpowers would not have made it through the screennow what i love most about a movie is its ability to make me laugh even while im in awe in the face of the effects the script handled this beautifully letting each and every one of the wolverinecyclops exchanges be a hysterical comic relief they talk i laugh they look at each other i laugh humor thats what i like in my menwhich brings me to the actors all the villains were hateable and all the heroes were loveable but to one exception rogue what can i say i didnt like rogue one bit in the animated series rogue was my favorite character due to her much adored girlpower kickass chick with enough puns to go around its the rogue i know and love where is she in this movie she is obviously younger here than in the series helpless and insecure the way anna paquin acted her out she reminded me more of claire danes than of superwomanhave you noticed how james marsden cyclops had bristles on his cheeks to make him look older i dont deny it that babe does have a babyface look and its what i love about him too bad he was hidden behind glasses throughout the movie except for the occasional accident of dropping them and closing his eyes before he fries everything in front of him to the ground well i guess thats just the price we have to pay to see this cutie as cyclopsnow i have nothing left to say except for my hopes for the sequel may it come to us as soon as possible 1 rogue as an adult played by someone else 2 gambit my favorite male character and his explosive cards i also want him to take immediate interest in rogue because they were always my favorite couple 3 more romance in the cyclopsjean graywolverine triangle there is definitely much to be explored in that story 4 beast would be interesting to see in the movie where was he in this one 5 james marsden james marsden and more james marsden i just cant get enough of him 6 more insiders jokes in the style of what would you have prefered yellow spandex that line cracks me up every time i hear it 7 more sequelsbottom line not just for fans but for anyone who likes action and science fiction,fantasy
to me its embarrassing how this mediocre movie has entered the top 250 films list surely it contains good specialeffects and some good acting but the movies script seems to have been written during a coffeebreak its a simple chasestory with a predictable plot a disappointment,fantasy

i had heard a lot about this movie when i went to see it a lot of negative comments i tried to empty my thoughts as i went to see iti sat down with my popcorn and coke and the movie started i tried to follow the dialog and the plot which was not that good but was more distracted by the stunning visual effectssound was great on this film good mix and elegantly put together for this type of movie a few errors must be tolerated but all in all great soundin summary the movie was good entertainment but we have seen it all before hundreds of times in other bad action movies see it for the effects they are great but the movie was not a great work of film artespen,fantasy
very nice action but also very usual doesnt show us anything new might go down great if youre a fan but if you are not then this movie can be boring and filled with the usual action movie cliches,fantasy
this movie followed the original comic book thats what i liked the most what i didnt like is that it couldve used more not just 4 bad guys and 5 or 6 good guys and there was no colossus besides that this movie was great  good storyline writing and acting 10 out of 10 beautiful im proud,fantasy
bryan singer has certainly succeeded in making a comic book movie that captures the flavor of the beloved uncanny  all of the actors capture the personalities of their comic book counterparts with the exception of mystique who in the comics was the second leader of the brotherhood of mutants  the story line does not follow to an overly predictable conclusion  a special treat was cameos by standards like kitty pryde and bobby drake  this is a very good movie but it does suffer from one flaw  its way too short  certainly i would hope that more time could have been spent developing prof xavier storm and cyclops without taking away from the obvious stars of the film wolverine hugh jackman is awesome rogue and magneto  and for a comic book movie it was a little light on the action it is well written and wolverine is the natural choice to be the center of the film  overall a good film  certainly worth the time of any fan of comics action movies or science fiction,fantasy
cant say this is a bad comic adaptation but it definitely got a lot more hype than it deserved i liked the movie but i still had qualms w it when i left the theater the movies atmosphere definitely is in tune with the series not too much violence hmmmmmm and more character introspection although the faint script does blunder this aspect quite a bit the script is halfbaked and weak but the characters acting does overshadow it not by much though oh well as quick as this was thrown together you cant say youll get everythingspoilers ahead for the uninitiated qualms for nobodywhy does wolverine freak out when he wakes up in thesion im sure wolvie aint gonna freak out if he wakes up and hears voices he was alive in the 60s you knowand yes everybody has a problem with cyclops lack of typecasting i dont think it wouldve been hard to find the playgirl model soldier boy typecast for cyclopsand there was obviously a family friendly air with the body count at 2 with no obscenities save for wolvie but ya figure hes gonna be like a truckeryoure a dick this is a war here cmonand with that standoff with magneto and the police stopping that bullet from slicing that cops brains in two now that doesnt show how driven to hatred magneto really is in this same scene you also figure dr xavier wouldve manipulated toad he was holding rogue rather than sabertooth that wouldve been tactically smarterid recommend it but dont prepare to be dazzled7,fantasy
alan bailey one word brilliant i give it 5 out of five  adam kyles once again our team of two has the same opinion about a really good movie 5 stars out of 5,fantasy
nowadays most of the summers movies leave nothing much to talk about this one however is different for it does leave plenty to think about the reason for that is that most of the summers movies are made out of effects and nothing more no script no characters and so on others however do tend to have a good script but do not have the right length or pace to be truly great we have had a share of both of these kinds of movies in this summer and the ones who obviously fit into the first category are mission impossible 2 the perfect storm the nutty professor 2 the klumps having neither seen the perfect storm not the nutty professor i can still give the reason all 3 became blockbusters it is because of their explosiveness their effects and their big stars this does not mean they are not good i mean mi 2 is good due to its explosiveness the perfect storm is good when you watch it on the big screen for the effects are overwhelming yet when youd see it at home it would suck as for the nutty professor 2 that is just a piece of trash of the latter category i have only seen one film so far being gladiator now that was a film which could have been great if the director had approached it differently but due to too much politics and a few slow parts in the film it was only good and only one of the summers best this film though is not the same as any of the films mentioned above for it accomplishes something i have not seen for quite a while it combines good characters and emotions with great special effects i think the last time i saw anything like it was in 1997 wondering what movie well yes im sorry titanic i bet now you are wondering what makes x  men so great well here it comesfirst of all i really must credit the director bryan singer whom many of you know i guess from his big breakthrough movie the usual suspects i must thank him for he is the only director after tim burton to make a truly great motion picture out of a comic book character this does not however mean that the two directors can be compared for the theme of the movies and the nature of the characters are much too different still they can be compared to both having had a great vision on something already made and imagined bryan singer did not only bring in great music good camerawork and great special effects something he had not done before but he also brought to us a tight and fast paced story without loose ends in which not the effects had the upper hands but the actors who supplied the movie with emotions and jokes this accomplishment is always due to the director and the writers who let the actors play their vision the people who cast the actors and last but very far from least the actors themselves who i might add here are no big stars but still known appreciated and capable actorsfirst of all there is magneto ian mckellen who is a villain unlike many others for he is neither wicked like darth vader or the emperor from star wars nor a psycho like norman bates from psycho or something like that instead he is a mutant who acts out his knowledge that people who are different will be stereotyped loathed maybe even feared and as a result of that will be oppressed or even killed he is a villain with a motive and can therefore be understood and is not likely to be hated or despised by the viewerthen there is wolverine hugh jackman who is the latest mutant to join the x  men in the fight against magneto his addition to the group however is somehow overshadowed by a rivalry between him and cyclops in which wolverine delivers some good laughs wolverine however also has a couple of nice moments with jean grey famke janssen and rogue anna paquin plus he is in some cool fighting scenes with mystique rebecca romijn stamos and sabretooth tyler mane and therefore is my favourite in this moviethe coolest fighting scene however is the one in which storm halle berry uses all her power to fight toad ray park who i think has in the last two years played the coolest villains on screen darth maul and the headless horseman it really is a pity that we did not see more of his cool moves and fighting but hey he was not the main villain in this filmsomeone i really must not leave out of this ode is of course anna paquin for she performs her character rogue with class this however is not the only reason i must mention this character it is also because her character is the one that has the most depth and the one i could identify most withlast but not least there are professor charles xavier patrick stewart and dr jean grey patrick stewart delivers a good performance playing a character he appears to have been born to play famke janssen delivers a good performance too and is very likeable and believable as a doctorwrapping this up i must say i can not wait to hear the people behind it are to making a sequel i feel that way because i truly believe that with x  men a comic series has been brought to the cinema that does not only meet the expectations of the true fans but that it also is a film which satisfies the normal viewer so please go and see this if you can  i swear you will not regret it9 out of 10,fantasy
i entered the cinema expecting to see a good movie because i had read most of the reviews i emerged from the cinema hall i emerged stunned the movie was amazingthe acting was very good patrick stewart and sir ian mckellan are veterans of cinema and play their characters very well stewart especially is extremely well suited as professor x however the real stars of the movie are hugh jackman as wolverine and anna paquin as rogue which is probably because they have the meatiest roles the rest of the cast do a great job as wellthe only drawback is that it is slightly short at 104 minutes the mindboggling special effects and the truly spectacular stunt work however make this movie an absolute mustsee for one and all,fantasy
this film was enjoyable from minute one the story played like a slightly dark cartoon and i thought this was the best style to use as it stayed close to the original comics the special effects for the mutant powers were spectacular but not over used it was also interesting to see the potential for sequels and the future developement of the story especially after showcasing the young mutants at the accademy the sly sense of humour came through in places and helped to lighten the tone eg logan and the metal detector and the comments about the uniformmy only slight negative is that it might have been a bit on the short side but the story did seem to flow and there wasnt and place were you thought than an obvious addition could be madethe predjudice of the mutants and the actions of some of the human characters should have struck home with people who realise that this film also carries a message,fantasy
surprised that it not only had action but also a heart the characters all had their own unique personalities which showed that the writers actually put some time in to write a script that carries you through the movie the good editing also kept the movie short which is what they should do with james bond movies,fantasy
nice action movie but not renewing i expected a lot more bad storyline too fast and simple it could have been much more if it would have been thought through a couple of times i thought it would have been the 2000 matrixacting was good but not superb could have been a better castit was just a normal action flick enjoyable but nothing more,fantasy
am i the only one who doesnt find this movie something special if you dont care about special effects you might as well go and rent batman its cheaper but dont get me wrong its not a bad movie i just expected a bit more thats all,fantasy
well ive only waited six years for this movie and i was not disappointed this is the best comic book movie since batman sure there have been some good ones like men in black and the mask but they were based on lesser known books that means there are fewer fans to please well bryan singer pleased me just fine with i knew there was almost no way it could be bad but i dared not hope it would be this good a few complaints i foresee people making and why they wont matter  1 not enough development of cyclops storm and jean true but if every character had been given as thorough emphasis as wolverine and rogue received the movie would have been twoandahalf or more hours long and no one but bigtime xfans would have been entertained cyclops and jean were handled well we got a good fell for them storm was the only one who really suffered but her battle scenes were reminiscent of storm kicking butt in the comics 2 the werent powerful enough  storm and jean didnt have the same umph they do in the comics but lets not blow out the budget their powers were accurate and the movie probably couldnt go as overthetop as comics do thats why we still have comics 3 backstory omissions  sure rogues connection with mystique and wolverines relationship with sabretooth in the comics didnt make it into the film but so what both the villains were well done and more subplots would have slowed things down too much and by the way  hugh jackman was a perfect wolverine cant wait for part 2,fantasy
too much hype over nothing special magnetto is the best here cant wait to see gambit and hopefully hell have a more manly role than awful marsden as cyclops is this wolverine or is it x men this is the big flaw here a movie based on a team is practically based on one character and even though jackman was good in his role we all know for a facteven though we dont admit it that it could have been better cast the effects are good the dialogue could have had many more lines the music was pathetic and was obviously quickly orchestrated due to the films early release date this is more of an intro to whats about to comei hope so anywaycause i want to see more of the cyclops of the comics why couldnt they just put dennis quaid ah pathetic and whats this no songs in the soundtrack ahhah come on wheres the rock soundtrack ps the individual fight scenes were decent but this movie would have been better directed by the matrix guys,fantasy
while bryan singers has received what can only be described as a thumbs up among critics and a slightly more wavering response by the audiences i feel most have missed out on it importance leaving the cinema on a hot summer night i recognised a strange smile amongst the males that exited with their satisfied but less than impressed girlfriends the kids boy or girl did not have this almost uniform smirk either the men who have grown up on star wars indiana jones and bond seemed to recognise something theyd long been missing i can only describe it as akin to the feeling explicated at the end of field of dreams by james earl jones it may not of had the john woo inspired chaos or the bruckenhiemer orange filtered cool it lacked the set in stone star power machismo of a mel bruce or nic and it wasnt plagued with a critical case of referential irony while i certainly enjoy all these in a movie except the latter as you might have guessed had something the blockbusters of late had lost in the brew or just plain didnt care about it had a story it had characters it had ideas and best of all it wanted to present them as well and as intelligently as the summer action seat filler would allow this was the reason we went to see jaws all those years before high concept was branded on the arse of every piece of cinematic entertainment sure the shark was cool we went to see the effects and the action and jokes but what made us buy another ticket what made us recommend it to our friends what made us queue around the block for a third viewing what made us hum the theme tune in the local lido what made us watch it on tv video and dvd year in year out ill tell you what an incredible piece of story telling with characters who actually seem like people as opposed to archetypes from other films and in recent years the most we could hope for is the star gets some choice wisecracks and the action is half as exciting as it was in the trailer comparing and contrasting with recent examples is a futile exercise the two most successful blockbusters of last summer the matrix and the phantom menace dont deserve as near as much the adulation they received and continue to gain they both suffer from the same problems that the miraculously lacks they both set up overcomplicated plots the essential premise is understandable from the trailer but they still find it necessary to bog the section after the opening action sequence down with an hour of exposition the matrix for all it camera tricks and location changes essentially has lawrence fishburne lay down the plot for over forty minute of cleverly shot talking heads where is the spectacle in that star wars i is crippled by even worse pacing and expositional problems it needs to set up all the characters for the next two films but also have a story within this one so while all the future relationships get their first meeting scene its hard to feel excited about any of the paths joining as thats all that happens for a film that opens with standard rolling introduction titles to brining us up to date all we basically chalk up for the following two hours is movie of scene setting for later installments yes obi wan and annakin do meet but little occurs between them the same can be said for the mother of his future children as andrew ohehir concluded in his report at the time of its release  this installment feels less like an opening chapter than a stammering parenthetical preface should ail with same defect it is the opening part of a franchise and worse still has thirty years worth of idolised comics to condense into two hours unlike batman which not only had huge audience recognition from noncomic readers due to the camp tv series and only one lead to introduce has a diverse cast to acquaint as well as a world that is obviously different from ours despite parallels to deal with the huge roll call of introductions the scripting team of tom de santo singer and credited writer david hayter have gone for what ill call the star wars approach a new hope that is establish one character and then have them promptly meet up with everyone needed on his quest in the same way luke skywalker briskly picks up the droids the sage the pirate the muscle and the plucky heroine on his journey he also has plenty of adventures on the way culminating in one big dnouement this way the plot is peppered with action that effects the proceedings and all the characters are introduced both in time to have purpose in the last act but also for future episodes the mission still propels the story but it also requires that the whole gang is assembled follows rouge and wolverine as they discover who they are what their powers are and what their place in society is like the hierarchy set up in star wars where the characters understanding of the mystical force sets the characters social standing here the more control a character has of their mutation the higher their ranking in the group clasical actors patrick stewart and ian mckellen take the roles of leaders of each side but also the alec guinness role in star wars of swiftly explaining the complicated mythology in simple but legendary sounding terms here mythology is replaced with political import the science introduction that hears stewart booming about evolution and mutation should if the producers have any sense become the regular opening for all entry in the series but apart from that most of the old hands speechifying is used to show their strange relation singer far prefers to show everything visually whether it be wolverines ability to smell danger cyclops power people prejudices of mutants or what magnetos doom machine does by keeping dialouge for character as opposed to signaling plot changes we have a far quicker fluid reality createdin nearly all press interviews singer has explained what drew him to the project he knew little about was the comparison to malcolm x and martin luther king we sense that magneto and xaiver have history merely from the casting when magneto says by any means necessary this doesnt seem like clumsy misuse of a historical slogan or tacking on importance via historical events taking events were people lost lives to add verisimilitude is probably the hardest and halfwitted thing to achieve as a director spielberg can be hit and miss and james camerons focus on a pair of stroppy teen in titanic was insulting uses its history deftly ellis island civil rights gun control mccarthyism and most risky of all nazi concentration camps work together as evidence to supports the reality these mutants live in is probably the most distinct cinematic allegory since high noon its subject is political intolerance its brave and skillful inclusion of a tragedy like the holocaust to open the film setting out its stall not as merely popcorn fodder but as a piece more interested in a human side than car chases it wants to show how these characters developed their ideals not their powers magneto is presented as someone so obsessed with equality hes willing to turn everyone into someone like him interestingly the starting point to this particular battle is a vote grabbing senator who is riding on peoples fears to pass a witch hunt law against mutants after magnetos plan fails one of his hench mutants actually disguises herself as the now dead senator and turns the vote around hows that for two opposing side causing moderation the bad guys actually stop the bill because the good guys stopped their far more nefarious scheme its a more pertinent message on modern living than we need guns lots of guns nearly every blockbuster of the last decade has been as flawed so it really is unfair to pick on the wachowskis and lucass successes to this extent apart from the fact theyve had such special treatment compared to everyone else earned a favourable review and an in depth article by kim newman in film magazine of record sight and sound newmans piece however was concerned with the process it took to get the film from the funnybook into the can and the review still felt like it was selling tickets as opposed actually judging whether the film would have any after life apart from sequels this is the cackhanded way all hollywood summer juggernauts are brushed aside by the university degree press and sight and sound is more than guilty of this perhaps this will go some way to redressing the balance these movies are the most watched have the most effect on the economics of the movie business and really do make or break careers the fact that singer has once again proven himself to be the master storyteller as he did with the usual suspects and made a movie that displays all the merits of big budget entertainment should be of note enough the fact that it could have more import than a thousand worthy documentaries on modern day prejudices should be celebrated,fantasy
basic plot outline in a scifi twist on humanity we enter a world whereby people are born as mutants this enables them to have supernatural powers and abilities due to permutations in their genetic infrastructure two mutants wolverine tortured by a forgotten past and rogue a young girl with uncanny powers stumble upon the world of professor x he runs a secret school whereby mutants can learn to use their powers unplagued by the prejudices of an intimidated modern society but trouble is abrewing at the hands of the professors excolleague excuse the pun hehehe magneto as he bands together some evil mutants to prepare for the oncoming war between humanity and mutant based on the famous comic book seriesreview  to my surprise again i really enjoyed this film it rates up there with tank girl as one of those really cool comic book to movie films i am not a comic book fan but i believe that they were pretty much true to the basic storyline of the series its not in the league of singers the usual suspects  or as dark and daunting as apt pupil  but basically its a lot of action filled fun its got cute people its got eye candy its got brilliant effects its got a coherent narrative what more could you want,fantasy
i went to see x men expecting something big  i left feeling that i had just seen a set up film  it was obvious from the start that this film was going to be setting up for the next onei felt that the performances where good especially patrick stewart but the rest really just faded into the backgroundits good but not great  go see it if your into the cartoon or the comic if not then wait for the next one,fantasy
comics adaptations are inevitably bad and a source of great pain to comics fans so i really expected this film to be very very bad  the inproduction coverage for screamed batman meets the matrix too many corridors too much greytoned scenery sculpted grey plastic costumes imagine my surprise then that it turned out to be the second best fun movie i saw all summer  it was all lean nofat nonstop action   the plot was dumb starts pretentious then slides into an animated conclusion but the breathless style carried it offit has its faults true but like the comic these come from its strengths wolverine is the only real character the coolest and sexiest in a very dull bunch and this is the only part with any meat or development  the other youve heard of show up do powers and leave prototypes for the action figures they hope your kids are buying by the truckload  the women have breasts which is nice and one is basically bodypainted butt nekkid to bring in the arresteddevelopment demographic  patrick stewart and ian mckellen grand old exports of english theatre bring personal gravitas to underwritten parts and regardless of how well the film works mckellen remains hopelessly miscast  the bad guys are bad but what can you expect from a wrestler and a stunt man  toad is one of the dullest villains in comics history and the movie just keeps throwing ludicrous new powers at him in a vain hope hell seem less lame  please say theyre not in the sequelfor the sake of the effects budget im sure most of the fight scenes take place in fog snow or shadow  sadly hiding the strings also makes what should have been absolute showstoppers difficult to followits a great blueprint for future franchise efforts which we can be sure everyone else with a superhero film on their slate will ignore,fantasy
it took a lot of time for to make it to the big screen and turn into a motion picture event but the final result was worth the waitingthis smashhit not only beat the crap out of the other blockbusters but also received terrific reviews and gained the love of the public around the whole world for a very good reason what makes such a vivid interesting and original movie is the fact that it isnt a typical pointless action blockbuster reminds me a lot of the first superman released in 1978 because such as back in the seventies superman was the motion picture that everybody was waiting to see for a long time and people made lines in front of the theaters to watch for the first time a man flyingso you see it had that appeal that feeling and the movie also had a good wellwritten story you dont get walltowall action in superman  of course there are adventure and scenes in which the special effects are necessary to build that moment  but the story is so sweet and human that you feel like you really got to know every one of the characters in the end you cheered for superman you cried in some sad scenes you enjoyed the ride but nowadays you dont get that feeling any more came in just about the right time with its oldfashioned story in which the main characters and not just the special effects have the spotlightin you will find everything that makes a movie so great a terrific director brian singer is the guy responsible for films like apt pupil and the usual suspects a brilliant story and great acting by a talented cast anna paquin is so beautiful and great hereshe changed a lot since the pianothe only thing that didnt change is her powerful talentcongratulations for the cast directors for giving to hugh jackman the role of wolverine this is the part he was born to play and he is such one hell of a good actor that i am certain that he has a brilliant stellar future on hollywoodwatch and discover again the pleasure to watch a beautiful and oldfashioned story,fantasy
 was an excellent movie and for those of you that thought it needed to have a more matrixlike feeling i dont know whats wrong with you the matrix certainly did have a lot more action and fight scenes and it certainly did have a lot less plot and character development unfortunately thats why the matrix sucked while the matrix relied solely on special effects to sell it had a story so if youre hoping for some matrixlike film see hollowman if youd like to see a movie with a plot and some welldeveloped characters see,fantasy
times are really changing im old enough to remember fairly regular announcements of my favorite comics characters preparing to leap to silverscreen glory only to fall dismally short usually mired in abusrd circuses of litigation im also old enough to recall the slide of the superman series into camp hokum as well as the period in the mid80s where former marvel honcho stan lee apparently went insane selling his companys entire character catalogue to the schmucks who made all those chuck norris movies i dont have the room to go into the results even if i wanted toafter all that to watch hopefully as tim burton saved the comics world in 89 then to watch in disbelief as joel schumacher turned the character into a sydney mardi gras float drained me of my enthusiasm for comicbased films by the time was finally greenlitwell i always enjoy a film that manages to surprise me i finally caught a matinee of and it did indeed surprise me i wont waste words on a playbyplay synopses if youve seen it you already have an opinion and if you havent ill simply say you wouldnt be wasting your money or time on this movie what more can you ask for these daysits a simple enough story told quite effectively instead of simply hashing over your basic good versus evil spandex grudgematch singer and co give us an intelligent yet fanciful picture of warring ideologies with the stakes at their most extreme in the themselves we find heroes whom despite their awesome powers are as paradoxically complex and ordinary as we are even the villains are afforded a strangely refreshing tragic dignity beneath their grotesque surfacesnaturally a great deal of the credit for the success of this film has been bestowed upon patrick stewart and sir ian mckellen and they do deserve credit just for agreeing to appear in a movie the more effete critics will see as beneath them mr mckellen is to be commended for rising erik magneto lensherr above a villain into an angry and misguided victim exploiting his special talents for a most ironic revenge the films bedrock the role of charles xavier is obviously no strain on mr stewarts talent but he deserves gratitude for never playing down to the film or its audiencestill its the supporting cast all relative newcomers whom the diehard fans will turn out in droves for and they shouldnt be disappointed i dont claim to be an expert when it comes to the history and characterizations of the but i was pleasantly surprised at how accurately they were portrayed as well as how well they were portrayed mr jackman and the pianos ms paquin in particular provided welcome surprises in their respective pivotal roles as the semiferal misfit logan and the lonely sensitive runaway who calls herself rogue famous covergirls fammke jansen halle berry and rebecca romijnstamos as well as teen idol james marsden also contribute solid dimensional performances in their surprisingly wellscripted parts prowrestler tyler mane as victor sabertooth creed does well with what little of the film he is given as does redhot stuntman ray park whose darth maul stole the show in star wars episode 1 as the incredibly agile mortimer toad toynbeein a movie like this one would normally expect the prerequisite overindulgence of special visual effects to glaze over any weaknesses or inconsistencies wisely and thankfully the filmmakers chose to throttle back substantially on the visuals which are confined mostly to the battle sequences and used sparingly throughout the rest of the film mostly to illustrate the extent of the powers of xaviers youthful charges and frankly im pleased to report there arent really many serious weaknesses or inconsistencies in the film to warrant such glitzy excessesgiven the generally somber tone and themes of the storyline fanaticism alienation militant philosophy will probably never achieve the revered classic status of 1978s superman the movie ironically richard donner is one of this films producers but thanks to its razorsharp production style and quirky humor it will likely be every bit as influential if not a fair bit smarter than tim burtons 1989 batman,fantasy
im going to go out on a limb here and predict that hugh jackman is going to go on to become a huge hollywood star jackman plays wolverine in bryan singers silver screen adaptation of marvel comics supergroup the the story is set in the not so distant future where genetic mutation has created what mankind comes to know as mutants a person born with special abilities or powers senator robert kelly bruce davison is the leader of a group of people that fear the mutant menace and is championing the introduction of the mutant registration act senator kelly fears for mankind should the mutants ever decide to strike out in anger against the rest of society meanwhile on the other side of the coin there is an ongoing battle between the two major factions in underground mutant society charles xavier patrick stewart and his and magneto ian mckellen and his brotherhood of mutants xavier is in favour of a peaceful coexistence between man and mutant and magneto favours the idea of ruling the inferior homo sapiens when magnetos brotherhood attempts to kidnap two newly discovered mutants named rogue anna paquin and wolverine the have to intervene wolverine and rogue are offered asylum inside xaviers school for the gifted which serves as a window dressing for a school where mutants can learn to control and harness their powers the school is also the base of operations for the xavier is troubled by magnetos apparent interest in these two new faces what could he have in store for them and what would the implications be on the future of mutantkind singer directs a wonderful film that concentrates more the characters and the story than the action but never ignores the need to spice up the plot just a little setting the tone here is jackman in his first major film role and what is sure to be a breakout role stewart and mckellen deliver powerfully restrained performances as the leaders of the two mutant groups never appearing too campy or overbearing the rest of the supporting cast was simply xcellent in their respective roles including ray park of star wars fame as the menacing mutant toad and former supermodel famke janssen as the beautiful dr jean grey long time fans of the marvel comics series will take special interest in some of the cameos made by their old favourites and new fans of the story will marvel at the complexity and humanity of a wonderfully crafted story so in the immortal words of wolverine hey bub get your ass out of that chair and go see my movie,fantasy
maybe i just expected too much from this movie i expected the ultracool matrixfeeling a powerful mixture of suspense and coolness a extremely good arrangement cool modern music styling and all thatwhat i got was an average movie well the looks are cool but unlike the title and theme suggest there are not many fights and all coolness is well carelessly destroyed again and again this movie is too calm too friendly to actorcentralized the actors are very good not to say ideal  but this movie lacks simply style not in the outfit but in the way it was managed this isnt really an action movie it has the looks but it concentrates far too much on the characterization of the people namely the mutantsim very surprised that it gets that good comments here on imdb i had been very frustrated of this movie and i all people i have asked said the same i cant give a recommendation for anyone maybe people which didnt saw the matrix before will be happy with this movie quality but im not,fantasy
clearly the makers were afraid of going all the way but played it safe to please hollywood and to make enough money to get the green light for a sequelmaybe in the up coming sequel theyll go to the darker side of the comic steering away from the main steam candy coating is true to the comic but is lacking soul or edge for a reference in edge in a comic book adaptation movie see the blade,fantasy
i went into the theatre expecting to fall in love with this film i had read and heard good things about it and i like my superhero films a bit dark and while i am not a diehard xfan i looked forward to seeing storm one of my favourite superheroines on screen and larger than lifei was disappointed by the film in the end i neednt tell you what a washout performance halle berry gave as storm a strange imbalance in this crowded movie was too much character background for some characters none for others i assume they will work this out in sequels but isnt assuming that there will be sequels a bit pretentious it certainly isnt a good excuse for making a lame first film which should be able to stand alone i submit star wars for your edificationi think that what really hurt the film aside from the fact that for long stretches nothing happened is the lack of humour i counted 4 jokes and they were wry ones at best im off to watch batman 1989 again,fantasy
as an fan since 1986 the movie was well done the story line was decent and it was easy to follow i was disapointed by the change in costumes of the especially wolverine i like his mask in the comics also some of the characters were miscast rogue seemed a little young and bobby and cyclops were also too young but patrick stewart was awesome as xavier i hope to see a sequal or 2 from this cast,fantasy
rarely does a movie come along that works so well on so many levels with the appeal to engage an audience of young and old alike  directed by bryan singer is one of them  simply put there is something here for everyone theres the obvious story which is excellent by the way which can be taken at face value and will be the attraction of the wider audience and then there is the allegory to ponder for those who choose to go the distance sorry folks no clues you have to do it on your own its part of what makes this movie so good  just be advised there is a whole lot more to this movie than meets the eye and its so well done and delivered from the directing to the outstanding performances to the dazzling special effects  singer has done a superb job of bringing this all to the screen his pace and timing couldnt be better and he seems to have an innate sense of what makes this material work and how to put it across  this film could so easily have become just another scifi b rated throw away in the wrong hands but with singer at the helm and with such a great cast it doesnt come anywhere near sinking to that level  there is also a restraint in the use of the special effects here that makes them all the more spectacular and again singer must be given credit for that as well ,fantasy
whenever i hear there that a comic is made into a movie i start to cringe as a comic fan i have seen a lot of blasphemy crying freeman is the only comic movie that stayed true to the comic all the other comic movies always have a story differing from the comic that bothers me but sometimes some comic movies get of the hook the punisher and blade didnt follow the comic but they were good surprised me a lot though the effects were great there was not a lot of action but somehow the story of rogue and wolverine captivated me more although i think rogue should have been kitty or jubilee hugh jackman is megacool as wolverine something that i didnt expect at all hugh reminded me of clint eastwood though dont know why maybe his facial expressions or his hair are the reason i really liked the movie it surprised me if you like science fiction or comics is the movie for you there were 2 negative points though mystique looked worse than the mystique in comics and cyclops was really a wimp unlike in the comic where he is a real leader and a likeable character,fantasy
good scifi drama yes you can hardly call it an action movie lookin past some sequences as expected the effects were brilliant and cool actors that suited their roles but bryan singer the talented dirctor behind the critically acclaimed the usual suspects should have done a better job with the action scenes making more out of the potential thats this movies weakness,fantasy
first time i saw the trailer i already knew that i had to see it and it was very hard to wait until it finally started in germany where i lived at that time now i am living in denmark and yesterday the film started hereof cause i had to see it again this time in english with subtitleshaving seen the comic strip on television as a youngster and read the comics i was not disappointed at all my great respects go out to hugh jackman wolverine he really is the incarnation of the comic herohe is the most charismatic and sexy man with the most incredible screen presence i have ever seen i am very glad that this other guy that was supposed to play wolverines part was occupied brian singer was lucky to get hugh to do it now the hard time of waiting for the second part starts but without any doubt an new star is born and his name is definitely hugh jackman,fantasy
this is without a doubt the best comic to film adaption ever it is a movie that focuses just as much time on the characters as the action and the action lets just say it is worth seeing for the fight scenes but still the action scenes are my only gripe its not that theyre bad its that theyre short they dont spend enough time during some of the scenes i was hooked on the movie as soon as the film introduces wolverine the cage scene was just plane fun to watch and i loved the arguments between wolverine and cyclops they were prettty funny bryan singergreat directorstays very true to many of the characters accept couldnt rogue fly i was a big fan as a kid and i remember her flying and whoever casted hugh jackon was brilliant he was the greatest thing to watch while he was wolverine he really embodied the character i hope this film makes him a stari bet it will and the sequel will be great too if they get the same cast itll be good i read that keana reeves wants to e gambit that should be pretty cool only thing im worried about that is the paycheck 9510,fantasy
 does so many things right for all the right reasons bryan singer and his screenwriters took a comic book property owned and operated by marvel enterprises  a company that has driven all of its best titles to creative extinction particularly their xtitles  and produced a textured iconic moviethe comic book characters of wolverine and rogue magneto and professor xavier the films main players are magnificently realized by the actors involved whereas the comics versions of these characters are thin mechanical props for a corporation to feed off of the films actors create histories motivations and passions by being earnest and real in their portrayals hugh jackman in particular as wolverine is able to take his toughguy sneer or cocky walk and excellently almost within the same scene display kindness and intelligence and a humanity this kind of acting job is rarely seen in action cinema and because it is action cinema jackmans accomplishment is nothing short of astoundingevery scene of is fabulously designed by director singer only what is needed is shown onscreen with excess verbiage and plot boiled down to essentials but what is there is elegant and powerful even with the unfortunate influence of hollywoods summertime moronics  the postelevator revenge of storm a push to get something cool out of halle barry ends up hollow and anticlimactic compared to the life and death struggles around hers and the hitandmiss musical score of michael kamen stick out s detailed acting and superb direction obliterate hollywoods kiss of death is a great movie with weight and substance stemming from creator talent and passion for the story an achievement by everyone involved,fantasy
as an old fan of the comics i have to say that this movie is even greater than those i stopped reading the comics about 8 years agoi was too old for it but this movie got me thinking that i should start reading it again this is a not a traditional superhero movie and thats a good thing it has depth a story that can be applied to todays society it handles issues such as racism prejudice and geneticengineering of course the movie is no schindlers list in the way it handles the issues but id say this movie has more depth and thought put in it than some other of the years blockbusters like gladiator and the patriot with no thru and thru good or bad sidethe only dissapointment about the film is that it ended i would still have been glued to my seat if it would have been 3 hours i cant wait for the sequels please make them quickly,fantasy
if you see one movie this year the old adage has never been more apt than for this brilliant example of action movie making  joel schumacher take note when you are bringing comic book characters off the page this is how you do it  the key elements in this film are realism keeping the humour to a minimumso that it doesnt descend into farce and a strong band of key characters led by established actors that know what they are doing this movie has all of this and more with patrick stewart and ian mckellen as the base and hugh jackman halle berry and anna paquin making the story come to life  the special effects were amazing and the naked mystique kept cinema goers glued to the screen throughout  how they didnt let anything slip was incredible     the film is very open for a number of sequals especially the closing line from xavier  wherever you go we will be right there to stop you old friend bryan singer keep it coming as the other pretenders to the superhero genre have nothing on youneil,fantasy
i really was positively surprised about the much talked about moviethe characters have been brought on screen in a wonderful way  especially hugh jackman as wolverine and halle berry as storm were fantastic in roles as superheroes the whole atmosphere is very dark and gritty which fits the movie very well in its attempt to show a society scared of mutantsthe way in which many small tidbits from the comic books were thrown into the movie was really a joy to see  characters like kitty pryde and iceman or rogues famous white hair as well as cyclops remark about yellow latex costumes were just perfect to make this movie a real experience,fantasy
director brian singer has a good track record as the writerdirector of the utterly superb usual suspects  this is his first foray into blockbuster summer action moviesfor a newbie hes not done too badly at all is one of the best action films of the year  its wellwritten and generally wellacted standouts are the previously unknown hugh jackman who is awesomely charismatic  expect to see more of this man  and anna paquin is highly sympathetic as a young mutant whose mere touch is potentially lethal  ian mckellan and patrick stewart are as reliable as ever as the two conflicting mutant leaders  the rest of the cast dont get much of a lookin although rebecca romijnstamos is memorable admittedly not so much for her acting as for the fact that she spends the whole film naked save for some strategicallyplaced blue paint is surprisingly short for a summer blockbuster  only 104 minutes  and in some respects is perhaps too short  the plot can be summed up on the back of an envelope act 1  what is magneto up to  act 2  so thats what magnetos up to wed better stop him  not exactly war and peace  in some respects its actually quite refreshing to have such a crisply plotted film but on the other hand its very obvious that theres a sequel on the way important plot arcs are left unfinished at the close of the filmthis film will no doubt be the start of a profitable franchise  its an enjoyable film with rather more gravitas than most summer popcorn movies and it well deserves its success,fantasy
this film is so bad one liners suck dialogue is horrible and its filled with all the boring repetetive cliches without 3 gorgeus models janssen romijnsantos and berry i would have given this 0 now it gets 4 mckellen and stewart are wasting their talent with this halfbaked film that is nothing what it couldve been,fantasy
i must admit i never really got into comics as a kid but i still knew the story this movie did a good job of introducing people to their tale it probably wont satisfy hardcore fans but it was rather enjoyable for people like me hugh jackman was amazing as wolverine as was anna paquin as rogue the only real things i can find wrong with the movie were its pace a little slow in parts and its plot a little thin and rushed other than that this movie was great with special effects that were amazing i gave it an 8,fantasy
 was entertaining yes but the one thing that was claimed made it into more than the average comic adaptation was the character development that in my opinion doesnt exist there are simply too many potentially interesting characters here to explore them all in 95 minutes hence except for hugh jackmans and anna paquins characters all others get short shrift as opposed to many other made from comic movies the characters here leave you stunningly detached no wonder with this little time one might say but that also seemed to be the case with the actors none of them seems to take great interest in differentiating their roles through their portrayal but how could they the narrative squanders aimlessly the dialogue is probably as bad as it gets and a little irony towards the material as displayed in the superman features would have gone a long way towards preventing from total cheesiness well its not cheesy throughout mind you but at least once too often besides as i expected the film is nowhere near as clever or important as it has often been claimed the message of tolerance is a good one as a concept but because of the script which is less than stellar i might add couldnt christopher mcquarrie have done it and foremost the sheer haste with which bryan singer sweeps through the story and past any real drama the film ultimately sabotages its own point the heroes are heroes the villains are villains good is good bad is bad but please live together peacefully any shades of gray get lost somewhere between the ten or so main characters pity this really could have had a point to makethat said i must however admit that i thoroughly enjoyed this movie as popcorn entertainment its great and certainly more worthwhile than any of the latest bruckheimer action flicks and id personally embrace any movie featuring patrick stewart ian mckellen and anna paquin altogether but somehow it all left me a bit disappointed considering the hype about how different from other comic adaptations this was supposed to be as a result might have been a lot better as a tv series pilot with that cast those fx and that huge pool of characters and story possibilities dont you think itd do great on a weekly basis i sure do,fantasy
i wasnt going to bother watching when i heard about it but since there was nothing else on at my local cinema i thought id give it a try is not what i expected usually i try to avoid these comic book movies but this one was different is a brilliant movie if your a fan of the cartoon series and the comic books then is the one to watchfans of special effects will also love this movie there are some great scenes in where special effects are put to good usethe action in this movie is also very high infact theres never a dull moment in 910,fantasy
this comment contains what some people might consider spoilersfirst of all i had never heard of the comic book before i heard about bryan singer directing this film ive never read the comic and i havent got a clue where to find copies so this comment is written from an uninformed point of view was better than i expected it had a good plot a very fascinating story indeed good actors patrick stewart ian mckellen need i say more and nice visual and special effects my main complaints though are toad  he is just too close to the ridiculous  and the fact that it is too short i dont mean too short as in bryan singer wasnt able to tell his story in that short amount of time i simply mean that the film was so darn entertaining that i wanted it to go on for at least thirty minutes more nevermind to get back to the acting patrick stewart and ian mckellen are the standouts of course but anna paquin was much better than i expected and hugh jackman was brilliant as wolverine and wolverine god if he was around id swoon just so that he could catch me in his strong arms jealous of jean grey famke janssen me certainly not  as for that cute little semilove story i really think that wolverine should wait until rogue paquin gets a little older they would be a great couple of the there are two characters who are let down by the script cyclops and storm cyclops walks around looking cool not much more and though storm is indeed stunningly beautiful i really hope that she gets more room in the inevitable sequel and of course all the villains except for magneto are also only shadows of what they could be but i guess that we will get to know them when the sequel arrives with that ending there just has to be a sequelin short stewart  mckellen  wolverine  fascinating story  good directioning  wicked film 810,fantasy
although some of the characters dont do much but stand around and the plot is kind of soft it still is a very entertaining moviea great deal of special effects a great deal of action a buttkicking wolverine beautiful sexy ladies portraying beautiful sexy mutants a touch of humor and a touch of heartthrobbing scenes makes it worthwatchingon a 010 scale i give it an 8,fantasy
to be honest ive never read long enough that it would make me a true fan however i was stunned how serious this film brought the comic to life there also were many quotes and moments that become even better if you know the comic i dont think it is a good idea to make movies out of comic books but this time and with one or two tim burton movies too it worked very well anna paquin hugh jackman patrick stewart and ian mckellen are absolute convincing justifying every modification made on the character even ruce davison was great and let no doubt about the sincerity of his action occur the only thing that bothered me a little was that  at least in the german dubbed version of the film  small touch of arrogant right hand put onto cyclops but here too i think fans of the comic book now better although he always said to be no fan of the comic bryan singer seemed to have made a film full of love for the material making that over the top characters like magneto or sabretooth appear serious and true stands way above the usual superhero flicks in character and plot development but also doesnt try to look more real through cutting superpowers to a more realistic level and for the visual expressiveness seeing someone carrying a tray with glasses of champaign in wolverines dream or professor xavier graciously standing up from a chair inside kellys memories are just two little details of many where the action movie grows to be art i surely cant wait to see beast or gambit in action but for a sequel it would also be an idea to concentrate more on the characters that are standing on the side line in the first movie like storm or cyclops after all is a great piece of film fun to watch and almost flawless in portraying some of the greatest comic heroes of all times and lets recent superhero flicks like batman  robin look even more hollow than they already are i hope their will be more films like in the future but i also hope that marvel understands that there is a big difference between the movies and the comic books and dont repeat the mistake of letting a film change an already existing comic like they did with blade,fantasy
a vibrant action comic book translation with a eye to future sequelsit unfortunately travels the easy genesis path of why and how the heroes originate its about time that film makers realised that most of their audience knows the whys and wherefores they could then concentrate on producing a movie with a strong independent storyline involving the charactersa film about the vietnam war does not need an explanation of the political and economic factors creating the war westerns stand alone without the aid of definitions of cowboy and indian cultureget a story then put the heroes in it not the other way round,fantasy
hi  im from brazil and ive seen this movie yesterdayi was expecting a lot of this movie and i was not disappointed  this movie has something that others comic books adaptations havent a great sense of humour  and theres a lot of great characterization by the cast specially from hugh jackmananna paquinpatrick stewart and sir ian mckellen  there are awesome special effects and a high fidelity to the comic book although theres something that it lacks but i dont know what it is maybe the running time  had gave me that impressionthe things happen so fast on this one but what matters is that i really enjoyed it  i give it a 95 from 10 ,fantasy
i was expecting much from this film and surprisingly i wasnt disappointed most comic bookbased films are badly made and just plain silly but this one was an exception like batman 12 director bryan singer has made a serious film with only a few light gags which all fit perfectly into the film the story centers around wolverine and roque who both are introduced as newcomers to rest of the group the big story is about stopping magnetos plans but its somehow of lesser importance than the relationship between wolverine and rogue which doesnt bother me at all this is an action movie but the talky parts are better than the action something that is very rare in a blockbuster and i think its all the better a movie for it the acting is great hugh jackman is wolverine hes a marvel to behold anna paquin is great as the tragic rogue patrick and mckellen are great as usual and the rest of the cast looks great especially the ladies but have little to do this is certainly a beginning for a saga and it doesnt bother me because in the long run im sure it will work nicely with its sequels a great original film go see it,fantasy
i have never been a fan of in my life the characters always seemed dumb in the cartoon series on fox kids and ive never read the comics of it i wasnt very psyched that that they were making an movie but then i found out that bryan singer was directing it that seemed very interesting because usual suspects and apt pupil both great films had little to no action in them then i also found out that patrick stewart and ian mckellan were starring in it along with a bunch of young actors with no really major credit besides anna paquin with the piano that got me more interested and once i saw the preview i knew i had to go see this movie im glad i did has so much to offer in an hour and a half and as i was sitting there watching toad walk on walls professor x use cerebro magneto floating through the air and the climactic battle scene of wolverine vs sabretooth on the statue of liberty i was thinking this is what you go to the movies forand not only does have fantastic special effects great stunts and xceptional battle scenes it also has a good story and good characters i know some of them deserved more screen time but they still were such great actors who really portrayed the fact that the werent all happy best friends i loved the tension between logan wolverine and cyclops you can tell that they didnt like each other from the start and the story was not built around special effects and fight scenes unlike a very overrated movie starring keanu reeves but it had substance i could tell bryan singer really wanted to prove that a movie based on comic books could be more than a comicbook movie and of course this movie had the coolest villains in it mystique was a purely evil and sinister spy and had the coolest morphing ability her power was probably the coolest out of all the mutants toad had a wicked sense of humor and was great to see in battle using his tongue slime and leaping ability to fantastic use sabretooth was a badass mutant with strong senses of smell and had sweet fight scenes with logan especially the fight on top of ellis island and magneto was played so well by ian mckellan you could just feel his presence throughout the movie he also had such an awesome power id love to be able to control all metal objectsall in all was one of funnest movies ive ever been to in a long time it will never bore you and will keep you captivated with its phenomenal special effects awesome fight scenes great humor exciting story and characters you can grow to love now i cant wait until the sequel 1010,fantasy
allow me to introduce my inner geek  i own spiderman 3 first appearance of doctor octopus  i keep it in a mylar case and i display it prominently in my home  i collect comic books  more specifically when i was a kid i collected marvel comic books  people who didnt collect might not understand the distinction but let me explain marvel published spiderman the fantastic four the hulk and daredeviland marvel published the and as long as i read comics i dreamed of an movie  so this past sunday it was not without considerable emotional baggage that i plunked down my 950 to watch the movie version of thelets back up a second  following are the top 10 comic book superhero movies ever1 superman 19782 batman 19663 superman ii 1980and thats it  4 through 10 are a noshow because the rest of those superhero movies rotincluding and especially the recent batman movies but then theres  honestly  i think is 4the tone of the movie is grim but not humorless  it takes the outrageous comic book conventions seriously enough that we believe they believe  its not burdened with the need to ironically joke about how stupid the very idea of superheroes is and as a consequence the movie takes itself seriously enough to be fun  and the movies themes about bigotry and human rights arent profound but theyre there  professor x patrick stewart is to martin luther king as magneto ian mckellen is to malcolm x if you can believe it  as directed by bryan singer usual suspects apt pupil this comic book movie actually has some interesting ideas in itokay  the setup for reasons nobody understands some people are born with strange superpowers theyre mutants  but just like there are good lawyers and bad lawyers there are good mutants and bad mutants  the are good  magneto is badmagneto is a powerful mutant with a dastardly plan to expose all of the worlds leaders to dangerous levels of radiation turning them into the things they fear most mutants  once theyve been mutated it stands to reason theyll have to defend their own rights as mutants  its actually a great plan not the usual supervillain grab for power  as much as he can in a story like this singer takes conventional goodvsevil stuff and twists it  magneto isnt evilhes a holocaust survivor who sees mutants as the next persecuted minority   as my friend jeff said this may be the first movie ever where the jew in the concentration camp is the bad guywe dont get to know most of the characters in this movie but anybody whos allowed real screen time is engagingwhich is why wolverine and rogue are the most interesting  wolverine hugh jackman is hands down the best here  he was even sexy enough to elicit whistles from womenand maybe menin the theatre i was in  wolverine is first seen making money in barfights and fighting off antimutant bigotry with his retractable claws were told his skeleton is made of metal and we can hear his knuckles clang when he lands a punch  wolverine takes runaway teen rogue anna paquin under his wing and here the movie wisely merges two comic book characters rogue and kitty pryde giving wolverine a powerful little sister to protect i told you i was a comic book geek  enough is hinted at about wolverines past to ensure hell be back in 2 electric boogalooas for the rest the x in professor xs name apparently stands for xposition because thats all he gets to do  cyclops ought to be called cypher and storm and jean grey just fade into the background  the villains  besides magneto and supermodel supervillain mystique rebecca romijnstamos are pretty dull but then the never had great villains besides magneto  it doesnt matter muchmagneto and wolverine provide enough kick to get this movie series off to a strong startwell wait  maybe there were some other good villains  the sentinels arcade  huhill have to get back to you after i check my collection,fantasy
 definitely exceeded my expectations  great special effects decent though not terrific acting and a good storyline made up for the odd poor script  i hadnt read the comic book and am not concerned about consistency but the story that was presented was definitely enough to keep me interested,fantasy
 provided its share of action and plot true to the the comics but was hard to equal on film first of all the comics have too many heroes to put on the screen it seems we could only see glimpses of each character and really only knowing the background behind magneto and wolverine therefore the true fans of the comics will enjoy this film but for others you will like the action but will find the movies plot to be average,fantasy
i wasnt very fimiliar with the comic so i wasnt expecting to like as much as i did but i really enjoyed this superbly entertaining film it is one of the best movies i have seen in quite some time the acting was very satisfying new zealander anna paquin in particular gave another sparkling performance the writing and screenplay were very good bryan singer put lots of effort into this film but mostly it is the technical things that made this movie the sound was amazingly convincing the visual effects were stunning and the editing was very noticeable and put to perfectionsure to be one of the best films of 2000 i highly recommend to all moviegoersrating 9,fantasy
i was expected this movie for long long times to come out in the cinema after i see this movie its very good movie for those who likes or never heard of it the movie plot is comes close to realitythe movie is not too action or too drama you can compare that to batman by tim burton the actors who play each character is good choice especially professor x patrick stewart and wolverine hugh jackman the effects is good very goodthe scene i like best is that when mystique and wolverine fought and they came out cyclops asked him to say something to assure that he is the right wolverine you have to watch it in the cinema for the answers,fantasy
in 1979 i have seen the light looking through my childish eyes i have watches star wars and made it my favourite never will one film top this because i will never be a child again and i will never be so enthusiastic like a child againbut this was a big mistake x men breaks through nothing left to make this film better all perfect just for me because i am a great fan of the comics the x men in the film are not just incarnations they certainly are the x men so if you love the comics you love the film a female friend of mine who didnt ever read a comic of x men and who hates actionfilms loved it too so go out and look and forget about films of superheros you have already seen x men is the future any other films with superheroes must beat this one i loved batman i  ii rest is crap but x men is much betterenjoy remember i am a great fan of x men but every other spectator will find it at least very good except you realitywhy can those people flyguyscu,fantasy
my boyfriend insisted that we watch the movie because he was an comic book fan in his younger years i was extremely skeptical but agreed to go along since i like patrick stewart dr x and will see almost anything with him in it just in case i would be totally lost my boyfriend gave me a 5 minute overview of the premise behindturns out that his prelude was totally unnecessary  although there was one reference to yellow spandex that confused me until it was explained to me the movie was wonderful  the characters had a lot of depth although im told some of them are slightly different from the comic and the acting was superb especially from patrick stewart and ian mckellen magneto hugh jackman wolverine was wonderful but halle berry storm was somewhat miscast the story was interesting and the makeup  special effects were amazing there are very interesting issues raised by the premise of in general maybe im reading too much into it but its one of the few movies ive seen where the bad guys arent necessarily evil in the traditional sense  their means may be questionable but their ends are actually quite noblea great movie  i cant wait for the sequels,fantasy
 besides being the best comic book adaptation since the original superman works nicely as a cultural allegory and is directed with a confident hand by bryan singer the story with its climax on the statue of liberty is admittedly a bit comic booky but  do i really need to say this  it is based on the marvel comics however the movie captures the comics tone perfectly and has its tonguejustfarenoughincheek to acknowledge the absurdity of the situation without giving in to camp perhaps most refreshing is the movie allowing itself to spend the first hour getting to know each of the and their counterparts the brotherhood of evil mutants  their personalities as well as their powers the movies central theme  growing up feeling different  plays out amongst the heroes professor x as a father figure to the wolverine as a big brother to rogue cyclops as the son trying to make professor x proud etc this new family manages to gel enough to challenge the evil mutants plans at the end with the fireworks and fisticuffs youll expect some of these scenes suffer because of a relatively low budget and a studio which rushed a movie to summer that was supposed to come out at christmastime or perhaps xmas once fox counts up all the profits from this movie i would hope they would spend enough on 2 to replace some of the unconvincing wire work seen here with those doanything cgi effects another smart move would be to replace michael kamen whose last project was conducting an orchestra with metallica with pretty much anyone else and giving that person time enough to write a decent score with 30odd years of history there are plenty of additions and subtractions that could be made to the cast of the sequel however each charactor in merits a return in smaller or larger ways the most important ingredient is obviously singer who has a firm grasp on just how to translate that long history to film and how to do it with style,fantasy
all i can say is wow  as a semi follower of the comics and cartoons i can honestly say that this movie did justice to the concept of course it is a bizarre concepthuman evolution has taken the next step and has mutated many individuals with powers beyond most normal comprehension  of course weve got the addition of the us government scientific research  patrick stewart is phenomenal as xavier halle berry is a great storm in fact all of the casting seems to work wellone of the other aspects of the film that seems to work so well for me at least is the inclusion of other characters that while they are not main characters in this movie they do show up and will more than likely appear in future installments of the series  at least this is one set of sequels that will work for years and years,fantasy
with the basic concepts of strange powers appearing at puberty and reaction of society to the perceived threat from within it is easy to envisage a movie embracing and exploring the concepts of youth alienation discrimination in modern society and even how brittle civilisation is in respect to perceived internal threats from race to communism or capitalism depending on your economic systemthe is not such a movie instead the postpubertal characters hide from society appearing only to wage war on an enemy called magneto somehow my willing suspension of disbelief is unwilling to suspend itself at the sight of a character seemingly straight out the depths of the flash gordon universe which kind of restricts ones enjoyment of the showthe other item which somewhat hampered my willing belief suspension was the use of a supersonic vertical takeoff and landing fullystealthed aircraft as thes transport if they can build those without needing the infrastructure of a military jet manufacturer why waste time with minor special powers when they could go into business selling such aircraft at 2 billion a throwapart from those foibles it is mostly harmless fun although it leaves itself suspiciously wide open for sequels this may be no bad thing the batman series certainly got darker and more thoughtful when tim burton took over of course using batman as an example one is forced to point at the joel schumacher followups including the widely despised batman and robin is nowhere near that bad but the sequels could go either way,fantasy
i dont really know if is the greatest superhero movie ever made but its certainly the coolestthe comic series was the ultimate in style over substance and very chic it was too it originally stiffed as a stan leejack kirby alternative to marvels own range of fantastic fouravengersspiderman et al almost coming close to cancellation an idea of how relatively unsophisticated these early issues were reveal that the x in originally stood for xtra a fivestrong team only two of them really make it through to the movie angel a winged playboy is wholly absent while plans to include the acrobatic beast were dropped after his later transformation into a bluefurred creature proved too extensive an undertaking bobby drake as the iceman does get a small role in the form of shawn ashmore though this is as a young student and not the same age group as cyclops or jean grey jean grey codenamed marvel girl in the comics one of the series less inspired inventions and absent here appears with james marsden as the guy who can shoot lasers from his eyeswhen the comic became cool was when its allegorical issues mutated humans as oppressed minorities were scripted by chris claremont in the midseventies onwards he totally reworked the team into largely what it is on screen though the popular nightcrawler is missing and i didnt spot colossus played as a bit part by donald mackinnon debatably the most popular superhero of the marvel range wolverine was also arguably the first short superhero his 53 frame here being transformed into the 62 build of hugh jackman jackman is magnificent his cynical taciturn view emerging from the seedy bars and fighting clubs he frequents later being used to prick the more absurd elements of the plot his adamantium claws are truly impressive on screen the special effects being used as elsewhere to serve the plot rather than being the plot george lucas please take note and he even gets to use them on cyclops as a new form of giving the finger his sniping macho relationship with cyclops provides some of the better sequences and jackmans timing means that these elements always seem spontaneous not bogstandard retorts written to order best line after emerging from a battle with the shapechanging mystique rebecca romijnstamos who assumed his form he finds cyclops ready to blast him just in case wait its really me he urges prove it hes told youre a dick comes the reply cyclops can only nod in agreement perhaps less successful is his love for jean grey famke jannsen which while again being true to the comic isnt that well developed on screenwolverine gets all the best lines all the coolest things to do and is one of the three main characters involved the rest just peripheral to greater or lesser extents patrick stewart gets a fair chunk of the earlier part of the film doling out exposition as captain jeanluc er professor charles xavier it must be disheartening for some of the cast that stewart is such a good actor without having really to try and there is evidence here thats he going through the motions halle berry gives a great effort as storm yet doesnt really impress maybe shes miscast as i always imagined storm with a bit more attitude sort of a grace jones typethen theres ian mckellen as magneto unused to the sf franchise lark and so managing to outact stewart by a considerable margin his character is still fraught with the odd problem mainly his origins the series is of course foolproof as no real origin is needed there are no cosmic rays no gamma blasts and no getting bitten by arachnids of radioactive properties theyve got the powers from birthpuberty and thats all there is to it yet the film casts mckellen as erik lehnsherr jewish victim of the holocaust this is still reasonably true to the comics and the sequence is brilliantly shot lashings of rain making it look like a kurosawa wet dream yet this does take something away the whole idea about the is that its allegorical later sequences allude to but do not directly represent the mccarthy witch trials yet the idea of the lead villain being a persecuted jew is spelling it out this comes across as similar to a scene in beneath the planet of the apes where we are shown chimpanzee war protesters allegory and literalism are two separate elements and should not be mixed again mckellen is ideally suited towards this sort of thing being homosexual in real life though its allencompassing reference to persecution of minorities is somewhat offset by the generic good looks of the castcharacters are reasonably well drawn the script is literate and theres a real sense that the people involved cared about what they were making theres nice little injokes a reference to wolverines comic book yellow spandex whereas here the group wear cool black leather and cameos from mutants that dont have a real part to play though not introduced to casual audience distraction arielshadowcat in particular getting a nice throwaway appearance theres even a great explanation of how rogue anna paquin gets the white streak in her hairbut this isnt a film for comic book fans its based purely towards casual audiences who may never have even picked up an issue some argue that its too short but for a superhero movie it sensibly neglects the dragging twohours plus duration and goes for the 104 minutes slot it has three clear acts and leaves you wanting more note how wolverines mysterious origins are not revealed but left hanging rather than the neat sewing up of loose ends that left batman with nowhere to go after he avenged his parents death in the first tim burton movie also notable if not necessarily commendable is that the kill their enemies and its not just wolverine doing the slayingi dont know if this film will stand up to repeated viewings in five years time it might be hopelessly outdated or its funky slick style and stylish  though not ostentatious  direction might be lost on me i suspect it really contains very little substance at all but its snappy yet realistic dialogue and wow superpowered fight scenes are clouding my reasoning who needs one batman when you can have a whole army of mutants no in just a few years time i might wake up and see this for what it really is but for now is the best summer blockbuster film of the last ten years,fantasy
as a newcomer to the characters i havent read any of the magazines i probably missed some of the injokes and fleeting references to other xcharacters however i very much enjoyed the film especially anna paquin who provided subtleties to her role that i hadnt expected if or when they make the sequel ill be standing in line ,fantasy
i expected a lot from this movie and i was not disappointed after i have seen it i think it is very good that they didnt try to summarize everything of the cartoonscomics in one movie which they did in for example the movie spawn also a movie of which i had huge expectations of but that movie turned out to be a huge disappointment i know which characters has which super powers so i was afraid that i had a lot of explaining to do to my girlfriend who doesnt know the at all during the movie but i didnt have to say a word well done they clearly made an open ending and i cant wait for the ii with probally more characters and less explaining lets hope and pray that theyll keep the same cast as they have now they all did a excellent job in the movie this is just an introduction people which to my opinion couldnt have done better so makers of the movie the please dont let me down by ruining it in the sequel you have a good start score 910,fantasy
i was not generally a fan of comic book heroes and id never really watched x men to any great extent  even so i enjoyed this film  many young people today know at least some of the x men story line and that helped me enjoy the film more than i would have if i went in completely ignorant    i have to say gosh that hugh jackman looks like clint eastwood  im glad im not the only one who thought this  and anna paquin she is so pretty and she does such a good job with this she makes you feel her anguish    i dont think they could have picked anyone better than patrick stewart to play dr x  as far as beast being missing i saw an episode of the animated show and remembered that he was one of the characters yes he is missing but they will likely get to him in the sequels you know there are going to be sequels hopefully they wont follow the sequel curse  this movie is great for fans its just the beginning and those who are open minded to explore ideas that they never had much interest in before its not enough to make me into a die hard x men fan but ive always been open to the story and never put it down so its just cool to me   not to mention im a female  bet you didnt see that one coming,fantasy
with plenty of action not too much but more suspense this movie puts humanitys morality in question again  we fear what is different  white and black skin normal and disabled people religions and more  but now human evolution is the thing to fear  some humans are mutating and becoming superhuman and jeopardizing themselves others and mere privacy in some cases  and the nonmutating people want to lock away these people to discard them  is it so different from racial prejudice eg as seen in mississippi burning  what would you do  an excellent film for putting your morals in check  it certainly makes you think,fantasy
when i first heard ofs release i thought i maybe wasting my time like i have countless occasions with many batman films and of course the awful phantombut being persuaded by the many good reviews and the amount of publicity it was getting i thought why not  and to my shock i was very impressedit follows the lives of two mutants wolverine who can produce retracktable blades from his hands and young teenage runaway rogue her touch is a fatal one  it shows these two characters join an elite group of spearheaded by charles francis xavier patrick stewart who helps mutants control there powers and use it to protect humans from xaviers old friend magneto ian mckellen who wishes to rid new york of the cruel human inhabitants who choose to not accept mutants into there environment telling you anymore would make it pointless in watching the film and ruin the magic that this marvel classic will bringthe acting is fantastic especially by hugh jackman who was only called up after dougray scott pulled out due to filming with mi2  famke janssen patrick stewart ian mckellen ray parks and anne paquin also deliver the goods to the big screenim also glad to see that the backgrounds to each character havnt been altered for the pleasures of hollywood like judge dread was  this is by far marvels finest conversion to the big screen this could have the same effect that star wars had and still has nowto be continued1010,fantasy
im the first to admit im something of a purist in my comic adaptations i dont look for absolute faithfulness i accept that the movie is in an alternate reality but i do want each character to act reasonably within the bounds of their comics persona that said id say the was about 70 thereoverall it was a fairly good script with decent dialogue although it certainly slips occasionally listen for storms closing remark to toad for a particularly odd line without the inaccurate characterizations bothering me this movie would rank much higher though there are still some plot holes you could drive a mack truck throughpatrick stewart hugh jackman and ian mckellan are all outstanding in their respective roles most of the rest of the cast is acceptable to good with the notable exceptions of james marsden cyclops ray park toad and rebecca romijnstamos mystique its not really the actors fault in the case of the latter three theyre just miscast and mishandled marsden is too young to play cyclops and he plays him as an unlikeable little snot one wants to see wolverine skewer the jerk cyclops is a straight arrow hes not a snot mystique isnt mute reptillian or a nudist nor is toad a wisecracking hip young tough with tongueflicking goospitting action all these characters have lost what made them special in the comicsthe movie plays like someone did their homework on the source material and then someone else willfully ignored it  there are some great cameos watch for iceman jubilee shadowcat pyro the new mutants and probably others but there are also problems the filmmakers went to the trouble to include henry peter gyrich but then spell his name wrong in the credits  a major plot point also hinges around rogue being able to steal magnetos powers when its an explicit fact that magneto is the only known person resistant to her powersoverall not a bad effort at all ive seen much much worse but theres still room for improvement,fantasy
the marvel comics were a godsend for me in the late 60si was fast running out of fresh material the victor eagle batman superman even the countless jingoistic british 64page war stories and they were fast running out of plots i mean how many times could one man smash the might of hitlers war machinethen they arrived like manna from heaven for a comics nutlooking back now they seem to have cascaded onto the newsagents stands thor the silver surfer spiderman the incredible hulk and my personal favourite dr strange they took me to new worlds and truly opened up whole new civilisationsunfortunately due to my pocketmoney constraints i regularly wore out shoe leather tramping around town to swap or cajole the latest issues from my contemporariesbut by and large whatever disapproving teachers and psychologists would say they helped to broaden my imaginationto datethough with the exception of the for me insipid and disappointing incredible hulk tv series and the admirable surfer animation that is where they have remainedso you wont be surprised to hear that i was looking forward to this onewhile i had religiously gone to superman and batman bigscreen interpretations and i still swear by batman returns marvel characters will always be preeminent for meand while its less than a week since ive seen the movie i will have to say that this is one time where im grateful for the use of computerised graphics in the cinema in its depiction of titanic battles between the wonderfullyrealised mutants the film scores almost all its plus points as in many other respects it seems to me filmmaking by numbersrope in a few distinguished british actors to lend gravitas as the opposing mutant leaders introduce some attractivelooking blist actors to offset the special effects budget overruns and sprinkle the script liberally with wisecracks oh and take time to introduce all the characters individually with an eye on the series and the attendant merchandising spinoffs of course the plot involves a battle to save civilisation as we know iti dont know why im complaining ill probably be queuing for firstrun showings of the remainder of the series even if bryan singer continues as directorsinger has gone on record as saying he was never a fan i would have to say im not really surprised as the movie ultimately seems first and foremost a computeranimation project which serves as an introduction to the world of of course im speaking as one of the seemingly few who wasnt bowled over by his usual suspects in any case that movie depended to a large extent on the quality of the performances and its a safe bet that there will be no oscar nominations hereim not sure was tim burton asked to direct perhaps the moneymen wouldnt tolerate his excesses or then again maybe hes too steeped in the gothic horror tradition to give it its most sympathetic interpretationbut we need a director with a  subversive vision for any future projectsin this case though mark it down as better late than never,fantasy
i was very impressed by this  going by the blurb i was expecting it to be a silly film based upon cynical money making merchandisingit was actually a classy well made scifi film featuring some superb special effects and some good acting from a capable cast starring paquin who was superbwhat did irk me though was a burning question were we told the truth  who were the starts really when patrick wheels stewart put on his silly helmet he was davros leader of the daleks dirty harry played wolverine magneto  you feeling lucky punk and if sabre tooth wasnt richard branson on a bad hair day ill eat my hat,fantasy
 is one in a very long line of blockbuster disappointments to be released recently the film is directed by bryon singer who cant make a good action movie first of all lacks good action setpieces even the fight in the statue of liberty wasnt any good i wanted also to see more of different mutants powers but obviously the fx budget didnt stretch that far the cgi effects were undeniably bad by todays standards so the film did not enough action but there were some good points being wolverene made some good jokes and was the funniest by far and i liked the open ended ending i hope the sequels will be better than this,fantasy
have we all seen the same film  ok there are a lot of good things in this movie and i would have enjoyed it a lot if i was not really shocked by the directors doubtful discourse  the film starts with a long and painful scene in a concentration camp  is it to make sure we realize that the bad guy who threatens the world is jewish  bear that in mind and watch the film againa lot of symbols and images reinforce the idea that the jews represent a strong creeping and almost invisible threat   i really wonder why nobody says nothing about it or just shyly evokes the problem,fantasy
it is really hard to review a film based on a novel without being disappointed by the necessary changes a director has made  its even harder to be objective when the movie is based on a piece of literature that has been adding new chapters every month for over 30 years is based on stan lees ground breaking comic book about the persecution of mutants humans who have evolved into a new powerful race called homo superior  despite being persecuted by normal folks a small group of mutants band together to protect humanity from the evil mutants who seek to destroy them it has been for many years the largest selling american comic book mixing all the elements of a great adventure novel with pictures of people in shiny yellow spandex  the film has tried to create a delight for long time comic fans while not not totally confusing the general public with no idea of thes 30 year long backstory so here are a few of the good and not so good characteristics of the film ill do my best not to make comparison to the comicsgoodacting   hugh jackman as wolverine was fantastic  surly feral but with a heart of gold he was the star of the film by a mile  even my comicilliterate companions enjoyed his performance laughing at every one liner and gasping as wolverine performed his tricks with his personal ginsu knife set the unbreakable metal blades that shoot out from his knuckles anna pacquin showed real emotion as rogue the teenage girl risks killing everyone she touches and there were also fine performances by ray park as toad and james marsden as cyclops in small supporting rolesdirecting  bryan singer obviously worked hard on this you can feel the great moments the love triangle between marsden jackman and famke jansen as jean grey is one of the highlights as are the little touches of humour after being admonished by team leader cyclops wolverine retracts his knuckle blades slowly leaving the middle blade standing defiantly up in a one finger salute  however in trying to please every one  singer has left the product a little empty  the confrontation between the two mentors of the good and evil mutants xavier and magneto only sparkles for an instant outside a train station and fails to deliver for most of the filmthe bad  well its what is missing that lets the film down not enough action little character development and the fact that the best villain an evil bigoted senator called kelly explodes halfway into the film really disappointed me it reminded me of a milk dud hidden in a bowl of broccoli you had to wade through too much horrible boring stuff to get to the good stuff,fantasy
this movie proves that you dont need a clever story to make a good movie  i liked it for its stunning effects and gutwrenching stunts sure but most of all its fun to see the characters from my old comic books come to life on the big screen it was a nice movie  make sure you see it,fantasy
just when i thought that the only way to make a good movie from a comic was animation compare batman mask of the phantasm with the awful batman and robin this film proved me wrong fastpaced welldesigned mostly anyway with good characterisation and the right mixture of comedy and action this passes the test of successfully blending the reality of the comics world with the real world,fantasy
loads and loads of fun dont go expecting something deep and wonderfuljust go expecting to have a really good time  youll laughespecially if you remember the old comics  theyve gotten the tension between the characters right and that old insulting oneliner humor too,fantasy
before i start let me get one thing straight comics i hate them theyre too crass and sunset beachishthankfully what i witnessed on the 24th of august was not a comic translation of camp superheroes dressed in supermans leftovers the themselves defy logic as does this filmthe plotline is far far more potent and substantial than most socalled dramas today  a clear battle of hatred and fear shown in society today represented not as a good olfight between bad and evil but a complex delve into human motivethe plot however remains light and accessible for its 12  uk  rating the running time was short and sweet leaving the audience in anticipation of a sequel  take a note john woo tom cruise etcpivotal performances from stewart and mckellen form the basis of the films underbelly whilst a remarkably russell crowelike hugh jackman is the perfect rogue hero and on that note the real life rogue storm and cyclops are well played by the stupendously gorgeous halle berry and rising stars paquin and marsden the villains say little and are basically magnetos stooges but their excitable ones at that park mane and stamos all adding to the flavourthis film was a welcome additon to a summer of not quite blockbuster proportions given the early part of the year however i have one warning bryan singer has moulded the film into the perfect launchpad for cultstatus away from the picturebook geek squadron when the sequels come which they surely will pleasepleaseplease keep the format and cast crew it is very rare that a series of films swaps key roles succesfully  star wars  most keep the linchpins  indiana jones and those that fail well we all remember batman and robin dont we comicbook fans,fantasy
im yet another person who never read the comics watched the animated series occasionally and yet saw the movie  why  two reasons  number one is that im married to a rabid fanboy whos collected the comics since he was a kid  number two is that i may not be an fan per se but i am definitely a wolverine fanback in february my husband told me that dougray scott had to bow out of and that a newcomer named hugh jackman had been hired in his place my response was probably not unique  hugh who  so i looked him up on the internet and i was not inspired by what i saw  a handsome darkhaired man with a pleasant smile  this guy was going to play wolverine the biggest badass to ever strut out of the frozen north  im a canadian too by the way  yeah rightthen i saw some publicity stills in entertainment weekly and i started to wonder  the hair  looked pretty good  it couldve looked silly but they managed to get the da style with the two trademark points just right the claws looked pretty damn good too  maybe this guy had possibilities but just because he looked the part didnt mean he could play the canuckleheadthen came the previews and the tv special and i found myself starting to become convinced  especially when i saw the shot of him leaning against a wall in full getup flipping out both sets of claws like switchblades when i saw the movie i realized that this was just before he goes toetotoe with mystiquethen i saw the movieis it perfect  hell no  the budget was slashed pun intended and singer was forced to have a summer release date rather than a christmas one this hurt the movie no question  is it a good movie nonetheless  i think so and the main reason is mr jackman  if he had been a lessperfect wolverine the movie would have gone down the tubes faster than you can say sniktladies if you havent seen this movie yet and im sure theres still one or two of you who havent  go  even if you think comics are dumb i dont i just dont read em is all youll love wolverine  hes sexy hes menacing hes dangerous and dammit hes protective of the women in his life  what more can you askps  memo to jean grey  ive thought this for years and now im convinced  youre nuts to stay with cyclops  at least give wolvie a tumble  this guy is aching for you and youre saying no  cyclops need never know  youre the one whos psychic not him,fantasy
 was one of the films i was excited to see this summer  after having been assaulted by the previews and promotion i went to see this adaptation of the marvel comics classic  as the titles came up my heart beat rose with fevered anticipation at the end all i could say to myself was man that was totally nonclimactic  was such a disappointment something was severely lacking a plot  the film relied too heavily on explaining the superpowers of the  dull  i mean sure we have to understand such things to get the complete picture but couldnt they have done it in a more interesting manner  the action sequences in this film were average at best  the big finale at the statue of liberty was well not that great  bryan singer is not an action director and it shows i wish hed go back to making great films like the usual suspects  still i have to say hugh jackman was the perfect wolverine although purists complain he is too tall get over it  i wish that they had worked as hard on establishing the other characters as they did with wolverine  all in all was ok  i hope they make a sequel to explain everything that was left unanswered  its so obvious the studio planned for a sequel which is why the ending of this film ends as a first chapter rather than as complete movie  ill probably go and see the sequel when it comes out but i pray they make a film that stands on its own,fantasy
i think this action movie could be better because action scenes are not enoughspecial effects are good ones but i think some fans missed the beast and a better argumentit is a blockbuster but many people like me think that a movie must be complete in all the waygood argument and a good starring performancewe want better movies not just a blockbuster,fantasy
i thought the film was brilliant as a fan of the cartoon and comic books i was really looking forward to seeing the motion picture the parts were played well and i believe the correct actor for each part was chosen and that they played to the best of their outstanding ability fans of the cartoon will notice that favourite characters such as beast gambit and jubilee did not make profound appearances in the movie at first i was shocked and annoyed that they had thoughtlessly left out these parts however now i can see some reasoning to it i appreciate the action taken as this will undoubtedly be the first of at least one sequal we can be sure to see our favourites in later editions of the series an opener to a series such as this film was would obviously have to be a mere introduction to the plot characters and general story therefore i hope to see my personal favourite gambit in the next film as im sure do many if the sequal is only half as amazing as the first then im sure no one will be disappointed,fantasy
i expected the best i was not disappointedbeing a fan of the since my childhood i was hoping the movie didnt corrupt the spirit that was on the comics i wasnt too afraid as i saw stan lee himself was involved in the movie  but stephen king was also involved in poor movies from his novels actually the characters were quite close to those from the comics and the storyline followed the spirit of stan leesi was surprised concerning the order of appearance of the superheroes angel and the beast are not there what a shame and iceman is still a child when wolverine is recruited collossus is not there either but he might have arrived later in the comics my memory is not that goodconcerning the heroes behaviour i was surprised by two points evil characters seem stronger andor good ones weaker and the girls lost a part of their abilitiesanyway all the small adaptations have been made to the profit of the storyline and this is not the same universe than the paper one this can be seen as a parallel universe where nothing will be the same againif you missed this movie you did lose something interesting try again you wont regret it is the best ever adaptation of a comics to the screen,fantasy
i can count on one hand the number of superhero films that were any good superman 1  2 batman forever the mask of zorro  but hollywood got this one right  despite minor changes from the comic book this movie is heart and soul the  its also thoughtprovoking and even emotionally moving in spots  highest recommendation,fantasy
after years of reading the and hoping for a quality movie my prayers have been answered  thank the goddess that dougray scott was tied up on mi2 because i dont think anyone else could have played wolverine like hugh jackman  if this role doesnt make him nothing will  the movie focused on the characters instead of the action and we got to know why they live in a world that hates and fears them  logan was our voice of disbelief and echoed our questions  the action sequences were well scripted and fit in with the tone of the movie  i think that all the actors did a great job with the material and getting to know their characters  the only problems that i saw were storm and the music  storm is a much stronger person in the comic book and was portrayed as timid in the movie  perhaps she will have time to grow into the character that we all love in the next movieoverall this was a great movie and the best of the superherocomic book genre that have come out in recent years,fantasy
my god i loved this film as a complete girly girl who has never read any comics ever this film was a breath of fresh air  the script was accessible to everyone and any in jokes went completely over my head and were not a problem the ensemble cast were superb in particular hugh jackman with his enormousacting talents and other obvious virtuesyes i am very shallow if theres a cute guy in it ill see it on a more serious note though i hope that the teams behind the new batman and superman movies will take a leaf out of bryan singers new book how to make a decent comic book movie instead of churning out yet another completely poo sequel  in short please see this movie,fantasy
 is one of the best films ive seen in a long time my personal fav actor was wolverine he kept me coming back to see the movie and each time it got better i strongly recommend this movie to everyone awesome job hugh,fantasy
being a moderate fan of the comics back when the beano was losing its appeal and superheroes in wild outfits with unexplainable powers were having more of an impact i was waiting with eager anticipation for the new movie that had been such a huge success in the us  lets face it the american cinema going public get excited about anything these days  the prospect of a relatively unknown cast no big names other than maybe patrick stewart and ian mckellan and a director responsible for one of the best crime thrillers of the 90s  bryan singer the usual suspects  added to the excitementthe summer was crying out for a big action dumb popcorn eating saturday night slice of tongue in cheek comic book nonsense and that is exactly what its got except that is was a thursday night preview the popcorn ended up on the floor of the row behind us and we never got to eat any with everyone instantly forgetting mi2  the other summer blockbuster if that phrase isnt too much of a cliche  the has taken centre stage but despite the presence of rsc actors stewart and mckellan this is one stage that doesnt see much shakespeare  i knew that pun wouldnt work  they do however put in a couple of remarkable performances mainly due to the circumstances in which they find themselves it would normally be difficult to play the leader of a bunch of out of control lightning summoning metal claw wielding lazer beam directing mutants with a straight face but the thought of where they are and what they are doing never seems to cross their aged faces stewart plays the magnificent professor x wheelchair bound mentor of the good guys and mckellan heads up the bad guys as the metal influencing magneto silly names aside mckellan never looks or sounds out of place even whilst levitating with powers ofwelllevitation  strange as he seemed to develop this ability out of nowhere somewhere in the middle of the movie the other character of note is wolverine  or logan he never seems to make up his mind  who is the key to the entire story one thing hollywood has learnt over the last few years if the movie starts to get silly have the most cynical character point out how silly things are and the audience instantly forget that they are watching a stupid movie job done or not the movies biggest drawback is that the kitsch is played a little too straight the characters are made to be very real and then pasted onto the page of the comic just as you learn to relate to them you remember that you are watching mutants with super powers i think a background in the comics can be an advantage here and also a major problem you immediately know whom you are dealing with and the relationships that develop you know the characters and what they can do but accuracy is not too important only geeks are going to say things like but he could never fly and she didnt have blue hair and nobody is going to care the movie has been made for people who havent even picked up an comic thats the advantage  not caring who these people are the rest of the cast with the exception of toad  played by the guy who was darth maul  and maybe rogue  she gets more screen time than the others  are just extras toad is brilliantly portrayed unlike the woeful storm the wooden cyclops and the annoying sabretoothi would like to say that the plot is nonexistent but it isnt the good guys have to defeat the bad guys the underlying story is based around the idea that mutants are bad and should be controlled or locked up or destroyed the political aspect is not as predominate as everyone has been saying in fact you could quite easily forget about society altogether and just watch the light show the movie starts with a seemingly blatant attempt to attribute the plight of the mutants to the horrors of the nazi concentration camps as we view scenes of jews in war torn poland if this is the subtext it is horribly misjudged and in poor taste given the feel and atmosphere of the rest of the storyoverall the movie lacks an incredible amount of flow and consistency professor x goes missing for most of the story wolverine has a great build up that just stops things happen just because they look good and it seems to make sense at the time a better script with a few more words would have been nice and a statue of liberty that didnt look like it was made of plastic what it also lacks is more suspense the battles between the two sides are pretty weak and are just a few minutes of people beating the st out of each other none of the characters show any grit or determination or concern the movie oozes complacency  out of all the characters only rogue shows any kind of fear and vulnerability and thats just because shes a girl a bit of empathy wouldnt have gone a misssorry bryan must do better next time and there will be a next time the movie is only an hour and half and way too short but thats what happens when you try to cram 100 comics worth of stuff into a movie you want kids to sit through  i actually thought the end battle scene was the middle of the story and that there was going to be a huge confrontation between wolverine and magneto instead it just ends somewhere in the middle after another light show expect several sequels510,fantasy
wow  i have to say that this is one of the best movies i have ever seen i watch the cartoon religiously and have also read as many of the comics as i can get my hands on  i loved the way they modernised the outfits and also modernised the look of the team  the relationship between wolverine and rogue was also well developed  see this movie if you havent already,fantasy
singer is probably the best hollywood director when it comes to films with lots of characters as he proved with the usual suspects here again he weaves an exciting tapestry of character interaction origin stories plot points and allegoriesviewers expecting to see a blockbuster action movie such as terminator 2 or die hard may be let down the movie is more about character interaction and plot twists additionally the budget for this film was something like 75 million a fraction of what most big action movies cost these days which was no doubt significantly doled out to the likes of patrick stewart and ian mcclellan but its a terrific film the kind of movie that has the viewer remembering scenes and quotable lines long after seeing iti have talked to comic book fans and those who never read a comic book and everyone i polled except many critics go figure thoroughly enjoyed the filmthe success of the movie should also be credited to ian mcclellans masterful magneto and to a slightly lesser degree patrick stewarts endearing professor xavierif youre like me youll wind up watching it 2 or 3 times,fantasy

first of all i must say that i am a female who is totally not into comics of any sort  therefore when my husband talked me into going to see this movie i was extremely skeptical  i expected it to be another one of those movies where if you werent on the inside and hadnt read the comic books yes i was dragged to see spawn and i had no clue what was going on that you would just be bored out of your mind for about 2 hoursboy was i surprised about  i must say that this film was written very well  you really neednt have ever read the comics to fully understand the plot of the movie  sure there were a couple of inside jokes eg  the yellow spandex jumpsuit reference which i had explained to me at a later time however im sure that those were for the purpose of entertaining the comic book fans and in no way did they detract from the ploti thought that the special effects were fabulous and that the characters were all very personable  also in the character of wolverine just enough humor was added to make it enjoyable to watch  therefore to all the females out there who are dreading the possibility of being dragged to this film  dont  it really was pretty good,fantasy
hello ok so i saw it last night and heres a quick run down on what i thought of itim gonna address many of the points people have made in the many reviews ive read for this film one by one as to whether i agree or disagree with them  ok here goesq  is the film enjoyable a  yes i found it very enjoyable why  cos it was nicely directed had a few funny jokes in it it had the superbly hot famke janssen or is it 2 ns one s wearing nice night tops halle berrys wonderful breasts yup subtlety there and even little anna paquin has grown up to be a rather attractive large breasted young thing  topnotch birdage all round  oh and of course mystique has a fantastic body shame it was blue and scalyq  does it screw up all the timeline stuff a  oh yes all the storylines the film is based on have been screwed to bry  examples include the fact that cyclops and iceman were supposed to be the same age and should have joined the academy at the same time however cyclops is a mid twenties member of the team whilst iceman is an adolescent school boy in the classroom  but hey i didnt actually care much cos ive forgotten almost the entire plot from the comics and it was only alex that reminded me of most of itq  are the fx nice a  oh yes lovely stuff nice cgi nice wolverine claws yeah twas goodq  is the plot of the film too lightweight and does it think its being all serious and great when its actually not a  yup the plot stank  overall premise was fine after all thats the whole point of the but it had a lot of holes in it  and it all seemed a bit too much like the first film of three  for example the matrix knew it was gonna be a trilogy but it answered pretty much most of what it asked  however this film has dream sequences underdeveloped characters and whatnot and its handled in blatantly obvious were gonna build on this in the next one manner  ok so that fine but it was there for everything nothing was explainedq  how well is wolverine used a  i thought he was pretty well used  he was nice and aggressive and didnt really do all that much really but what he did was nice like the first time you see his claws and he pins this large bloke against a wall with two of them and slowly extends the middle one towards his neck whilst slicing the bartenders rifle in half with the other hand  wolverine has the best lines from the film the best of which i would love to spoil for you but ill let you hear it for yourself when we go see it   on both the macho front and the humour front  oh and there is a beautiful piece of direction when hes swinging round a prong on the statue of liberty by his claws and the camera follows his claws round all four sides spinning slowly until its completely cut off  ok so i cant explain it but youll like it when you see it leigh q  is ray park a gay stank ass a  no  for the first time in cinema history we hear ray parks real voice yay  its just a normal london accent actually but it suited toad well enough  oh and i did like his character cos his fight scene was very nicely done and he even did a darth maul joke by grabbing a metal bar that was holding a lift open spinning it in the exact same way he did with the light sabre and doing the arm to the side stance lifted directly from episode 1 oh but instead of a snarl he does this really cheeky grin and it was really nicely done  could have been a really crap joke but he pulled it off well he doesnt get to do much martial arts but being able to jump really really high he does some lovely bladeesque landings  but anyway this as turned out to be a far too long review so ill sum up now  is a very lightweight movie the plot sucks and the timeline its based on goes completely out of the window  but it is a very nicely directed film the acting is mostly very good and yes ian mckellen and patrick stuart do add the required gravitas to their roles any scene with both of them in really did sparkle and there were a few very funny little jokes in it like wolverine using the middle claw to flip off cyclops so in all i thoroughly enjoyed it adam and alex thought it sucked by the way and will hopefully be seeing it again and yes it shall be dvddscore  7510  so ill give it a 7 on imdboh yeah and it has this one really superb death scene in it where a bloke literally melts away to nothing it was sweeeeet,fantasy
finally we can say that a film has reached the level of the comicbook version first was superman that in its first film started the comic adaptation pictures the 4 sequels that followed it were poor and quite sadthen the batman saga came tim burton did a great effort to create the creepy  dark atmosphere of the flying hero and the first and second part were ok kinda interesting film but the third and forth created by joel schumacher were as bad as hellso the level was incredibly low a perfect opportunity for brian singer to create a welldone thrilling action with brilliant sfx productionand combines these three things action incredible visual effects and good plot setting the film like the best comicbook adaptation ive ever seen in fact the film is so great that itll go like a flash in front of you and you will say thats it i want moreit is a worth looking 1010,fantasy
i saw this film yesterday and have to say that i was very impressedafter the last 2 batman films and the matrix blah there comes a film that focuses on the characters and their interactions rather than on how cool it looks and the effects while the effects are immpressive they dont own the film this film pretty much belongs to wolverine logan and his being a part of the i was drawn in by hugh jackmans performance which is right on it was like wolverine from the comics had come alive the way he spoke the cigar in the bar the jeans the hair the sideburns it was perfectalso the other characters were interesting storm as some potential in the sequelm as does jean grey and cyclopsim really looking forward to the sequels1010,fantasy
if you dont like the comics you wont like the movie  thats the bottom line  the only real criticism from domestic press has been the basic premise this is a geek film  i am a geek and i loved it  this is how comic movies should bethe best acting in the movie is done by hugh jackman wolverine  im a big fan of the ol canucklehead and jackman enbodied him  they way he moves his eyebrows the way he walks talk chews on a cigar and drinks hard liquid made me laugh out loud with joyrogue is not inaccurate  before she took on ms marvel rogue was a scared young girl like anna paquin played herthe humor is well placed and smart  the jokes are even funnier than most of those in summer 2000s comediesthe only complaint i have is that there wasnt enough  of course im not talking about a few deleted scenes  i want the sequel right now,fantasy
while this movie lacked a bit in story and has an ending that very easily allows a sequel isnt that what we all expected i think this movie was mainly to introduce most of the characters and the story will be better in the sequel which i am sure will come soon the action scenes were very good and im glad they didnt cut on special effects the movie is also very true the comic books which is a good thing it is also very funny at some moments and even makes fun of their own cartoons one little point i have to add i think its too bad rogue was just a teenager she seems so much cooler in the comics,fantasy
i am not a big comic book fan but like most men who grew up in the 80s i am big into dd and other fantasy gamesthis movie was excellent the battle scenes were awesome and very realistic the heroes and villains alike worked together in the fight scenes and they were very well choreographedthis is a must see film for anyone remotely familiar with the comic book heroesabout the only bad thing i have to say is that they did not explain how they came about getting their names it is obvious that the names fit their mutant abilities but they sort of just came from nowherealso when cyclops and storm saved wolverine and rogue my question is how did they know about the perilous situation of which they were inoverall it is well worth admission price,fantasy
im no comic book nerd and had no prior knowledge or expectations of the this is the most intelligent summer blockbuster of 2000 a film that deals with issues of paranoia and prejudice a film that delays the action and respects its audience to develop plot and character it also captures the comic book darkness that prevailed in the atomic agecold war 1950s and 1960s no need to camp this up or dumb it down a top cast in a welcome success,fantasy
hollywood often goes for the easy option  make an action movie with tons of brilliant action sequences or sfx and forget about the plot or background story  doesnt do this instead it is a very intelligent and well founded story packed with enough action to make you sit up and take noticethe films premise is acceptance and tolerance  and our attitudes to other things other than the norm  however it doesnt seem to question what is the norm and whom defines the norma brutal example of this is where the film starts out in poland 1944  where we see magneto as a child being ripped apart from his loving family and his family sent to the death camps this was pretty dark and gritty  yet it didnt have that real kick to it that it neededit has magento played by the maginficent sir ian mckellen  sigining mckellen as magento was a master stroke  but alas his onscreen scenes with stewart as professor xavier were far and few between i wanted more of themthe film although a tad silly does have brilliant sfx sometimes you hardly notice it  your not meant to your meant to sit back and enjoy this film  and i didit was a shame that ray parks fighting skills were not on screen as they were in phantom menance  and its a shame we werent told why sabretooth hated wolverine or why magento didnt realise his brain was scanned when sexy famke jannsen was using that mind enhasing machineapart from this the film is a good intelligent film  its a shame they were little holes in the plot or script and its a shame that the end scenes on the statue of liberty were never the climax it was meant to be  its a good film but its an action film no more  no less,fantasy
the  is a movie that will please both comic readers and contemporary audiences alike at first i had my doubts like the millions of other fans worldwide over things that have been discussed over and again the dark costumes being the major player in this this quite simply is probably down to the fact that most people not too fondly remember batman and robin 1997 and dont want to see a similar movie well if you havent seen the yet i can tell you to rest assured this movie topples the entire batman franchise tenfold i went to see the movie at a special preview 17800 and as soon as i entered the cinema i knew the movie was going to be a hit we had previously been refused access to a different cinema because it had sold out on tickets we got the last two at this cinema and it was a huge relief as i looked around i saw what i believed to be a non audience normal people wanting a slice of something different and i didnt see one disappointed sole everyone loved it cheered the heroes and booed the villains at the end everyone stood up and applauded and i felt proud at last a comic book movie had delivered at last i was satisfied the whole thing looks slick and fantastic special effects can sometimes swamp a movie but these endeared it the sfx were eye popping from the word go and the whole cinema was thrilled in the three main characters in professor x magneto and wolverine we are treated to spot on characterization and acting patrick stewart and ian mckellan were relishing there chances and done superbly hugh jackman well after seeing him i couldnt imagine anyone else in the role surely a good candidate for the role of james bond when pierce brosnan hand up his holsten jackman is wolverine everything from his caring for rogue excellently played by anna paquin to his at odds nature with cyclops marvel girl and storm again a top notch cast is how the comics make it fell bryan singer gets it right with his direction and the music was wonderfull too in michael kamen there is surely one of the most underrated american composers ok there isnt a theme tune but were is the need for one with all the special effects good acting and marvellous action mr kamen does well and deserves special praise so go see this you will love it before this i used to think wouldnt it have been great to have seen star wars when it first came out it must have been special well now i know what it was like because i have seen,fantasy
if you are an fan i dont see how you could be disappointed with the film the film is well paced well cast has the expected special effects and includes some funny references specifically for the longtime fansjust to be clear this isnt an adaption of a john grisham novel its the straight out of the comic booksenjoy,fantasy
after all the reviews and the hype i was expecting something fantastic from this movie  unfortunately it seems to be let down in several major respects  i will confess now to knowing next to nothing about the so a lot of the things i would have liked purists will probably hatemy biggest complaint is the way that the whole film seems to play like an introduction  all the time we are expecting something climatic to happen and it never does  the film doesnt so much leave potential for a sequel it leaves the plot completely unresolved  also the subtext is a little too sub for my likingwhen we do finally get to a fight scene it looks so completely unnatural that it just doesnt carry the drama that it should the action seems so broken that it is almost feels like frames in a comic book  i would have said this was really clever and a good thing it is a comic adaptation after all if it werent for the fact the it is so pronounced you are expecting 60s batman style pows to appear when someone throws a punchmy other gripe is about the characters  superheroes should radiate cool see burtons batman the crow or the matrix but these just dont seem to possibly wolverine was a bad choice for a lead he seems that he should be a much darker character than he appears and he talks to much  rogue was a big wet but hopefully this will change in the sequel when she has got over the shock of being a mutant  the only character who seems to have this innate coolness is storm probably something to do with those white eyes but she is let down by halle berrys poor delivery of every line she speaksoverall its fun for ninety minutes with good effects good sets and at least a vague idea of saying something worthwhile  its just not what i had hoped,fantasy
 and definitely the most difficult to pull off i read the comics for about 4 years and watched the cartoons religiously but was always apprehensive of anyone trying to pull off a movie but oh boy did it workthe characterisations in the most part were practically spot on but it was obvious from the beginning that wolverine was the star he couldnt have done a better job right down to the scene when he walks through the metal detector chortleoverall the movie was sufficiently dark and stylish with some top special effects but thankfully relying more on the characters to carry the story the humour was just right toorecommended for anyone fan or not and any age at that this slots in right behind gladiator for me in this years best movie releases roll on the sequels,fantasy
this is a very good comicbook scifi adventure movie it is also the first deadon adaptation of a mainline marvel superhero comic book series blade and punisher etc i do not consider in that genre some of the critics are opining that is is not up to the standard of the first 2 superman and batman movies but they miss the point to comics fans this movie is as different from those as marvel comics are to dc comics home of superman and batman  marvel comics from the 60s on  were darker denser and more layered than dcs   this movie catches that as well as you can in an hour and a 12 there are more heroes to be introduced in this movie series and i am looking forward to that  this initial installment was fun and well done hugh jackman as wolverine shouldered the weight of his character which really carries the movie despite the presence of bigger stars stewart and mckellen gotta go get my sir ian  magneto action figure,fantasy
possible spoilersfantasticvast liberties were taken with the original comics but when the results are this entertaining im not one to be preciouswhile the plot and characters were spot on people criticise berrys storm but she didnt get enough airtime for me to be sure what made it for me was the little injokes  from the kids at the school pyro iceman jubilee and shadowcat thru to the mention of henry gyrich to rogues hair at the end  i was sitting in my seat squirming supressing the urge to stand up in the cinema full of noncomic fans and point out all these fantastic little thingscharacters  hugh jackman was born to play wolverine he even sneaked in a little bub while fighting sabretooth i think something more should have been made of their prior relationship  maybe have sabretooth mention their days in the cia together just prior to getting thrown off the statue still i suspect that will be handled in the sequel judging by the direction of the closing scenesrogue was also well handled  some say she is too young but i think her age makes her seem even more vulnerable she is at the age where she needs someone to rely on and logan fills that role admirablythe plot  standard fare as far as the comic story goes but for a first movie you cant overwhelm nonfans with established lore perhaps in the sequel well see a widening of the scale to include largerthanlife villains like apocalypse or sinister xavier and magneto had great chemistry their intimate scenes bookending the film summing up the whole situationoverall definitely worth your money fan or not who knows maybe this film will sway you and if not well its still an entertaining romp with great costumes good looking actors and sexy special effects,fantasy
i wasnt expecting much out of another comic book movie afterall batman has become a tired cliche with me after the  first film i was a passing fan of the comics with wolverine as my favoritei must tell you that when leaving the theatre that night i knew i had seen one of the best scifidramaaction movies of 2000 how my eyes were hurting from bulging out i was so intensely staring at the film with the wonder from down under hugh jackman as logan i was visibly shaken and stirred by his powerful performance anna paquin definitely accentuated this genius cast ensemble it was wonderful to see how she has grown as an actress and as a beautiful young woman since the piano and the perfect touchpatrick stewart and ian mckellen as the two mutant adversaries they brought class to this filmi am already anticipating the sequelsif any of the main characters from the original film fails to appear in the sequels it will not be a worthwhile movie ive seen the three times and will make it four very soon i highly recommend this film to all ages and tastes blood factor is rather low just be mindful of some scenes with wolverine if youre squeamish or you have little ones in tow i look forward with great interest in hugh jackmans career you wont be disappointed with this fun movie,fantasy
i grew up reading the comics watching the cartoons and since the tender age of six i have waited for a bigscreen adaptation  when i heard the news that it was finally on its way i was more than just a little excited  the trailers were all great and even despte the hardships on the set i knew that this would be something special  the movie was everything i hoped for and morefor a start the performances were stunning  hugh jackman brings wolverine to life like no one else could  he has a real bezerker quality that you just wouldnt want to mess with  anna paquin is excellent as frightened runaway rogue whose power means she can never have contact with another person without killing them  ian mckellan plays magneto with such conviction that we almost sympathise with him and his motives seem justified  patrick stewart captures the look and manner of charles xavier so well that you barely noticed he isnt onscreen for as long as you would like  the few confrontations he has with magneto are tense and briliantly acted  these are men with a history with beliefs and they are both out to show their views by whatever way they think is bestthe writingstoryline is excellent  we are presented with a real world filled with these strange people yet the underlying themes of racism and discrimination make them seem as real as they ever could  the film never shoves these views down your throat but lets you digest them in whatever manner you chooseand then of course theres the action  and when the claws go snikt theres certainly lots to be had  the fight sequences are brilliantly played some of them brutal others almost balletic  the sequence that takes place on the crown of the statue of liberty with wolverine and sabretooth is superb and the finale will leave you screaming for morethe film ends perfectly with every character being where they should be in order for a great sequel  credit to everyone involved for making this one work and work superbly  this is honestly the best movie i have seen and i cant see another one coming to knock it off the top spot  go and see it right now,fantasy
truly  xcellenti was counting the days of release to this movie studying at oxford for the summer i wasnt able to catch the excitement back home  but finally on august 16th i caught it  wownow this movie aint perfect but then again what is fans seemed to have it pegged to be this years lost world or phantom menace although i think the latter was a let down yet fun to watch but truly bryan singer and company did a bangup job of not only capturing the essence of classic and beloved characters but also brought something new to the screen  not only did it dodge common comic book cheese they also steered clear of terminal seriosity yes i know thats not a word  cut and cheek but never close to anything resembling superman iiithe movies only flaws lie in actually the plot  magnetos scheme to turn world leaders into mutants may play out better on film than on paper its still rather cheeesy  the movies primary flaw however is its length i wanted more is that really a flaw though  of course theyre fixing that with the dvd and the barrage of sequels were sure to see  bring on 2so in conclusion  best movie of the year sorry gladiator and it gets a 92 out of 10  all hail bryan singer,fantasy
superb i walked out of the cinema stunned  the casting was the thing which struck me the most  i was an avid watcher of the cartoon and i went in thinking its not the same  theyll have ruined it but i was wrong wolverine looked just as i expected him as did all the other characters the costumes were cleverly done as well but i was disappointed that they didnt make wolverine wear the yellow and blue suit storyline was gripping but i was left with the feeling that i wanted more  it all seemed to stop too soon this could just be because i was enjoying it all but it sets you up for then next films  roll on 2 and if you havent seen yet leave your computer now and go see it,fantasy
i enjoyed this movie even though my knowledge of the comic book version is very limited  usually comic books dont translate well to movies due to incompetent directing and scriptwriting but i have to give this one a thumbs up  they did the right thing to introduce only a few mutants because there are too many mutant characters in the comic  to put them all in the movie would be silly  with a few central characters we can focus more on the storyline than mere mutantplethora eyecandy  filmmaking is different from comics after allthe cast delivered satisfying performances  professor x is just spot on and looks like the actual comic character  wolverine is very convincing and magneto has presence  the other characters are also played very well like jean grey and rogue who is given a sensitive performance  my only minor quibble is storm halle berry is very goodlooking but somehow her acting is wooden and is made obvious that she is just play acting  its no big deal thoughbut the real goody comes at the end  i just love how openended the ending was  it screams out that a sequel is in the making which made me to look forward as how the story continues  just like back to the future trilogy  the possibilities of bringing more new mutants are exhiliratinga very well done movie with great casts,fantasy
not a very bad movie for marvel at least it worth to be produced good action sequence good story line but something is missing the special effects is totally awful not to the plan and not resemble the one in the comic book or games more spending in effects should be an advantage and probably will get more audience if sequel will be produce more characters should be added like gambit or war machinei give it 710 to if the movie can show something like future copshk version of street fighter released in 1993then will deserved 1010,fantasy
im not sure why only extremists ever post user comments it seems that only people who really really loved or really really hated the movie ever post when most movies fall in betweenfor the record i am a fan of the and use to collect the comics until jim lee leftso what do i think about this movie it wasnt as bad as i thought it was going to be but i think that i couldve written and directed a much better one i dont want to sound big headed but i believe that if youre going to go through the trouble of adapting a comic book you might as well take as much from it as you can otherwise create your own heroes only somebody like alfred hitchcock could make an adaption that is not only strikingly different but a masterpiece and singer aint no hitchcock although i did like the usual suspectsthis is a change of subject but i think the world has yet to see a superhero comic book come to life superman which was the closest of the superhero bunch batman and all the others tried to add too much realism and thus create an unbalance between comic book fantasy and reality why bother they should just dive and take as much as they can from the comics take a look at dark city the crow and dick tracy i would really like to see a movie that is as faithful as possible to the comic booksnow as for the movie i wouldve gotten rid of all those students casted somebody else for cyclops hes too much of a twerp got somebody for colossus who is one of the top 6 favourite among fans and chosen brighter costumes if youre not going to go with the original ones which would be stupid at least dont become a matrix ripoff and have them all wear the same thing as for the cast and crews saying things like the costumes wouldnt translate well into real life if you say things like that you shouldnt be making moviesi just hope the next one is better or they hire me,fantasy
i did not read as a kid i never heard of the characters until i saw the movie fragments nevertheless i am a scifi fan and i saw the movie in its first day what i felt during the movie was not mentioned by the other critics so here it goes  i am sure some clueless people may be surprised to hear this but females dont go to see a movie to see the great special effects or action scenes even though i see all the scifilm films the ones i truly enjoy are the ones that have the touch of some romanticism some degree of attraction between characters this is why i and all the females i know enjoyed mission impossible ii better than i not a representative sample but still my bf says romanticism is like a very important side dish to me i dont like it by itself but it has to be present with the main course for me to enjoy the dinner from this perspective sucked i am not saying there should have been new romantic interests developed between wolverine and rogue i wouldnt mind this but fans would go mad i am saying if dr jane grey is the love interest of cyclops i have to be able to see this during the film there was no attraction between the two and she was flirting with wolverine very unconvincingly it was a mediocre film for me but not because of its action sequences,fantasy
a mutant among superhero films excels in the story department not truly amazing with singer at the helm and over 30 years of continuity everything feels right enough for a movie adaption but their could have been a little more wowfactor for my taste being capped from 100 million to 70 million may have been the reason this film clocks in at around 90 minutes but why the fast editing why the semiclimax why do we have to wait a few years for more well y is the sequel of x so lets hope a sequel will improve on these points,fantasy
first off im a big fan of comics made real we dont talk about the phantom though and i enjoyed this film i was a bit irritated at the obvious priming for a sequel that was going on throughout the film leaving me expecting more there was certainly time as the film is quite short i cant say too much without spoiling the plot but i couldnt really see why magneto was doing what he was when the more obvious course of action was how the film ended anywayfacadewhy didnt magneto use his powers to bend wolverines little adamantium skeleton i would have,fantasy
movies based on comics nowadays are few and far between nevertheless it is rare to find a bad one  keeps this tradition alive its a smart and funny film which is sometimes hard to find in the action genre of movieaction based movies tend to suck the plot out and fill where it should have been with action but the action in added to the plot and made the story as a whole come together and in the end making the action all the more enjoyable my only complaint spoiler alert spoiler alert is the ending that old cliffhanger of an ending though it may not be considered a total cliffhanger in it is still drumroll a cliffhanger i loved the movie hated the end a cliffhanger is fine but i like something anything to end when the words the end shine in all their glory on the movie canvas as you know they are probably making a sequel but topping this one off would have gave a little more closure to the viewer  but as i stated before it is a great film  for all to see fan or not you have to see it though at the end it has you saying yougottabekiddingitaintover,fantasy
warning some spoilers aheadi had a strange curiosity in watching because of the fine reviews it was receiving but i had many doubts about it 1 i have never i mean never read an comic book i had already watched some episodes of the cartoon but didnt understand a word of it maybe the words would sound to me like chinese but man i was wrong 2 if you watched judge dredd batman forever batman  robin superman 2 3 4 or 90 of comic books adaptations you know what it means crap brainless razzie awards i was afraid that joined the list but man i was wrong 3 i do not appreciate summer blockbusters very much there are exceptions of course gladiator but the majority is pure crap the mummy is one of the worst films ive ever seen and i had an unpleasant experience in the movies last week watching the infamous gone in 60 seconds could have joined the list very well and would be a perfect meal for the razzie awards but man i was wrongin fact is one of the best blockbusters ive seen in a very long while its very far from a perfect movie but it has everything you need for your perfect summer flick thrilling action terrific special effects cool characters good soundtrack amazing scenery and for my taste an above the average character developmentthis could have been just another action flick or something worse but the difference is a good screenplay a rarity on the genre and a decent director who thanks god didnt know anything about the the man is bryan singer who had already directed two other films the great the usual suspects and the mediocre apt pupil he teaches us everything or almost that we outsiders should know about the the film starts in a nazi field on the world war ii showing magneto when he was a child starting to use his powers and maybe because of that separated from the rest of the jews now in the near future there is a weird segregation in the society the homo sapiens us of course and the homo superiors these are mutants who have to learn how to use their power and they really suffer with that they are divided in two groups the ones led by professor charles xavier patrick stewart the who wish that the society accepts them and the ones led by magneto ian mckellen who want to start a war against the homo sapiens these two characters were compared by singer with martin luther king and malcolm x the are dr jean grey cyclops storm among others they are receiving two newcomers rogue a girl who kills people who touch her and wolverine a very strong man with bad mood and those metal knives inside his hands magnetos men are sabertooth mystique and toad all of them really nasty i understood well what all the characters represent and i thought this was a great job by the screenwriteri got even what i didnt expect some depth wolverine is the most welldeveloped character but we will know more about him on the sequel magneto is a very interesting character ambiguous and not just plain bad i really liked the way the movie treated the good and the evil but i still wanted to know a little more about the rivality between magneto and xavier about storm jean grey and cyclops i think everything will be more explained in the sequel this movie lets the door wide open for the sequel what is the secret of wolverines past what will happen now that mystique has turned into the senator what will be magnetos plans now what will happen to rogue lets wait for the sequel and i hope they make a good sequel as good as the originaloverall was a very pleasant surprise in many ways it is a good choice if you are tired to see things as gone in 60 seconds and it destroys the myth that every comic book adaptation is awful along with the first batman it is there the prove the oppositei thought they put 75 million dollars in the right place gone in 60 seconds costed 90 million the patriot costed 110 million but is much better its fun stylish smart amazing not perfect but very good8 out of 10  easily recommended,fantasy
i was not impressed with this movie with ian mckellen and patrick stewart i thought it deserved a chance but i just felt embarrassed for both of them the whole time  the dialogue had me laughing out loud in places that i dont think were intended to be funny the plot was just kind of absurd and silly some of the actors were obviously doing their best with the exception of maybe halle berry who was frankly awful rebecca romijn stamos had approximately 1 line in the whole movie as for the endingim all for leaving it open for a sequel but the ending tied up absolutely no ends whatsoever its like they just decided randomly to end the moviebasically unless you are a die hard comic book fan i wouldnt see this movie maybe if you want a good laugh otherwise dont waste your money 410,fantasy
wow im amazed at all the morons in this country this movie may have been a decent science fiction movie but it certainly does not deserve to be in the same category as gone with the wind and apocalypse now im sorry but this movie was bad with a capital b just another lame movie based on a comic book hollywood please dont make anymore movies based on comic books,fantasy
ill keep this short and sweet this is the kind of film that couldve easily been a disaster  it couldve been poorly cast and acted see keanu reeves in the matrix the dialogue couldve been mindless filler see keanu reeves in the matrix it couldve been a badly edited 2 12 hour movie it couldve been a substanceless special effects vehicle it couldve been overly dramatic or improperly stylized the list goes on and on fortunately it was none of those things  instead the director served up a tight well thoughtout and thoroughly engrossing movie that did not take itself too seriously  go see it if you havent,fantasy
i have never in my life read an comic book i had never heard of them before the film came and david letterman started to make jokes about them my knowledge of comic books stretches as far as wonderwoman and green lantern but my own superheroes were more in the line of pippi longstocking and bamse the strongest teddybear in the worldi had three reasons to see the film 1 bryan singer directed 2 patrick stewart was in it 3 there was absolutely nothing worthwile showing in theatres guess what i liked it i liked it a lot as long as you accept the premises  superheroes saving the day yada yada yada  its a great film not the seventh seal obviously but possibly the best adventure ive seen since the princess bride and star wars but the good films are older than tpbgranted expectations arent so high for this kind of film were lucky if they have a storyline this one did also some fantastic characters directing and okay special effects but im a girlie im not supposed to care i loved how the mutations were both a gift and a curse  three of the heroes wolverine rogue cyclops get into situations were they risk killing someone they care for because they cant control their powers the social aspect could have been used better it was a little obvious at times i for one have seen to many nazis in popular movies but again just having one was greatmain characters wolverine and rogue were well done and acted you really came to care for them although i must admit i have had it with broody rebels with no past i didnt mind so much when it came to wolverine because he was simply great also he was funny sabretooth storm what do they call you wheels rogue was endearing facing the fear she had for herself goodbad leaders xavier and magneto were exactly as well done as one could expect when acted by a couple of long time pros like stewart and mckellen also i was taken in by cyclops those of you who question my motives can please think over your own motives for liking mystique sure he was a total 90210 preppie but he was recognized and dissed as a such in the film causing some grins from yours truly and there was more to the character than that for one thing if this had been 90210cyclops would have been the popular hunky guy and wolverine would have been the badass that mothers tell their daughters to stay away from in this film wolverine can sit in a train full of people comforting rogue and nobody raises an eyebrow cyclops smiles at a kid and its mother hurries to take it away preppie is the only one of the heroes who can never pass for normal sadly they never develop his character much and this cockybutinsecure control freak disappears into the background same goes for the last two heroes jean grey and storm  the latter is so underdeveloped i cant even tell whether she was well acted or notone thing that really bugged me though while the good guys are all cool and have fantastic abilities magneto is stuck with a pair of unbelievably lame animal people called sabretooth and toad sabretooth makes me long for good ol beauty and the beastvincent who was a philosopher between the asskicking i doubt that sabretooth is even housebroke on the other hand theres mystique the shapeshifter and her powers are so interesting im willing to overlook that her real shape looks like a wet playboy dreamthe other main flaw is that the film is not enough to satisfy it leaves you hungry for more not only is the storyline set up for a sequel but it hints lot of things characterwise wolverines past for one thing that it never shows i dont mind seeing a sequel but i dont want to be forced into seeing it is a little bit too much like the first book in a fantasy series where you have to read the rest only all books in a series tend to be made by the same author what if they replace the director and the next film turns out bad that could happen its not like 15 more minutes would have spoiled the film so big  for that and the henchmen big d for the rest of the film,fantasy
overall i have to say that im waiting for the sequel  this movie was just a set up for the sequel and i think itll make more sense for those of us that know nothing about the  i do recommend the filmthe special effects are alright  they are trying to be over the top its like a comedian thats trying to be funnyyou want to laugh but you just cant give it to him  that how it is with me and the special effects  i want to praise them but i cantray park star wars episode i and sleepy hollow has an actual speaking role in this  its interesting to see him not behind a mask  its too bad his career out of a mask is over  we shall see in the years to come though,fantasy
as a devoted fan of the comic book when i was younger i expected this movie to be a real flop  i expected my critical eye to be overworked spotting flaws and unnecessary deviations from character  ive seen other comic book adaptations and they never translate well  the best was the first batman movie and it could hardly be said to have been particularly true to the comic was mostly true to the comic  obviously any movie is going to have time limits and as such cannot portray hundreds of issues of story in that time  given these limits the essence of the characters and origins were all as sound as they could be  in fact a few of the changes made were improvements over the comic bookthe only thing i expected this movie to be good in was effects  given the high bar set by movies like the matrix i expected a strong effects and stunts show  this was really the one place where was average  many of the stunts flopped failing to capture the speed or essence of what they were trying to portray  you could tell which stunts were done with wires and which were cgi  it was very transparent which in this day and age is unacceptablethere also were no particularly stunning camera angles during the stunts like matrix had  they tried once or twice but none really came off as they should have  it may seem unfair to compare any movie to the effects wizardry shown in matrix but this movie and subject matter was perfect to exploit such dazzling effects work and it was very disappointing to see how poorly many were doneby no means do i want to imply that the stunt work was bad overall nor that is substantially detracted from the overall strength of the movie  it was primarily a minority of the action that had these problems  this one is worth seeing  i was merely disappointed by the missed opportunities to do something truly spectacular when the movie opted for simpler less dazzling effects and on the rare occasions when it reached for the stars it was executed poorly,fantasy
i absolutely loved this movie   it was wonderfully done and i was quite impressed  hugh jackman is the only person who can play loganwolverine james marsden was excellent as cyclops and patrick stewart was amazing as well  i liked how they did iceman especially when he made the ice rose for rogue  i also really liked how it began with magnetos memories of the concentration camps i could and would definitely see it serval times and i cant wait til it comes out on videoanna paquin was no rogue shes talented but not rogue   rogue was done badly but rogue is a hard charcter to recreate  mystique wasnt done well either she looked far too reptilian  i also was displeased that gambit beast and angelarchangel wasnt in it,fantasy
 warning 2 spoilers in this review every summer the same thing happens a new blockbuster film appears sometimes the result is astoundingly good batman matrix sometimes it is so bad its not worth even mentioning it the phantom menace and sometimes its a mixed bag is that mixed baggood points excellent photography dark and murky in the mutant fighting scenes light and airy in the human scenes nice special effects although not in the same league by any measure as those in the matrix also anna paquins character and acting are the best of the bunchbad points the special effects sometimes actually detract from the enjoyment of the film as an example ray parks fighting scenes are almost nonexistant definite bummer because his character is always enhanced by sfx in some way or the other at least in phantom menace his lightsaber duels were always visible on screen in you get to see him leaping from wall to wall and hanging for dear life with his tongue but not much more also there are some continuity issues throughout the film for example in the final sequence spoiler ahead wolverines makeup is uneven and it really shows when in the scene with rogue he sometimes appears scratched then healed then scratched again but the worst problem with the film is its uneven pace it starts slow then tries to catch up only to slow again spoiler ahead when the climax was over i was wondering whether this was it or if there was any other scene it wasnt a climax really the action sequences are too few and far between and it is very difficult for someone who isnt a fan of the to be interested the whole film it is simply not compelling enough if you are not a fan and this shows also in character development where you never really get to know the principal characters or their motivations wolverine charles xavier cyclops storm toad seems like the producers wanted to concentrate on the esthetics of the movie instead of deeper meaning thinking that fans would already know the basicsi would have to say a far better example although similar in many respects such as photography of a comic book movie is tim burtons batman this movie has very very strong principal characters joker and batman whose life and tribulations are made known with subtle hints amazing sets gotham citys nightmarish landscape beats new york any time and a dense complex plot i am sure this last opinion will be debated but only time will tell which is the greatest comic book movie i can hardly wait,fantasy
you dont even have to be a hardcore fan to enjoy this action packed eyepopping scifi picture  a cast of virtually unknowns with the exception of patrick stewart add to the overall luster to the whole film patrick stewart prof xavier is excellent in the role that he admittingly never heard of famke janssen jean grey a former bond beauty is perfect in her role as a woman with telekinetic abilities  relatively new to the seen hugh jackman explodes onto the screen as wolverine definitely the best of all ian mckellen is great as the misunderstood magneto sure this movie is full of eyecandy but there is a very well written story there  the are a group of mutants that together try to put an end to the war between humans and mutants grab the kids head to the theater grab a big bucket of popcorn extra large pepsi and sit down and enjoy this great scifiaction movie,fantasy
okay the movie that i thought would be the biggest flop of the summer is actually pretty damn cool i admit it i was wrong mr singer cast and crew i apologize i shall never doubt you again except for that idiot halle berry thank god she barely has any dialogue here actually this movie is much better than it has any right to be the potential for embarrassment was huge we have a director who has never directed a commercial hitspecial effects film before a cast of mostly unknowns and a bunch of super heroes in leather suits with goofy powers and lets not forget a final battle taking place on top of the statue of liberty but ill be a son of a gun if singer didnt do it and do it wellafter an opening sequence that is  as moving and dramatic as anything ive seen all year i knew i was in for something special ive been reading the book for about 15 years now so im one of those types that the media was focusing on as the movie opened up around the world yes its all true we are all pale friendless virgins who obsess over every little detail of the book sadly this is true for many of the books readers comics just seem to bring out the analretentive types so its safe to say that i had some interest in how the movie would come out wolverine is my all time favourite character and after seeing this all i can say is that hugh jackman is wolverine it was uncanny i just sat there thinking this guy is wolverine could this be any cooler others may not have this reaction mind you if jackman plays his cards right after this he could become a major star in hollywood keep an eye on this guysomething that really surprised me was how well the relationship between xavier and magnus was handled the few scenes that they share are some of my favourites mckellen and stewart are the two thespians of the cast so this should be no surprise but they captured the unusual friendship they share very well magneto is and always will be the malcolm x to professor xaviers martin luther king in the fight for peace between mutants and humans they other villains have mostly nonspeaking roles but they do their jobs well i hope ray park fans noticed the little homage he did to darth maul in one scene cute the good guys get a little more screen time the standouts being jackman stewart and young anna paquin who is adorable as the cursed rogue shes a scene stealer in this one and the relationship she has with wolverine is very sweet a part played by kitty pryde and then jubilee in the comic famke janssen provides sparks and is easy on the eyes yum and james marsden is pretty cool as cyclops a character who is usually hard to do anything with i also thought the scene involving xaviers journey via cerebro to the psiplane was very visually interesting they took something that had always been rather obscure in the comics and made it look very simple yet fascinating on screenno real complaints here the third act leaves a little something to be desired i thought the end battle was maybe a little unspectacular but otherwise this was great the movie has the same problem that the book often faces which is how do we get rid of xavier before the final battle because when you think about it when you have the most powerful psi on the planet on your side the rest of your team seems a little redundant from the sounds of things this one will make one hell of a dvd with a rumoured 45 minutes worth of cuts made before it was released to speed it up some say at the characters expense we are witnessing the birth of a franchise here they could probably release an film once every two or three years like the bond films the story possibilities are endless if they wanted they could just lift them from the comic they have the dark phoenix saga the xcutioners song inferno the mutant massacre the phalanx covenant and so many more if they want new villains why not use mojo mr sinister apocalypse onslaught the hellfire club the shadow king etc unlimited potential really i very much enjoyed this one and it deserves a 910 stars for impressing me so much gnight,fantasy
 should engender hope in the hearts of longsuffering comic book aficionados perhaps this film will raise the bar for this longabused genre maybe the key is to have the screenplay written by a fan of the original comics as was done here whatever the reason is a winner this is a characterdriven story that never sags but just marches through from opening scene to the credits skillfully incorporating just the right amount of action dialogue and scenery there are plenty of great special effects shots but they never overwhelm the characters the quality of the fight scenes is also excellent and they also dont overwhelm the story in contrast to just about any actionadventure movie in recent memoryspecial accolades go to hugh jackman as wolverine perhaps this is a breakthrough role for him this is not to detract from the other actors all of whom handled their roles perfectly rebecca romijnstamos having to work through tons of makeup as mystique still projects humor and personality into her character i wish we had seen more of patrick stewart and ian mckellen but unanswered questions in the story combined with what appears to be enthusiastic viewer response assures us of a sequel featuring both of these journeyman actorsrating  scale  to ,fantasy
im pretty hard to please tend to favor art films snub the most popular stuff and in general am just hard to live with when it comes to films but i saw today and wished it had been twice as long  id be happy to see it again soon  id heard about the special effects but you have to see them to appreciate them  the acting was uniformly excellent casting superb and most miraculous of all there was actually a story worth paying attention to and which furnishes food for thought an action film that involves the viewers brain  too good to be true  not if the film is  go see it  it may be awhile before another movie this good comes along,fantasy
mutants are becoming more and more common in future society but people turn against them forcing the mutants to form two sides the good guys and the bad guys the bad guys make a threat towards the world and kidnap literally one of the in a plan to turn the normal citizens of new york into mutantsscript shows some signs of intelligent intentions but the direction is lacking as though the director didnt know what to do with the material and it quickly wears out its welcome got to admire some of those eleborate sets and special effects though anna piquin is pretty good and underrated actress famke jennsen is good in her role on the overall though a major disappointment my rating 5 out of 10,fantasy
id never read a comic book or seen a cartoon of the had never seen anything to do with it  after seeing the movie twice im hooked  ive since been trying to get character histories and reading anything i can on wolverine jean grey and cyclops  i loved the movie and the special effects are awesome  i loved watching the wolverinecyclops rivalry some of the comebacks were hilarious  i even dragged my best friend to see this movie she too had no clue about and she liked it  i would recommend this to anyone,fantasy
now i know all fans including myself know the are not complete without the entire team which includes wolverine rogue and even professor x but i feel some major changes in character amounts might have let more growth occur for the main characters it could have been just about the three i just mentioned with wolverine being the main mutant magnetos team was just fine though but overall this movie was very cool hugh jackman wolverine came off with the best performance ray park toad was also very cool hes had a lot of big underrated parts in phantom menace darth maul and sleepy hollow headless horseman without a head patrick stewart and ian mckellan had good chemistry as old rivals that are so well known to each other theyre friends bryan singer always leaves you with a very cool feeling after seeing one of his movies in the usual suspects you got a feeling of surprise and amazement in apt pupil you felt haunted and chilled and now in you want to be one,fantasy
with 3 about to be released in less than a month i had to bust out my dvd and give it another watch what a great movie even now im blown away with how well the movie was made its truly fantastic and theres almost nothing i would change in the film from the opening scene at the concentration camp you know this is going to be a well done movie the characters are absolutely fantastic and handled so perfectly the relationships and chemistry are all very well written and truly felt by the audience there are so many scenes that make me grin like an idiot because its so well done particularly the first scene with professor xavier and erik lensherr magneto discussing philosophies then theres the scenes with marie rogue and logan wolverine logan wolverine scott cyclops and just about all the others for that matterthe story is nothing short of brilliant basically humans are being born that are different than the normal human and the normal humans are naturally fearful of these mutants sothere are two camps of mutants those who want to work to live in peace with humans the and those that feel they are superior to humans and will eventually dominate the earth the brotherhood of mutants and thus the premise is set and story flows from thereof course you have to mention the special effects in a film of this nature i can safely say that the special effects are perfect in this film there isnt a single scene that is badly done most of the special effects are rather subtle and rarely in your face and never overdone this is truly what a scifi movie should be specialeffects that serve a story not the other way aroundif you havent seen this film by now i really dont know what youre waiting for this is truly one of my favorite films of all time and definitely deserves a view or two or three i strongly urge you to give this film a chancecant wait for the last stand i hope its good,fantasy
i was an early reader of the and stopped pretty early on  ive been surprised by all of the hype about them in the past several years  i also dont understand the trend of turning the characters in this and other comics into musclebound creatures full of angstin any case i decided to see the movie because i figured that if nothing else itd be a fun action movie  in that respect i wasnt disappointed i also like the interplay between the charactershowever one things left me feeling not quite right about it  if i recall correctly cyclops and jean gray were two of the original appearing in issue 1  another original was iceman  he and cyclops should be basically the same age and if they are young the school should be empty except for them and a couple of others  yet weve got a child iceman a youngish cyclops and a very wellestablished school  call me nitpicky but i hate it when movies muck around with established timelines  that definitely detracted from my experience,fantasy
this comment contains very vague spoilers in every human lies the ability to adapt or mutate  this film focuses on individuals whose natural mutations have given them special abilities that they do or did not know how to use or control  a powerful mutant and humanitarian professor charles xavier proposes to bring these mutants to his large home and help them develop their abilities and a respect for mankind  they are generally feared and thus hated by the normal people of the earth  as such another very powerful mutant eric magneto lehnsherr with a tainted past with humanity nazi death camp survival proposes to either unleash a specially developed radiation which causes normal people to mutate or destroy them  characters include wolverine cyclops storm jean grey rogue  magnetos band includes mystique sabre tooth toad very well done,fantasy
so what can i say after having read all the marvel comics available in sweden ive been waiting for a movie my favourites were always the so when the movie came out i thought great all my favourite marvel characters in one movie that is where i got disapointed the movie in itself is great but i as a marvel fan cant stop thinking about that they left out all the coolest characters come on where are gambit colossus bishop canonball beast and joseph members and the coolest of them all the living tank the unstoppable juggernaut member of magnetos gang another thing i dont like is that the movie doesnt follow the comics its only based on them magneto isnt from poland hes from canada rouge and wolverine didnt join the like they did in the movie there are lots of details like that but as i said it still rules,fantasy
in a summer of disappointments comes bounding through the gate with a vengeance  in this film we get gasp character development interesting situations and allusions likeable heroes sympathetic villains and a total package that i feel is one of only a few movies out there right now worth your movie buck  anyone who is a fan of the comic book or comic books in general needs to check this film out especially to see hugh jackmans wonderful turn as logan bringing the character to life in front of our very eyes  highly recommended,fantasy
read the summary it is true when i first saw glimpses of this movie my anticipation turned into concern a lot of the things that made what they are were disregarded i liked their yellow uniforms and they had to make fun of them so now superman cant wear his get up wolverine isnt that tall either and his claws dont come out from there now the movie was somewhat entertaining nice special effects but the story was quite mediocre and there wasnt a good use of bad guys sabretooth has nothing to do with magneto either i can go on and on my conclusion is youll get more entertainment out of one comiccartoon episode at least they are more frequently available look how long you have to wait for the x men sequels waste,fantasy
right up there with superman and batman is a winner the movie is extremely loyal to the comics making minor changes but leaving big details example origins intact the cast is excellent especially patrick stewart and ian mckellen hugh jackman and anna paquin were also good of course like most big budget films this film has very impressive special effects i also liked the in jokes what would you prefer yellow spandex people who have never read the comics are not going to understand the movies plot like a fan would even fans who did not like the film at least understand it by the way there is reason is on the top 250 list at the time of this writing its that good will surely bring on sequels thank you and inspire other projects superman 5 to get made hopefully the sequels will continue to be as good as this film,fantasy
overall was a great movie  the quintessential summer blockbuster the special effects were awesome but they didnt completely overshadow the plot which was interesting as well  my main problem with the movie was that we didnt get to know storm at all  the other characters were really developed quite well but storm was denied both a personality and any decent lines  i was also sad to learn that gambit my personal favorite wasnt in the movie  oh well maybe hell show up in the sequel  i loved the message of tolerance and acceptance that was woven into the movie and that can be applied to many reallife situations  hopefully it will help some viewers learn not to automatically fear what they dont understand,fantasy
without a doubt the best comicbased film and one of my top 5 favorite movies of all time  i cant wait for the sequels to come in and anticipate the dvd release  extremely accessable to all filmgoers even if they arent fans of the comic or comics in general even if they hate the comic theyll love the movie  see it a billionzillion times,fantasy
this comment may reveal some of the movieive been an fan for a while when i knew that a movie was coming out i had many reservations most of which came from the last batman moviei have to say this made up for that mistake this was a well done movie they kept the cheese to a minimum almost nonexistent they couldnt have picked a better combination for professor x and magneto lets face it patrick stewart was born to be xavierthe thing i liked most was the dark overtones of the movie  that scene at the beginning set the tone for the whole movie of course it has always been a battle against discrimination for mutants in the comics and cartoons which parallels many aspects of our own societyif you are a fan of wolverine youll really like this he gets more camera time than most of the others hugh jackman does a great job with this characterall the characters are great save maybe cyclops i thought they could have picked someone a little less boyish and perhaps maybe made him a little less of a weenie but it just makes you like appreciate wolverine that much morei like storms character my only complaint with that character would be halle berrys voice it doesnt have the power behind it that i would have expected thank the cartoons for thati really liked rogue anna paquin was a great choice she had a great southern accent she was a delight to see on screenif they do another movie i hope they can keep the feel and energy that this one had and not screw it up like the batman movies just say no to joel schumacher stick with the same director,fantasy
this movie is a wonderful example of great entertainment while remaining loyal to the original comic series with wonderful effects linked with a powerful storyline and good acting audiences and comic loyalists alike will find themselves in the edge of their seats from the beginning and will find themselves thinking about the film long after they have left the theatreseach character portrayal is fairly well done patrick stewart proves that he can go beyond the acting limits of his star trek experience and prove he cannot be typecast into one rolehugh jackman delivers a powerful performance as logan wolverine breathing life into a difficult character hes definitely a star on the rise with a bright future and i will be watching him closely in the futurei enjoyed this movie because it delivered a powerful plot concerning mutant discrimination allowing the movie to be applied loosely to our own lives this movie gives a great beginning a successful future series,fantasy
i was very impressed with the opening scene bryan singer seems to have a very good understanding of what nazismtotalitarianism is all about enforced equality the movie is excellent truly i expected either a bunch of special effects aimed at people who prefer readers digest 90 of summer movies take a pick or something selfabsorbed to the extent of anesthesia star trek comes to mind what i got was highgrade directing tolerable script and very good acting jackson and mckellen heres the big question of the day this is not a spoiler but if youd rather not know anything at all about the movie skip the following three paragraphs why does the x sign on the uniform look so suspiciously like the swastika why does professor x wear a small golden encircled x as a necktie pin  again it looks exactly like the golden swastika that hitler and highestranked nazi party members wore on their necktiesi mean singer who filmed apt pupil a movie about an ss officer could not missoverlook these strange similarities could it be that the school of xavier is not good to the last drop as i was leaving the movie theatre i overheard a woman about 35 talking to her husband older tired and her two kids about 7 and 10 i liked it  but you know i wanted more i agree the film is about 10 minutes too short the ending also was tepid id rather see magneto looking at prof x and saying something like you dont know what he wolverine is about to find but i do  and a cut to wolverine doing something whatever really then again  there will be sequels i would hope for the nazi allegory to develop and for some unusual twists to happen alas the all dumbing force 20 century fox might consider that to be too darkrating 10 heck i would even nominate it for a special oscarr for outstandingly brave and novel idea of having a plot and an actual ethical conflict in a summer action movie,fantasy
that didnt suck these were the first words i heard from an comic fan after leaving the cinema considering the standard level of satisfaction with comic book to big screen conversions i think this is a shining review as someone who knew almost nothing about the comics i think the movie was great it will well presented well paced and well written the characters were understandable as was the situation they were in and they were portrayed in a way that contributed to the story rather than detracting from it the special effects were excellent which is normal these days though some of the subtle effect such as those when magneto used his power were excecuted so well that i was impressed even though excellent effects have become the norm all of the acting was appropriate though i have to admit no performace shone in my eyes the biggest problem with the movie was its length at only 92 minutes of movie i thought it was a bit short the figures are made up for by the end credits running over 10 minutes but i consider that to be a cheat all in all i would say that is well worth the price of admition and i am planning on seeing it again,fantasy
dont get me wrong  this movie had some pretty great special effects a decent story and for the genre above average acting  but it wasnt that good  wasnt anyone else bothered by the blatant attempt to set up the sequel at the end,fantasy
i stopped collecting and reading comic books around 15 years ago at that time was one of the best selling titles and one of my favorites although the movie doesnt match every detail of the comic book eg uniforms the ones that it skips do not seem important i enjoyed the movie the same way i enjoyed the comic book what more could i ask for,fantasy
i have always been a fan of x men  i started to collect the comics about 4 years ago  i cant believe how good the transition was between the movie and the comics  great casting job as well  although halle berry was not very convincing as storm  she was the most undeveloped character of all of them  overall a complete success,fantasy
movies and tv shows based around superheros or comics have a tendency to be well for lack of a better phrase bad  not this time  certainly the quality of special effects helped a lot and it had the obligatory beautiful women and black clothes but those happen to be part of the formula for a good action movie so who cares also patrick stewart and ian mckellen added some weight and gravitas to balance out the young actors  the plot and acting were not exceptional but were certainly good enough  if you like action movies with good special effects and cool characters this is certainly worth watching,fantasy
its great to see movie i started out being a fan of after i watched its cartoon series anyway the movie is good in terms of special effects and all the casting are really great and suitable especially wolverinei believe a lot of people will agree with me off screen i dont see a bit of hugh jackman having any traits of wolverine its amazing to see how good he portrayed him movie cyclops seemed to be a little bit too vulnerable in this movie i expect him to be stronger but its a fact that he couldnt do anything when his visor is being taken awaythats the way to beat him isnt it i saw only very little intimate scenes between cyclops and jean i really hope to see more i also expect onscreen storm to look more mature rogue is younger than i thought but the character was brilliantly carried out by anna paquin toad is disgusting but surprisingly funny mystique whew so sexy other casting of the characters were fine the special effects are great too but the movie is just too short that i cant believe the movie ended that soon i must see the sequel overall a fine comicturnmovie,fantasy
as an avid comics fani am pleased to say this movie did not disappoint me  i was able to deal with the minor discrepancies from the comic that is to be expected  hugh jackman was the perfect wolverine he played it the way it was meant to be played  the casting of ray parks was a nice touch,fantasy
with any movie coming from a source this ingrained in its fans theres always the danger that the result will be totally incomprehensible to the public at large  miraculously almost completely avoids this pitfall with the few forgivable almost mandatory exceptions of minor injokes that dont distract in any way  i have only a surface familiarity with the background comic gleaned mostly from hearing other people talk and had no trouble understanding and genuinely getting into the film right from the starti really liked this movie  its got great characters main and supporting a great setup a great general introduction to the concepts a nice balance of special effects a respectable plot that effectively sets up the main characters relationships and hints at what the next step in the storys development will be and then it just stops  great i cant wait for next weeks thrilling second installment  except in this case itll be a yearplus before a sequels outi had a few minor quibbles with this film especially over the way the straightforward plot seems to have been severely edited for time but the only real problem was that the film seems to lack a real effective climax and conclusion  it honestly feels more like a terrific tv pilot episode than a standalone movie and i have the suspicion it would have benefited impressively from the extra running time it might have gained on television luckily the rest of the movie is well enough done especially in the way it manages to independently develop characters with decades of history behind them in a ridiculously short amount of time so that im willing to wait to see where the storys going next  with a setup this engaging itll be a crying shame if the followup doesnt prove to be twice as good and that ought to be really impressive to see,fantasy
i have just seen todayaugust 6 2000 and i have only one word to say about it terrific thespecial effects are terrific everybody is well cast and the action fast paced but the thing about this movie is you actually care about what happens it has a good plot to match the actors and special effects best of all it leaves oom for a sequel or two patrick stewart and ian mckellen are magnificent fleshing out the characters to a realistic level hugh jackman and tyler mane are also great but for different reasons and chalk up another good part for ray park as toadray park played darth maul in star warsepisode i the only complaint i have about this film is that they couldnt flesh out all the characters in the alotted time cant wait for the sequels,fantasy
i saw mainly for an escape from reality and i was not disappointed it was not the most original and substantial movie i have ever seen but it was fun and the characters were neat  i just wish it didnt seem like a lot of other action type stories and had more originality to it  i liked the relationships between the characters and the visuals were fantastic  i think ill see the next one there has got to be a next one as far as i can tell but i hope it gets more of a story linei gave it a 7,fantasy
this may not be the best film you ever see  it may not even be the best film you see this summer but so far its the best comic book adaptation made  although a bit shortleaving a few characters slightly underdeveloped a nice quick paced adventure  excellent direction  great acting all around  but the big kudos of the movie goes to hugh jackman dougray scott was originally cast as logan but got hung up in overtime on the set of mi2  good  he was wretched in that movie  he would have made wolverine horrible  hugh jackman made me a believer  he was wolverine  if youve read the comics then you know his sharp personality shined in this movie  kudos jackman  very well developed motivationsfor the most part with many parrallels and extensive groundwork for sequelsequels maybe keep them coming  810,fantasy
what i saw for the most part was plot holes and cheese lots of cheese  for example ive never heard of people making such a big deal over mutants before and chances are i wont in the near future either  it was made to seem like it is all common place which of course it isntapparently a lot of things in this movie are supposed to be commonplace  mutants just walk around in train stations and bars in full garb and weaponry yet no one seems to notice  is this really commonplace too  if i saw someone walking around wearing flowing robes or nightvisionesque looking goggles i would take a second glance but not because they were mutants  if all mutants feel like outcasts why dont you just put on some pants and a tshirt  maybe then no one will noticeperhaps i missed something because i never read any of the comic books however ive never read the superman comics the crow means more to me than it ever could on paper and i havent even seen men in black on the magazine shelf yet i loved all those movies  even incarnations of batman whether it is a liveaction movie like the first one or a cartoon movie batman mask of the phantasm are better than this attempt atthere was so much promise but it fell short of immortality even for a mutant,fantasy
very intriguing special effects destined to become the movie of 2000 while entertaining and fun didnt live up to my expectations especially with the huge hypes i looked forward to a movie that maybe scratched the subject of mutation a bit more and studied the elements of the characters natures more expoundly but instead the movie was just a bunch of heros saving the dayin spite of that small mishap this movie is still great funworth seeing at the very leastat present my vote stands at 7 but it may vary,fantasy
when the movie came out i had some doubts about it as i had seen the animated series and read a few issues of the comics and didnt like it very much the only reason i went to see was because it had ray park in it and i absolutely loved him in the phantom menace as darth mauli have to say is one of the best movies ive ever seen in a while aside from the phantom menace thanks to the magnificent performances of all those involved hugh jackman who is well known in australia was a heck of a lot better than i expected and he really fits the role of loganwolverine patrick stewart also did a great job of portraying charles xavier and ditto to sir ian mckellen as magneto i also had my doubts about james marsden as cyclops but he too turned in a great performance heck there arent even any slackers in this castmy only real complaint about the movie after watching it was that the ending could have had some more action in itso go see i guarantee you will enjoy it i rate it 85 out of 10,fantasy
 is a decent but a thoroughly sloppily put together motion picture the special effects are used so much that the film becomes a joke the mutants and their powers were so unbelievable that my suspension of disbelief was broken almost instantly batman and superman work as movies at least somewhat but when a live actor can control the weather or shoot lasers out of his eyes it just becomes too hard to believe now i was  never a fan of comic books but i was a big fan of the television cartoon series that was around several years ago i loved that show and besides batman the animated series there wasnt a better cartoon series around super powers when used by real human actors seem incredibly fake used by cartoon characters on the other hand and they seem more believeable also as a television series the cartoon allowed characters to develop the film tries to do this while also being a summer action extravaganza it doesnt work all that well 510,fantasy
i have no familiarity with at all but this movie was so well done i had to comment  it shows there really are no limits for bringing fantasy to reality on the big screen  for me the plot was a bit vague at first but thats ok i caught on  ive only seen a few trailers  too many are too long with too much detail these daysin spite of what bob zemekis thinks the public really wants the story was good overall  the cast was excellent  the characters strange but hey this is a fantasy so enjoy the action subplots and the ride i would see it again  if they dont do a sequel they wasted some dialogue and mislead the audience  if not in production it should bevery worth seeing especially for the effects and interaction between characters  bloopers would be great,fantasy
the movie like all good cheese can only come into its own if it is allowed to develop the meatiness and density that comes with maturity while it was the most purely enjoyable summer theatrical release i have seen in years i wish i wish i wish it had just delved a little more into the world in which it was set  im not asking for a brooding diatripe on the injustices of society but more mention of said injustices would have made these characters into characters the likes of which i might have been a lot more interested in  my favorite line in the movie was mystiques only line as mystique its people like you who made me afraid to go to school suddenly we were not looking at a soulless villain headed towards a rightfully deserved death but a real character who had had a rotten childhood and was taking it out on others in a confused attempt to get even from that point on i found myself overlooking the obvious heinousness of her crimes and actually gladdened that she survived and went about righting the senators wrongs in his guise  it just takes one extra minute on screen to turn a the flattest character into someone youd like to know  oh and i didnt appreciate the way that the entire background to the film was explained in a five minute monologue rather than slowly revealed throughout the films course and how such trifling details as xaviers possession of a blackbird underground research facility and psychicatrium or whatever the hell that was were left completely unexplained  another action sequence would have been nice too,fantasy
 is in the ranks with the crow and batman as great comic book adaptations magneto believes that a war is brewing between humans and superpowered mutants professor x runs his school for mutants while the government is scaring the public about mutants rogue finds wolverine and after they bond wolverine is attacked by sabertooth and the original save him the two go to the school and learn about what they are and what they have to fight against the movie is a showcase for wolverine who is surpisingly done justice  good effects and great tones of the comic are some of the plusses the ending gives way to the possibility of sequels rebecca romajn stamosfamke jansen anna paquin and halle barry all are beautiful and made the movie delightful  out of ,fantasy
i was very impressed with  i had nothing but positive comments about the movie i had enjoyed the comic book series and my friends who have similar tastes recommended it  so i was expecting to be disappointed  i wasnt  the film is great entertainment the ensemble cast does an excellent job  i was particularly impressed with the way that the excellent special effects were used to advance the plot and the characters and did not completely take over the films humanity  there was great adventure good character development and the film even dealt with issues in a way that was stimulating to the intellect okay its not shakespeare but for an actionadventurescifi it was much better than most  you would have to be trying to dislike the movie not to find something to enjoy  a special note on actor hugh jackman  for an australian i was a bit worried that he was given the part of wolverine  i had previously known hugh jackman as a guy who sang the national anthem at football grand finals so i wasnt sure that he would be able to do justice to a disturbed character like wolverine  he did an excellent job almost stealing the show  i look forward to 2 and 3,fantasy
it was no doubt daunting to the makers of that there were hundreds of thousands of fanatics who were as likely to vilify its latest incarnation as embrace it fans of the comic book need not have worried this flick will not disappoint but those countless millions who dont know an from a ychromosome may feel otherwise for all its earnestness and technical competence is a classic case of cinematic deja vu whatever vivacity tim burton was able to inject into 1989s wildly popular batman has long since dissipatedwitness the disappointing reception to its last sequel and the recently cancelled resurrection of the superman franchise does little if anything to raise the bar for the genreits little more than a good mutants versus bad mutants tale with a little quasiracism thrown in for flavor plus too little is made of the oppression suffered by mutants in a mortals world just as too little is made of the toofew characters in this plotline yet even after apparently distilling the pantheon of mutants into a handful of characters for the movie version scant use is made of the many serviceable actors hired its seems ironic to see so much onedimensionality in a movie based on a minimally twodimensional source but the inbred success of will no doubt beg a sequel not to mention inspiring even more comicborne adaptations come to think of it spiderman starts production this fall,fantasy
why people are so glad the x men movie didnt screw upbecause there was so much room to screw up thankfullythe screenwriters and the director avoided itx men used to be my favorite comic book when i was a kidthen marvel comics started milking the franchise comingup with a new mutant comic every couple of months or soby the last time i read it there were so many mutantsscattered in so many different titles i lost count and myinterest in themso as almost everyone else i was a skeptic when the reelstarted my skepticism didnt last long the movie deliveredto both readers and nonreaders i was impressed the character development with the exception of cyclops andstorm and the action were so well balanced there was areal good story brewing beneath it all  seeing how thesepeople are feared and rejected because of who they are ismaterial enough to leave us thinking how is this happeningin reality but the thinking was left behind for summerthrills this movie had a lot of unexplored potential but thenagain it had a lot of chances of being just a silly fanboyflick bring on the sequel and lets hope cyclops has alittle more time for his character to develop,fantasy
okay i might as well admit it  ive never read an comic book ever however i did see some of the animated series a good one too and gained some knowledge of the characters involved  then i learned of the movie from a trailer while waiting for mission  impossible 2 and noticed that patrick stewart was in the movie so i decided to check it out partly to see how good he was my boss really likes himwell not only was he great but the movie was great too even for those who have limited knowledge of the moviein the nottoodistant future people are developing unusual powers and as a result are feared by normal people especially sen robert kelly  he wants to create a mutant registration program and both professor xavier stewart and magneto ian mckellan dont like it  but while xavier still holds out hope for the humans magneto thanks to a horrific experience as a holocaust survivor does not  he wants to force humans to accept mutants  by turning humans into mutantsmagneto has created a machine that can do so but it weakens him severely so he needs marierogue anna paquin a mutant who has the unfortunate gift of absorbing the lifeforce and memories of anyone she touches and in the case of other mutants their powers as well meaning she could kill a person  when magneto kidnaps her wolverine hugh jackman who has befriended her goes to her aid as do the  cyclops james marsden storm halley berry and jean grey famke janesseni loved the movie  it had neat characters  to me the worst was sabertooth tyler mane and he was still okay  fine action and a good message about the evil effects of prejudice and intolerance to boot  plus it had two relationships that were handled well  the first was between professor xavier and magneto and stewart and mckellan handled that friendship very well  they may be on opposing sides but their friendship prevents them from killing each other which helps magnetos characterization especially  mckellan plays magneto as someone with good reasons for what he does but sadly misguidedthe second relationship is the paternal one or is it a big brotherlittle sister one between wolverine and rogue and it works wonderfully  the relationship helps rogue feel safe and accepted while it humanizes wolverine  i especially love the scene where he willingly gives rogue his healing power to save her  it is my favorite scene because it is proof of what good relationships can do to people  kudos to jackman and paquin for their portrayals of wolverine and roguein short all fans of the series must see  and for those who have limited or no knowledge give it a chance anyway  you might wind up loving itbelle book,fantasy
im glad singer didnt go for the obvious summerblockbuster extravaganzatype movie the actionsequences are omnipresent of course and there are plenty of spectacular scenes but theres a kind of subtle atmosphere that is kept going which i found to be very cool theres some nice attention for detail with a couple of well placed jokes its not just loud explosions and people punching eachother mi2 very good casting i particularly liked the way stewart and mckellen interact they both have this quiet authoritythis is the kind of summermovie we should see more often keep it up i cant wait for the sequels,fantasy
at last a 4 color comic that can stand toe to toe with the comic it self the cast is good the story is simple in a 4 color way and the action is great again in a 4 color wayfor a comic film it gets  out of  action adventure it gets again  out of patrick steward is born to be prof x he has the look accent and style the rest is also great even wolferine who is the most difficult character to transform from the comic to the screenin all great at last a comic film that is what it is,fantasy
i was surprised that bryan singer was selected as the director of normally i wouldve suggested that a director like john woo or the wachowskibrothers did this kind of movie should be a movie with fast action fast story and a fast and beautiful photographybryan singer wasnt as you can see the first man i thought of but i was still pleased to see him as a director he has a very special way of giving characters life to give them flesh and bone the worst kind of thing that could happened to was a thin story with characters you didnt care forbryan singer convinced me once a again that he belongs by my top ten directors in hollywood this movie has anything that you possibly could want from a movie like this as a fan of marvel i dont feel ashamed over this movie like i was over spawn  though it had its moments  i recommend everybody to see this movie enter the world of mutants and enjoy i doubt ill see any greater movie this year,fantasy
i just saw this movie a few days ago and it had blown my mind away it is such a cool movie with some very good special effects and action sequences unlike any other comic book made into an action flick this had some depth and some kind of plot i would not rated this movie for its plot  but for the special effects also some of the acting was good especially from hugh jackman ian mckellen and patrick stewart but also there was some eye candy for the guys as well such as halle berry rebbeca romijn stamos and famke janssen at the end of this movie you are know that there will be a sequel to this since they have left some holes in the story such as will wolverine find out about his past or will xavier and magento fight it out for another day you would just wait and see if the hollywood producers will churned out a sequel for this movie,fantasy
its a growing genre super hero movies and this one is by far the best i have seen complete with the graphic novel feeling and scenery and with a wonderfully relieving sense of humor reaches far beyond the fans of the comic  i have never read one single panel of the comiccomedy is essential when making movies of this kind without it there would only be a dumb plot with geeky super hero personalities mystique smells nerdy male fantasies a long way but by taking itself not too seriously this film is irrestistible i was so amazed by the interaction between the good guys what do they call you wheels the smart humor giving the finger in an entirely new way and the nottooviolent action makes up very well for the to put it mildly oddball science and the somewhat brainless plotalso its refreshing to see a scifi flick that has almost no gadgets in it apart from the aircraft if that qualifies as gadget and cyclops weird glasses its all man versus man or whateveranother clever touch is showing how magneto once was sent to a concentration camp during ww2  symbolizing the future fate that he and his mutant brothers and sisters are about to suffer the mutants become modern day jews and the ordinary humans become their third reich torturers it also explains the strong hatred that he feels towards the human race  he is being reminded of his traumatic childhoodwowi never thought i would be able to analyze a super hero movie in that waythe bottom line is go see it even if you havent read the comic and like i did had very low expectations if you have any sense of humor and adventure you might be surprised,fantasy
it wasnt a bad film it was rather well done actually i am not a big comic book geek so most of the characters where new to me the film did a good job getting me up to speedthough i did get the yellow spandex jokemy main problem with this film is that like most action films of late they spend to much time trying to wow you with unreal effectsi think  a lot of actors talents are not seen working with the blue screen for effects dont get me wrong is a solid film but it isnt a special film if your a true blue comic junkie it may have more meaningbut to me it was just a fun ride,fantasy
or homoerotic for that matter  finally a director has decided to not only make a movie based on a comic book but also has decided to take it seriously  many past directors have always seemed almost embarrassed of the fact that their main character is a man that dresses like a bat or a pretty boy in blue and red spandex  the people and stories are then treated as these campy jokes  its insulting to anyone who reads the comic and to people who expect a highflying action flick and get cheesey one liners brian singer is the first director that doesnt seem embarrassed by his subject and it helps  i am not a fanboy or at least i wasnt before the film so i had no reason to feel betrayed by the little differences  but even the most hard core comic fans have to admit that no one was shamed in this movie  all the characters were treated with respect  some were underused but that is not the same thing  there were no groaners as far as the dialog goes with the possible exception of storms do you know what happens to toads that get struck by lighting line  what was that and the villains didnt dance around screaming im so eeeeeeevil a la batman i think the comic fans should rejoice plus not for nothing but dont you think it is a bit daunting to include 30 or so years of backstory into one movie without tweaking information or consolidating characters  i think they did a fine job  just thought id give my two cents on a great little movie simply cause i can  god bless the internet,fantasy
bryan singer knows what he is doing and what he is doing is creating an excellent franchise this film leaves you wanting more and more and is just amazing hugh jackman may have only been big down under before this but now he is king of the world his portrayal of wolverine was perfect and he showed he is a fine actor and a bad man mardsen did a fine job and really gave cyclops that preppy leader with the hot babe i always envisioned famke is hot and a great actress who created a hotter than imagined jean grey patrick stewart was excellent and proved he was prof x i had my doubts about mr mckellan but he proved me wrong and im glad halle struggled as storm but could easily tweak her role for the sequel no one did a bad job except the score composer while it didnt hurt it didnt help is awesome and the sequel is coming prepare for the next generation of adventure to get even better1010 this is a dream realized for fans and a great film  for non comic fans,fantasy
i absolutely loved i seriously think it was more entertaining than all the batman and superman movies put together i am only an occasional reader of the comic book but from my viewpoint the movie was as faithful to the comic as it needed to be or could be expected to be in order to appeal to a wide audiencethe casting was absolutely terrific from top to bottom the action scenes and special effects were spectacular the dialogue was witty yet appropriately restrained unlike the endless barbs that go back and forth during every fight in a batman movie the plot was interesting involving and directly related to the core themecant wait to own it on dvd and to see the sequel,fantasy
being a comicbook fan i have never been caught in the trappings of the fanaticism but have been left to enjoy a story of theirs on occasion putting me in a position of being a less critical judge of the movie and its character rendition than many others in a nutshell everyone did a fine job portraying their designated characters the specials were very good but when arent they the action was quality stuff etc so whats my beef rogue dragged the movie down did anna paquin have a special deal with fox or something i enjoyed the synergy between rogue and logan in the beginning but it wore thin a little too quickly wo giving away the story i just want to finish by saying that there must have been some other feasible way for magneto to make his point or seek his revenge than beating an otherwise tired character to death,fantasy
much better than that mission impossible 2 this movie is definitely the summer movie it has a fantastic  not to mention sterile  look to it its fantastic on the eyes and really has a comic book feel to it also the action is actually fun and exhilarating and not just annoying and phony hence mi 2 a very clever movie where the dialogue isnt actually that annoying i left the theater feeling great this is by far brian singers best movie,fantasy
if you want a picture of the future imagine a boot stomping on a human faceforevergeorge orwelli think the above quote suggests that the esteemed mr orwell may very well have been able to appreciate human bigotry after all is as old as human existence though the trappings seem to border on the preposterous can one really say that the films premise is as outrageous as at first glanceill be frank i wasnt expecting anything from this film though i am a longtime comic collector ive learned to hate all things as time rolls on there were so many times and so many moments were the film seemed to be on the edge of going down the toilet hehguess i should have had more faith what ive seen this night is the next step in the actionfilm revolution begun by the matrixthough the were created in america the storyline science fiction elements characterizations and outrageous action actually have their roots in both japanese anime and the german expressionist film movement of the 1910s and 1920s these two seperate schools began to merge in the live action arena with the underacknowledged gem dark city the neophyte movement finally began to hit overdrive with the matrix and with has finally begun to hit its stride im not sure what one could call this movement in film roger eberts term of visionary filmmaking is way too vague to be considered definitive but hopefully it will define the action genre for the 21st centurygranted none of this would mean a thing if the acting or writing werent topnotch david hayters script is notable for its lack of verbosity taking a cue from the german expressionist movement most of the drama is conveyed in images the shattered gates in poland the ominous floating guns during the train station standoff logan holding maria tight in the hopes of keeping her alive the dialogue can only be described as adequate one is not likely to find that many memorable oneliners but it never becomes so terrible that one winces as he occasionally had to during some of the clunkier lines of star wars episode one that said there are at least a couple of good jokes in the script and logan sticking out his center claw after setting off and turning off the metal detector is probably the best visual joke while the plot sets things up for a potential sequel by leaving more than a few loose ends it doesnt feel forced real life is a very messy proposition after all and not every square peg is going to fit in the round holestheres nothing wrong in the acting department by a large margin patrick stewarts charles xavier is every bit as commanding as his capt picard ever was its a credit to the mans presense that his impression on screen remains formidable even if he is bound in a wheelchair sir ian mckellen offers a believably chilling magneto a man burning with old hatreds and the need to do something about them but the central figure of this saga is undoubtably hugh jackmans wolverinelogan he plays the role like a hunted animal barely civilised and totally reliant on his instincts close to him in this center is anna paguins rogue a frightened young girl with a power she cant control or understand her purpose is to reaffirm the humanity in logan that he hasnt realized hes been missing the others make less of an impression mainly because theyre restricted to the use of their powers and their interactions with logan still james marsdens cyclops makes a nice verbal sparring partner for logan and famke janssens dr jean grey sets the stage for a potential romantic triangle down the linei never thought that i would say this but i now do hope for a sequel to this filmonly of course if they can follow up with the same high level of quality displayed here i xpect no less,fantasy
as a life long fan of the comic book series i found this movie to be completely lacking in character development totally opposing the lives set up for the characters for the past thirty years and completely against everything i grew up knowing about these people  the character of rogue was utterly destroyed  she was turned into a whiney snivelling scared little teenager that turned my stomach  she was weak and useless and bore absolutely no resemblance to the character that i have spent the last fifteen years in awe of  the character of scott summers was a total pretty boy  he was a buffalo with his visor and was nothing but annoying  i never particularly appreciated cyclops in the book but if the character were to have been like marsdens summers well im glad hes dead  jean and storm were completely useless  they did absolutely nothing the entire movie through  storm was no longer clausterphobic which was a severe part of the characters personality  and beyond which halle berry continually dropped her accent and storm would never cower in fear from any opposition much less sabertooth and toad  magneto was a frail old man and not much of an opposing force  xavier was captain picard in a wheel chair and had no business messing with wolverines head  the real charles xavier would never terrify a man like that when hes so new to the school  the only redeeming force in this movie is hugh jackman as wolverine  he found the essence of that character and brought him to life  kudos to jackman the rest of the movie bit  some of the children in this movie acted better than the famous so called professionals they had in the parts of these characters  halle berry should have been dropped off that part faster than wolvies claws go snickt  i can only hope the next movie will be an improvement because i was totally underwhelmed by this part,fantasy
i thought i would be disappointed in anna paquin as rogue rogue being my favorite but i am happy to report she did a smashing job of it  i was also happily surprised by hugh jackman as wolverine he sizzles on the screen both in ferocity and sex appeal am i right ladies all of the cast seamlessly brought their characters to life but wolverine has become my favorite moviethe special effects are well done and the costumes are wonderful  the choice of all black uniforms rather than the colorful and varied ones of the comics  cartoon is the only real departure from the we grew up with and does not hurt the image of the at all there is a reference to wolverines cartoon uniform in one scene where he questions their choice of uniformit doesnt matter if you are a die hard fan or meeting the for the first time you will be hooked  a must see for fans and first timers alike,fantasy
let me start off that yes i understand that nothing can be directly translated from one medium into another without making a few tweaks here and there leather and vinyl does look better than spandex on the big screen i also believe that comics get  no respect in the film industry compared to an actual book i dont really understand this when a books translated people always complain that they left so much out and then proceed to tell everyone that the movies a horrible adaption but when its  a comic any changes seem to be overlooked why  comics will have more stories than any series of books could hopefully wish for the have been around since the 60s but nobody seems to mind all the weird things that happen in the movie  okay now onto the reasons and the spoilers so stop here if you havent seen it yetthe whole movie seemed to center around wolverine if they where going to go this route they should have made a movie called wolverine and then make sequals called the  thru out the whole movie you get to see rogues powers and the fact that people go into a coma like state when she uses it so why is it that magneto is still up and going in the last battle when rogue has just zapped him  magneto even states to sabertooth that he will be in a weekend state and needs his protection  storm is really underplayed in the movie shes truly is my favorite character in the comics do you remember the scene where sabertooth grabs her by the neck why didnt she shock him why was he able to knock her around until they got outside mystique has the ability to imitate anybodys appearance but not their powers yet in the movie she has wolvies claws and appears to be just as dangerous with them  the writers and directors saw it fit to make the big screen jean grey from two characters in the comic moria mctarget and jean grey  theres a character name bobby drake the one who gives rogue the iceflower who was one of the  original so that would actually put him closer to cyclops and jean greys age  i really found all this really fustrating if you cant relate think about how jurassic park was for all you people who really enjoyed the book and think about how the movie and the book really differed and youll understand my fustrationokay now im sure all of you are reading this and saying im being to picky but the point of this all is is that the movie became really plot driven in a way that they decided to change the way the characters function during the climax just to help the story along ie storm vs sabertooth and how rogues power did not effect magneto this is usually considered really bad story telling but for some reason people dont seem to mind in this movie i guess special effects are really what matters now from what this movie is scoring,fantasy
i have been an fan since i was probably five until i was ten i always wanted them to make a movie because i wanted to see real people act out their parts when i heard about becoming a film i got real excited i have started to write screenplays and if someone else didnt do it i would have centres around hugh jackmans performance as wolverine i saw him on a talk show and i wouldnt have known such a calm person could play the part so wells highest quality is its cast and performances good acting good movie anna pacquin rogue ian mckellan magneto scott marsden cyclops halle berry storm and my personal fav ray park toad give great performancesi think that the special effects and the story line could have been done better  way better it was great that they incorporated a lot of the but not as stars the director gets two thumbs up is welldone,fantasy
i just saw last night and it totally blasted the hell out of me ray park was among the audience what a nice fella hes a very kind and funny person well as you have already read from all the postings here the movie relies more on the feelings that this group of mutant misfits have to deal with than with any other aspect of the comic series i recall someone stating that you cant believe that such beautiful people could be mistaken for freaks enter rogue anna paquin is a beautiful woman her image hasnt been exploited the same way as janssens berrys or stamos but you cant help fallin in love with her shes so desperate and confused her sadness really beats wolverines seek for a past hugh jackman is indeed a great actor and he portrayed wolvie in a pretty cool way with the attitude and the looks but believe me you will feel paquins performance more than any other specially in the dream sequence  youll know when you see it  man i almost cried during that one  ok back to earth is a great movie you should go and see it,fantasy
this was a particulary stunning summer action movie in a summer mostly filled with silly comedies and pointless dramas  it will certainly have more effect than any other movie this summer as it is far and away the best sequel opportunity  it practically begs for one  and i honestly hope they do make one several even if theyre going to be like thisbut no film is perfect and this ones flaw is rather large the character of marierogue is constantly being used not as a character but as a plot device  rogue is a very powerful mutant and was before this movie a very powerful woman  by having a child play her as a victim and something of a weakling at every turn made for a huge drawback  the result was that she despite being a main perhaps the main character came off as unrealistic while all the other actors were excelling,fantasy
im planning to go and see this again  the effects were incredible  the acting is really really good  the storyline actually holds water which is impressive for a comic book on the big screen  i especially loved the relationship that grows between rogue anna paquin and wolverine hugh jackman whose only flaw in this world is that hes married its not the relationship i remember them having in the cartoon show but i like it this way better  if youre a fan of the comic books if you ever wanted to be a super hero or if you just like cool special effects this is a mustsee,fantasy
i enjoyed the movie quite a bit and felt it worked on its own terms as a specialeffects laden summer action movie but it could have been so much more  the producers clearly didnt have much faith in its audience keeping the film to 95 minutes and sacrificing story and character development in favor of action and visual effects and doing everything short of flashing coming soon 2 in purple neon at the films conclusion  the critics seem to think it is too overcrowded but i actually felt there should have been more characters  it felt odd watching a team of essentially four this isnt the fantastic four  i hope they bring more in for the sequel id especially like to see gambit and nightcrawler or maybe more of kitty pryde and iceman who only make brief appearances in this film  hopefully there will be more character development  if they just slow it down and actually tell a story they could have something really great and meaningful on their hands  in other words a real film as opposed to a popcorn flick the romance between cyclops and jean could obviously be expanded  they dont even so much as kiss in this movie  they seem oddly illsuited for she is obviously several years older than him  still i was pleasantly surprised with the casting choices with all the actors surpassing my expectations  on the other hand their performances make it all the more plain that they need a stronger script one with more emotional and intellectual power  they can clearly handle it as actors even halle berry who is gorgeous but only occasionally gives good performances  she is just right as storm and anna paquin is terrific as rogue  all i can say is they got a good director in bryan singer so please please get a topnotch writer to equal him for the sequel,fantasy
i was losing my mind waiting to seeand the wait was worth it  this movie took me back to my room circa 1976 where my comic books ruled my little life  it was a great escape and a solid action ride from start to finishnow im waiting for the sequeli hope its 4 hours long,fantasy
i think all in all the movie was done very well  i am not a hardcore comic fan  if i were i might not have liked it as much but then when it changes from the comics to the big screen certain things have to be changedbelieve it or not compared to what i remember reading in the comics i actually preferred the liveaction version  my only real criticism is that it was such fun watching it that the time went by too fastthe movie could have been longer  if they make sequels i will watch them,fantasy
i was pleasantly surprised by  i enjoyed it  you do need to know a little of their history before going in because they dont take much time explaining or developing each character  i think everyone did a pretty good job but halle berry was a little weak she didnt have much to work with though  hugh jackman as wolverine was excellent,fantasy
this film met most of my expectations as a fan the movie is lacking what im sure the sequels will make up for like most have said it lacks a lot but there was no way they could please everyone it was a tasteful and wisely made rendition and i hope to see it turn into the best comic book franchise ever filmednote in the film goofs it mentions that the guard has metal buttonsis it me or did anyone else catch that the guard was the same one mystique turned into at the statue of liberty hence the metal buttons the way magneto tells himher to send xavier away and magneto knocks down the king because he just kidnapped xavier which will lead to the next film,fantasy
this review contains spoilers for the film so read at your own risk is an action packed scifi drama  the film begins with a comment by professor x about the history of mutation and then we jump to a nazi concentration camp where magnito is a child and torn away from his parents the gate seems to bend unnaturally and he is finally knocked to the ground we then jump to the near future where a senator played by bruce greenwood wants to pass a bill to tag all mutants much like mccarthy tried to do with communists in the 50s  everyone seems to applaud this and agree with him the film focuses mainly on rough played by anna paquin  she discovers her mutation after she kisses her boyfriend which she can take whose ever life force she touches and can eventually kill with this with this ability she later hooks up with wolverine who has powerful regenerative abilities and three knives protruding from his fist  his car crashes and they are attacked by magnitos men while xaviors defeats them and then they are taken to professor xaviors school for the gifted which is a cover for mutant children  the must stop magnito from turning the world leaders into mutants after he unsuccessfully converts senator kelly  the cast is fantastic in this film  patrick stewart gives an excellent performance as professor xavior he generally cares for his students and is a positive force for good and a great mentor  anna paquins character of rogue is the one audiences would feel sympathy for  she cant ever come in contact with other human beings without killing them and she is innocent  if you are looking for a great action scifi drama film then will work for you,fantasy
simply one of the greatest action movies of all time one of the more amazing aspects is that the characters strongly resemble their comic book counterparts that kind of thing is rare this is one movie that really lived up to the hype unlike say the phantom menace so how about that spiderman movie,fantasy
for a super hero type flick i went in expecting just a lot of gizmos and gadgets boy was i pleasantly surprised i thought there was just the right blend of emotion escapism and action hugh jackman as wolverine was excellent as was anna paquin as rogue i hope there will be a sequel,fantasy
i found the movie over all to be very well done as a one time xfanatic i really think the movie conveyed the same feelings as the comic books do i also think the characters were portrayed very well especially wolverine who has always been my favorite all though some might argue that important characters were left out even the characters that were included barely received enough time for character development as it was congratulations to hugh jackman who does a terrific job portraying wolverine as wild and unrelenting but still shows the human side of him i also enjoyed famke janssens portrayal of jean grey i really liked this movie id love to see it again id recommend it to anyone whos looking for a little mutant fun,fantasy
being a fan of comic books i wasnt sure whether or not i would like a movie based on the bestselling comic of all time  also received a lot of hype causing moviegoers to expect a movie to be better than it actually is  however was a very good film  not only is the movie teeming with eyepopping visual effects but it also has intelligence emotion and humor  most of the characters are portrayed with great attention to the conflicts between them professor x vs magneto wolverine vs cyclops  the only things that stop me from giving a rating of 10 are that wolverines past could have been revealed in more detail and that storm has very little personality lets work on her more in the sequel overall a very good movie  delivers  910,fantasy
as the movie began i thought oh good theyre keeping the more serious tone of the instead of sinking to the just say a cool oneliner and then blow something up action flick  however the intelligent villains and emotional depth of the characters quickly gave way to hasta la vista baby  the plot quickly started to rely on intelligent characters suddenly acting stupid  imagine something on par with mystery men only this wasnt a comedy  the action sequences had some brilliant moments wolverine vs mystique but the bulk of them just didnt convey the pace and intensity of superheros battling supervillains  the majority of the combat sequences were just how many times can someone get sent flying obviously on a digitally removed wire through a wall  you get hit by lightning fly through a wall you get blasted by cyclops eye beams fly through a wall maybe ive just seen too many good combat sequences in kungfu movies but i was left less than impressed by the directing during most of the fight sequences  on top of the statue of liberty theres about 12 seconds in a fight sequence where wolverine and sabertooth are both obscured by lady libertys crown  i left the theater feeling like this movie came so close but fell short so many times  if youre going to theater see something else and wait for this to come out on video,fantasy
having been an fan for many years i was hoping for a good movie what i got was an excellent movie with a fantastic plot as well as some background information hugh jackman did a great rendition of wolverine his makeup crew deserve mega kudos  patrick stewart was a genius as usual  everyone was fantastic  the action was superb i have to own this one on dvd when it comes out,fantasy
 is truly what happens when you combine the genius of a creative team which cares for the history behind a legacy yet had the creativity and insight to bring this to the real world and the big screenbryan singer tom desanto and everyone else on the xteam delivered  big time  against all odds rushed release date limited budget hordes of naysayers they delivered a film which will not only appease fans of the comic but the general public as wellthe theme this is the real worldand this is tomorrow sometime in the near future  this takes place in the real world not a gotham city fictional locale and deals with real issues  bryan singers move to take this movie its characters and the viewing public seriously is what makes this movie stellar  this isnt watered down silly and insulting like other comic book to movie translations as of latego and see it  go and see it twice at least  for the comic book fans that complain about how their beloved characters have been altered age or costumewake up  the premise of this movie was to make it real  a story drama even with action it it  for those not familiar with the history nor do not like comic book moviesdefinitely go and see it its not just a comic book movie  i dont collect comics  i just loved seeing this movie a number of times  its entertaining and then somei hope we the powers that be decide on doing a sequel yes its that good,fantasy
 i must say was really a good movie  the special effects were fabulous and the plot was short but was clear and got its message across the characters were developed nicely especially wolverine  this is a movie that you should definitely take the time to see this summer  you wont be disappointed,fantasy
dont get me wrong i liked this movie great performances by a cast who could have done much worse with the script but there just wasnt enough action in this one i assume the reasoning was that the audience needed some introducing of the characters and that didnt leave much time for special effects basically this movie is a good setup for a kickbutt sequel looking forward to 2,fantasy
i felt that this film adaptation really did the justice  they did a good job of dealing with the 30 year history of the for this movie i thought the special effects were excellent even better than the matrix the costumes were nice seeing how yellow and blue spandex would not translate too well onto live people adam westbatman  all the acting was well done as well  the only thing that could have been done a little bit better was some more character development for some of the other than rogue and wolverine,fantasy
i mean well in a way it is just another action movie but honestly could anyone have done a better job than bryan singerhe gave the characters depth although i have friends who argue against it insisting that characters like halle berrys storm do nothing but strut their stuff on stage with her more than tight leather pants and quite phony africanoexotica accent i mean i thought she was rather convincing as storm maybe its the boobs thing that got to them it was sizable uhm but thats not the pointabout character depth well singer couldnt have possibly concentrated on all the characters and expect to pull it off it was smart of him to concentrate on wolverine  possibly the edgiest and most discussed he is the protagonist of the story and the other characters revolve around him their traits are brought out through their interactions with him and mind you singers characterization did keep to the original recipe marsden was pretty credible as the idonttakenostandkeepawayfrommygrrrl leader of the janssen gave jean grey both body and brains but she looked a little old for marsden but i wont chide anyone on that because it just means theyre progressive enough to think its ok  well storm she had those little prickly fringe and her attire screamed look at me body but no one can take away the fact her power was the ultimate coolest god i wish i was one of themrogue didnt really have a name like marie in the original right i think one of the major overhaul from the original was rogue portrayed by anna paquin they added this vulnerability to the character which is perhaps realistic to a certain extent but honestly did rogue ever have such rapport with wolverineoh well i really shouldnt act like a grumpy groupie because this is one of the best comicbased movies all the batman movies dont even come close the plot was commendable and somehow i couldnt think of a better word to describe this movie than cool magnetos power and affliction was mentioned so precisely and poignantly at the start of the show seriously its hard to think of how it could be done in a more tasteful fashionok maybe this show isnt a perfect 10 because they had some corny and cheezy bits that they could do without but it does provide many sharp oneliners mainly from wolverine hugh jackman really carried it off with a tourdeforce performance ok not that fantastic because film critiques will undoubtedly argue that his role doesnt require much however he really slipped into wolverines persona and skin with such comfort and easetalk about skin did anyone miss out mystique honestly need i say more,fantasy
i did enjoy the movie and found that it kept in my opinion to the basics of the comic for what you can do in a movie  i did however have one problem with not the movie but the credits  the movie was filmed in toronto and area however in the credits the following things were not credited  casa loma  which was used for partial interior shots of professor xs school and also mclauglin house which was used for several exterior shots which included the scene of the fountain and when they leave from the grounds in the ship was a shot of the back of the house as for the movie i enjoyed it and have seen it twice  i would recommend it to anyone who likes the comic  however not for young children,fantasy
this is maybe the best cartoonbased movie ever it is the best since batman the special effects are really good the actors are amazing witch is very very rare for these kind of movies we care for the characters and thats why its so good but the amazing screenplay help a lot its like batman with an heart i give it 12 out of ,fantasy
this film could have failed miserably on so many levels like almost each and every costumedcomicherotoliveaction film ever made but it didnt it succeeded marvelously pun intendedi have been disappointed with a lot of movies lately in fact i think the last action picture i was impressed with was blade the only complaint i had was with the actor that played cyclops if there was a weak link in the cast he was it he was not a strong actor and he was way way too young i actually expected logan to irritate me more considering that cyclops has been my favorite since before the beast had hair but in this instance they could have dropped him out of the airplane over the water and i wouldnt have missed himof course the anchor to the film was the same as the anchor to the prof x its hard not to see captain picard when you look at mr stewart but im really glad he was cast in this role way back when this film was just a rumour and we were all doing our fantasy casting patrick stewart was always at the top of everyones listso all in all my total complaints amount to cyclops was a too young jerk storm was too short rogue was a bit too weepy although on a deeper level it works andumoh well i guess thats about it not too bad when thats all thats wrong with a movieoh and thank you to the film makers for all the little inside and semiinside gems such as a nod of the head to the other mutants from other comic titles and even to the original a very nice touch indeed who ever was responsible must actually be a fanso there it is worth every penny i own three movies yes the trilogy and when this one comes out im going to make it fourgo enjoy and dont forget the extra butter on the popcorn,fantasy
so was this movie adaptation of a comic book series going to be a success or just something corny and clich ridden you know what i held reservation on it even after i saw the trailers for it and was greeted with an awesome movie the trailers looked good but the movie was even better is a comic series with many characters and plots but this particular movie dealt with the rescue of rogue anna paquin rogue is a young girl who discovers that shes a mutant and is forced to leave home for fear of being discovered and ostracized she ends up in northern alberta canada where she inadvertently meets and saves the life of a brooding angry man by the name of logan otherwise known as wolverine hugh jackman the two end up at an institute for the gifted run by dr xavier and the story launches into the comic book world of superheroes spawn was another comic series turned movie that left a sour taste in my mouth and left me with a bit of trepidation what made this movie good a good concrete storyline with special effects that enhanced the characters and ultimately the story not a substitute for a story although there were plenty of special effects the movie used it mainly for creating the personalities of the main characters the most popular character was probably wolverine and hugh jackman did not disappoint this is the first time ive seen him in a hollywood movie and he definitely held his own patrick stewart as xavier was the perfect casting as was ian mckellan as magneto both actors have very powerful presences on screen and made it a pleasure to watchthe one thing that i have to say that made this movie a little harder to follow at times was the number of characters there were so many of them that it occasionally spread itself thin in some of the character development department especially with some of the villain characters but im sure that this will change as in the sequels there were enough hints of it overall a great movie,fantasy
the greatest comic book of all time is transformed into a very well made film incredible special effects and a great cast make this a must see film you do not need to be a comic book or fan to enjoy this action packed block buster but you may enjoy it more if you are a fan the film does not have the best acting in the world but action films arent necessarily made for superb acting still there were a few performances worthy of mentioning patrick stewart better known for his star trek the next generation role is one of the better performances in this film he plays professor x the leader of a school for gifted children film veteran ian mckellen turns in the best performance of the bunch he plays the powerful revenge seeking mutant magneto coincidentally both stewart and mckellen are english and about the same age stewart enjoyed a birthday the day before the premiereaustralian born actor hugh jackman has his hands full playing thes principal character wolverine he appears to be a good casting choice despite the fact that the comic version wolverine has a stronger build and has a canadian accent oscar winning actress anna paquin plays the character known as rogue but she suffers from the same problems as wolverine she is supposed to have an accent in her case that of a southern belle but she is observed only a few times actually trying to muster one however aside from the few flaws the film is really sensational you get to see three beautiful and talented ladies halle berry famke janssen and rebecca romijnstamoslook for ray parks particularly entertaining role as the otherwise disgusting mutant called toad the best costume of the bunch would go to tyler manes character sabretooth whom most closely resembles his comic book counterpart halle berrys costume would follow a close secondthe film is about two groups of mutants living in a world were they are not wanted one group focuses there unique individual powers on bettering themselves and one day protecting those who do not trust them the others are revenge seeking mutants and want to wage war on humanity because of their differences it will take mutants against mutants in order to save humanity,fantasy
    2000 usa pg13 104 min directed by bryan singer the usual suspects apt pupil staring hugh jackman patrick stewart ian mckellen and a host of others  the time is now and mutants are being born on earth  most appear human they are human expect for the x factor  the x factor may manifest itself in many ways wolverine is capable of almost instant healing ability xavier reads minds and magneto is a magnet youll have to see the movie or read the comic book to understand all the possible mutations that can or have occurred  but as the movie starts humans the ones without an x factor are preparing to register all mutants  they dont want them teaching in the schools or controlling our minds  people need to know what mutants can do  but to make a movie the mutants are of two camps those that want to live in harmony with nonxers and those who want to use the xfactor to kick some butt  xavier stewart is the bekindtohumans xer and magneto mckellen is the xerswillrule mutant  after a lot of fights some really cool special effects some humor and too few scenes with the nude blue chick the movie ends  not really the producers just want us to go back outside and pay to see ii  i cant wait,fantasy
this movie is so awesome i use to watch the cartoon of i didnt know how the movie would turn out  at first i didnt know what to expect but later on in the movie it got really good the fx in the movie is really cool the acting was excellent and the plot was really excellent i recommend this movie to anyone who likes the cartoon or comics or to anyone who likes a good action movie,fantasy
every once in a while hollywood gets the superhero genre right they did in the first two supes films batman 3 and now here in the i liked most of the performances thought the costuming and characters were played straight and remained true to their source material and felt that director singer respected the genre most of all he had some  to work with and didnt waste a pennyi enjoyed wolverine most of all as seems to be the consensus but will also say that i liked halle berry as storm she didnt have many lines sureand in fact had a real tongue tier in one sceneoh sorrybut you hadda like how they showed ororo in all her lightning bolt hurling gloryrogue and cyclops were good too so were the villains as i stopped reading the in the early 80s i cant say that i remembered mystique or sabretooth that much but the rest i sure did the are a part of our culture its nice to see that bryan singer has done them justicemckellan and stewart were quite good too by the way i agree that stewarts scenes seemed to be a little truncated but what he does have workshopefully the next one will be longer and include likely villains ala the sentinels or into more of the classic charactersbut i agree with some here you dont wanna jam in too many people its hard enough to get the ones already included straight or introed properly to the novice fans out there as it issoi give this one  outta  its good and they should be congratulated for turning in a solid effort which could easily have been really awfulwant proof go see batman 2attack of the rocketlaunching penguins or batman4when ahnold skates gag,fantasy
hmmm i havent been hanging around this site much lately but i must admit some surprise at how highly this film is rated  i mean i thought id have a higher opinion of it than most people because i used to read the comic book which probably gives me a slight prejudice on the matter  well anyway that said is not a bad film but man they could have done a lot more with it i mean here you have a movie thats basically guaranteed a profit yet its only a little longer than an hour and a half  i mean theres not much character development here  for the most part at least wolverine and rogue fans are in luck  however rebecca romijnstamos as mystique has one line and ray park as toad has two  couldnt they do better than that  and tyler mane sabretooth doesnt speak much either  in fact outside of wolverine and rogue professor xavier and magneto are the only characters with much of a personality flat as they might be and yet patrick stewart and ian mckellen seem underused in the parts especially stewart  by the way dont think that means theres lots of action because there isntwhich isnt to say that i didnt like the film  what action scenes it has are fairly good and the plot is passable enough  there simply didnt seem to be much to  when it ends you feel like youve watched the first episode of a new tv series  and you have basically because you can pretty safely bet theyll be at least one sequel  710,fantasy
this movie is just terrific  these characters are so great and here is a movie which really showcases them  my hat is off to bryan singer and tom desanto  i dont know if they read these comics or not but they successfully captured what the are all about  they knew which characters to keep and who to save for later  i certainly hope we get to meet colossus and nightcrawler in the sequel  which should take place in europe so we can meet the aforementioned international mutants and maybe throw in banshee too  my pal martin thomas said it perfectly this is the best superhero movie since superman i,fantasy
since 1995 i waited for this movie to come out and finally it made its way to the big screen  my expectations of this movie were high and i did enjoy every bit of this movie however i do have a few bones to pickfirst of all the movie was way too short  95 mins was the total runtime and yet 23 of the movie was used on developing plot and background  i mean theres really nothing wrong with deeply defining the plot in fact that is good but when your limited to 95 mins then theres a problem there is really only 1 true action seen near the end the statute of liberty scene  and before you know it the movie is over  they should have had at least 1 more action scene that would involve a few melee combats  that would have completed the movie and made it a 9 or 95 instead youll just have to wait for the sequelbut other than that the movie is still entertaining  the effects are awesome and it was well acted very unusual for a comic flick  i wouldnt go as far as to say that there are any oscar deserving performances however some come close  hugh jackman was a great wolverine and anna paquin was adorable as roguei really look forward to the sequels  although i have a gut feeling that it will bomb like most sequels do810 for dont miss it,fantasy
no manner of special effects can make up for a failed story line and uncompeling characters badly overacted and poorly thought out the film relied on stereotypes and created no suspense or sympathy for the characters who are supposed to be the target of hatred on a global scale,fantasy
i finally have seen this one after waiting ages to get to the cinema and i was not disappointed ive read the reviews and i have a few things to sayi there are characters missing in the movie because the film had to be for people unfamiliar with the movie not just the fans too many characters would have been too confusing people would have got lost with whos whoii the character development was small because the movie would have dragged otherwise and besides there are so many characters to develop think about it  wolverine cyclops rouge jean grey professor x magneto sabertooth mystique toad and storm  thats a lot of characters to try and develop in such a small space of timeiii the screenplay wasnt as bad as people make it out to be it was actually kinda impressive given the movie ive said it before and ill say it again a complicated plot doesnt constitute a good movie some movies are just as good without them besides what were you expecting william shakespeareiv its got lots of special effects and sfx but could you really have a movie without them bet the same people complaining it was all special effects and no plot would be the same people that would have been complaining if it had a good story and no special effects i can hear them moaning now where are the special effects etc you just cant please these people everv there were a lot of loose ends because there is so much more to happen the comics have been going for so long hey the cartoon series took about 15 episodes to cover this entire mutant registation thing and who knows how many comics then theres apocolyse the phoenix and sinister etc to go on with theres a lot of stuff to try and tie up this is a 30 plus year amount of stuff were talking about besides in reality if they had have tried to tie up all the loose ends the ending would have been really untidy and clustered and all rushed and it would never have worked unless the movie went for four hoursvi leave the realistic realism stuff alone please yes there are continuity and factual problems let it go please thats why theyre called movies for heavens sake please leave your brains at home and bring your imaginations with you youre spoiling the funvii some people had there minds already made up about this movie and what they would think of it  cheezy comic remake plot holes bad script not doing the film justice and nobody not ever me can convince these arrogant people other wiseno need to mention hugh jackman enough said least nobody is hoeing into himsaint just,fantasy
this is possibly the best movie to come out this summer  i was waiting for it just like everyone else but i was skeptical after seeing mission impossible 2  i had thought they would take out the team aspect of the and focus on wolverine but the movie was put together very well while wolverine played a large part in the plot he wasnt the focus and the entire cast worked together as a teamthe casting was excellent and the special effects were mixed in beautifully  the actors seemed comfortable with their mutant powers and used them very well  the story is well written but i feel that there were some things that didnt follow the comic or the cartoon such as wolverine being a little too soft but that is easily overlooked due to the good chemistry of the whole casti was disappointed in ray parks role in the movie but he portrayed toad very well  the rest of the actors captured their respective characters well and you could feel the tension building between wolverine jean grey and cyclops from the startoverall it was an awesome movie definitely the best one ive seen yet im definitely going to go see it again,fantasy
ok as a casual fan of the comics i knew quite a bit about the characters beforehand i was really excited about the movie yet i was afraid of a batman and robintype failure  fortunately the movie was great  magneto was portrayed not as necessarily evil just as a guy with a different approach to a situation more along the lines of a machiavelli  the friendship that exists between prof x and magneto was not given much background but it was shown that they respected one another in the present based on the past  wolverine was wellplayed i dont know if anyone could have brought wolverine to life as well  stewart and mckellan were both very good and so were the supporting cast  i anxiously await the sequel and i hope bryan singer is behind the camera again 1010,fantasy
when i walked into the cinema the only thing that i was worried about was if i didnt understand the film but this movie was very easy to followthe only problem was when i left the cinema i felt like i hadnt seen the full film things werent wrapped up enough maybe the sequel will continue from the spot i hopeother than that this was an excellent film and i recommend it to anyone,fantasy
ive never read a single bookcomic or watched a single cartoon i thought id take a shot at watching this muchpublicized movie and was pleasantly surprised i never understood my friends obsession with before but im now inclined to start finding out more the only problem i had with the movie was that it was too shortbryan singer was right not to introduce too many characters at once since it obviously worked for newbies such as myself if you know nothing about dont worry youll enjoy the movie all the same,fantasy
i feel the director truly humanized the characters and did an excellent job translating them from the comics to the movie  a very enjoyable movie that rivals even batman  something of a standard for all comic movies to aspire too,fantasy
like a lot of people i know i went into the movie with somewhat low expectations since movies based on comic books have a below average track record  after the movie was over i was recommending it to everyone the next day  im sure there will be some hardcore fans of the comic book who are going to get very nitpicky about certain details but understand theyre trying to make a movie to appeal to everyone and not just the nerds hugh jackman stole the show as wolverine patrick stewart was made for the role of professor charles xavier and sir ian mckellen was superb as magnetoadmittedly i wasnt an or marvel comics fan growing up  i was more into the dc comic heroes superman batman the flash green lantern etc so this was the first time i got to know some of the characters and background of the whole story  what i like about the movie is that it wasnt really an action film although it did have its moments  its more of a story about the mutants and their struggle to live in a world where theyre met with hostility because theyre different from everyone else and the two different ideologies as to how to address it  the films a commentary on how easily we human beings become frightened with what we dont know and how we seem to always address it with intolerance and hostility  the arent superheroes per se  theyre regular human beings who just happen to be mutants and have these extraordinary powers and you cant really think of this as an ordinary good vs evil story from the beginning of the movie we get an idea of what made magneto the man he is today and that hes more complex then your runofthemill movie bad guyalthough the movie wasnt longer like many have said it was tasty but not filling enough and the ending somewhat awkward go out and see it undoubtedly there will be sequels and i hope theyll be just as good if not better than the first  terrific directing effort from the young director bryan singer and i hope whoever makes more comic bookbased movies in the future will refer to this one as the template the guide to how a good one should be made,fantasy
the best thing about x men was that it concentrated more on plot character interactions and development rather than special effects and to much action the action that it did have was classy and understated which was a treat in this day an age if the next movie follows in the same way and doesnt become a cheesey summer flick and get controlled by a studio which would swamp it with teens then it will be good but they have to get bryan singer back he also directed the usual suspects,fantasy
unlike most people who are going to see this film i actually collected comics back in the early 80s still have em so i went to see the movie with some trepidation and a lot of curiosity in sum the action was great but the character development needs workmy biggest disappointment was the absence of kitty pryde who has a tensecondcameo i can only hope shell return in one of the sequels because shes always been my favorite writing dialogue for her would have livened up things considerablytop kudos go to hugh jackmans portrayal of wolverine he was dead on in my opinion you can put an actor in a costume well talons and pray hell growl with sufficient ferocity but jackman takes this tortured character to new heights sardonic mistrustful fierce and under all that hopeful of finding answers wolverines character came to life in a way it couldnt in the comic bookpaquin does an admirable job as rogue her mixture of fear and hope somewhat like wolverines quest for the truth about his past was very compelling im looking forward to seeing her in the sequelsthe other did fine but when action leads over depth youre going to miss out on the personalities and thats what makes this movie somewhat lacking why should we care about cyclops jean grey or storm we the moviegoer not the comic book readers know nothing about their history unlike wolverine and rogue hopefully well learn more about them in the sequelspatrick stewart and mckellan as someone else said were underused as dr xavier stewart is a dead ringer for thes leader and does well but hes absent for much of the last half of the filmany action movie lover will like this film no doubt and the seeds have been sown for a promising series of sequels maybe im asking for a lot but lets hope we get to hear some more promising dialogue and character development,fantasy
x men was surprisingly a quality film though top 250 of all time it is not  hyped up is the term that comes to mind  great special effects true to the original comic book for the most part and some great acting  it was painfully obvious however that a good chuck of the film was setting up for sequels to come a process done less blatantly in the past with such greats as star wars and the god father dont get me wrong it was a very entertaining show with content but for peters sake let the general audience digest the first before stuffing seconds in their face,fantasy
 does right exactly what richard donners superman did right neither film goes for camp quality neither simply tries to put a comic book style movie  bright colors largescale sets  on the screen  while the movie does contain a lot of impressive visuals its doesnt focus on the visuals at the expense of everything elselike superman takes time with its story and develops genuine rather than forced conflict  it isnt simply a matter of heres the villain heres his master plan now the hero fights him  while there is a villain and there is a master plan the actual conflict runs deeper than thatultimately the strength of both superman and lies in the fact that the real focus lies on the characters  just as donner focused more on the relationships between supermanclark kent and lois lane rather than superman vs lex luthor director bryan singer focuses on the interaction between the characters  it works perfectly,fantasy
excellent fx and the characters to execute them  however the way they ran through the movie made it seem like a 90 minute preview  i left the theater with an empty feeling inside i am still wondering when the real movie is coming out,fantasy
generally speaking translating comics into movies results in some real travesties of filmmaking either because the comic itself is pretty silly to begin with or the filmmakers create something totally ridiculous with no regard for the potential of the original material  there are some exceptions however and is one of them it is a fun big splashy intelligent well cast with the notable exception of halle berry  shes just wrong for the part well paced summer blockbuster  ok so this isnt hamlet  but its a damn good adventure movie best one this year since gladiatoreven if you have never heard of the comic i am sure youll get a kick out of this movie  special kudos to the nearly unknown hugh jackman who steals the entire movie as wolverine,fantasy
how come every summer blockbuster has to be plagued with an awful script summer after summer action packed blockbusters get better and better as far as visual effects and sound go and worse and worse in the diologue and realism categoty t2 jurassic park id4 men in black armageddon star wars ep1 that is what i mean those of you reading this have probably seen and those of you who havent know the detailsplot characters etc from reading other reviews so im going to skip that part ill just   tell you why will eventually fall into the same category with id4 and armageddon as of july 26 2000 is in the imdb top 250 and it average vote is about 83 or so when episode 1 came out it was in the top 30 movies of all time and as time passed the majority spoke and realized that it sucked badly the same will happen to so dont be fooled by the good reviews you see oh and while were talking about episode 1 let me just say that jarjar has just been overtaken as most annoying character ever by toadplayed by the same who played darth maulsmall world eh toad is awful toad is worse than awful i can only imagine that singerthe director put this character in to appeal to 5 year olds though im sure most 5 year olds were rolling their eyes too at this corny jackass dancing around like a clown on screen youll know what im talking about when you see it the story is farfetched but fine i have no problem with imagination as long as it is done right and does a good job explaining mutants etc even though it is a pretty ridiculous plot it explains it enough to where you can forget about the problems with it accept that there are mutants and enjoy what they are doing on screen aside from 1 or 2 the characters are fine the story is acceptable and to tell you the truth they set it up well at the end for the imminent sequels but the script is too cliche and actually takes away from what could have been a very good film i wont discourage people from seeing it afterall we sat through basically the same stuff the past few summers and probably will do it again in 01 i know i will see even greater  visuals and i hope that the dialogue and realism stars moving in that direction as well,fantasy
ive watched two special screenings in my home country because the regular showing is on august 16th grrrive never considered as an actionadventure film but a very serious film it is a character developmental movie designed for a trilogy i think bryan singer did a good job for this genre exploring the origins of each character just like in the usual suspects i dont blame this film that wolverine has more past than his fellow its just hes a complexed character hugh nailed the part so what if hes too tall he delivered it well i will surely treasure this film bring on the sentinels gambit beast and psylocke on the sequel,fantasy
hi everyone i reckon that was a real cool movie i like all the characters and their special abilities especially storms shes my favorite i like the lighting strike she did at the train station when they were trying to find rogue i liked rogue and her special but i didnt like the way of the reaction of people she touched festy when wolverine battled mystique that was mad well the last battle i was thinking is that it what finished already that cannot be the final battle and boom the movie finishes and the good guys win without a scratch gee i was like how easy was it for the good guys more mutants better abilities and stuffanyway id rate this movie 86 but since there is no 86 i voted 9 and a movie this rating is worth the watch enjoy,fantasy
wow i went to see for the second time a few days ago and i am planning my 3rd already i myself am very picky about movies though it may not seem so by my comments but this one struck all the right chords it had everything a movie should have and more not to mention wonderful undertones for those familiar with the popular comic book series this is one movie worth seeing more than once and if you havent seen it yet get there you wont regret it extreme kudos to australian hugh jackman in his phenomenal portrayal of wolverine and also to anna paquin patrick stewart ian mckellan james marsden famke janssen halle berry and a great rest of the cast,fantasy
thank you bryan singer thank you  hugh jackman your wolverine was the real deal look forward to seeing more of your work in other areas as well as 2  mckellanstewart top notch rest of the cast handled themselves wonderfully bring on the sequel ill see it three timesman i cant wait for itgot to go see to tide me over again and again and againyeeehaaaaaa     oh yeah by the way i liked the movie later all,fantasy
i saw the top 250 poll has it ranked at like 120 something and thats pretty good considering its company but then i couldnt decide which way it should go was it that good that it should go up further and mix in with some of the truly timeless acts of classic movie making or did it deserve to rest lower amongst the other superfun hollywood summertime fluff that it seems to fit in but was it really fluff or was it the vindication movie of all comic book adaptations with an actual plot and purposeim really wrestling with this onehow can you call a movie with action suits and dick jokes to be that brilliant while at the same time with the undeniable presence of a complex and poignant social commentaries on segregation resistance and acceptance call it popcorn fodderits the feature film equivalent to a monster trampoline doublejump and im still left hangingan interesting twist is that ive never been an fan not to say i never liked them but instead have never been exposed to it usual suspects though has been at the top of my list since the day i saw it for these reasons i have been following the film for some time based and with greater exception placed upon the quality of bryans previous work and not on any hopes of making sure canada was portrayed properlyi had read a few articles prior to viewing and have since seen way to many interviews and have read the original script the more i uncover and the more i ponder this thought i really appreciate bryans own struggle when taking on this project on how to balance the cerebral and the physical elements available in it he could have gone all action and made one whopper of a flick that appeased everyone in the matrix crowd or he could have hammed up the commentary to the point were jim lehrer would have raved about it as the movie of the yearinstead theres a balance a tenuous equilibrium difficult almost on the viewer at how carefully it wants to walk the line but alas i have to concede successfullysure i could have asked for a few more punches and couple more things to blow up near the end and of course i still have questions about the issues it raises half way up the flag but never quite comes clear on but in the end i still felt satisfiedso yes after all this and i do appreciate your patience i liked it i dont recommend anyone to go out and watch it for some kind of life affirming revelation on human interaction not would i tear some teenage angst ridden kid away from one of their violent toys to go get their fill of mayhem but i will tell anyone who wants to see it that i thought it was good and that is really all they should have asked,fantasy
this movie was even better than i suspected it to be if they do make a sequel to it  it would have to be better than this because this was awesome hugh jackman had an amazing performance especially for his first big role and he was so funny too there were some parts that were just so cool but i dont want to give it away so ill just say you should really go see this,fantasy
the whole cast does a great job in their roles wolverine is as irreverent and lovable as he has always been and makes me want to see a movie with him playing an even bigger part in it than he did in this though he was in this movie a great deal  i thoroughly enjoyed it and the whole audience cheered and oohed and ahhed and laughed and enjoyed it as much as i did  go see it ,fantasy
i saw in australia and i thought it was great the movie should of been a bit longer but other than that it was greatnow i am not a die hard fan like some of youi have seen it on tv and read some comic booksbut after reading some of your comments about the movie i just have to say get over itits silly to think that a movie would be the same as the comic book you tell me in the history of movie that a book tv series or comic book are dead on with the movieill give you two examplesi used to read 2000 ad and i did enjoy reading judge dreddso when the movie was coming out i couldnt wait to seebut when i did i was a bit unhappy in it but i got over it second one was forest gumpnow i did read the book and saw the movie and they are not the same so what i am saying isget over it so the movie was not dead on with the comic bookso whatjust to see it made into a movie is just great one last comment the acting was greati did enjoy hugh jackson and anna paquinthey were greatand to all of you who thought she was wrong for the parti just got three words to say to you get over it,fantasy
 is based on the worlds most popular comic book series of the same name created in the early 1960s by marvel comics ultimate team writereditor stan lee and artist jack kirby its premise appeals to the angst of the teenage years showing a world where outcast mutants are shunned by a normal society who fear and hate their special gifts while most adaptations of comics are halfhearted and pathetic bryan singer director of the usual suspects has succeeded in what seemed impossible and produced the ultimate comic book film while not every piece fits the original comic book puzzle the whole matches the same spirit of the stories and characters that made so famousas the main plot of sets in we find ourselves in the near future a strange phenomenon has gripped the planet as a new breed of man has been discovered they are mutants born with a special key in their genes that unlock special powers and abilities one such mutant is professor charles xavier a wise aging man with psychic powers who believes that mutants and humans can live together in harmony opposing this ideology is magneto a survivor of the nazi concentration camps who has sworn to himself that he will never allow such atrocities to occur again born with the power to control and manipulate the magnetic properties of metal magneto has formed a brotherhood of likeminded mutants in order to carry out his schemes and ensure that mutantkind prospersentering this equation are rogue and wolverine rogue is a young girl just uncovering her budding powers simply by touching a persons skin she absorbs their lifeforce sending them into a state of coma the first time she ever kisses a boy he freezes in a death trance scarring her psyche and making her afraid of herself and how she interacts with others she soon meets wolverine also known as logan a hardboiled roughnecked wild man who chomps cigars and pitfights in canadian dives for cash he has the power to heal damage done to his body and even more importantly he can unsheathe a trio of unbreakable claws out of his knuckles deadly living weapons which make him a lethal warriorafter the fantastic atmospheric setup of these characters and their personalities the real plot of the film sets in and never lets up as wolverine and rogue figure into magnetos whims they find themselves under the protection of charles xavier he has created a school for gifted youngsters a safe haven for young mutants and their abilities and a place where they can be taught that even though they are different they do not have to fear themselves or hate what they are along with the school xavier has formed the a group of mutants who have been trained to defend humanity from evil mutants who would use their powers for sinister purposeseverything about the characters and the way they are presented works patrick stewart a classicallytrained shakespearean actor is great as xavier and ian mckellan a englishman with a similar theater background is perfect as the diabolic magneto but the premiere performance here is australian unknown hugh jackman as wolverine himself who captures the character of logan in every way hes gritty and dark but he retains the same soft spot for the women in his life that the comic hero himself has this is a careermaking performance from jackman and its amazing that he like the rest of the cast perfects these fourcolor heroes so wellthe supporting cast is made up of the rest of the team and magnetos brotherhood the brotherhood itself is more of the talk less do more variety being given little lines but starring in all of the big action scenes tyler mane a former wrestler growls and howls his way through sabretooth a feral warrior with super strength and ray park a veteran stuntman late off sleepy hollow and phantom menace is a showstopper as toad an athletic beast with a long tongue and amazing agility the most interesting of the three brotherhood members is rebecca romijnstamos as mystique a blueskinned beauty with bright yellow eyes martial arts skills and the power to shapeshift into other formsthe themselves include cyclops who can fires beams of plasma from his eyes played by james marsden hes cocky and brash but stuckup and bossy typical for the team leader his fiancee is jean grey a telepathic doctor played by the gorgeous jean grey a love triangle of sorts becomes apparent between cyclops jean and wolverine another comic book mainstay which is nailed by this movie adaptation the odd character out here is halle berry as storm a woman who can create and control the weather berry is serviceable but shes a weak version of the regal beauty known to comic fansbryan singer controls skillfully and with passion its cold and gray somber and understated a sense of loneliness and silence hangs over every scene drawing us deeper into the world of these characters even when they use their amazing powers the special effects never conquer the film the action pieces themselves which show us these powers are strong and fast but their only weakness is that theyre simply too short when storm calls a bolt of lightning or wolverine and mystique go tooth and nail were left wanting much more than what we are giventhe plot formed by magneto might be a little hard to swallow and the dialogue might skip the occasional beat but for the most part everything is as it should be the direction and editing are excellent the performances are great and the effects are fantastic this is the one comic fans have been waiting for receives a 95 out of 10,fantasy
okay was a good movie not a great movie but a good one im glad that i saw it in the theatre for the special effects but i dont think it would have killed me to see it on home video so its up to you whether you want to spend 10 or 250 you wont be losing much if you wait for the videoi have a couple of problems with the movie one is the lack of character development the entire screenplay seems to be written assuming that youve read the comics and already know about all the characters and are going to get all the inside jokes like the joke about wolverines costume in the comic book seriescartoon and some things the romance between wolverine and jean grey are pushed ahead at unbelievable speeds apparently all the good stuff happened when they werent on screentwo i hate to point this out to bryan singer but when its winter in canada im referring to the scenes in alberta its winter in the united states too sorry its not like australia the usas summer is not our winter and chances are if we have snow theyre going to also i just couldnt believe a continuity error like that talk about perpetuating the myth that its always cold in canadaanyway aside from those two little things if you can call no character development little its a pretty decent movie however for a better idea of whats going on i recommend either reading some of the comic books or watching the cartoon before you see itoh yeah and whatever happened to jubilee and gambit not to mention liberties taken with various other characters,fantasy
i thought this movie was a lot better than i thought it would be although i am not a fan of the comic so i had no idea what to expect hugh jackman did a great job acting as a vicious animal and then a fatherly caring man his oneliners were also hilarious the ideas used in this movie were very original and the special effects were great the conflict between 2 characters over a love interest was very humorous i thought the characters were developed well and the costumes and sets were great this movie is a great one to see with everyone,fantasy
 definitely delivered in the action and special effects departments the acting makeup and cinematography were all excellent as well in that sense it was a great moviehowever the thing that i really had a problem with was the fact that there were a few holes left in the plot that could very easily have been prevented for example from what financial base did dr xavier start this spectacular school for mutants clearly it would require a huge amount of money just to build the big round room alone and even more than that is it just me or does it seem very unlikely that every mutant with these amazing powers somehow winds up in this school and not in some secret government institution somewhere is it a coincidence that the only people who ever witness these peoples powers are the people who just want to turn them over to this school and not to the scientific community to see how they work not likely and what about those powers themselves the narration at the beginning of the film talks about how these mutants have skipped a step in evolution so that their genetic structure is in various ways superior to that of the rest of the human race thats great but does the ability to shoot lasers out of your eyes or even more the ability to walk through walls have anything to do with your dna i dont think so it doesnt seem that there was a lot of thought put into these aspects of the film and it really bothers me when the filmmakers do things like thatoverall was a very good film and it is definitely worth seeing but only as a special effects and action extravaganza it seems to be aimed mostly at younger male audiences because of the absence of a solid amorous subplot and also because of mystiques outfit  besides all that at least a basic knowledge of the comics which i personally dont have im into movies not comic books would probably be beneficial in understanding the story a little bit better if you havent seen go out and check it out but if you arent impressed by films that are pulled along almost entirely by their computer generated images and explosions you might want to skip this one,fantasy
it was a really good movie very entertaining and i didnt even want the movie to end  i also liked wolverine he was very cute and acted good i cant believe there was some other actor who was to play wolverine but dropped out thank goodness hes stupid because if he wasnt we wouldnt know that beautiful australian dude hugh jackmani give the movie 10 out of 10 bye bye,fantasy
first of all i have to make a confession i never watched the cartoons as a kid prior to this movie i was absolutely clueless about every aspect of the mythology in fact the only reason i had any interest at all in this movie was the fact that it was directed by bryan singer who also directed the usual suspects which in my opinion is one of the best movies of modern times unfortunately upon leaving the theatre all i felt was frustration sure the movie was beautifully made the sets the costuming the special effects and the direction were all topquality but all i could think about was the amount of holes in the script had the screenwriter spent more time on character development this could be a truly great scifi film this years answer to the matrix but i couldnt keep from wondering throughout the movie what happened to the little things where was the chemistry between cyclops and jean grey where was the explanation of everyones whereabouts origins etc if only the screenwriter had been more thorough after all the little things are what make a movie great and as for the cliffhanger ending obviously designed for a sequel it tied up no loose ends whatsoever it was almost as if they were in a rush and forgot to film the last few pages of the script in defense of the ending a good friend of mine who loved the movie told me it left me wanting more wellthe ending left me wanting more too only not in the form of another sequel it left me wanting more detail more chemistry and more explanation it absolutely kills me to see a movie with such potential sink because the screenwriter sacrificed the character relationships because audiences might think it was boring,fantasy
i really liked its the first film of the summer which ive seen more than once and i still havent been bored with it its full of action yes but deep down it is more concerned with characterization the action scenes in the film are few and far between and most of the characters arent fully explored but the dvd will probably clear that up with cut footage as far as the plot goes it isnt anything to write home about but it doesnt matter its just a clothesline for some great visuals and scenes acting isnt great across the boardonly a few stand out from others let me start by naming my least favorite performancesjames marsden and halle berryshe gets saddled with the worst line of the film everybody else works fine but there are three performances that stand out in my opinion first hugh jackman has the starmaking role of wolverine and he is great in the role and has some of the best oneliners in the film yes the movie has a sense of humor plus he is backed up with major energy and charisma i see big things for him in the future second is there anything the great ian mckellan cant do in terms of acting hes superb as the villain magneto plus he has a legitimate back story for why he is bent on performing his evil deed finally the best performance in my opinion comes from anna paquin the little oscarwinner from the piano now all grown up and suddenly very lovely its a tender and touching portrayalwhat would you do if you had to spend the rest of your life without human contact due to mutant powers she has great chemistry with jackman and has several wonderful scenes the one im thinking of is the quietly performed but still heartbreaking train scene between her and jackman as her tears spill silently down her cheeks i never liked her and still dont like it performance in the piano and i feel she didnt deserve the oscarshe was simply too grating to me at least however look at what a couple of years has done to her actingshes given more and more solid performances and with this one proves that she can at least now back that oscar up finally this is a summer movie that at least has a message in itit deals with prejudice and fear of those who are different from the rest of us great popcorn entertainment mixed with solid filmmaking make this a mustseegrade b,fantasy
what a great film after years of problems the have finally made it to the screen and it appears the delay was worth it the special effects are top notch with one or two exceptions bryan singers direction is quite confident considering this is his first action film scifi film special effects film and it transcends all of those genres it is a very palatable and gentle lesson in how easy it is to become frightened of what you dont understand and how bias and intolerance can become infectious the opening scene alone is worth the price of admission haunting tragic and infuriating fear not people even if you have no idea who the are or what they are about if you are looking for some great entertainment fantasy rooted in reality and characters that are immediate classics go see,fantasy
minor spoilersi saw this film in melbourne with about 850 other xfans at a public preview id estimate that about 800 of them had huge smiles on their faces at the endthis is a very classy very tight and wonderfully put together film as a film on its own its right up there with the best of 2000 as a comic book film its the best ive ever seeni loved batman and i loved superman but has something these lacked a special heart to it that stays with you and pulls you into its world it has that rare quality in a fantasy movie a soul this is a film that you wont forget as soon as you leave the cinemathe story deals with the rise of genetic mutations in our modern world where children are born with special powers they realise when they reach puberty their inability to deal with their powers leads professor xavier patrick stewart himself a mutant with telepathic powers to fund a special school where they can learn to integrate themselves into a fearful and prejudiced society which will not accept themone of xaviers old friends another mutant known as magneto ian mckellen because of his ability to bend metal takes a different view magneto believes that society will never accept mutants and is out to declare war on those who have persecuted him his plan is to sabotage the group of world leaders in new york who have gathered to formulate a global policy on mutants and thereby force a showdown with those who fear his kindinto this world walks rogue anna paquin a teenage mutant who discovers she can absorb other peoples energies and thereby threaten their lives just by touching them running away from home she encounters logan hugh jackman in a bar in the canadian winter logan is also a mutant a feral loner with vicious claws and super healing powers but a mysterious past with a horrific secret eventually without giving anything away they join xaviers team and are drawn into the battle against magneto and his allies both logan and rogue play crucial roles as they try to stop magneto before he succeedsthe story is simply told but is never patronising nor tries to excuse itself with cheesy selfparody a common trick in science fiction or comic films these days bryan singer director the usual suspects takes his film very seriously but is never pretentious the film contains quite a few laughs and some very good lines most of them from loganwolverine is not like the matrix the team wear black leather costumes but the resemblance ends there is less hyperreal more gritty and more relevant the themes are those of prejudice fear of what you dont understand alienation and the courage it takes to be yourself if you are an outcasthugh jackmans performance is brilliant almost worth the price of admission itself he completely inhabits the inner skin of logan the character is superbly written for the screen hes funny hes angry in your face hes sarcastic but he has integrity honesty and his own set of rules which he lives by logan is the audiences eyes into the xworld and hugh has him down to a t characterisation raised to the level of an art form for me hes one of the best comic characters ever to make it to celluloid and i dont remember a better performance by a lead character in this genreian mckellen magneto is also magnificent great delivery wonderfully imposing presence and not horribly overplayed or hyperevil he just has a different agenda patrick stewart is suave controlled and a humanitarian the perfect prof xanna paquins rogue is sensitive lost so why is this happening to me her scenes with logan are beautifully crafted and the chemistry between them is very touching women will love it guys well you might toofamke janssen is also very convincing as jean grey an intelligent sexy and mature woman whom cyclops is very lucky to have as his girl james marsden is fine as cyclops a young man trying to live up to the ideals of his mentor and finding leadership can be a burden at times rebecca romijnstamos is an eyecatching bad girl shapeshifter mystique all blue with painted scales the makeup is amazingthe visual effects are very tight well crafted and are absorbed into the story without detracting from it bryan singers touch is light and it works wellthe mix of humour and drama is cleverly balanced and never jars there are also some very moving scenes particularly at the beginning and the flashback sequences involving logans past which are quite disturbing some countries will probably give a more restricted rating not necessarily because of any gore or violence but because of the overall impact of some of these scenesoverall i give this an 8 out of 10 its exciting its dramatic its funny im going back friday to see it again and probably on the weekend as well bryan singer youre the man,fantasy
i saw yesterday and i throughly enjoyed the plot as well as the special effects despite what i have heard from others i think that the actors did a great job the end is set up for hopefully another movie which i know many new and old fans would go to see it has the best visualsound effects i have seen besides star wars and has made me a new fan of the,fantasy
this movie was thoroughly enjoyable if a bit too short  hugh jackman was excellent as wolverine as everyone else has noticed but i was most impressed with sir ian mckellen as magneto  lotr fans who are anxious to see his portrayal of gandalf must be encouragedelsewhere i thought marsden was channelling the spirit of cary elwes which isnt necessarily a bad thing eg the princess bride  dr jean grey i dont want to embarrass myself by misspelling ms famkes last name was fine on many different levels and i was impressed by anna paquin  she is quite a young actresspatrick stewart was terrific as always and i think he and sir ian lent this film its gravitasthe script was efficient and the director did a fine job of meshing the live action with the pretty good special effects  heres hoping that the next time the studio green lights a bigger budget for a longer film and more eyepopping sfx,fantasy
if you have ever found yourself wondering what it would be like to have superhuman powers you have to see this movie it was made to appeal to a wider audience not just 8year old kids who collect the comic books when i first walked into the theater i was skeptical but i soon found myself enjoying this fantasy movie i will see this film again and probably buy it when the time comes,fantasy
at the tragic final act of la boheme lovesmitten tenor rodolfo sings your tiny hand is frozen to starvingbutstillsingingloudly soprano mimi when the role of mimi is assayed by a sveltefree diva such as montserrat caballe this scene bids fair to being operas most fallingdown funny moment but in fact it works  it works because a caballe can hit the notes and b its opera dammit  its supposed to be overthetop the movie is based on the marvel comic book and happily for us comic books are also expected to be overthetop  the only thing we need be concerned about is whether the movie hits the notes  and does it you betcha is precisely what weve come to expect from a summer movie  its straightforward and not particularly nuanced but who needs nuance when you can have big fat explosions and really good looking people in leather the movies design is outstanding dark and foreboding it harks back to the frank millers batman and the granddaddy of dystopia films metropolis and of course the movie has fabulous special effects and great fight scenesto be perfectly honest knowing that the story takes place in a comicbook universe didnt stop me from asking the tough questions  did charles xavier get the proper building permits for the better parts of the school for gifted students  who built the xjet boeing or lockheed and is the neighborhood zoned for stealth  is there a sweatshop somewhere that does nothing but turn out superhero uniforms  and most importantly are those suits dry clean or fine washablebased on the worlds most popular comic book the movie has a builtin audience of people who have faithfully followed the xadventures for over 30 years and who are not going to tolerate much deviation from the canon  i try to avoid those people  i went to see the film because i really wanted to hear mature hunk patrick stewart say eeville  this does not mean i didnt know the movie would succeed or fail based on the performance of the unknown playing wolverine  the may be a team but lets face itthe rest of the bunch are wolfies backup singers  its no accident that the movie and the latest harry potter book are selling like proverbial hotcakesboth are stories about outsiders with the mutants edging out the wizards in the spiffy threads department wolverine is harry potters evil twin  in short he is the comic book character i would least like to have at my dinner party but most like to boink  so lets get down to brass tacks  does newcomer hugh jackman hit the noteswoofand now id like to digress for a moment to rhapsodize about 2000 being the year of the antipodean guy  from jackman to crowe to the rapidly wrinkling gibson theyre all over the place reeking of testosterone and raising the drool bar to olympian heights  and contrary to the stereotype they appear to be perfectly capable of handling verbs  i tell you its an exciting time for the intelligent moviegoing femalethe rest of the cast is perfectly on pitch too  who cannot enjoy plummyvoiced master thespians stewart and mckellan duking it out for the bestpronounced vowel award  i suspect that the males in the audience will appreciate the talents of berry janssen and the very blue romijnstamos almost as much as i appreciated jackmans  the villains are appropriately villainous with ray park who is carving out a career for himself as the most unrecognizable actor to kick serious cinematic butt winning my personal badguy laurels as the toadso drop that henry james novel and rush right off to see the movie i suggest copious amounts of butter for your popcorn and perhaps an entire box of milk duds  if youre male youre going to be hearing some mighty pathetic whimpering coming from your date starting the moment jackman hits the screen  just ignore it,fantasy
the special effects were amazing and the movie was exciting from beginning to end but i never found out what these mutants were all fighting fortheres obviously a lot going on beneath the surface between professor x and magneto  this is the central conflict in the original comic books but this movie chooses not to delve in there at all  instead it sticks with its laser blasts and shapeshifting  there is a brief attempt to convince us to sympathize with wolverine but that ends up being too rushed and too shrouded in mystery to make any sense to anybodywith its arsenal of fine actors couldve paused a second to let someone say something meaningful  i dont think i was allowed to blink for the full 104 minutes  visually stunning and very entertaining but it could have been more of a movie and less of a laserlight showhopefully theyre planning to follow in the footsteps to make x2judgment day  well you get my drift,fantasy
a fine movie if it had contained the richness of 30 years of comic book magic and soap opera subplot this movie lacked the power and richness that only the comic book heck the cartoon could purveythe mutant women were made small and ineffective their powers and bodies overshadowed by the mutant men marvel women are known for their voluptuous stature and strong loud voices  these woman were quiet they took rogue a tall robust struggling poverty class southern bell with a heavy sensuous drawl and transmuted her into a middleclass teeny bopperwolvie got all the lines and it seemed this movie was made to drown out the actors with little talent by giving the ones with talent jackman stewart mckellan all the lines even the special effects were limited to some very artful scenes which contained those that were best suited for martial artist actors  halle berry got left behind it all for obvious reasons like a puffy cloud of silence with frosted lips  i was upset by the shallow hollywood treatment of a storyline which could have made a longer movie with lots of marvelstyle flashbacks and mundane comedy creating a legacy for sequels to comebring back gambit he is wolverines comedic foil and vice versa  modernize the costumes and design all you want but leave the writing to stan lee,fantasy
although i hadnt really been planning to go see this movie im glad i ended up going i was very impressed the special effects casting acting and screenplay were all excellent it had just the right amount of humor not very much  it didnt have to resort to endless cheezy oneliners to keep it going halle berrys storm character could have been put to use better  she didnt do enough akicking made for good eye candy though all in all an excellent movie 910,fantasy
of all the things posted by others i dont completely understand is the way that they complain about iceman being too young with all due respect to them bobby was only about 16 when he joined the original 5 in the comics and was the youngest one i honestly think that he wasnt used enough and i really really wanna see more of him in the sequels i understand how they may be mad as scott and jean both members of the beginning 5 as well were much older but the way bobby is meant to be in the movie is actually quite dead on i think it would have been great to see him go save rouge with the core team they already had 1 person who didnt know what to do what would another one do also scott and ororo were not done justice in this film but that leaves more off for the sequels and thats what i want sequels910,fantasy
to be completely truthful i though this movie was going to be lousy i mean really lousy i saw the preview and thought oh boy another cheesy comic to film adaptation i had no intentions on seeing it but decided to give it a shot because i loved the comics and had already seen everything else im happy to say that i was very pleasently surprised really stays true to the comics with well developed characters that act like they did in the comics the casting was good in that aspect but i though everyone except xavior and magneto looked too young in the comics storm is supposed to be a very old woman but she was cast with halle berry who is in her early 30s but this is only a small let downthe effects are wonderful big exciting and flashy if you can i would definatly recommend seeing this film in a thx certified theater as it really adds to the sound qualitythe plot is good making it feel like a long comic very satisfyingmy biggest complaint was the absence of my favorite of all the gambit whos idea was it to leave him out that guy really kicked some serious ass also i though it was too compact they should have extended it into a 2 hour movieall in all it was a very nice change from all the poorly made comic to film adaptations i give it a 7 out of 10,fantasy
 is in my opinion perhaps the best comicbook movie that i have ever seen it is in the same rank as batman the crow and blade bryan singer has once again directed an excellent movie patrick stewart and ian mckellan portray the friendfoe relationship between xavier and magneto brilliantly though it is somewhat subdued almost everything in the movie is which is the one bad point in the movie the 2 hour time period isnt enough to do a really good job of characterization hugh jackman does a good wolverine anna paquin does a great job of looking really scaredthe other actors deliver good performances as well but like i said they wasnt enough time to give to all of themthe action sequences are state of the art the dialogue is nicely done the jibes between cyclops and logan are priceless and i loved the cameos from various otherin any case this was a great movie i cant wait for the sequel and there will be one,fantasy
i found this movie enjoyablesomewhat more than the comicsorryfans the casting was phenonomalhugh jackmanray park and patrick stewartamong otherswere the characters they playedi wish toad had more lineshes my second favoritei dont think i have to tell whos the firstsniktalthough im not exactly a reader of the comicim sure that many injokes flew over my headi think it has quite an interesting concept a comic that has deep meanings and concepts with enough fluff value to keep dimwitted teenagers like me interestedinsert insipid smiley icon herein my opiniona mustseeto the general populacea donthavetobutperferableifyoudidsee,fantasy
i had no idea how this film would be but director bryan singer did a great jobthe special effects were fantastic and there was a basic storylinebringing comic books to life is a difficult task but singer managed to pull it offits really pure entertainment for your money,fantasy
the film shines like a star with great acting all members of the cast especialy patrick stewart dazzeling fx good storyline and a message never judge anyone whoes different as i said before everyone in the cast did a good job but my favorite though is ray park as toad somehow he was particuly entertaining and i found mystique oddly attractive i recondmend this movie to anyone who is a comicmovie fan fan or a scifi movie buff,fantasy
fox demanded more editing to be able to have an additional daily showing in theaters thus much in the way of character explanations and development is on the editing rooms floorgreed hurt this movie which couldve been better its obvious they intend to make sequels if the original movie was shown as the directed there would be a larger demand for a sequel although with the first weeks revenue it appears a sequel is likely,fantasy
i watched the cartoon many years ago and ive always been a little nervous about making a full version movie from a cartoon or video game but this was done quite well though several characters were left out the cast stayed true to the comic and cartoon and of course only patrick stewart could play prof xthe other point to make is hugh jackman he did a remarkable job as wolverinelogan this part was originally supposed to go to dougray scott but jackman was cast instead and pulled it off i just dont think a skinny scottsman like dougray couldve done the same job jackman played wolverinelogan with perfect ruthlessness and anger and added some mysterious je ne cest quoi that made you think about even after the movie was over is a fun summer flick with great special effects that isnt very deep or disturbing like so many recent movies i cant wait for the second one,fantasy
i used to watch the animated show  loved that  i used to think it would make a great movie  it did  i saw it opening day  am going to see it again  its a winner in my book if you like action check it out,fantasy
this was such a great movie one of the coolest movies of the summer and one of the only movies that i was actually looking forward to this summer the other is godzilla the one thing it was lacking was a good soundtrack where was the theme song anyway it was very entertainingalso im glad that canada was fairly portraited in this movie coming from canada myself i can tell you this is exactly what our country is like right down to the plaid shirts i am glad that everyone will now be able to see our country as what it really is instead of just as a big cold neighbour to the us75  10,fantasy
this movie rocked it had a combonation of humor and action when i first heard about i thought it would be smashed up and downed by the critics but then i read the reviews they all said was awesome so i went and saw it in a word i was amazed the only bad part about it was that most of the bad guys didnt have much to say and in the end when wolverine is going to that old military base in canada they could of wasted 30 minutes explaining how wolverine became a mutant but all in all i give it a 10 out of 10,fantasy
even though three of my best friends are xsuperfans i somehow must have missed the craze i really liked the movie though i wondered where the other were like gambit or beast yeah i know theyre doing a sequel but still i also think that toad was horribly underused ray park has an awesome fighting ability and they really didnt let him shine magneto and professor x are wonderfully castgo see it,fantasy
im so glad that i finally saw a movie this summer that didnt dissappoint me when i saw the previews for this one i had my doubts first of all it was pg13 i was hoping for an r rating and second i know how corny the story could of been but they did everything they could to keep the cornyness at bay wolverine was extremely cool in this movie and the underlying plot about being different and being feared for it made the movie all the more interesting  special effects were good and the cast was greatexcept storm wasnt that cool ending was kindof lackluster but overall a great summer action movie hear is to at least 2 more sequels 810,fantasy
this movie was even better than i expected and my two daughters who watched it separately also agree  i really felt that some of my favorite heroes had come to life  i knew dr x would be right on target and was pleasantly surprised that magneto and all the others except rogue were also right on target rogues character was changed to fit the new story line and it worked instead of the outlaw mutant overwhelmed by new powers she became the ingenue and replaced kitty pryde as wolverines junior partner although i was spending some of the time analyzing the movie and the characters most of the time i was transported to a different world judging by the audience reaction even the skeptics got involved with the story and action  i want to see this in the theater again and look forward to owning it on video,fantasy
 was a rather excellent movie  it was all that i expected it to be and i was rather pleased  some may say that the character development was low and i must agree  but they pulled it off  i believe a person going to the movie who doesnt know the first thing about will come out with a rather good understandingfirst of all i would like to say that the choosing of patrick stewart as charles xavier was about the best thing they could do  he fits the criteria for the prof to a tat first i had my doubts about the abilities of the other unknown characters but after seeing the movie i realized that actorsactresses have to have a start somewhere  well i must say these people started out with a banghugh jackman was simply awesome  his portrayal of wolverine was beyond comparison  but i must add my comments may be onesided due to the fact that wolverine is my favorite of thei am a diehard star wars fan but i had to rate this as a 10 because it is simply and excellent movie if you havent seen it yet then i say make this your next movie  you wont be disappointedthank you for your timet,fantasy
let me begin by saying that this movie is almost worth seeing just for hugh jackmans performance of wolverinehe did an excellent job well im not a reader of comic books anymore but ive seen the animated series  or at least he did an entertaining jobpatrick stewart did a great job also  as did every cast member basicallythe story has some good action a pretty interesting plot great humor and also compelling loveinterest i wont say between whom making for a wellbalanced moviethe characters seemed real  as did the movie overall  despite this however i can only give the movie a betterthanaverage not excellent rating  i guess because its hard to take a movie based on a comic book very seriouslystill i think theres little they could have done to make this movie betterexcept maybe make it longer is definately worth seeing  it presents itself in a very realistic manner with the right touch of seriousness and humor to make for probably one of the better movies of this yearyup the movie has a great message710,fantasy
well not really but a disappointment nevertheless the films dialog was absolutely pitiful you know what happens when lightning strikes a toad same as anything else and the undignified promotion of its own sequel during the last 10 minutes was embarrassing great cast but stewart and mckellan were criminally misused janssen was pretty good as per usual berry sucked paquin was excellent the ending was silly and pretty unexciting when magneto put that hulking dumba solely in charge of keeping him safe from the i felt as if the last vestiges of excitement had evaporated so in summary style without substance a la mummy and a shameless sequel plug a la back to the future ii annoyed me but damn it i like scifi even when its irritating 6 ex 10,fantasy
a lot of credit is due to bryan singerwhen the became the most popular comic book in the 80s it did so through the balance of teamwork and amazing characters many of which had complicated tormented backgrounds any movie adaptation which didnt capture these elements would have been an abject failure of interpretation singer being able to make compelling wolverines and rogues story the tension between loganscottjean and demonstrate the team play is a big part of making this a good movie for those outside of the geekfanboy crowdits a shame then that the dialogue wasnt particularly interesting and that delivery of oneliners during the fight scenes was disappointingahhh high wit was never thes strong point they caught the look and feel and that is good,fantasy
x men rocked all over the big screen the characters were wonderfully played and it didnt fall victim to the campy comic book movie genre a great film wolverine rocked the house and it was nice to see patrick stewart on the big screen as someone other than capt jean luc picard ian mckellen rocked too the special effects were awesome i cant say enough about this movie,fantasy
having been a fan of the x for years and awaiting this film since forever i am more than content with it  it blew me away and even though there were some flaws in the story line and characters it all pulled together to make an astounding scifi flick that made me remember the good old days of staying up late and reading the latest of the talesi will definately be waiting for a sequel and who knows maybe they will bring back the generation x television series,fantasy
of all of the possibilities growing up i chose over superman and batman because of the deeper meaning superman is about being an outsider and fitting in batman is about doing whats right is showing you that being different isnt bad this movie holds true to the comic series in most respects in the comic book they never reveal a last name for magneto also i think anna paquin is a bit young to be playing rogue someone a little older than her would have done well too hugh jackman is a perfect realization of what wolveriene is and he plays him like he was born to the rest of the cast fit their roles but not as well as him this movie is terrific and even the cameos done by hopefully in future movies iceman shadowcat pyro colossus cannonball and jubilee are great i even believe i saw nightcrawler before he became weird looking i only wish that gambit was in this movie casting suggestion ryan phillippe i think he could pull off a cajun accent well and he could fit the part easilyso sit back and enjoy the best eight bucks youll ever spend,fantasy
one of the more wonderful themes in this movie which closely parallels the comic book premise is the invidious loathing that socalled normal people have towards those who are different an immediate sense of the hearings held by former california state senator john briggs about homosexuals teaching in schools was quickly brought to mind in the appearance of jean grey famke janssen before senator kellys bruce davidson committee additionally when sen davidson is converted it again reinforced the image of irrational fear that so many heterosexuals have about the glbt community they both envy the gifts of the minority and at the same time loathe them for having something that they fear will never be theirs freedom,fantasy
i liked it and i think even people who arent fans of the comic will like it possibly even better than us fans  see my cons listpros  the special effects were very well done i was impressed especially since i thought the fx were going to be cheesy and lame my main concern was with wolverines claws and i have to say they rockedthe storyplot was solid not the best story to come out of hollywood but i liked it especially so because you didnt have to know anything about the comic or the characters to follow alonggood humor in appropriate spots good action they didnt overuse the special effects and had no need to use effects to cover for a weak plotstory see abovecons these dont overly affect those of you who arent fans  ok im a fan of the comic not hugely but i know most of the characters and i just have to say they did a crappy job of casting rogue for those of you who dont know the comic consider yourself fortunate along the same lines i think storm could have been cast better and had a better hair job but she was ok on a pro side i think the rest of the casting was done well especially wolverine though he could have beefed up just slightly more and add some more chest hairi would have liked to have seen some backgroundhistory scenes for cyclops and storm though i know storms would have taken too much movie time still i think they could have at least squeezed in cyclops  maybe theyll get into these in the sequelgive magneto some better clothescostume yeesh i grudgingly could accept the batmanlike rubber suits they gave the but magneto didnt even have decent normal clothes he looks like a total dork except for one scene where i remember him having a kinda cool red metallic looking shirt at least they gave a decent explanation for the helmetbottom line worth your 78 if you like actionhero movies especially those that dont depend on blowing up 95 of the set but actually rely more on a plotstory ,fantasy
i was dragging my feet rolling my eyes and dreading this moviemy friends were pushing me into the theater  and surprisingly it was quite enjoyablepatrick stewart is of course the only possible choice for xavier  even though his part is comparatively small he still commands every moment hes on the screen  his scenes against ian mckellan were absolutely brillianthugh jackman was excellent as wolverine but way too tall  wolvie is always supposed to be the little psycho  famke janssen was surprisingly good as jean grey but underused  james marsden was adequate but bland as cyclops  anna paquin was quite nice as rogue  but halle berryplease goddess if you love me get thandie newton or vanessa williams in the role next time  berry was terrible  awful horrible ugsomei was struck by how faithful the characterizations were  wolverine and cyclops butted heads quite a bit during logans early days with the team and the cyclopsjeanwolverine triangle was a major part of it  some other things however didnt work  the toad for example was way more powerful in this flick than he should have been  and why didnt we get a taste of storms claustrophobia in the elevator granted it saved us watching berry try to actall in all a decent flick  i might actually see the sequel,fantasy
i havent read a comic book in 10 years but i did see a few eps of the cartoon tv show that was so popular 45 years ago i was surprised then at how serious that cartoon was and that it was in serial form with each episode building on past episodes pretty adult stuff for a tv cartoonthat is the same way i felt after seeing the movie it was dark serious there were maybe two laughs including one big one and  best of all  interesting i expected the movie to end up somehow kiddiefied with lots of things that made little sense and many cheap laughs and stupid oneliners boy was i surprised looks like a terrific start to a movie franchise the characters were all believeable well they are mutants so you have to buy into the premise the technology was interesting and not too futuristic the actors ranged from excellent patrick stewart and ian mckellen and the guy who played wolverine did a great job too to passable halle barry sabertooth some characters didnt say much toad mystique the plot made sense mostly we only nitpicked a few things afterwardthe core of the movie which sets up the good and bad sides is believable and thoughtprovoking how would our society react if we found that certain individuals were genetically different and had exceptional powers would we embrace them or lock them up i hope the movies keep up what this first one started i would love to have seen the additional 45 minutes that were supposedly cut from the movie the information was interesting enough to support showing it if i have one criticism it is that the movie was a bit slow in the first 45 minutes because the characters had to be set up and brought in but that was a price i was willing to paycheck out it is better than you think it will be,fantasy
so many factors go into whether one likes a movie or not and some dont have anything to do with the movie in this case the audience i happened to be with made all the difference they clapped and cheered and made a few cheesy lines sound suddenly deep and that helped me alot not that the movie wasnt good on its own it was great faithful to the themes of the comic and full of clever action but since i liked it i will focus on my few criticisms ok comic plots are often cheesy but i dont remember any plots being as simplistic and undirected as the one surrounding magnetos plan turn humans into mutants with a white glowing field of energy please couldnt we come up with something a little more credible i dont it needed to be a save the world plot especially when the rest of the movie seemed so much an introduction to the characters i think maybe a cooler plotline would be him going to sink some nuclear submarines which really happened in the comic and was always a real keystone memory for magneto anyways what else oh halle berry sucked big time sorry but its true oh and too many things were covered in too little time i thought the movie couldve been a lot longer but maybe younger people would have gotten restless who knows i thought the first part of the movie was the best introducing magneto and wolverine and stuff but once the it became a lets stop magneto and bad guys et al from shooting their giant white ray it fell apart a bit anyways wolverine was awesome and so were magneto and prof x in fact everyone was real good except for storm maybe shell die early in the sequelno i doubt it anyways bravo over all 810,fantasy
i think this movie was awesome i am the sickest x men fan and i know everything about the comic tv series and now the movie i have seen it twice in two weeks and plan on seeing it again most movies based on comics turn out horribly inaccurate this was fairly accurate also most movies based on comics suck this and blade were some major exceptions i am looking forward to the sequel,fantasy
 almost did it  it started out perfectly but then it failed to reach what it needed to reach for fans and nonfans  most likely because it was thinking more about making sequels then making the best first movie that could be madeive been a fan of the comic book for awhile and i know of the potential great story telling that if done right can even be considered for oscars and golden globes  the potential was not reached in the movie what did not work especially was magnetos plan to turn the world leaders into mutants  it was uncharacteristic for the type of character who whole heartedly hates humans why would you invest your powers in people you hate  from a fans point of view its just something magneto wouldnt do from a nonfan view point its just stupid  and the fact the the philosophies of both xavier and magneto wasnt heavily explored upon cause a lack of great dialogue  as great as it was to hear wolverine call cyclops a dck  i would much more rather hear a vocal debate on the two view points then leading to physical confrontations with emotional content the fighting in was there for little reason but to have an action sequence  more human interactions would help exploring the different issues the movie shouldve addressed  instead the movie focuses mostly on joining the team introducing characters and powers  although thats all good it doesnt pay off in the end because of magnetos stupid plan and lack of purposethe more than it is about really cool characters is about prejudice and finding out what is right and wrong by stepping in other peoples shoes in the human shoes we can easily relate because we dont understand mutants and are afraid that these mutants will be like magneto and want us dead  as magneto we understand his anger because humans hate mutants they want mutants dead so why not kill them first  in xaviers shoes however theres the hope that we can all live in peace  that yes they might want us dead but we shouldnt have to kill them first in order to stop them from wanting to kill us we should invest our time in trying to get them to understand  and thats why the are the heroes  however the movie is too much just about cool characters when it needed to be more about great story tellingnow that the characters are introduced lets hope the sequel will reach the potential a story can become out of 10,fantasy
my primary concern was whether they would be able to properly recreate all of the very defined characters  this they did with an uncanny ability i was very pleased to see that they had such a great screenplay for the movie i was worried that it would be watered down for the kiddies but it still had a badarse attitude that was great to see  the special effects were wonderful  realistic looking lightning subtle effects earth shaking sounds and the total physical realness of the flying bodies all came together to create a stunning eyecandy experience  this movie i will buy on dvd as soon as it is available,fantasy
this movie rocks patrick stewart was made for the part he played the script is great there are only a couple people in the movie maybe in a sequel like beast nightcrawler and collossus i also think that sentinals would have been good in the movie  ryan vals son age 10,fantasy
after being a collector of the uncanny comics for 20 years picking up my first copy when i was 14 i can describe the first full length movie as fantastic i know that the events of the movie are different to the true origins of the but to try and condense the entire comic 25 year plus history with all its diverse characters into a 90 minute believable movie is impossible thankfully this movie has portrayed as closely to the origins as i think they possibly can with the characters that have been used it was totally enthralling to see other comic book characters like shadowcat iceman moonstar jubilee and was that johnny storm of the fantastic four all in professor xs office when wolverine bursts in come to life and look positively human i wait to get this movie on dvd,fantasy
with the auspicious arrival of the new film things are looking up for the comic book world in its increasingly unpropitious history at the movies joining donners superman and burtons batman on the shortlist of truly fine comic book adaptations looks to become the next major franchise hopefully it will fare better in the sequel department than the other aforementioned warner bros franchisesthough patrick stewart and ian mckellan may have lead billing as far as the credits are concerned this film really belongs to hugh jackman and anna paquin as fan favorites wolverine and rogue respectively though stewart professor charles xavier and mckellan xaviers old friendturnednemesis magneto form the intellectual core of the film the emotional aspect the connection to the audience is conducted by paquins sense of alienation her growing fondness for wolverine and his developing friendship for his new young charge much praise will be heaped on jackman for his portrayal of wolverine but kudos must also go to james marsden cyclops and famke janssen jean grey for it is their byplay and chemistry that gives jackman his best and most memorable moments had they not played so well off jackman wolverine would not have come off so well as he doeshow does the rest of the cast fare halle berry storm is the only to stand unconvincing in her role although its not entirely her fault she is simply given very little to do and as a result fails to convince the audience of her capabilities marsden and janssen are good in their roles but more time should have been spent on showing us that they are in fact a couple we are told that they are but we never see it considering that much of the mood of the film and is derived from the triangle of cyclops grey and wolverine it would have been nice to have been provided a glimpse into their private lifethe only big failing is the score by michael kamen which falls flat on its face its not merely inadequate its just plain bad had a good composer been brought in who could have developed motifs for the important characters such as rogue wolverine professor x and magneto things would have been considerably improved just a few notes would have been enough somewhere between three and sevennote combinations to connect the audience sonically to the charactersstill i highly recommend the film and not just to fans of the comics i think nonfans people whove never even heard of the comic let alone picked up an issue will enjoy it just as much on a scale of 110 gets an 8,fantasy
i loved this film so much i saw it twice the weekend that it opened i understand that alot of the people who are diehard comic fans will nitpick it until they turn blue in the face but as a fan of the cartoon with some other comic knowledge of the the changesalterations that they made i think were appropriate after all most comic book story lines to alter depending on the new writer and the interpretation to fit the storylook at the batman movies vs the dark knight vs batman the animated series and oh yeah adam west as for everyones complaints about rogue she was young but not too youngshe cant be flirty as she usually is until shes comfortable with herself which was hinted at in the end anna paquin was great a helluva lot better than i had dreamed as were hugh jackman and rebecca romijnstamos though she didnt talk muchand shes not super strong or able to fly until she sucks the powers out of another mutant whose powers permanently stay with her originally rogue was bad and she killed ms marvel who had these powers as i understand itand everyone else was great jean grey and cyclops were always a little boring for me so it fit that is until the whole phoenix thing and iceman will be back in full force by the next one im sure as will probably jubilee  i did love it my fave of the summerso far cant wait to see what the directors cut will be like,fantasy
this movie is totally cool  has a lot of great action combined with wonderful special effects  though the idea of human mutations such as those in the movie is fantastic the movie was so absorbing that i forgot about the believability as soon as the plot started coming in to focus,fantasy
i have been an xfan although ive been out of the comic game for some time now for years and i join the legions of my ilk that claim to have been waiting for this 10 years or longer this is no exaggeration hailing back to the days of yore when wizard was but a young magazine posting a fantasy casting call for the thenimpossible xmovie a cast which i believe included alan rickman as magneto fans have been chomping at the bit for any sliver of information that was in existence for years the loyal waited in the wings watching in silent horror as the project was scrapped not once but twicethankfully the film has indeed arrived poised to satiate the literally millions of fans out there what was the end result well get to that in a minutethe superhero genre has experienced a bit of a quagmire as of late with wretched entries like steel and batman and robin note joel schumacher should be publicly whipped ever since the release of batman forever the genre has been on a general down swing im not saying that they were all that good to begin with but lets face the facts since the release of said batman film the awful pg13 rated spawn and terribly acted blade have been the high points in the superhero world batman and robin was simply the final straw the superhero genre was dying it needed a hero of its own to save itenter no adulation no zealotry to mask this opinion is amazing finally someone figured out that it is not special effects and oneliners that make for good film the secret lies in acting while remaining letter perfect to the mannerisms and behavior patterns of the characters removes the painfully unbelievable aspects of the comic while retaining the same overall feelingpatrick stewart the man born to play charles xavier delivers a predictably wonderful performance as the old prof displaying all the aspects necessary to his character ian mckellen who i admit would not have been my first choice although it is now plays the perfect magneto cyclops james mardsen and jean grey famke janssen fit in to the puzzle naturally and play their roles to a tee ray park martial arts master best known as darth maul is actually given a chance to act as toad and through his limited lines he does very well adding a bit of wicked comedy to the script the most improved character is definitely rogue who always annoyed me in any other incarnation anna paquin shows off some of that oscar winning charm as a young rogue and displays the hopelessness of her situation in an almost heartwrenching way not quite your typical superhero scenario ehbut here it comes no one stands out more than hugh jackman one statement if i may hugh jackman is wolverine can you believe they found this guy doing off broadway in canada he was cast as the most difficult role in the most popular comic book adaptation ever fanboys were screaming for blood when they saw the first publicity shots where are they now shelling out eight bucks to see him in action againin closing while admittedly imperfect is the model by which all superhero films should be made studios with films of this genre slated in production should be lining up to kiss bryan singers feet go see this film you owe it to yourself,fantasy
perhaps one need have at least a casual familiarity with the comic book to enjoy this movie as much as the vast majority of the posted reviewers the movie was mildly interesting if only in anticipation of which novel mutation would be next tossed our way on that note i must say i was left teased and unfulfilled i didnt think the mutations rose even to the level of interesting and maybe i am myopic to the subtle nuances of her predicament but anna paquins rather onedimensional performance as rogue left me with not much more than a lingering feeling of pity that she got gipped in the mutation lotteryspecial mention must go to hugh jackman who is poised to be the greg evigan of his generation there was also a moment at the beginning when i wondered how david cassidy got onto this picture to give jackman his due he has at least the charisma of the two combined he even gets to deliver the films funniest line when asked to prove that he is in fact himself and not some pale blue imitation  and im sure ill tune in to discover which malevolent wouldbe emperor of the mutant underworld is responsible for wolverines radical prosthetic implantation although i must say i feel a bit manipulated into waiting for a sequel i would have been much happier if they added another fortyfive minutes to the flick and put that baby to bedof course it has been mentioned that halle barrys talents were totally wasted she emoted like one under the influence of prescription analgesics claudia schiffer artfully embodied the rage that could only come from the merciless schoolyard taunting that certainly accompanied her cyanotic complexion and garish engraving work imagine the agonizing choice of being yourself a blue freak or looking exactly like one of the other kids youre playing with sad i felt her pain famke janssen was beautiful as ever and that cyclops dude was not nearly as annoying as he could have been sir ian and mr stewart were adequate to the task they were asked to perform i dont forsee any academy award nods in their immediate future unless they have some stellar projects in the worksall in all it was a mildly enjoyable if uninspired ride almost hard to believe it was helmed by bryan singer who was responsible for perhaps the best film of the last decade,fantasy
admittedly my expectations werent terribly high however i am glad to say that this one exceeded all expectations it is rare to see such good acting in an action adventure film this one actually has a soul and even looks suspiciously thoughtful hugh jackman is fabulous and so are the shakespearean actors  with the sheer force of their skills they provide the film with its classy feel looking forward to meeting up with them all over again of course therell be a sequel theyll have to have one just to explain wolverine,fantasy
a few questions a very good movie but not xcellent  it would be an xcellent movie when some wear their own outfit like wolverines blue and yellowwhats up with that  it will look good trust me mr singer why all black do we need the toad to be in this movie why not the juggernaut  he would ton of damage to the and it should be over 2hrs long movie it is too short 95min come on 75 millions budgetwhere all the money goes fox studio save 25 millions for not cast mel gibson as wolverine well think about that rating 3 xxx out xxxx,fantasy
this movie does what has almost never been done before and actually doesnt insult the fans of the comic on which the movie is based upon  it is also probably the only movie ive seen based on a comic which actually treats its source material with respect  the relationship between logan and jubilee is modified to that between him and rogue but captures the essence  the mysterious past of wolverine is discussed and left open to be discovered in sequels which is one sure way to know that people will come to the sequel as if they wouldnt otherwise  the tender love triangle is examined between wolverine jean grey and cyclops  plus i too have always thought that cyclops was a dick hence whenever wolverine ripped on him i was delighted speaking of wolverine jackman after this movie is wolverine wolverine was to me like many others the coolest and most interesting mutant and singer wisely chooses to give him and his character due weightage jackman nails the character in every way possible  he looks the part of the feral mutant with mutant healing power nearly unbreakable adamantium claws often uncontrollable rage and an attitude thats unmatched  he even manages to sneak in a bub  he also brings genuine pathos in a few scenes that flesh his character beautifully thus wonderfully bringing life to this character in minutes what took years for marvel writers to build on in the comics that said patrick stewart was also born to play prof x and mckellan was surprisingly perfect as magneto  in fact i felt they got most if not all of the casting right  paquin brings the right amount of vulnerability to her character thus showing it may not necessarily be a gift to be a mutant the fight scenes were nicely staged and especially the climactic battle was awesome  it really reminded you of the fights in the comics between the brotherhood and the  i didnt really care much about storm as some other fans here i thought halle did a good enough job and the wig wasnt so bad  but they couldve added a fight or two or at least more scenes between logan and sabretooth which wouldve kicked ass  these two have a long and legendary rivalry in the comics and shouldve been explored more in the movie  their fights have made some of the best episodes in the saga i think sabretooth having similar healing powers as logan may return in the sequel  really dont be surprised to see more than one villain from this movie mysteriously return in the sequels  i could gush about this movie forever  i was an fan and i was very happy with the way they made this movie  the only possible complaints from me it ended too soon ill tell you when the sequel comes out ill be there and i suspect i am not alone in feeling like this  go see it 1010,fantasy
unfortunately suffers from the same fault that all comic book movies suffer from and that is the dreaded origin plot line  just once i would want to see something that begins its story some ten years into the superheroes liveshaving said that i will say that there is hope and lots of it for future sequels where these characters will be already defined and we all can get down to some serious action which there is not nearly enough herealso there seems to be an abundance of sweetness  rouge is sweet her classmates are sweet hell even wolverine is sweet wolverine isnt he a maniacal deranged psychopath yes he is  but not here  for future considerationmy final vote is a generous 7,fantasy
i never actually read the comics but i watched the cartoon and when i saw they were making a movie i was ecstatic  i was afraid they might ruin the story and change everything but when i saw the movie i loved what singer director of the usual suspects did with it  i think that hugh jackman who played wolverine was perfect for the character and that all the other actors did a great job as well  i really hope they make a sequel to this movie,fantasy
was it worth the wait well i read my first comic 20 years ago and dreamed of a movie since then so probably not but it is a very good movie it is true to the comic with an actual story to go along with the action and special effects the acting is strong stewart prof x and mckellen magneto give their usual strong performances but it is hugh jackman wolverine who really steals the show jackman is wolverine the rest of the cast does a good if somewhat underused job i hope future sequels will better use the underappreciated halle berry storm as a longtime and movie fan i definitely recommend this movie as an aside do now worry if you do not know they mythos behind the it is adequately explained throughout the movie,fantasy
i gave this a 10 for no other reason than i have waited my whole life to see logan brought to life and singer jackman and the writers did an almost perfect job  and building the story around that character showed that they must have been fans at one timewhen i heard they were making this movie i could only imagine batman forever but worse and there isnt much worse  i dont know how singer ever pulled off such a clean sharp movie but he did and deserves credit  he kept true to the comic and any changes or omissions made were perfectly fine  i even liked the little things he did like bring in the new mutants and keep halle berry from talking,fantasy
while in the usa this week i went to see expecting a not so bad movie little did i realise that i was in for a very big surprise is what i would say one of the best movies so far combining the matrix style sfx and fighting styles patrick stewart really livens the whole story and makes it come to life he is a superb actor in for a knighting i think and puts the movie right at the top i hope this movie goes on to smash its way into the us top 100 but for that it would have to earn at least 135 million can it make it i think it canif you have not yet seen i would recommend that you do and fast i went expecting to see an over the top comic book with some moderate sfx i was wrong and it turned out to be better that the matrix and exceeded my expectationsgo and see 910 hey no movie is perfect,fantasy
its sad that a good plot in a summer action movie is a surprising event but there it is  the ironclad and suspenseful plot and excellent writing in this movie won me over immediately bryan singer deserves accolades for this great movie  also making a strong showing was hollywood newcomer hugh jackman  i read or heard somewhere that he was chosen partly on the basis of his chemistry with anna panquin and i have to agree  the scenes between the two are extremely believable and very moving  also he did a perfect wolverine  all parts of his acting were perfect the sound of his breathing when he was under stress his way of moving the tone of his voice  excellent the movie also had just the right touch of humor not too much not too little  the action scenes were excellent though i wish ray parks had more latitude for his particular physical talents  i understand why they didnt  they were keeping with the characters abilities but one scene reminded me so much of his darth maul i actually felt like watching phantom menace again  yikes i admit i havent seen perfect storm yet but i have seen gladiator patriot and mi2  is by far the best action movie ive seen this summer,fantasy
i have been told by some fans that the movie is not like the comic book  honestly how can you adapt such good story arcs into a 2 hour movie because the characters here are true to the comics although some origins may have been changed this movie is the best adaption of a comic book since superman  excellent special effects good plot and crisp dialogue make this an mustsee  if you think this is not the you know and like check out the cartoon  did you like that  why  at least the story here is more credible than those cartoons can ever be  if you disagree i have one word for you  morph  director bryan singer is to thank here as his desire for good story telling has cleaned up superhero movies after director joel schumacher polluted them with his batman adaptions  best of all mystique,fantasy
this was a good superhero movie because it concentrated on the characters any movie that doesnt make you care about the people on the screen is doomed to failurethis movie wasnt as good as the alltime superhero epic superman but it was still damn good entertainmenti will rate it a 10 thats as high as it gets folks,fantasy
i was not an active reader of the x men comic and i am no expert on the characters i found the movie to be more enjoyable than i expected but it lacked the epic quality one associates with these types of films for example the scenes at the statue of liberty were very modestnot as spectacular as they could have or should have been it was very claustrophobicmuch like a tv movie of the week on foxin factthat is what this movie seemed to be made for television it is unfortunate that fox not only slashed the budget on this film but also forced the filmmakers into a summer rather than xmas releaseas for the plot without revealing too much i will only say that the threat of mutant registration came across as rather lame could this idea have come about because of the budget restrictions i would have preferred something more grandlike legislation to allow the military to use a virus to seek out and neutralize mutants now that would have been a threatand magnetos response in the film would have been more understandable furthermorethe nazis are featured early in the film this sequence was truly dead weight it was jarring and not as relevant to the story as some may suggest it would have been cheaper and more effective to have magneto talk about his childhood when he is facing xavieror senator kelly on the plus sidesterwart and mclellan did the best they could with their roles but the real stars were jackman and paquin they brought some emotional power to this flickwhile the rest of the cast were not well developedi understand that there were scenes removed from this film to cut the running time downperhaps they would have improved the film but not enough i suspect i certainly did not find this film to be as disappointing as batman but it didnt soar like superman either,fantasy
ever since i heard about this movie being made i wanted to see it so i went to the cinemas with very big expectations i have to say i wasnt totally dissapointed with it there were a few things that werent totally true to the comic bookslike rogue being so young and sabretooth being so stupid and monosyllabicbut i gradually acccepted this the casting i have to say was good patrick stewart is proffesor xavier and hugh jackman portrays wolverine perfectly and shows us that he does have a heartand that australians can actjames marsden looks good as cyclops although i have a problem with drjean greyi think this is due to the fact that beast didnt make it to the final cut and they needed that dr element in therehalle berry was good as storm but didnt have much to do besides kick evil mutant buttat first i have to say that anna paquin was not in my list of choices to be cast as rogue but she does a good here of showing us a young rogue before she became what she is now on the evil mutant side ian mckellen is fantastic as magneto and shows us how powerful he really is ray park is good as toad although the character was totally different from the original but i dont care because the original was so lame rebbeca romjinstamos looked so incredible as mystique but why did she only get one line in the whole movie there was also a slight change in her costumeshe was never naked in the comics finally tyler mane as sabretooth good casting not so good transition of character from comic book to big screen i mean sabretooth is supposed to look like an animal instead here he looks like a man with a bad facial hair problem and whats with the costume did he rob a second hand clothes store also sabretooth is supposed to be wolverines opposite hes supposed to be cunning homicidal and extremely psychotic yet here he nothing more than a big dumb sidekick to magneto he doesnt sound or even look scary in this movie plus his fight with wolverine should have been much longer than 2 minutes hopefully well see a full out bloodbrawl in the next movie along with some hint as to the connection between wolverine and sabretooth overall however this is a good movie and is right up there with blade 810,fantasy
not a bad attempt and given marvels history of terrible films this one is a pretty good effort pretty to look at and containing a good dose of humor combines elements from all through the run of the comic mostly for the better the plot isnt all that terribly well thoughtout or explained however and the exposition zips by like a bullet train storm and cyclops are little more than moving standees unfortunately but jackman is excellent and paquin does agreat job with rogue a good film could have been a great one,fantasy
like any good movie series the first has very little plot and a lot of character developmentpatrick stewart hally berry and anna paquinn are here just to have stars on the marque  its the unknown actors that stand out and give the best performances and ian always makes a good bad guy maybe if film was longer they might have fleshed out the characters more or make you feel for the more but hopefully the next one will fill any plot holes and give the stars more to dooh yea lets have gambit in the next one  he was missed,fantasy
so you think its a disappointing movie eh  not up to mi2 or chicken run apparently you were so caught up in the hype that you forgot what the movie was really about a group of people who fight the good fight in a world that would rather want them killed  my hat tips bryan singer and the players especially patrick stewart and hugh jackman for taking the original premise of the comic and running with it  the special effects are nothing but perfect  bottom line if you are still finding this film unfulfilling then maybe you should see it again with a more watchful eye,fantasy
i grew up with the trading cards and every thing and it never onced really interested me but this movie really jumped at me and i loved it some of the effects that just show up will push you back in your seat  it hadd its funny moments and its tender dramatic moments but it was still great  id like to see them do a sequal  its opened enough at the end this is 10 definitly,fantasy
one of my major concerns before i saw the movie was whether or not they could do wolverine right  lets face it he is the and one of the major reasons the has been so popular over the years  i am happy to say that not only were they true to his character but they were also true to storm jean grey professor x mageto sabertooth mystic and toad  rogue was a disappointment but luckily she was played very well by anna paquin i only say she was disappointment is because they werent true to her powers or personality  true in the movie was able to steal the powers of other mutants but in the comic she can also fly and is very strong  in the movie she was the damsel in distress most of the time  hopefully theyll fix that in the sequelall in all i would highly recommend this movie to anyone not just comic book fans  there are many touching moments between rogue and wolverine some great one liners and several intense action scenes loaded with great special effects  is perfect  no they never explain why rogue travels to the north before meeting wolverine  is it fun  yes  should you see it  absolutely,fantasy
i have read the comics and i am a fan of them i thought hugh jackman did a great job portraying wolverine it had a great story and good graphics it was a great scifi action movie i am looking forward to a sequel,fantasy
when i went to see i wasnt sure what to expect i knew it would be great looking with great effects and it certainly was but i didnt know what to expect after that i was very pleasantly surprised this is one of the first action movies in a while that has actually had a point to it in some parts of the movie it was closer to a drama it gives us a message of how prejudice affects our world although mutants are the target of prejudice in the movie the message can be applied to any group of people that has ever been in the same situation hopefully people who see will get that message instead of concentrating solely on the visual appeal which there is a lot ofthe two main mutants in the film are wolverine and rogue hugh jackman and anna paquin both do incredible jobs instead of just showing them killing the bad guys like typical summer action movie fare brian singer the directoranother amazing job focuses on their pasts showing us how they ended up like they were he does a great job at this he can really make you feel emotion for the characters another uncommon thing in action moviesthe rest of the cast is good as well patrick stewart professor xavierleader of the and ian mckellan magneto leader of the bad group of mutants are especially good i was surprised by rebecca romijnstamos performance as mystique another bad one although she didnt have many lines i still thought she did a very good job surprising considering how most models do in movies id like to see more from her provided she can stay out of typical model roles ie bond girl the one weak spot is tyler mane as sabretooth but its a pretty small part so it doesnt really matteryou dont have to be a comic book fan to enjoy this movie ive never read and i enjoyed the movie immensely and it made perfect sense to me it offers so much more than a typical action movie it has a well thoughtout plot which may not seem like a big deal but not too many bigbudget action movies do that anymore mi2 i highly recommend this movie even if you dont typically like action movie has a much deeper plot much more heart and is just a great movie overallrating 910,fantasy
i loved  i have been a comic collector most of my life and i expected this movie to flop like the fantastic four movie but it is awesome  a must see for any comic collector  i cant wait for a sequel,fantasy
everyone seems to think this is the first great comicbook based movie however a few others come to my mind blade was highly entertaining mib was great  i loved this movie despite its obvious flaws  it focused on my two least favorite xcharacters rogue and wolverine and we didnt get to see magneto really hurt wolvie unfortunately but i still enjoyed it  those who said james marsdens cyclops was wooden seem to think thats a bad thing  cyclops while one of my favorite has always been very stiff at least in my mind overall the only character who i felt was portrayed badly was storm who shouldve been more imposing imho did professor x say these were his original students  i thought he said they were some of the first meaning that its possible that storm wasnt with the rest of the group of course that doesnt explain away the fact that bobbys way too youngoverall i loved this movie its the best ive seen this summer for sure and will anxiously await a sequel esp if nightcrawler or the beast show up,fantasy
this movie was one of the first big budget special effectseveryothershot summer blockbusters that does not suck  this movie makes an excellent transition from the hit comic book to the big screen  most not all movies that transition from a lower form of media tv books comics bomb but this one doesnt loose any of the excitement you get from reading the comics  i definitely give it six stars out of five its that damn goodminor spoilerthe only setback this movie had was the lack of the mutant gambit he was one of my favorites,fantasy
no this isnt meant to be a complex character study but what it tries to do it does very well this is a comic book turned into movie the movie had to do these things 1 establish the concept what are the it did that 2 establish the characters in a manner that didnt take away from progressing the plot it did that for the most part 3 have enough action it did that for the most part 4 get a person to want to see it again it did that for me 5 make you want to see the sequel it did that 6 get the audience into it sure did that where i went to see itagain just because this movie wasnt too cerebral is not a fault what it needed to do it did and thats why i rated it an 8,fantasy
when the sequel to this movie comes out and it inevitably will since the end of the film left it set up for that eventuality please will someone beat me on the topside of my head if i ever even consider wasting my time and money and going to see iti must start by saying that i am not a comic book fan i am a movie fan therefore i have nothing to base whether this depicts the comic correctly if its true to the characters or much of the other debate that seems to be prevalent in these critiques  i went in there solely for scifi film entertainment and was hoping expecting really to see something on the calibre of last years masterpiece the matrix because of all the hype and great reviews  what a disappointmentin my opinion the characters were not interesting or developed enough to care about the sets were typical the costumes were unimaginative and the special effects were well can we just say seen it done it  the only thing that i could say was outstanding was sound effectsmy friend that saw this movie with me said it was the worst movie that she had ever seenwell i cant be quite that harsh but i only gave it a 5 and i would not recommend this movie to anyone i am basically dismayed about the lack of original films to come out this year  i guess the movie geniuses shot their wads last year and are resting their brains for the future,fantasy
i know more about nuclear fission than i do about this comic book series so i cant comment on how well it captures its source material but i can say it is one of the most exciting movies ive seen in a long time and despite several jump out of the seat action sequences it also slows down frequently enough to get to know and like the heroes  a lot of plot strands are left unresolved for the inevitable sequel and for a change i look forward to it,fantasy
i absolutely loved this movie i especially love the acting abilities of hugh jackman and a few of the other characters i did not like the casting of ana paquin as rouge she is did not show enough backbone to be the same character on the series i hope they find an older more mature rouge for the upcoming series i am super impressed with the casting of almost unknowns and thrusting them into the lime light they did a wonderful job and i am sure we will be seeing them in future movies hopefully they did not kill toad off for the sequels and he gets a role that he lives in this time i think ray parks is sick of dying the enemy all the time i am looking forward to the sequels and hughs newest movie  animal husbandry,fantasy
story is a science fiction action film which takes place in the near future the human race is evolving at an accelerated rate  at random people are born mutants with extraordinary powers ranging from heightened psychic senses to animal like abilities  because some mutants have potentially dangerous powers a political battle rages over what precautionary steps the government should take to safe guard normal civilians against mutantsthe good guys are the a team led by professor charles xavier patrick stewart famous for his role as captain jean luc pickard  xavier also heads a school where young mutants learn to control their powers  the film eludes to a long standing friendship between xavier and magneto who are still friends despite their opposing goals  magneto believes that the human race should be conquered by the genetically superior mutants  xavier believes that the two should work to coexist peacefully despite the personal and political bigotry most men show towards mutants  unlike many other generic super hero films has plenty of content  there is obviously much more story to tell both in the past and the future than what has been shown in this filmcharacters the bad guy magneto wishes to destroy the human race  he is a mutant with the ability to create magnetic fields and thus has a seemingly telekinetic influence over all metal objects  aiding him are henchmen mystique toad and sabertooth  mystique is a doppelganger played by rebbecca romijinstamos  i have to wonder why a supermodel was cast into the character whose face and body are never seen as mystique frequently shape shifts from her original form which resembles a blue alien   toad is played by ray park famous for his role as darth maul  disappointingly his role is very small again although his incredible martial arts skills stand out in the few moments he has onscreen  sabertooth is played by professional wrestler tyler mane whom i am not familiar with yet he plays his simple role of dumb henchmen perfectlythe include already mentioned professor charles xavier who can control the minds of others and is farsighted through clairvoyance  at his side is apprentice jean grey with among other psychic powers telekinesis jean grey is the girlfriend of cyclops who can shoot laser beams from his eyes  cyclops is at ends with wolverine who take a liking to his girlfriend  wolverine has indestructible claws build into his metal skeleton and regenerates his wounds faster than most bad guys can dish em out  rounding out the team is halle berry playing storm who can control the weather  finally there is rogue who has the most crippling and unique power she can absorb the life force and mutant powers of others by touching themoverall this film of course is based upon the poplar comic book of the same name portraying a comic book on film always requires careful direction  most comic book characters wear outrageously unrealistic costumes spawn and perform surreal actions nearly impossible to translate into reality on the silver screen  however handles these problems perfectly  costumes are never over done characters even joke about this and superb special effects make the plot progress very fluidly throughout even the most unrealistic comic book scenarios although ive heard several people claim they could see a string attached to toad at one pointall things considered this is a good film  great casting and action combined with a bold story and top notch special effects all work to bring this film together  thumbs up and four stars,fantasy
sorry but after reading some of the moronic posts i had to go through the work of registering to post some of my thoughtsfirst of all several people said this was the best comic book movie since superman or batman but definitely not matrix 2 did you people know that the matrix was also a comic booksecondly i am not a huge fan of the comic book and only an avid watcher of the cartoon but some statements in here have been bewildering first of all someone said the characters were younger than in the comic what did you think they were born adults second jean gray is a dr i realize marvels multifaceted fronts to the story line can be confusing for anyone but this is pretty basic to the whole reality thirdly i saw a comment about how rogue did not fly rogues flying ability came later due to draining a person that mysteriously endowed her with that persons powers forever also her relationship to mystique is only a vague intimation not proven fact rogue has never remembered any of it and finally scott and jean grays relationship was not fiery on screen as some of you have lamented but this aspect was perfectly in line with the early story something that had to kill the hollywood producersall in all i think hollywood did a commendable job on not being itself in this movie much better than slew of earlier flicks i only hope the sequels dont run into the ground like batman,fantasy
ive been waiting for this movie for a long time  the casting was good the director was good  i honestly thought this would be a great flickim up to seeing mi2 again and skipping going to a second timebryan singer drops the ball royally on this one  this movie lacks any knowledge or forethought of the subject  i honestly think he did a major disservice to the  he had a chance to clean the mythos up and give us something more compact and streamlinedi would rather read postclaremont issues than think this was a good representation of the  my issues are spoiler alert1 kelly and gyrich are dead  and we see gyrich for a whole twenty seconds one of the better antagonists and singer dumps him  all the hype about kelly is useless  singer goes nowhere with kelly and doesnt leave him for future projects2 cyclops is like cardboard on a stick and just as painful to look at he was horribly represented3 would storm freak out due to a human being turning into water  no i think not  her character was not pulled off very well at all  i think storm would be much more graceful4 iceman is a teenager  why  what possible good did that do  his character could have just as easily been sunspot or cannonball or jubilee or some offtheshelf kid  they wasted iceman5 why did toad have to do the darth maul move  sure its cute but was it really needed  why not just decapitate him while on a horse while were at it  i lost any interest in him at that point6 obviously sabretooth is not the foe we would expect for wolverine  i wanted some idea that creed knew who logan was  and i got nothing  he was about as useful as bane in batman and robini could go on but i wont  needless to say if you need to see this movie wait until it hits the 100 theaternow im off to see chicken run again,fantasy
i caught a screening when the film opened last friday it wasnt quite what i xpectedpardon the punnaturallyof coursemy main gripe was about the costumesnot every comicbased movie has to outfit the heroes in black leathertype suitsbelieve it or noti also think that mena suvari wouldve made a much better rogueimhobut i must saythis was a step above those godawful nick fury and generationx tv moviesboth of whichcoincidentally aired on fox,fantasy
wow i cannot even begin to explain by how much i was blown away with this filmmonths back i wouldnt have cared less about this film and my friend dragged me along to see it and it was fabulousnow im not a fanboy ive never read the comics but i used to watch the tvseries so i have a basic understanding of the charactershugh jackman  this man is gonna be a huge huge star i just know it his portrayal of logan was superb good job good jobanna paquin  i was a bit weary of the casting decision with her being rogue but it makes sense now shes supposed to be young inexperience and not has voluptuous just get over it purists her brotherlysisterly relationship with logan was very touchingpatrick stewart  he was born to play this role nuff saidian mckellen  dittonow the three other storm cyke and jean grey werent given as much screentime and their characters werent that signifigant but  they all did a good job especially famke jannsen whos charismatic and penetrating personality made her stand out in what could have been a forgetable rolethe brotherhood  now i thought toad mystique and sabretooth were a weird ensemble but it was a rather well thought out choice ray park who had like one line hey quit playin around was fantastic as his spiderman esque amphibious mutantmystique also had one line youre the reason why i was afraid to go school as a girl did remarkably well shess darth maul  a totally cool villain who doesnt have much to dosabretooth blah pure moviemenace wasnt as personified as toad and mystiqueall in all this movie is great its more than just a summer blockbuster its a rather well thought out tale of prejudice and rasism with mutants as an obvious metaphor see it you wont be disappointed,fantasy
this movie is great for fans of the series and comic book   and for people who have not seen it yet will like it more  thats right i think that if you do not know anything about the i think you will enjoy this movie a lot more  ive been a fan of the comic for more years than i can remember and have always watched the cartoon  and i think i like them slightly better  its the fact that there were changes to the character that i did not like wolverine for example was portrayed as a weaker person than he really is and his fighting ability come on he was getting the crap kicked out of him by many people  in the comics he is trained in about every form of fighting you can think of  plus sabertooth is the same as wolverine and the two of them have a very important past together in the movie they did not know each other  the list could go on but would you really want to read it  dont get me wrong i loved the movie and intend on buying it on dvd right when it comes out  but i would have liked to see more development of the characters,fantasy
i think that the problem with making a featurelength feature of the is that the are an ensemble cast  instead of only really having one or two main protagonists to develop as is the case with most comicbook movies like batman and superman this film has to develop an enormous number of characters  for the 1 12 hours that the movie runs i think it does as good a job as it could in developing the characters that it chooses to depict from the comic book series  the adaptations of the characters are well placed into the real world of liveaction film theyre not these spandexclad commandos where every one of them knows some sort of martial art and has bulging muscles  in fact theyre more or less normal people who are different from us only because of their mutant abilities  that makes them much easier to relate to for a liveaction film and also makes the premise of the much more believable in a realworld contextaltogether i do wish i could have gotten to know the characters a little better but theres only so much you can tell about so many characters in just an hour and a half i guess i wish the film was a bit longer and had a little more character development  as it is though the movie is one of the best comic book adaptations ive ever seen the action is good the characters welldone and the dialogue is very effective funny and doesnt insult the intelligence  also the issue of mutant persecution particularly its relationship with the holocaust is executed very well although it wouldve been nice if magneto wasnt so vilified and if his side of the story was sympathized with a little moreall in all this was a very enjoyable movie  congratulations to bryan singer and his team for making a great film,fantasy
could this be the best comic adaptation yet  perhaps but only because of the abysmal quality of previous superhero movies  you dont have to do much to exceed batman a fat joker lipsynching prince songs  cmon someone somewhere along the line should have realized that was a bad idea  of course the audience ate it up so i guess i expect too much from americans not to mention the shadow the punisher the phantom et al superman is the only one that comes to mind that might rival and most would probably disagree therethat said is triumphant in its mediocrity i didnt hate myself for wasting time and money on it like i did with the others and it doesnt totally destroy the legends it presents see warren beattys egotrip dick tracy if you want to see a legend turned into crap  the jokes while awful are mercifully few and had the geniuses in the theater laughing so there i go againstill as a fan of the comic and a student of film i think much better could have been done  cyclops is not pretty enough to warrant hiring one so utterly devoid of talent  storm was equally deadpan and a waste of time how can you care about someone that boring  did i mention boring  that word fits xavier rogue and all the villains as well  wolverine while quite capably played by hugh jackman was far too nice not to mention tall  the film makers seemed to have realized that they didnt have time to make you like him if he started out as a jerk so they made him seem like one for all of about 2 minutes at which point he becomes a big softyone of two things could have been done to make this film better take the time develop the characters better or take the time to develop a strong plot  neither was done and it shows,fantasy
this movie was great it had everything in the right place to keep the story moving you learn early on the two edged sword of the mutations the mutants are born with a curse as well as a blessing the tagline protecting those who fear them explains the core of the movie everyone has been at a point in their life when they wonder who they are what their destiny is and where they fit in the big picture this movie taps into those feelings perfectly and provides a great action story as well my only disappointment is the obvious overediting of the theatre cut there was almost 45 minutes chopped out of the movie to slim it down to the 1 hr 44 minutes we see at the theatre i have a hunch that the bosses at fox were responsible for this they wanted all that pesky character development thrown out so the action scenes would completely dominate the film those not familiar with the comic may feel overwhelmed as the different characters fly in and out of scene after scene the powers that be at fox should have pushed the movie over the 2 hour mark i think that would have added enough dramatic content to bring more non fans into the fold the critics are being very harsh on this film pointing out the opening scene as too dark for a comic book movie and one even pointing out that the ability to controls the weather isnt a mutation its a miracle well folks its still a comic book a fantasy judging it as anything else is doing yourself and your readers a disservice more films are sure to be made and will undoubtedly be as successful if not more so they should stay with the same director and not pass the job to a joel schumacher type to turn it into an abomination like the last two batman films,fantasy
this movie was just what i wanted in an movie action perfect characteristics and a good plot i thought all the actors played their roles to a t specifically patrick stewarts portrayal of professor xavier was an exemplary job from logans cockiness to cyclopss feelings towards logan to jean greys feelings about cyclops they were all amazingalso the special effects were wellneeded to pull off a true xperience good job everyone and i hope to see a sequel soon,fantasy
this is perhaps the best movie of the 2000 summer season  first of all wolverine got all the best lines eg  cyclops asks logan how they know its him and not mystique  logan responds by calling scott a dick  the whole theater laughed the best part of the film as mentioned above is the scottlogan part of the scottloganjean love triangle  the character development on logan and rogue was wonderful the only problem was they gave rogue half an identity her names marie  everyone still calls her rogue and heres hoping that the next movie will have gambit to create a gambitrogueiceman triangle yes  rockin man,fantasy
comics often dont come to real life all that gracefully but after the several years that it took to get this one to the big screen singer has by and large made the most of ityou need to be patient while they set background information up but if you are you are rewarded with some decent suspense and some positively wonderful comedy add in some action and a few good special effects and youve got yourself a comic book come to life in quite respectable fashionthis one is definitely worth seeing on the big screennote knowledge of the comic series before seeing the film is not required though if you know the comic youll get a few more laughs than everyone else w it is also generally speaking an ok flick for children down to perhaps as young as 9 or so the blood is there but is minimal there is virutally no swearing only one instance i can think of and one could seriously question whether that is even a swear word in this day and age a little romantic tension exists but zero sexenjoy,fantasy
 the movie is fantabulous i urge those hardcore fans of the comics to watch this movie with an open mind and understand that it would be impossible to bring the comic to the movie screen without some changes being made having said this the makers of this movie stayed as close to the comics as they possibly could it payed off is one of the best and most enjoyable movies of the yearwhen i first heard they were going to make this movie i thought what a flop this is going to be havent they learned anything after such awful comicbook adaptations as the batman sequels and the flash etc but i was wrong is differentthe producerdirector took such care and the actors especially patrick stewart ian mckellen anna paquin and hugh jackman played their characters with such respect and dignity that the end result is quite satisfying and rewarding not at all campy cheesy or just plain stupid note to the batman movie franchise learn form thei cant say enough about the casting the pairing of mckellen and stewart was an excellent move and wow what about hugh jackman ive heard about hime before but am totally amazed by his acting capabilitiesi have a couple of gripes though the movie is too short and halle berry wasnt that goodwell thats all i give it 9 out of 10,fantasy
i think this is a near perfect adaption of a comic book to film  kudos to the cast  crew for pulling together  creating this masterpiece  i could not be more pleased with the film  yes it could have had a better score and been about 23 hours longer but those are minor issues  i can not wait for the sequel  this has become the new benchmark for comic book adaptions  i give this a 10 out of 10,fantasy
after 10 long years its finally here ive been reading the comics and in 2nd grade ive heard the rumors about the movie at the time arnold schwarzenegger was rumored to be in it now finally after many years of waiting yes im gonna be a senior in high school this upcoming school year i finally saw it actually saw it wednesday at a special screening for free and i must say it wouldve been worth full price this is probably without a doubt my favorite comic book adapted movie yes better than batman its that good i never wanted the dazzling special effects and fun to end but unfortunately it had to but the good thing is there is most likely a sequel coming up and i guarantee you i will be there im ready to see this movie again,fantasy
while some may fault this movie for not being 100 faithful to the continuity of the comic book it is without a doubt the best adaptation to film of any comic including tim burtons batman movies  fastpaced yet remarkably easy to follow even for noncomic fans the movie conveys all the information necessary to understand the who and the what without becoming bogged down in expositioncasting in this film was welldone with a few strokes of luck in particular having hugh jackman take the place of dougray scott actually worked out for the better given scotts performance in mi2  patrick stewart was perfect as professor xavier as was ian mckellan as magneto what i particularly enjoyed was the onscreen relationship between these two formerfriendsnowenemies which was carried off beautifully by these two fine actorsthe rest of the cast performed well and the cameos by various other mutants at xaviers school mutant high was fun from a continuity perspective several things about the school didnt make much sense  bobby iceman drake was far too young and xavier listing storm as one of his original recruits was also incorrect the original team consisted of iceman cyclops jean grey the beast and angel whereas storm didnt join the team until the revamp that added wolverine nightcrawler colossus and others in the late 70s in giantsized 1  however this is a minor nit to pick one that would not be noticed by most nonfans and which does not detract from the movie in the leastthe door is obviously left open for more stories and hopefully the movie will be successful enough to justify moremy one quibble is that the movie seemed a little on the short side running time was 95 minutes  several scenes felt rushed in particular jean grays speech at the beginning however more exposition might have slowed down the movie too much which would also have generated complaints  as it is we have a fine action film which serves to introduce the to the noncomicfan audience and thats a very good thing indeedrating 8 out of 10,fantasy
i was looking forward to seeing not because i expected an excellent movie  in fact i wasnt sure and didnt really care either way as to whether it was good or bad it just looked fun  ive never been a huge fan but im familiar with most of the characters and major plot points since i used to read american comics a while back  with most comic book movies being really bad i didnt have very high expectations for  im glad i didnt  otherwise i might have been disappointedas far as just being a ton of fun to watch doesnt disappoint theres some great visuals and direction and then theres also some cheesy stuff  i supposed ill talk about visuals first  the special fx werent too bad but it looked like they needed a higher budget  some of them were really cool  the wind effects of storm and cyclopss optic blast were cool as well as some of the other mutant power stuff i was skeptical of mystiques look at first but i found that i really liked it in the movie but any scene with characters flying just looked cheesy and rigged and the statue of liberty fight scene was justweird  the slo mo just didnt work in that contextas far as the characters go the ones that were focused on were in character and looked pretty good  wolverine was great and i ended up liking him more than i ever did in the comics for some reason  cyclops was the dork that he is and of course professor x and magneto were well done  rogue was ok despite the fact that she was much younger than fans are used to  but storm justdid nothing  she looked scared most of the movie and she was way too much of a background character although if they had concentrated too much on every character it would have been too loaded with complicated details and would clutter the story and she had the worst line of dialogue ive ever heard which many people have already complained about  that line was trying so hard to be cool that it just came out all wrong  sabertooth was pretty bad as well  id have to say he was the worst  i hated the lion roars and the fact that he barely spoke  he wasnt all that savage either and the whole wolverinesabertooth rivalry thing was ignored in the movie i realize that the movie was made for the masses and not just for and comic book fans so they did a commendable job translating it even if its missing detailsoh the soundtrack was just badtheres not much more i can think to say about this movie  it was good for a comic book live action movie  i still think the best medium for comic book movies would be animation since the characters are drawn characters to begin with but unfortunately mature cartoons dont go over too well in this country  despite the few problems the movie had it was ok overall and i had a good time,fantasy
well the wait was worth it  my only complaint was that i would have liked to see more character development and use of the powers of cyclops storm and jean grey  and wolverine is heading for an abandoned base in the andirack mountains  can you say sentinels for the next movie  this will rock,fantasy
being a teenage boy in the states i grew up reading the comic as well as watching the fantastic cartoon show  so like many people who had high expectations for the new star wars movie i also had high expectations for this film as well  though i miss gambit bryan singer has orchastrated a fine movie indeed  well filmed well acted and well paced i cant wait for the next movie with more characters  in the end is just a truely enjoyable movie to watch for all ages,fantasy
i recently saw the movie and i must say i was quite impressed now im not a fan of the though i think theyre cool but the filmmakers did a very good job of bringing the characters to life the acting is wonderful especially from patrick stewart ian mckellen and hugh jackman for anyone who likes scifiactioncomicsfilms kind of movies are bound to like this little number,fantasy
i have to say i am greatly impressed with this movie for the first time in a long time a comictomovie conversion didnt kill the whole story obviously they had to follow a different continuity its difficult to squash over 30 years of stuff in one move there were no cheesy lines the costumes were cool the spandex is fine in the comic books but not on the big screen no stupid effects with mutant powers has been the subject of conversation all week at work and at home,fantasy
i have been a fan of the comic and cartoon for years and when i heard they were finally making the movie i was kinda worried after seeing how disappointing some of the other comic book based movies came out well i was pleasantly surprised at how well this movie turned out overall i felt that they really got the main point of what is about across to the audience  hopefully with the sequels there will be more character background now that the foundation is laidas for the acting hugh jackman stole the show as wolverine  patrick stewart and ian mckellen were both awesome as professor x and magneto famke jansen and james marston were pretty good in their roles as jean grey and cyclops even though they had little to work with although her hair should have been redder  anna paquin was ok as rogue  she wasnt very good at a southern accent and it was gone by the end of the moviei dont know what they were thinking by having halle berry play storm  like many other people i had imagined angela bassett in that role she is a superb actress and could easily convey the inner strength that storm is supposed to have  they could have at least had someone who looked a little more like the part like vivica fox or maybe vanessa l williams since storm does have blue eyes when they are not all white  and in this day of special effects and makeup you would think that they could have made her hair look at least somewhat realisticanother thing i was somewhat disappointed with is how the female were always either getting their butts kicked or being rescued when one of the things that attracted me to the comic was the presence of strong female characters i wonder how or if rogue will have her other powers she gets from ms marvel in the comics in the sequelas for the other villains i felt they were all pretty good at playing their parts  although out of all the villains in the comics why toadsome characters i would like to see in the sequels are nightcrawler psylocke why not tia carrere gambit beast and more of kitty pryde,fantasy
finally the long awaited movie is here i saw the movie on monday and it was a lot better than i expected i was expecting it to be great but it was even greater with dazzling special effects and a great storyline this movie is the best of 2000 hugh jackman did a great job as playing wolverine and anna paquin did a pretty good job playing rouge patrick stewart was great as professor charles xavier and halle berry was unexpectedly to me anyways great as storm i have been waiting for this movie for a while maybe even over a year but for the last couple of months ive been reading magazines with info on the movie and just sinking my teeth into them this movie is a must see for all fans and even for people who have never read the comic books,fantasy
ive been a comic fan since i could read and i really tried not to get too excited about this movie for fear that it would let me down like so many other marvel effortsbut have no doubts fans of marveldom  this movie did not disappoint this fan and unless youre a tard i cant see it disappointing you either,fantasy
while i enjoyed this film and am mildly looking forward to the sequels  i am amazed by the ability of an average movie to receive such gushing reviews  what has happened to us as moviegoers the action of the movie kept it moving along and held the audience however that wasnt entirely neccesary because the movie was predictable from start to finish  the acting was all around good  if not great in places and parts ie patrick stewart and all the characters were at least interesting  nonetheless the backstory to all of them was noticeably absent  i had to wonder why at times did this particular mutant team up with magneto or this one with dr xavier  do they feel torn with the issues  do they have extreme loyalties to the person or just to themselves  why did their powers develop as they did  the scene in washington dc at the begining of the film where the senator makes a speech in the middle of a conference was as subtle and intelligent as say an orangutan using an adding machine  the comparisons to macarthyism and racial oppression were certainly appropriate  but give the audience a little credit  sheesh that said  the movie was still worth the 525 i plunked down matinee price but not by much  the feigned attempts at catchy oneliners were cute but forgettable  obviously the sequels are already being writtenor even completed as the movie not only leaves several issues unresolvedbut hits the audience over the head with them as the movie ends  again  this is unneccesary and only a plot device to make more money in the future  not about good filmmaking  oh wellits not the first time thats been done and it definitely wont be the last so i dont blame for that final verdict65 stars out of 10,fantasy
im an independent moviemaker in canada that aspires to do big budget blockbuster summer movies im also an avid comic book reader but i hate marvel comics  the have for ages so i cant say i was exactly looking forward to this movie and i never ever thought id love this movie bryan singer who directed the also excellent usual suspects  his fellow xmoviemakers did an amazing job translating these characters to the big screen relative newcomer hugh jackman gives what may end up being a breakthrough performance as wolverine only diehard xfans may be a bit upset by how some of the characters are adapted to their motion picture versions rogue is quite different than the sexy southern bell xreaders are probably used to my favorite thing is that they didnt have a cheesy top 10 soundtrack to accompany the movie as they did with mi2  other such summer fare when a movie comes out thats based on something thats already beloved by a large  of fans whether its hamlet xfiles batman or silence of the lambs the key is to appeal to the worshipers and the people whove never heard of the thing before rarely does this succeed but with they pulled off a movie that should be enjoyable to both forms of viewers i give it my highest possible recommendation go see it,fantasy
i loved it  i am looking forward to seeing it again and again  on the whole i thought it was very well cast and the movie characters very true to their comic book counterparts with two very notable omissions colossus and nightcrawler  these were two very key characters in the comic story lines  if they could not make it into this movie at least put them in the next one  any movie this good deserves another,fantasy
this is a really great movie regardless of what critics say so what if the characters werent completely introduced they werent suppose to be remember there may be two more coming it reminds me of a certain star wars at first we didnt understand what the force was but after two more movies we all understood and loved it besides if anyone cared what the movie was all about we have years of great comics and cartoons for researchit may not be as great as the star wars saga but i can see it becoming a successful trilogy and i hope it does  this movie wasnt necessarily suppose to please everyone but it did an awesome job trying,fantasy
this movie was a brilliant adaptation of the comic with more to come i hope  dazzling special effects and an involving story line and simply par excellence acting my opinion especially by hugh jackman and anna paquin as wolverine and rogue jackman really brought the rude crude buttkicking wolverine to life and showed the humane side as well and anna paquin really did well as a confused and frightened rogue  i hope the sequels keep coming,fantasy
my friend took a couple of us guys out to see this movie for his birthday and trust me it was the best movie for the occasion  it has a very interesting plotone of those ones that youre afraid to get up to go to the bathroom in case youll miss something  after reading reviews ill admit it isnt exactly a summer movie  you do have to pay attention and its not very light  but it is a good movie nonetheless and i would definitely advise seeing it in the theaters  it adds that much more effect,fantasy
i loved the film but there were few circumstances under which i wouldnt i grew up glued to books not the show  dont talk to me about the show and have awaited this cinematic moment all my lifei think it was a really decent portrayal of what i and many geeks like me already loved  in that respect it made the cut  i dont think anyone expected it to be a brilliant take on an action comic albeit an action comic with a little depthmost importantly the acting was good  seeing halle berry ray park and rebecca romijn stamos in the cast scared my pants off but patrick stewart a dry performance but adequate ian mckellan a charming villain i thought and especially hugh jackman great job but a little more grit made up for the somewhat below par casti loved that brian singer was able to lend a tad of his dark and realism based style to this fantasy epic  i thought he saw in the story what fans saw when reading the books is real  i wanted as sincere a treatment of the tale and singer did his best to provide itas a true blue fan i am also not offended by editorial changes made to the characters and their powers  rogue went from a voluptious flying vixen to a tool in telling a good story  cyclops and storm became minor characters to focus the movie on its most interesting parts  im glad it wasnt bogged down with elements present only to satisfy those who prefer comics to movies because it was a movie after alli thought the little bit of humour near the end wolverine calling cyclops a bad name was needed and too rare although the yellow spandex joke was a little too obvious a wink at the audience  oh and by the way did everyone notice ray parks stick twirling salute to darth mauloverall  go see it if you like scififantasyaction and are not short on imagination  if you read the comic or watched the show go see it now,fantasy
sitting in the big theater and watch the light go out as historys changes x men an xcellent movie  after seeing this movie i felt good it gave me a good feeling not like batman and robin or spawn but a relieving feeling the movie was as i say again excellent  from beginning to end i was dazzled at the good effects and nice story  they did the movie as good as the comics  it shows if u have the right director and right writer u can make a movie work this is a definite to seecyclops how do i know its the real u loganlogan ur a dick scottcyclops ok its him455 stars,fantasy
i admit i did not know what to expect from this movie  i was hoping for a wild entertaining ride  i was not disappointed  i highly recommend this movie to hardened fans and rookies alikeespecially the ladies because to put it simply  hugh jackman rocks ahem  sorry about thatseriously hugh is the hottest new sex symbol of the new millennium  his smoldering performance his passionate mixing of strength and sensitivity and his dynamic screen presence make him someone to watch for years to comeif i havent made my opinion clear enough  run do not walk topeace outpikachutrupika pika,fantasy
when i was little i watched this show as a cartoon and when i heard they would be bringing it to life i thought it would be corny and a stupid imitation but this movie was so well portrayed and was so vivid it made me feel i was a kid again you should go out to see it now,fantasy
the biggest and most anticipated film of the summer is finally released  for years comic book fans have been waiting for big screen adaptations of fantastic four spider man and now finally released and what can i say about but not since dick tracy and the original batman 1989 have i seen a fantastic and exciting film based on a comic book  this movie is way better than spawn and blade it does make the comic book film genre alive again for the new millennium focuses on two characters wolverine hugh jackman also called logan love that name and rogue anna paquin they discover that they are outcasts of society called mutants  where wolverine can heal his own wounds and have sharp claws come out of his fists rogue can feel other peoples or mutants energy and power  they are attacked by the powerful evil mutant sabertooth tyler mane before they are rescued by cyclops james marsden and storm halle berry wolverine and rogue are taken to a university for mutants led by professor charles francis xavier patrick stewart and his assoicate dr jean grey famke janssen  professor x tells the two newcomers that their mutant powers can help protect society a society that is afraid of them however evil magneto ian mckellen wishes to use his powers to destroy a society that betrayed him and his team including sabertooth mystique rebecca romijn stamos and toad ray park  together the must stick together to save a society that fears them i never did read any of the comics i was more into the dark knight and captain america  but from watching this movie i was very impressed  there was nonstop action and excitement and director bryan singer doesnt pull any punches with any corny plot characters or dialogue  i was at first disappointed in its 109 minute running time but after watching the film its so fast paced that there are no slow scenes the acting by all of the cast members are great with kudos going out to anna paquin as rogue and newcomer hugh jackman as wolverine  although most of the film centers around these two they both did a great job with their characters especially jackman hes a fantastic wolverine and support from mckellen stewart janssen berry and marsden also add flavor to the film  that is why i enjoyed this movie there is more than one character to enjoy  unlike the original batman where the viewer was intrested in batman and the joker there are so many characters to be engrossed with and the directing is fantastic from the tricky camera angles to the fast pacing singer makes this film a true comic book film  puls i also enjoyed the special effects the sets costumes and music by michael kamen this is another eagerly awaited film along with episode i that delivers the goods and then some  it is action packed you do see quite a few characters and it is in a comic book style  i highly enjoyed this film and ill be the first or one millionth person in line for the sequal to be continued    out of five,fantasy
well i have waited and it has come  and in my opinion its somewhere in the middle of the road  not the most amazing film of the new year which i had hoped for nor the phenomenal letdown that i had been expecting many of you will believe that i am grading the movie too harshly but to all the hardcore fans out there you will uderstand where i am coming fromwolverine was definitely good  even though he did not have as much shall i say grittiness and general tough guy attitude as the comics portray him i believe that hugh jackman did an impressive job filling in his roles big shoes  patrick stewart also did a great job truly portraying professor x magneto was a bit harder as ian mckellen did a good job of displaying the emotions and motivations behind magneto but he does lack the bit of muscle that the real magneto possessed making his costume make him appear as a somewhat frail old man in a rather unflattering suit  i mean the real magneto was pretty jacked but that is one detail i can do without  jean grey portrayed by famke janssen was more or less nondescript although she does look somewhat like what i would expect jean grey to appear as cyclops on the other hand was more or less cheesy  storm was the same although at times halle berry was able to make her a bit less disappointing toad was a hit even though he is way too strong for the little shrimp that he is anyone who has read the comics knows  i guess the choices of sabertooth and mystique were more or less based completely on looks because the 2 didnt require any acting whatsoever  it makes me wonder why they picked rebecca romijn stamosi feel that the biggest problem was definitely the shortness of plot and the lack of characters  to the newbie this movie does seem great however it misses out on a lot of key characters  where is gambit nightcrawler beast colossus and angel  rogue and iceman are just teens and will hopefully be able to appear in the coming sequel if there is one  and the real lack of supervillains was definitely a letdown they couldve thrown in some more even if they werent part of the original story i mean it already is somewhat distorted as it is  i dont think anyone would mind if the producers and writers tossed in mr sinister and his nasty boys or the rest of the brotherhood of evil mutants pyro who is a kid in prof xs school blob phantasm etc  and this movie shouldve been made to be around 3 hours long  in fact this couldve rivaled star wars  but the shortness of the film around an hour and a half didnt go for the character development and taggled plot lines that were usually found in the comics  all that can be said is pray for a sequeleven though i spent all this time lamenting about what this movie lacks it is definitely a film to go see  good effects that dont turn the movie into a cyberjunkies euphoria and some better than decent acting make this film overall a good choice  for the fans see it for the heck of it  for the newcomers see it because you will like it,fantasy
i saw the movie on opening night at around 1030 at night and the theater was packed there were so many people there and my friends and i who are all fans of the comic book sat with anticipation just waiting for it to begin i have never been so excited over a movie in a long while and when it was over everyone in the theater applauded and my friends and i were most definitely not disappointed in fact this film is one of the best comic to film adaptations since the original batman and is in my top ten list of my favorite filmsthe plot is fairly basic and if you are not a an avid reader of the comic book you will still understand everything that is going on i wont give the plot away but heres a basic summary of the characters professor charles xavier runs a school for gifted youngsters that shows mutants how to use there powers and teaches them to accept what they are in a world that usually doesnt accept things that are different he believes that humans and mutants can live together peacefully as one one man on the other hand does not share his views on humans his name is magneto he believes that humans be destroyed because they treat mutants so harshly and  that humans should believe that mutants are the superior life forms xaviers answer to mutants like magneto are the a group of mutants who fight for the benefit of mankind  and people who also share xaviers view on humans the consits of cyclops jean grey and storm caught in the middle of this is wolverine and rogue wolverine is a very aggressive mutant who is very confussed about his past rogue is a young girl who is has just discovered her mutant powers they seem to share some kind of bound that brings them together he vows to protect her and watch over her magneto has his own answer to people like the the brotherhood of evil mutants they consits of mystique sabertooth and toad now it becomes a battle between people who dont share similar opinions and the big question is whos right about the people mutants live amongstthe acting in the film is good all around they all fit there parts to perfection the stnadout performance comes from hugh jackman who is a star in the making he brings wolverine form the comic books staright onto the screen anna paquin is also good as rogue and the relationship between her and wolverine is very well written shes vulnerable without being too annoying the one problem with the acting is halle berry as storm not that shes bad but i feel that they shouldve given her more to do hopefully in the next film they will expand on that one other good performance is famke janssen as jean shes plays the part with smarts and sex appealthe action and special effects are great too the fight between mystiqueplayed pretty well by rebecca romyn stamos is so awesome and very well put together i liked the fight between wolverine and sabertooth on the statue of liberty but i felt it was a bit anticlimatic toad vs cyclops storm and jean is gret too ray park dazzles us with his great stunt and martial art skills and storm fans will lovre the outcome of this fighta great movie and director bryan singer you have put together a solid film kudos to you 1010,fantasy
 was one of the best movies of the summer i have seen so far yes the special effects were great but thats not all the dialogue was sharp and witty especially from the readytofight wolverine you also feel sorry for one of the lead bad guys magneto who has been different from society all of his life because he was survivor of the holocaust and is hated for being a mutant you see why he hates the human race so bad the relationship between rogue and wolverine is believable because they are both very different from the other mutants they share some type of best friend always bond this is a great directing job by bryan singer director of apt pupil which did nothing for me i hope there is a sequel in the making and if it is i cannot wait to see it,fantasy
first let me say that this movie presented a fantastic rendition of the classic comic book characters the it was interesting action packed and intelligent but since i am now acting as a critic by writing a review i must point out the minor flaws that this movie has let me start with hugh jackman the extremely talented actor who portrayed wolverine an extremely gruff violent unreasonable semisadistic and animalistic mutant although jackman seemed to put his all into this character he wasnt quite able to capture the roughness of wolverine jackman came off as a nice man playing a mean character and the absence of wolverines catch word if you will bub was not something to be addressed but i missed it oh another extremely minor detail about jackman wolverine is 56 jackman came off as approx 6 now lets address the character of rogue portrayed by the inspirational young actress anna paquin personally i think she is a pretty average actressconsidering she is in her teens but i thought the flaws of rogue were more the directors fault than paquins first off the character of rogue was brought out to be a southern teen mutant who had the ability to drain the lifeforce as stewart put it from any being she touches well the truth is roguepaquin is a southern woman who seems to be in her early 20s not a young teen girl that was the directors fault now paquins fault she dropped her accent for half the film she seems northern and she couldnt maintain the southern belle accent actually i think natalie portman queen amidalapadme in episode i would have been better considering rogue is a grown woman by the time she comes to professor xs school for young mutants but she was pretty good as rogue and did not bring the quality of the film down at all now lets look at storm the african mutant who in the comic books played an extremely important role storm was portrayed by halle berry who in my opinion is not the most versatile actress by far to put it politely shes rather limited the fact that her character probably had under ten lines and didnt play a pivotal role to the plot was a terrible injustice to the comic book character of storm who soon became a leader of the team she also had the paquin flaw dropping her african accent for half the movie and when she had it it wasnt too noticeable but i mean how can you tell if someone has an accent when their most important line is senator kelley is dead now we come to the issue of storms elemental powers she has the mutant ability to control all forms of weather rain snow lightning etc are  all at her command there were three instances where i thought that storms powers were underplayed first when she and cyclops james marsden went into a railroad station to try to find the runaway rogue storm is at a ticket booth when sabertooth tyler mane grabs her around the neck lifts her off the ground and starts choking her storm lets this happen for maybe ten seconds before she zaps sabertooth with a lightning bolt now if i were being throttled by a sadistic killer like sabertooth and i could control the weather i wouldnt wait until cyclops made an attempt to save me before i took action i would have zapped his behind to rhode island the second he touched me then later in the movie toad starts beating storm up while she makes no attempt to defend herself it is only after toad throws her into an elevator chute that she finally decides to do something about it then when the are trapped in the statue of liberty by magneto and wolverine tells storm to zap him and he reminds them that they are in a copper structure storm doesnt think to maybe blow magneto away with wind or part the earth beneath him hmm disappointing and i find it sad that since storm was really the only africanamerican cast member they should have given her a more significant role now lets look at cyclops who was portrayed by james marsden a seemingly average actor who had a very limited role in the comic books he has a very authoritative dont take any crap from anyone kind of mentality in the movie he lets wolverine mess with him and kind of lets him hit on jean who is his fiance but thats about it for him the last character i think had some flaws was sabertooth the sadistic animalistic killer who was portrayed by tyler mane first of all sabertooth is brought out as a mindless minion of magnetos in the movie truth is sabertooth is actually pretty intelligent and his own man then his claws come on in the books theyre like 6 inch daggers in the movie theyre like the witch finger nails you buy at halloweenand sabertooth and wolverine have the exact same mutant powers with the exception that wolverines claws pop out and can retract and sabertooths are always out this similarity is never really brought out i thought patrick stewart professor x and ian mckellen magneto were the strongest actors in the movie and were both great and gave the film a solidity that one doesnt often see in an action comic bookderived filmi also think that famke jassen jean grey performed fittingly for her role just four more things first sabertooth and wolverine were already fierce enemies before they came in contact with the in the movie they meet by way of the then rogue is not a younger teen when she joins the shes a grown woman third at the end of the movie when magneto is in his plastic prison and xavier leaves magneto after playing a game of chess with him one of the chess pieces falls making a ringing sound implying that it is metallic that is the catch ending but please you mean to tell me that everyone went to such lengths to put magneto in a special failsafe prison and they give him a chess set with metal pieces come on fourth the directors left out one of the original five members of the beast a blue furry monster who is strong agile extremely intelligent and fast if i am not mistaken the original were jean grey aka marvel girl originally cyclops wolverine storm and beast not rogue rogue comes around the time of gambit but thats a different story let me say again that all these flaws are extremely minor and i dont think that they bring the quality of the movie down at all i thought was xcellent and xtremely well done i am very glad it didnt suffer from the unintelligent beat em up mentality that the recent batman movies suffered i know i critiqued this movie harshly but i am a real fan of the and my standards were extremely high anyway most of the minute flaws were only noticable if you are really familiar with the comic books this movie came very close to reaching my standards and i could have happily sat through it again after it finished two words see it you will be very pleased i give 9 stars out of ten but im only 14 so you decide,fantasy
 was truly truly one of the best movies ive seen this year i was not disappointed at all especially by the performance of hugh jackman  he was the perfect man to play wolverine  all the other cast members also blew me away with their great portrayals of the superheroesthe effects were the best ive seen in a while  everything looks real even though they are computer generated  it was amazingas a child i grew up on the comics and seeing them alive on the big screen was a wonderful thing  i was also nice to see both comic fans and people who have never picked up a issue come together  the movie was great and i recommend it to people of all ages,fantasy
 i believe will evolve into the star wars of our generation the special effects much like in star wars were the latest and most dazzling of the day the actors and actresses you will learn to love if you dont love them already and the plot leaves you begging for more this movie is rightfully number one in the box office and i hope all who see it enjoyed it as much as i did i was an avid reader of the comic when i was a child and now to see it on the screen is amazing the acting sfx and plot were all amazing in the unquestionably best movie,fantasy
this was a bad movie  there was no character development at all  none the ending was pathetic  i kept looking at my friends and saying is that it  where were the amazing fight scenes made even better with incredible special effects  i saw maybe two fight scenes that were worthy of the comic book  where was the humor  i cracked a smile maybe twicemaybe  this could have been such a good movie  it was only about 1hr40min long they should certainly have developed the characters more and added something to the storyoh well,fantasy
excited to see the finally make the big screen and glad they waited so that it wouldnt be cheesy as some had feared  excellent casting job although a couple too many cameos in the moviekept things interesting however 2 thumbs up,fantasy
i started reading the a long time ago along with the counterpart xfactor i just have to say that i thought this movie was the best based on a comic series ever done it was definitely well worth the waitalthough i think that perhaps katie holmes would have been a wonderful choice to play rogue i did like anna paquins performance but the character i totally loved and can not for the life of me get out of my head is hugh jackmans wolverineas soon as he came on the screen i was entranced with him he just had a way about him and how he played logan that i would never have anticipated ill admit that i wasnt always a fan of wolverine in the comics but jackmans portrayal has shed a completely different light on wolvie i think he was a great choice for the rolethe other actor i have to praise would be halle berry as storm ive never really like berry in anything else i have seen her in  but i really liked her as storm i too laughed my ass off when ray park did his darth maul move at the elevatori also cracked up at the yellow spandex jokethe only bad thing i have to say about this movie is that the casting of janssen and marsden was kind of mismatched she looks too much older than himback when this movie was still a rumor i can remember thinking that the perfect choice for xavier had to stewart i am pleased to say that i was not disappointed at alli completely recommend this film to all who are fans of the comic as well as those who have never even read it all in all i would have to give it a rating of 15 out 10,fantasy
i must say that this was a great movie  the whole cast was excellent but the highlights were hugh jackman patrick stewart and ian mckellen wellwritten and welldirected  my only complaints were   too short  it was only 92 minutes   beast was not in it but since the movie promises a sequel i shall wait,fantasy
overal a statisfying movie  they did a good job good points very real to life in making the characters exactly like their comic book counterparts wolverine was done so well that he stole the show and it was good that this movie focused on him fantastic looking and perfect casting for the characters magneto xavier logan storm sabertooth and cyclops when xavier p stewart and magneto ian mckellan  god and monsters get together it is pure magic well done fight scenes that make the superheros show off their talents excellently bad points xavier and magneto feed off each other so brilliantly and i only wish the movie had more of them together on the screen there could have been a little more on the human fear factor how everyone was scared of all the mutant business at least they covered it in the movie i did not like ana paquins acting ability as rogue  she started off well but seemed to go downhill as the film progressed overall the good more than outweighs the bad probably cause i was so taken with logan after all he is my fav x men character  is it true that apparantly 45 minutes of this film went on the chopping bloc  i wonder what those scenes would have been like to the movie  maybe it could of had more dialogue and story explanation  me thinks though that they totaly went for the simple adventureactioneffects film  although that succeded i wonder what the other 45 minutes would have done rating 7 out of 10,fantasy
well what can i say this movie was xcellent though i have not been really a fan of when i first saw this movie it changed my whole perspective to comic books  although there has been many comic stories brought to the big screen in the past this movie was so far the best of them all the special effects and action sequences were the strongest point of this film so if youre into this kind of thing brace yourself this is one kind of a ridehighly recommended worth your time and money,fantasy
i dont know about anyone else but i have been disappointed with a lot of the tv series turned to movie movies that have come out  lost in space didnt do it street fighter just terrible and a couple more  they try and change the characters too much or the plot is stupid  was the exception  since batman came out in the early 90s i havent been impressed with a cartoon turned to movie till now  this movie was just great  the characters looked and sounded the parts while the plot was good  i cant wait to see it again  i never got bored and it was just plain good,fantasy
this is the first time in the history of film and comics that they actually got it right lots of people praise the first two batman and superman moviesi have a piece of advice watch them againno batman movie really explores bruce wayne as a character he chases around over the top bad guys who act like common gangsters in crazy outfits and only speak in catchphrases for the entire film he is also involved in a forgettable love story every time batman has no real interest in love only justice its an intregral part of his character we need a year one or dark knight moviethe superman movies are a little better but they really play fast and loose with his powers  telekinesis illusions white lasers that come out of his hand  the ability to erase loiss memory rebuildthegreatwallofchinavision also the superfake city battle in the second movie is quite lame  if it wasnt for gene hackmans fab performance those movies would be totally forgetableblade was a vampire movie and a mindless on at that there is not much in that movie that screams comic book except for the total lack of characterization inherit in most comic book movies  captain americastraight to video punisherstraight to video  and the hulktv movies were the absolute pits was a real movie not corny or gritty or cheap looking the esp wolvie and rogue acted like i would expect them to if the were real people  wolverine and cyclops were perfect together storm and sabertooth were a bit of a bore  did anyone catch who was who at the academy i saw shadowcat iceman and maybe pyrohes a brotherhood member in the comics maybe hell defect or betray them in the sequel  who were the super fast basketball player and the waterwalker are they actual characters or created for the moviei would love to see another movie and a wolverine solo movie i wish we could finally see wolverines origin which hasnt been revealed in the last 25 years  i havent read the comic since they got awfulpost claremont and i hope they finish that story somewhere,fantasy
this movie was one of the best movies i have seen in a long time it was a movie that you can take your kids to see most kids have video games or cartoon that are worse than this movie there were even a few funny comments scattered through the movie which provided a nice break from the action scenes i actually laughed more during this movie than i did scary movie the only thing i would have liked to see was a little more of toad ray park was awesome as darth maul and they didnt really show enough of him for me in i cant wait for the sequel,fantasy
i know absolutely nothing about the  i went with a guy who did and he was like a guide  he explained things to me about the characters that i needed to know  but after a while i began to realize that it was unneccessary for him to do so  the film did a pretty good job of explaining it all to me  and i was impressedthere was much left to be desired in this film but i think that was by design  i wanted to know more about professor x and magnetto  i wanted to know more about their friendship and their rivalry  how did it start how did it get to the point its at now and so on  but that is also a credit to the makers of the film because there is obviously enough material here to make a dozen filmswhat i enjoyed most about the film was that the bad guys were not really cut and dried bad  there was no true villain  i guess you could say that magnettos henchmen  and henchwoman  were more evil than not but magnetto was an interesting study  this is a man who was in a nazi death camp and he is being ostracized from society by humans that cant and wont accept another species as being better in some way than they are  the subleties of racism are not subtle here  there is a great line in the film when magnetto says something to the affect of humans are always afraid of what they cant understand  how true  there is also a scene in here that shows humans experimenting on a mutant and that is similar to what we do to animals mutants are treated like lab rats but what one of the underlying subtleties of the film says is that everyone and everything should be treated equal it is not up to us to play god and decide that just because someone or something is different than us that we should should arbitrarilly exterminate them  this is a deep movie disguised as a slam bam summer flick  i guess now i am just learning what comic book fans have known all along is a great story with many layers to itmy favourite character is wolverine  not only is he canadian but he is a rogue and quite the bad ass  he reminds me of a bit between a cross of han solo and luke skywalker  he is abrasive and cocky like han and he hasnt quite learned how to control and utilize his ability quite yet like luke in star wars  i would like to see him learn more about himself and his ability in the sequels to come  in fact i am looking forward to the sequels just so i can learn more about all of these characters  my friend told me that there is a lot more to the than what we saw on screen and he said that wolverine and sabretooth hate each other and are always battling  that is something i am looking forward to with great anticipation  and of course i want to know more about magnetto and professor x  this series should be treated as if no one knew anything about the history of the comic books if it does so this could really be a james bond type series where it spans 4 or 5 decadesi enjoyed this film  as i left the theater i wasnt quite sure what to think  it was good but it took me a while for it to sink in  once it did i realized that this is a great film and the fact that it introduced the characters just enough to garner my interest is also a bonus  i am now looking forward to perhaps 2002 to see the already greatly anticipated sequel75 out of 10 i have a feeling the next is going to be even better  there is so much more that i want to know and learn about these characters and a sequel is almost a guarantee  this is a great summer film and i look forward to seeing all of the characters back for the next one and one word of advice to the writersgive toad more to say next time  he was funny and he cracked me up with his childish like antics,fantasy
this is what i think  if you walked into that theater not knowing anything about the or good story telling and only cared about seeing the action displayed when two superpowered beings butt heads than im guessing you probably would have been impressed with this movie  i on the other hand was looking for a bit more  watching the movie i realized that each of the characters fell into only 1 of 2 categories  that was either good or either bad  watching a movie i like to look for the complexities of characters that can make them either essentially good or either essentially bad   this meaning that the characters decision to be either good or bad was not one made very light heartedly  take for instance magneto  in the comic book he isnt simply a superpowered villain who displays his superiority out of pure hatred towards mankind like portrayed in the movie  he was more so like a very well educated man who knew the stakes and simply did what he needed to do to survive  another example would be wolverine  now why wasnt wolverine a complex character in the movie  one factor which is understandable is the fact that they wanted to leave his past shrouded in mystery  i can live with that  but what i cant understand is why they left out the other half of his personality  before wolverine had ever joined the he had gone through a lot of pretty horrible things  he was a veteran of war like situations and had many years of life experience to his name  unlike in the movie wolverine was not just a loose cannon  he had much more to offer than just a wise cracking smart mouthed hard balled character   i can go on about pretty much every one of the characters  another thing i feel missing from the movie was the personal conflicts between all the characters  sure i know cyclops and wolverine went at it with some witty remarks  but thats not what im talking about  anyways in the movie the reasons as to why they went at it was left vague  in the comics it is easily recognizable  it was the fact that cyclops was a by the numbers kind of guy while wolverine on the other hand did what he felt was needed to get the job done regardless of anything  another tension builder between the two consisted with each others relationships with xavier  both of them were somewhat considered to be sons to xavier  cyclops being the good child and wolverine being the problem child  of course the problem child receives more attention in an attempt to figure out the problem leaving the obedient good child becoming jealous of their relationship and building an undertone of hatred and animosity towards the problem child  this is where a lot of the conflict between wolverine and cyclops evolved from  again i can go on and on  but to make a long story short i am merely trying to say this the movie did not fail in its translation of a comic story to a movie story as most of you probably think im getting at   i believe where it really failed was in its translation of the comic characters to the movie characters  having the characters as clear cut as they were in the movie makes it really hard to feel any form of remorse for magneto who if you dont remember has been through a lot of horrible events which partially forms his attitude decisions and train of thought  magneto is not simply another villain out to conquer mankind but more so a a part of a persecuted race of beings just trying to live another day   in the movie it is hard to feel that any of the characters have any real thoughts about what is happening and what has already happened and thus it becomes hard to feel triumphant for the victors and remorseful for the defeated  in truth all the characters are just trying to accomplish one goal survive   no one is completely good and no one is completely evil  i dont want characters that come off as cliche and easily categorized  i want characters that people cant easily agree on and be able to get something from and question with themselves and others their beliefsat last in reply to myself i fear a movie like this will never be made and this is for one very evident reason  the i long for existed only in its earlier generations where characters such as magneto and xavier were modeled after such political activists as malcolm x and martin luther king jr and was written for a target audience of older men and older women while the of today not to say that it lacks the same intellectual stories as the previous it is written for a new target audience of males ages 1022  so hence the movie in order to appeal to the entire audience felt they must sacrifice intelligence and complexity to appeal to the younger fan base  but this is also incorrect  given the right writers and proper direction even my movie could be made and appeal to fans of any age and even those who have never heard of them before,fantasy
i have 15 years of comic books at home so my expectations of this movie were high and i wasnt dissapointed yes there are things i might like to be different but this movie had to create balance between what comic book fans insist upon and what strangers to this comic universe need to understand it and it acheives that goal admirably hitting all the big points the comic book strives for while making it accessible for those whose whove never heard of wolverinemight greatest hope is that in the sequel storm my favorite character has a more central role,fantasy
ummmlest anyone think that this movie has a hidden undertone against the religious establishment let me remind you when this comic first was created that was not the message the message is about discrimination in generalmagnetos history with the concentration camps draws a parallel between the holocaust and the backdrop of modernday sentiment against mutantssecond reading some of the very few negative reviews of the movie i am reminded that it could be the best movie ever with the best plot ever best characters ever and best dialogue ever and someone would still have to give it a thumbs down im one of those people who wasnt thrilled by id4 or jurassic park i need a plot and character development to really like a movie even with as big a star wars fan as i am i can admit that phantom menace was ok this movie on the other hand impressed me trust mego watch the movie and then judge for yourself,fantasy
after the slooooowwwwwmotion of mi2 and the stacatto leaps of gone in 60 seconds and the strange colors and images of pitch black is just refreshingly pure normal brilliant cinematography with seamless special effects and a superb cast from start to finish moves along at a racy pace seeing the two classically trained actors stewart and mckellan face off is worth the price of admission in itself watchout hollywood theres a new villain on the scene apart from that the rest of the cast were good although with a couple their mutant gene may have overshadowed their acting and delivered strong performances,fantasy
to quote a friend of mine this is the movie ive been waiting for i grew up reading the so i was very apprehensive about the idea of them making a movie could hollywood pull off such an endeavor without making it too campy or too hollywood are those two things disparate not sure the first five minutes put my fears to rest the characters are right the dialogue is right the story is righteverything clicks and it wasnt just a special effects extravaganza like weve become so accepting of from hollywood of latethis one has a story character development etcin shortgo see it whether youre a fan of the comic or not this one is sure to please,fantasy
plotcrunchmutants are a reality the normal population fear them and want them gone many mutants live in fear until professor x stewart a mutant himself opens up a school where all mutants can find refuge and also learn how to control their powers a specific group of mutants led by magneto mckellen have a nasty plan reserved for the masses and its up to professor x and his team of brave students to stop them its a freak war that will blow your mindthe lowdowni cannot compare this film to the comics its based on cause i never followed them but on its own i must say this is a very good movie a solid platform to build a franchise on first off the casting is dead on and i predict a new star in the guise of hugh jackman wolverine the man looks like a young clint eastwood has rough charm to boot and knows how to move when it comes to fight scenes wolverine is by far the more interesting character in the film and trust me you will love him i appreciated that the movie took its time to set up its situation and main characters it makes the last 20 minutes of slam bang mutant action way more rewarding the visual effects are top notch and the combat scenes rival the ones we saw in the matrix prepare to be dazzledmy few complaints are a the movie has many characters but spends most of its time developing wolverine and rogue in the process it leaves other main characters in the dust storm berry cyclops marsden and the villains were way underdeveloped i guess well find more about them in the sequelsb ian mckellen is a wonderful actor and when magneto was out of costume he worked but for the life of me i laughed my butt off when i saw him in his get up metal helmet and all i would compare the feeling to going to a rave and seeing a 60 year old dude flashing glow sticks and sucking on a lollipop he just looks silly maybe a younger actor would have been a better casting choicebut enough nit picking this film delivers on most fronts has a likeable cast wonderful visual effects a good story breathtaking fight scenes some humor the bantering between cyclops and wolverine is hilarious great heroes and amusing villains i especially enjoyed the morphing ass kicking mystique enter the world of theactingpatrick stewart is professor x he doesnt have much to do but hes the perfect chive for the part hugh jackman has a cool name and gives life to one of the most interesting antiheroes of the year wolverine walks the walk and talks the talk i couldnt get enough of him anna paquin rogue also does very well her vulnerable show will surely touch you and her scenes with jackman are amazing rebecca romijnstamos mystique has maybe one line but shes by far one of the coolest villains in the flick she has a bod to kill for and knows how to whoop that ass ray park toad also does good in a mostly physical part he brings some humor to the film and even gives us one of his darth maul movestyler mane sabertooth lets the makeup do most of the acting cause he doesnt have much to do but look menacing he didnt do anything for me either way but he does have a great fight scene with jackman ian mckellen magneto gives another solid performance he brings depth to the character and we understand where hes coming fromtoo bad he looks funny in that funky helmet famke janssen dr jean grey and james marsden cyclops dont have much screen time but bring lots of presence when theyre on janssen is sexy and marsden is witty cant wait to see more of them in the sequel halle berry storm looks amazing in costume but is very underused also what is up with that accentit comes and goes like the flugoreno gore but some kool cartoon violence and amazing effects i loved the mystique design the toad tongue and the wolverine clawsdirectingsinger is very effective giving the film a comic book feel but somehow managing to also keep it grounded in reality it makes the fantastic scenes more powerful an example would be the police showdown with magneto he moves the film at a fast pace gives us some kool shots and well directed fight sequences good showsoundtrackthe score is very under whelming a bit more juice in the music would have been appreciatedbottom line fans rejoice the film gives the comic book justice movie fans rejoice we got ourselves a good summer movie that will surely thrill you the movie looks slick has a sympathetic cast good writing good production values and a kickarse ending and for all you marvel fans out there lets see if you spot the reference to the comic book wolverine and another marvel hero that goes by the name of iceman i for one am looking forward to the sequel already i cant wait to witness more of the world have a blastbulls eyethe film was shot in toronto canada hugh jackman is australian and will surely follow in russell crowes footsteps,fantasy
i used to collect comics when i was younger so as a former hard core fan i was a bit skeptical as to how good a live action movie on the subject would be i am happy to say that the movie is wonderful entertainment i liked bryan singers take on the story a moody introspective tale thats closer in spirit to unforgiven or the wild bunch than batman watching patrick stewart and ian mckellen inhabit their roles and play off each other was a treat although should we expect anything less from these two actors especially impressive is hugh jackmans deadon interpretation of wolverine  this man is a very talented and charismatic actor who will hopefully go far in the businessthe reason i did not rate this movie higher is because of the not quite air tight construction of the overall work also many of the characters storm mystique and toad in particular have only a few lines and we never really get to know them beyond the action sequences this is not to take anything away from what the film has accomplished however this is easily one of the best super hero films ever made is there a cinematic franchise in the making if they keep the tone similar to this film we might finally have a sequel to look forward to,fantasy

i first heard rumour of this film coming to be several years ago when it was discussed that patrick stewart would play professor xavier  i hadnt heard anything since then until i saw a poster at the theatre  it was worth the wait  if you are an fan you must see this movie  it was great action and great fun,fantasy
it now being monday i have seen once every day since it was released last friday  the 4th time today at 130pm mst was just as awesome as the 1st time at 320pm on friday  hugh jackman is positively amazing  he did for wolverine what jim carrey did for andy kaufman  patrick stewart once again proves that he is not just jeanluc picard and the beautiful rebecca romijnstamos proves she has some awesome screen presence  aside from every scene with wolverine the thing i loved the most was cameo appearances by pyro iceman kitty pryde and jubilee  this movie was everything i hoped it would be and i have new faith in comictofilm adaptions  it is up there with the matrix for me and i can not wait for the sequelsmy rating  out of the wittle dwagon,fantasy
as a longtime reader of the comics i was having doubts about how well it could be made into a movie especially considering the long chain of crappy comic book movies that preceded it batman 24 superman 2 captain america bladeneed i go on  but now that ive seen it i hope that bryan singer comes back because he made one hell of a cool movie  was well written very true to the comicseven making some character improvements toad for example is much better in the movie than he ever was in the comics  was very well cast especially patrick stewart ian mckellan tyler mane a perfect sabretooth ray park and hugh jackman once i saw that lump of crap known as mi 2 i was so very happy that dougray scott didnt play wolverine  they wouldve had to change his name to ferret  the special effects were fantastic and at the same time not so overwhelming that they took over the movie  without a doubt this movie is a drama with great characters and plenty of history to back it up all in all congratulations should go out to the entire cast and crew of for making the first comic book movie since batman that didnt insult the history behind it  lets just hope that marvel can keep this in mind when they go to make spiderman and the soontobe endless chain of comic movies soon to come,fantasy
 was almost perfect just the right amount of action mixed with humor at all the right times with impressive visual effects everything i would expect from bryan singer as far as directing goes but the movie was only 96 mins and it left me wanting more it was originally over 2 hours which may or may not have been too long i would have liked to see more of wolverine by himself and also more of the school i also would have liked too see beast as he was one of the original my biggest complaint was the line that storm gives before she shoots toad into the water it was just too corny other than that great movie,fantasy
possible spoilers the things that really bothered me was that most of the characters werent the right age and being a great fan of and having read all the comic books i know that jubliee and shadow catnot to mention some of the others that made little cameoswere not at the academy at the same time nor were they the same age also the story of how rogue came to be with the is totally wrong there is no chemistry between jean grey  cyclopsnot even a little kiss and jean grey  wolverinethe attraction wolverine has for jean grey is tottally unbelievable the best thing in the movie is the sexual chemistry between rogue and wolverine was i the only one to notice ok so shes only 17 but i still think they should have been romanticly linked by the end of the movie of course im just a romantic sixteen year old girl so you may not all agree but you have to admit that theres definetly great chemistry between them the villans were all good but i didnt really enjoy cyclops or jean greyof course i have never liked them in the comic books either famke janssen is too old and boring as jean grey and james marsden is too young and annoying as cyclops halle berry on the other hand is great as storm although she is terribly underused only given a handful of lines and hardly any screen time hugh jackman is perfect as wolverine as is anna paquin as rogue also i think the film was way too short  but overall i give this film an 8 out of ten stars and a 10 out of 10 if i had never read the comic books,fantasy
ive seen an advanced screening of in boston and i went in with high expectationsbeing a fan of the and i came out with very little problems with the movie  one was the lack of character developement and the running time  i know i cant blame character developement on singer or any of the writers because they filmed flashbacks of origins of scott summers and ororo munroe but was forced to cut it for fox because they felt there was not enough action and running time was the same case the movie was excellent  the character portrayals of the actors was on the nose  marsden was a great cyclopsscott summers and he made the love triangle between him  logan and jean grey awesome newcomer hugh jackman was a great wolverine  not too over the top gruffness like the animated series but gruff enough he was the tough guy with a heartfamke janssen played jean grey well  showing emotion for logan but knowing her love was with cyclops halle berry made the best of her part  she wasnt an integral part of the movie but she was a good addition nonetheless mckellan and stewart both were on the nose with their charactersthe brotherhood of evil mutants was a different matter  very much background characters but i loved them all overall a great movie and i would be surprised if it wasnt a top grosser of the summer and spawn a sequel ,fantasy
 left me pleasantly satisfied  i was not blown away nor did i feel like cinema had been redefined  but i felt that what i had seen was very good bryan singer and his production team have overcome pretty formidable odds  fan  studio pressure reduced time and money iconic source material not to mention a lastminute actor replacement hugh jackman for dougray scott  to create a nicelypaced intriguing and wellproduced fantasy adventure with strong performances good action scenes and welldone special effects almost as fascinating as the film and the hype has been the aftermath mainstream reviews from folks like roger ebert and michael wilmington at chicago tribune have ranged from underwhelmed to outright dislike  while on the other hand response in alternative press scifi fansites and fan postings has been overwhelmingly positive where lies the schism i wonder  comparing some reviews i find it almost hard to believe that everyone watched the same movie  one person accuses the film of drowning in special effects while another says there are not enough  a critic decries the lack of character development while a noncomic book fan says they clearly understood each characteri will be the first to admit the film requires a leap of faith just to accept the initial premise  that genetic mutation would result in divergent and fantastic abilities like weather control and laserbeam eyes  it seems that everyones ability to suspend disbelief and buy into the film lies at a different level a problem that also occurred with singers the usual suspects one of my personal favorites i will also agree that the large number of characters has resulted in unbalanced plot development with a lot of exposition time and ciphers abounding  halle berrys storm is an especially unfortunate casualty barely registering until the action and then not as tough as her comic book counterpart  i am guessing a lot of this is due to the 45 minutes the studio had singer cut from the movie however those details did not detract from my overall enjoyment of the film or taking pleasure in what i regarded as its successes the film benefits enormously from singers deliberate decision to play everything straight without the camp that marred other comic book ventures when humor does occur it grows naturally out of the situation and attitudes cyclopswheres my motorcyclewolverine youre a dick  i also liked the fact that the actors all underplayed their lines  amid the fantastic trappings and special effects overthetop villainy or histrionic heroism would have destroyed the film when the action scenes kick in with digital effects explosions morphing and wirework kungfu singer still keeps things very straightforward and matter of fact  he does not dwell upon the fantastic nature of what is going on nor drag out the fight scenes for the sake of fighting  take the initial wolverinesabertooth encounter and subsequent rescue by storm and cyclops  each being uses their powers according to the rules laid out  nothing is delayed for artificial dramatic effect it just happens  no one talks when theyre fighting probably cause in real life no one would this approach does remove an emotional element from the fight scenes that occurs in other films ie the matrix but that is because singer as always has goals that are more intellectual than emotional  the climatic destruction of magnetos mutant device and rescue of rogue is not what interests him the most but the aftermath and what it says about the characters  wolverine has proven himself to the team our novice heroes have had their first trial by fire magneto now knows how far xaviers team will go to stop him  again much of this is inferred  singer does not spell it out which i found to be a welcome change though the film generally moves well it does have an episodic and stop  go quality  this did not bother me too much since the original comic books tended to be episodic though i am guessing part of this is actually due to lastminute rewriting and studioimposed cutting most fascinating for me was the realization of the extent to which manifested all the fears and fantasies of childhood through adolescence as children we often feel small and helpless  the origin of magnetos contempt of mankind is traced to the boyhood trauma of watching his parents killed an honest fear even i can recall experiencing as a young child marierogue embodies adolescent terrors of puberty budding sexuality and the feeling of isolation which extends to all mutants at the same time we see images of what we would like to be  cyclops is the handsome cleancut hero  as xaviers number one guy hes the jock prom king guy who dates the cutest girl in school  we awkward nerds might hate him as wolverine does but we also envy him  at the same time wolverine is that other side boys fantasize about  tough streetsmart rebellious a loner  hes the superhero equivalent of james dean  then there is professor x  wealthy allknowing allpowerful  and the guy in charge the film is dotted with other childhood fantasies running away from home rogue beating up bulliesauthority figures mystique to senator kelly its because of people like you i was afraid to go to school anonymity mystiques shapeshifting powers contrasting ones size or limitations professor x is handicapped but telepathic toad is ugly yet a deadly killer  returning to a previous thought if we fear lack of control then our desire for control is represented by storm weather professor x thought and jean grey matter perhaps this explains the split  fans tend to be younger than critics maybe the film speaks clearer to them  i have noticed that people who have seen the film close to my age 27 or younger have enjoyed it the most for us we still feel a bit like,fantasy
i went into expecting nothingim gladthe biggest problem with this movie is that it was about an hour too short leaving absolutely no time for any character development  the only who had any depth to his character is wolverine  the rest of the cast may as well have been played by cardboard cutouts because there was no depth or development of any of them  i guess when you put 6 or 7 superheroes in the same movie there just isnt time to show how any of them tickits a shameit wasnt the worst comicbookturnedmovie ive ever seen but it sure wasnt the best  c,fantasy
i just saw for the second time and its still worth seeing for me dont believe what the critics have written because if it aint the english patient or some other story from the heart its not good enough for them though the plot is a little thin as far as magneto deciding to use rogue to turn all the world leaders into mutants its still entertaining  i stopped reading the comics several years back when they started doing crossovers and making new xtitles it became a lot to keep up with  plus the cartoon ended  but this movie is just as good as any other comic movie  it stays mostly true to its characters except for rogue and its just cool to see cyclops and storm on the big screen though both say hardly anythingthough i generally think sequels are a way to capitalize on the success of the first film and dont live up to expectations a sequel would do well for  this movie is very much about wolverine and rogue  i think the brotherhood with the exception of magneto spoke a total of 5 lines throughout the whole movie  the action sequences were cool but the character moments were just as nice to watch  i hope the sequel can show more of thatsome quick thoughtswas it just me or did it seem like everyone passed out and had to be hooked up to tubes at least once  did prof x really need 20 tubes attached to his headsomething about sabretooth kept reminding me of heman the movieits a little hard to believe humans could imprison magneto in a plastic cell  but i guess thats where the sequel comes into playwolverine has some great oneliners  to jean whats your super power putting up with him  just as funny as youre a dickstorm had a great fight with toad at the end but that line what happens to a toad when hes struck by lightning a little too comic booky for me,fantasy
even though the movie winked out halfway through because of a severe thunderstorm i found this movie to be one of the most enjoyable movies ive seen this summer the special effects were on par or above par in most scenes my only big complaint was that anna paquin just didnt fit into the rogue role it was her body type bottom heavy when she should have been top heavy the wolverine character was excellent all in all though i would still rather read my comic book,fantasy
as summertime blockbusters go this is as good as it gets being a long time fan of comic books particularly the this movie has been overdue its about time for marvel to catch up with dc but in the end it was well worth the wait thank you cgieven if you havent followed the comic book and maybe youve never heard of the see this movie its packed with action special effects comedy and even a little human drama who hasnt felt like a mutant detached from humanity at one time or another i wanna be cyclopsbryan singer the usual suspects has kept his success rolling as a top hollywood director and with talent like patrick stewart as professor x did you have him picked for that part as well and ian mckellen as magneto how could you go wrong newcomer hugh jackman as wolverine im countin ta three fore i pop my clawsis outstanding oscar winner anna paquin was fabulous as rouge as well as bad guy sabertooths tyler mane add the stunning halle berry as storm and beautiful famke janssen as jean grey and the circle is completethis movie is a fantasticfun two hour detachment from reality so grab that popcorn and coke sit back and enjoy excelsior,fantasy
having read the since childhood i was prepared and eager for a major motion picture to be made for over twenty years  given the lack of technology inspiration and motivation by marvel comics when they were still a strong company it has taken these many yearswith the initial facts of casting location and rumors of possible story ideas i was sick with what hollywood was trying to do with this enjoyable mind provoking story  then i saw the first internet teaser  hmm maybe i wasnt giving this movie enough credit  then the first full length theatrical trailer and the second and the third  i wanted to see more and more as the days went on leading to july 14th  i reverted from a complete adult loyalist and fanatic to a kid bursting with anticipation to see his heroes on filmsinger does a fine job of translating a chapter from 40 years of history to film  where i hated the casting choices before the movie and still uncertain about some even after i have to say my biggest doubts were overcome in wolverine  hugh jackman a virtual unknown from australia lists in his profile that he is 62 and weighed 160 pounds before filming can you say beanpole  for the readers of the comics we know that wolverine is so likeable because he is short mean sarcastic and the best there is at what he does  upon hearing jackmans casting as the little ferocious furball i was illas it turns out jackman with the addition of 15 pounds of muscle delivers the best performance from the ensemble cast  of course the two heavy weights mckellan and stewart were good as usual  though there was no back story and extremely little detail of the other characters aside from names and powers it was fun to see them all transformed on film  the biggest problem this movie had was the complete alteration of an already complex mind blowing story  i guess hollywood has to do what its got to do the plot was extremely weak as well  with that 40 years of history they could have come up with much better but then i guess thats why they went through 9 writers before they finalized this current scriptall in all its a great ride and just the right amount of time  in this day of 25 to 35 hour long epics comes in at a wonderfully short 15 hours  tell the story get to the action and move on to the sequel singer has done just that for this first installment of what is sure to be the rival superhero franchise in films between marvel and dc,fantasy
the movie was very good  i also thought bryan singers apt pupil was quite good too  there was two scenes that i really loved in this movie  they were when wolverine attempts to regroup and succeeds by calling cyclops a dick  the second one was when wolverine sliced the bartender shotgun in halfthis movie was action thriller drama and scifi all put together  a lot of wolverines wisecracks were hilariousjust couldnt wait to get my shirt off again huh you call that a landing you are so full of st and what do they call you wheels this is the stupidest thing i ever heardthe movie was really good  hugh jackson played wolverine really well  i gave it a ten,fantasy
no spoilers here just wanted to let the purist know that as someone who collected the comics for years and knew the official comic mythos  this movies newly created mythos fits like a glove and you will love it bryan singer has just launched a big career as he directs this sonotlikeasuperhero film that we never have to suspend our disbeliefwe buy everything thats happening at all times  you also care deeply about the charactersthe doubts are over  hugh jackman is wolverineyounger maybe in his looks but every bit the wolvie we all know and loveand gives a fantastic performance  anna paquin does great as rogue as welland they make great use of her original mutant power throughout the filmthe effects are top notch and die hard x fans will go nuts as the individuals powers are showcased very well  make no mistakethe action when present is breathtakingand you get some really great scenes but the movie doesnt rely only on the eyecandy by no means  like the matrix they do a great job of creating this other world that exists within our real world  i hope they get crackin on the sequel right away its going to be a long wait,fantasy
i saw this on its opening day of july 12 in australia having watched the animated tv series about 9 years ago i knew a fair amount about the x men but i wasnt a long term fan of the comic never bought one so was i expecting to grow to love the characters of this bryan singer film in only 2 hoursyes from magnetos heartbreaking separation from his parents to rogues near fatal bedroom pash to wolverines xtreme fighting introduction i was instantly gripped by these characters the writing was flawless the plot moved along very fast but for an action movie i was amazed how little this adventure was plot driven and how majorly it was character driveni couldnt believe i was looking at hugh jackman the musical theatre pretty boy as the meanest toughest superhero of them all wolverinewhat an acting standout he even stole the show away from patrick stewart and that is no small feat when i saw how far down the list anna paquins name was on posters i thought shell be lucky to even say anything in the movie let alone act up to her potentialall i can say is the on screen pairing of wolverine and rogue is cinema magici cried when that scene you know the onelet sleeping dogs lieoccurredin fact the whole movie overwhelmed me emotionally i went wow at the action and most action movies dont do that to me seen one building explode youve seen them all but the fight scenes especially the one on top of the statue of liberty were fantastic it was also symbollic to fight for justice and humanity on the symbol of liberty i thoughteverything was spot on the bickering of cyclops and wolverine the calm cold war chess game mind set between proffessor x and magneto and the mesmerizing body of mystique made sure i didnt look away from the screen once during the whole movieheck i even stayed right to the last credit in case there was a one shot to give a clue of a sequelthe best comic book to screen adaption ever even outdid superman the movie and that is the ultimate compliment1010,fantasy
yes nine years i was a freshman in high school when i first picked up a copy of wolverine and was introduced to the world of i immediately fell in love with the characters and was reading the trade magazines to find out when i would see a movienow the moment has come and it was worth itthis was definitely one of the best comic book films that this comic book fan has ever seen it had none of the problems that most comic films have the dialogue wasnt cheesy it was very realistic the look of everything was also realistic without being untrue to the comics i cant believe that they got wolverines hair rightthe changes to the characters backgrounds werent anything that made me mad or dramatically changed the characters nothing like the joker killing bruce waynes parents they basically just put the characters together at a different time then when they all met in the comic in the end it made the characters they chose work well together without 10 hours of background story to cover 35 years of comic book developmentall and all i have to say that they presented a very dramatic movie story and fully used these amazing characters to their full potentiallets hope spiderman is this good,fantasy
fear the mutants no more a long time fan of the comic  series i found this to be a spot on interpretation of the decades long saga the script was terrific and provided a well balanced story that within its time constraints including the cut scenes introduces the characters and the story very well and wont leave the general public scratching their head the pacing of action sequences added immeasurably to the story and special care was taken to ensure that the sfx werent too over the top meaning that you could actually believe the characters have their powers performances all around were fantastic stand outs being aussie hugh jackman as wolverine and anna paquin as rogue best of all you dont have to be a comic geek to enjoy this movie have marvel finally got their big film franchise you bet,fantasy
after having read the comics for years and years i was glad to see this movie  well done and a lot of fun  wolvie was right on  the interaction between the characters was perfect and the acting was great  i will be going to see it again this week i think,fantasy
finally marvel has gotten this right after miserable showings from previous ventures such as captain america the punisher and fantastic four movies which im sure no one besides myself and a few other diehard fans have seen marvel delivers the goods with joins the ranks of the dc movies that made it big ie superman and batman shines thru out and true comicbook fans will not be disappointedi liked the movie because of the great performance by hugh jackman as wolverine hugh jackman makes this movie and he does a great job portraying the brooding roughedged wolverine the typical outcast superhero i think hugh was the best possible choice for this role he also has some of the best lines in the movie in fact you could change the name of the movie to wolverine and it would still do wellunfortunately all the attention that wolverine gets detracts from the other characters in the movie their characters seem almost a sidenote to the wolverine story patrick stewart does a stellar job as professor x but i wish he had more lines and a bigger role stewart was destined to play this character the resemblance to the comicbook character is uncanny as in uncanny however i think his screen time was a bit short in sum i would have liked to have seen the other characters developed a little more as wellall in all the movie kept me glued to my seat throughout there just enough unanswered questions to set itself up for a sequel just like a comic book does until the next issue i also thought the translation from comicbook to movie was well doneit was well worth the price of admission and i would gladly see it againxcelsior ,fantasy
finallythis is what a summer movie should be grab your popcorn and enjoy the ridei want to be logan aka wolverine and im 31 the last movie i felt this way about was star wars back in 77,fantasy
my biggest concern with the film was that it would either be a matrix clone or a camp version of the comic financially speaking the former would make sense and the characters do lend themselves to a simple blastem up effects show fortunately for us bryan singer and his writers 9 at last count have made a film that dares to be intelligent and character driven in a field of summer lowintelligence crap as a long time fan i was greatly impressed with what the filmmakers have accomplished from its opening shots of a polish holocaust camp you know youre not in for one of the joel schumacher directed batman craporamas that would seem to the only way a comic book movie can be made these days rogues entrance is handled with extreme seriousness and anna paquins terror at her first use of her powers is believable and connects the audience with her immediately wolverines appearance is also memorable with hugh jackmans silhouetted head gulping a beer down right before beating the youknowwhat out of a canadian trucker the only problem with wolverines introduction is that after being told to get out of the bar he leaves his beer behind logan would never do that there are a few plot problems which probably could have been fixed with a few lines about how thes inexperience leads them to lose their fights at the start and how magneto seems to be sheltering those mutants whose outward appearance would never be accepted by humanity hopefully in the sequel theyll add nightcrawler to the roster to counter that sure there arent as many fight scenes as we might want and that probably has more to do with budgetary concerns than lack of ideas but whats left is a wellphotographed intelligent statement about intolerance that sits underneath one of the best comic book plots done on film hopefully the success of the film will allow more money for the budget and a little more action that said i also hope they dont give up the intelligence of the series for a simple series of action scenes its a great start much better than we could have hoped for but i think it may ultimately alienate mainstream audiences who go into the film expecting explosions and getting magneto in a holocaust camp at the beginning of the film and quoting malcolm x at the end now lets see about adding a little more action into the mix and where the heck was colossus,fantasy
ive been reading mostly good reviews of this movie and with good cause its an absolutely great movie  the only only problem with it is that it was too short  but i guess thats okay cause it set up for a great sequel if you didnt like this movie youve either never heard of the before or you just dont like to be entertained for some reason,fantasy
bryan singers views like the comic reads  with masterful subtlety real intelligence and selfdeprecating humor the audience is constantly aware that theres more going on in the characters lives than is being shown and every word every gesture affords a look into those deep watersand if hugh jackman isnt a russell crowesized star by this time next year ill be shocked ditto anna paquin famke janssen and  yes  even ray park and if the usual suspects was an audacious debut singers more than delivered on the promise it made with this brilliant affecting entertainment better sign this crew up for the sequels now fox  their stock is going to shoot through the roof,fantasy
the are the best team of superheroes and now they are finally on the big screen the reason why the are so great is that you can actually relate to all of them in some way here are the in the movie  the telepathic leader professor charles xavier patrick stewart the telekinetic and telepathic dr jean grey famke janssen cyclops james marsden who can shoot an optic blast from his eyes and the weathercontrolling storm halle berry rogue anna paquin and wolverine hugh jackman become the two new rogue can absorb others memories and if mutant powers wolverine has the ability to heal himself rapidly and has an adamantiumlaced skeleton that comes with three claws which pop from his knuckleson the brotherhood you have the master of magnetism magneto sir ian mckellen the shapeshifting mystique rebecca romijnstamos the fierce sabretooth tyler mane and the extremely agile toad ray park by the waymystique pops up in the least expected placesthe special effects are awesome and the fights are greatly done  this may be a spoiler  my favorite fight is between wolverine and mystique but i dont want to ruin anything for you so i wont tell you any more about this scene  there are many more fight scenes that are great and just as goodi would give the a 11 out of 10  really is a great film you all should go see it,fantasy
i hardly got words its like ive viewed other peoples true life on the screen ive waited for this a long time and was so afraid of being disappointed but my heart was beating rapidly my mind was reeling and i felt alive because i had experienced what the had experienced with them respect is the key word here the filmmakers had respect for the foundation of the characters respect for the story the comic book and theyve also made a great movie a great story movie buffs will enjoy this too i enjoyed every second of it it should have lasted for 5 hours and that is the only mistake i can come up withabsolutely wild amos,fantasy
five more minutes with each character would have made this movie a 9 rogue and wolverine were developed as were magnus and xavier but we never got a feel for cyclops jean storm or any of the bad guysfor example the sexual tension between jean and wolverine wasnt fully developed and so the conflict between cyclops and wolverine was superficial mystique toad and sabertooth were basic thugswe saw their abilities but not their personalities worst storm was nothing more than a pretty statue what motivated her why was she therethose of us who followed the characters exploits in the comic books may have taken our knowledge of the characters for granted i know i didi loved the film my wife however had no idea who those people were before she sat down in the theater so while she enjoyed the action and the special effects the characters were little more than trained monkeys to her i was ready to give it a 9 but she thought it was a 5so after seeing the amazing way singer developed the divers characters in the usual suspects im deeply disappointed in his treatment of thes heroes and villains maybe 2 will do better,fantasy
while not being a huge fan of the comic books the movie was true to the universe that i knew of from the comics and the animated tv series  i could not of imagined a better suited cast for the movie everyone was perfect in their roles especially hugh jackman as wolverine  he was everything that i imagined wolverine to be  bryan singer was perfect for the job as director bringing a realistic vision to the movie and not bringing it down to the depths of a hammy comic book adaption  the writing was also good it had good pacing and plenty of funny moments and hidden surprises for the xfans out there  the only problem i had with was the length  it should have been much longer i felt that there were scenes that went by too quick that should have been longer and the back story behind some of the characters should have been fleshed out more hopefully we will see a longer version for a dvd release  all in all an excellent film  highly recommended even if you dont follow the comics,fantasy
as a onetime fan of the comic i wasnt expecting such an enjoyable screen adaptation patrick stewart dignifies every project hes involved with hugh jackman is wonderful as wolverinecrusty suspicious but goodhearted almost in spite of himself id see it again to watch these two do their stuff,fantasy
i felt the movie was great overall the choice of actors was good halle berry has the body but not the voice iman has the voice for the role jackman was really great as wolverine and i was especially happy that he didnt use the australian accent he has my biggest gripe was the use of secondary characters i didnt like the idea of pyro in the movie bobby drake was good also if they got another girl that looked a bit more than kitty pryde it would have been better too also the use of guyrich was bad too,fantasy
this movie rocks  everything about this movie is great  the performances were absolutely stellar especially hugh jackman as wolverine the special effects were out of this world the storyline was even better the only complaint that i have with this film is that it shouldve been longer  if you havent seen this movie yet go see it you will not be disappointed  well worth your time,fantasy
this move was fantastic i knew very little about going into the movie and the only characters i knew a little about were wolverine and storm the cool thing about this movie is that it is very easy to follow if you are not an reader or if you arent into scifi i should know because both apply to me i recommend this movie because it combines witty dialogue and great action along with wonderful characters this is a must see i saw it twice in its first 2 days out ,fantasy
i avidly kept up with this movie on all the rumor pages i could find online and i dont regret it at all  half the things i read were wrong anyway so i expected things that never happened  however all in all i think this movie has proved that marvel comics can translate to film successfully  and jackmans wolverine was amazing  he was able to keep some aspects of the character and still add his own interpretation  anna paquins rogue was the same way different but still interesting  she also has potential in the sequels to become more like the original character  my only complaint with the movie was that it should have been longer  they could really have explored everyones relationships with each other better,fantasy
first i must say that a special hats off to hugh jackman for his impassioned performance of wolverine next i got the feeling that bryan singer desperately wanted this movie to be great he was obviously a little out of his element here but he succeeded in making a stark realization of this wildly complex comic i collected and wolverine up until onslaught and i have to say that waiting for this film was only second to waiting for episode i sadly i have to say that this film out did star wars from start to finish i was not disappointed  some of the character development on characters needed to be fleshed out but on the whole i loved it  i left the theater with a big smile on my face and a warm spot in my heart  i was excited and proud of everyone attached to the film hats off guys,fantasy
despite some of the negative reviews all of which seemed to take the movie way too seriously  was an excellent summer blockbuster  im a long time fan and a live action movie can never fully live up to my expectations but as long as the movie was entertaining without being stupid see just about every other comicbook adaptation  i would be happy  i was ecstatic  for the most part great acting  hugh was outstanding as wolverine and toad was an unforgettable character  mystique and rogue were nice surprises  they were a lot of fun  from 2 characters i thought might bring it downthe movie was choppy and could have been a little longer to explain more to nonfans but still it was great start and i hope to see some sequels  i think it can get much better,fantasy
 delivers a fun motion picture which holds fairly true to its comic book origins  some of the characters were surprisingly better than i would have expected  toad rocks cyclops was 100 in character a few others were somewhat disappointing sabertooth rogue storm   the failure of some of the characters seemed to be script oriented not leaving tyler mane a chance to act  all in all its a must see for fans and a should see for fans of fantasy scifi and action,fantasy
this was tremendously satisfying film i read the comics during the 70s and 80s and have always been impressed with the series writing this film did not disappoint it was fun it was true to the characters and it didnt alienate people who dont know the like my wife who really loved the movie it is in my opinion the best super hero movie yet yes even better than batman at its best,fantasy
i have sat through my share of comic booksturned moviesdick tracy superman batman etc etc was different it lacked the traditional cheese that directors seem to incorporate into this genre i walked out of the movie impressed with bryan singers vision of this story the good guys and the bad guys were just so cool that i found myself torn between who was the coolest he also did a great job setting up the premise of the story with sufficient background so that the first time watcher would still be able to follow the story and care about the characters they picked the best actor to play wolverine hugh jackman who portrayed wolverine as a troubledteeteringontheedgeofgoodandevil man equally strong performances from rogue xavier and magnetodont wait until video get the full effect of surround sound theater and be prepared to be dazzled by some great effects and oneliners that make you laugh overall gradea,fantasy
i saw it last night and i really enjoyed it of course im not a diehard x men fan so the missing characters didnt bother me the special effects are amazing and the acting is great all around im looking forward to seeing it again and any sequels that come out,fantasy
im not familiar with the comics or the cartoon but found this movie to be one of the best action films ive seen in a long long time  yes i got the yellow spandex joke ive seen pictures of the characters of course  and i had one up on most of the people in theater  the darth maul tribute move toad does in the fight scene was over a lot of the peoples heads but i laughed so hard i thought i was going to be sickexcellent  bravo  my only problem was that it was much too short of a film,fantasy
i thoroughly enjoyed this film it should satisfy the passive fan me and the fanatic a note to said fanatics if you want a truly pure adaptation of a comic this complex youre talking about a fivehour film that costs 200 million dollars or more the filmmakers have retained the most vital aspect of the comic its spiritgoing in i was concerned that with so many complex characters to introduce and get to know the films creators would have trouble fitting it all in and not sacrifice story fortunately bryan singer and writer david hayter understood that even though this is a team of super heroes there would need to be a central character or two that are the storys focus even better they choose perhaps the two most interesting to build the story around wolverine and rogueits no wonder that logan aka wolverine is one of the most popular characters ever drawn in a comic book for one thing the footlong claws made of an indestructible metal called adamantium that shoot out of his knuckles snikt that he has trouble controlling at times along with the claws his entire skeleton is laced with the same adamantium much of his life is a mystery to himhe doesnt remember how the metal got there nor even where or when he was born and i havent even gotten to what his real super power is he heals really fast but still feels pain and has the heightened senses and reflexes of a wild animal for my money perhaps the coolest comic book character ever created like the other mutants of the his powers are both a blessing and a curse the claws and metallaced bones come in handy when he gets into a tussle but they also leave him at the mercy of thes archenemy magneto who controls all metalsin the film rogue anna paquin a teen who has just discovered that she is a mutant runs away from home and ends up in western canada where she comes across wolverine hugh jackman this struck me as a huge coincidence the kind that only a movie can get away with but then it occurred to me that professor x played by patrick stewart thes leader may have placed a hypnotic suggestion in rogues mind to go to the canadian rockies to the exact town wolverine was in i figure this because in the films first big action sequence the two of them run across some bad mutants sabretooth and toad and are rescued by two of professor xs students cyclops james marsden and storm halle berry i suppose the writer thought wed figure all this out for ourselves while all the other mutants in charles xaviers school have powers that are useful rogues seem at first only a curse any person she touches she absorbs their life force plus their personality traits and super powers if any this leaves the person she touches weakened and depending on how long the contact lasts comatose or dead the prospect of a life without the possibility of real human contact is unimaginable especially for a teenageras the story progresses we find out that magneto has plans for rogue wolverine adopts her as sort of a big brother and swears to protect her he has every reason to fear magneto but bravely faces up to him anyway who laced your bones with that wonderful metal magnetos question to logan is one of the weirdest lines youre likely to hear in a movie all year loganwolverine also finds himself siding with magneto in a way seeing that humanity is getting ready to wage war on their kind this is consistent with the comic and makes logan difficult for the rest of the team to trust magneto ian mckellanperfect casting is in the process of recruiting mutants to join him in his planned counteroffensive against the rest of humanity driving the political steamroller against the mutants is us senator robert kelly who believes among other things that mutant teens should be banned from public schools because they can be considered lethal weapons a very timely issue to introduce its hard not to empathize with magnetos view hes seen what happens when a government turns against an entire race having survived a polish concentration camp in wwii illustrated in the films gripping opening scene all signs point to a witchhunt aimed at the mutants and hes not going to stand around and watch it happen his plan doesnt even involve killing hes not out for world domination but merely wishes to change peoples thinking xavier knows that bloodshed is inevitable however given magnetos by any means necessary positionthe films not perfect its based on a comic so it has to be campy at times theres also a few story flaws for instance when rogue runs away from xaviers school for the gifted xavier needs to use a machine that enhances his psychic powers called cerebro to locate her even though shes only a few blocks away at the train station cyclops and storm are sent to find her and are again confronted with sabretooth and toad a minor character in the comic but causes major trouble for the here then xavier gets the police involved using them only as a shield and endangering their lives as a result im pleased with this scene because its almost as if the police arent even there just like the comic would do the only scene where xavier and magneto really do battle its one of the films best and most imaginative then mystique another magneto loyalist flies in and picks magneto and company up in a helicopter why would a guy as powerful as magneto need to escape in a helicopter theres also a brief ode to star wars seemingly for the benefit of those who actually liked episode i in which ray park who plays toad strikes a darth maul pose tacky and unnecessarylike the comic professor xaviers team is still a workinprogress still learning how to work together and to use their own super powers this vulnerability creates jeopardy and gives the franchise somewhere to go over the course of the series there will be several of these films im sure theyll master their powers and teach newcomers how to use theirs the final scenes leave the door open for the inevitable next chapter for which i will wait with bated breathgrade b,fantasy
overall i was pleasantly surprised  id seen all the hype and despite the abysmal track record of comicsbased movies i had allowed myself to get excited about the movie  and i wasnt disappointed i give it about a 91and ill probably buy it when it hits dvd,fantasy
my only complaint is that they gave rogue a name  besides that i thought this was the best movie ive seen this year and the best super hero filmthe acting was excellent especially hugh jackman  he portrayed wolverine very accurate  i think most of the characters were accurately portrayed except mystique of course i also have never realized how boring cyclopse isi recommend going to see this once or twice or three times  i know i am,fantasy
first off ill apologize right now for the cheesy summary line  i couldnt help myself as for the movie i was quite impressed with what in my humble opinion has to be the best comic book adaptation yet  many fans of the comics were understandably worried about this movie  after all weve waited a long time through rumours of its production stories about setbacks even the occasional rumour that the attempt was being cancelled altogether why does it seem so difficult to make a movie of a stan lee comic while dc comics are turning into movies left right and centerhowever after seeing the first teaser trailers several months ago the xcitement sorry again began to build  patrick stewart as charles xavier ian mckellan as magneto  how can you go wrong with thatafter seeing the movie i was very impressed  after all its often difficult to adapt such largerthanlife comic book heroes and their trials and tribulations to the big screen  in comics and cartoons you can get away with much more in the movies it seems to be much more difficult to suspend disbelief and yet retain the flavour of the comic  the movie did an admirable job by taking one of the older stories of thes fight against senator kellys attempted pogrom against mutants and adapting it to reflect todays current woes of racism and prejudicethe casting was terrific from the aforementioned stewart and mckellan roles to that of newcomer hugh jackman as wolverine  he was spoton as the surly shorttempered maverick of the and he even looked the part although with those sideburns almost anyone can look the part  we even got a look at how magneto came to be and why hed be so twisted by the plight of mutants  its a shame we couldnt see more character development for the other but its difficult to do when youve only got 2 hours to work with when the comic had several years to develop the history of these people  perhaps the inevitable sequels will give us a better glimpse at how each came to bein all i found the movie to be very enjoyable i was even able to ignore for a little while the fact that it was shown in what has to be prince georges worst theatre wornout seats stained screens overly salty popcorn and an outdated sound systemif youre a fan of the go see it although i dont really have to tell you that do i if youre not a fan you just may become one afterwards  im already looking forward to a sequel where we may meet some of the other hank mccoy the beast gambit morph maybe even a cameo from spidey himself  that is unless the spiderman movie gets a shot in the arm from this release and swings its way into the theatres a little sooner,fantasy
i love this movie  i plan on going to see it again  unlike sad attempts to bring batman to the big screen connects  the action is awesome and the story in between sequences kept me interested  true the absence of other is too bad but obviously theyre planning on making a sequel so give them a chance to introduce others  go see this movie as many times as you can it was the one movie ive seen this summer thats been worth my 8 bucks,fantasy
maybe i just didnt get it because ive never read the comic but this movie did very little for meif i go see a special effectsfuturistic actiontype movie i expect for my senses to be overwhelmed at several points during the movie and the action to cause my heart to rush at times  did neither for me some of the effects were interesting but the action was generally so slow and fairly predictable that it just wasnt very interesting from that standpointthe movie still had a chance for me if it had an interesting story  but the storyline was very simple and plain with no major twists or turns or surprises  there was no good guy decides to become a bad guy then changes his mind at the last minute type of stuff at all  it was a pretty boring story overallthey also started to explore this whole love interest thing between wolverine and one of the female who was already spoken for but that never went anywhere and had no impact on the story whatsoeveri was perplexed at the end of the movie as to why any of that was in therei just didnt get that at allsorry to all the big fans but as a movie i cant recommend,fantasy
wowspecial effects have finally caught up to the comic world but without making major characters into cgi  the movie stays true to the comic providing not just the action but the plot devices and intercharacter interactions we loved in the comichugh jackman was fabulous as wolverine and patrick stewart did a great job a portraying charles xavier  the rest of the cast also did a very good job i was even impressed with ian holmes performance as magneto who i had thought was illsuited for the role when i first heard about itthe only thing missing that they could have done a great job with was the danger room  oh well maybe in the sequel,fantasy
finally a movie based on a comic book that they didnt screw uphaving been a longtime reader of the comic books i must admit that i had some trepidation attending this movie  after all i remember how disappointed i was after seeing batman 1989however this movie works on two levels for those who are fans of the comic book and for those who have never read the comic bookthe characterization of the their enemies and surrounding cast all remain if youll pardon the pun xtremely close to their comic roots there are some slight liberties that have been taken but none that should offend the avid comic reader  i was totally blown away by hugh jackmans portrayal of wolverine  it was outstandingfor those who have never read the comic they too will appreciate it the plot is selfexplanatory packed with action and two great headlining actors ian mckellen and patrick stuart who were absolutely fantastic picks for magneto and professor x respectivelymy prediction is that this will be the biggest movie of the summer for 2000,fantasy
i had never read the comic books so the only thing drawing me to this movie was the chance to see patrick stewart as professor x  i was neither disappointed nor confused  the characters were welldelineated the script was both funny surprising and serious  the theme of intolerance was handled superbly  the action scenes were amazingyou really felt like these characters could do all these amazing things  but the film really benefitted from some wonderful performances  after this hugh jackman is wolverine  his performance still makes me think two days after seeing the film  patrick stewart and ian mckellenmagneto spar admirably and although you know who is good and who is bad the line between satisfyingly hazy as it should be with such a complex issue  the best part of the film was the relationship between rogue anna paquin and wolverine    the rest of the actors do very well with their characters and you just know that the sequels will be even better as long as bryan singer is the director and the scripts are kept to such exacting perfection  i recommend it highly as the best action film this summer not to mention in a long timeboth exciting and intelligent  go see it now,fantasy
hugh jackman did a wonderful job of bringing life to the lost sole of logan wolverine logan has been my favorite character for years and hugh did it masterfully bryan singer did a good job of bringing the whole movie together and bringing it to the screen in his own unique way the movie didnt have the goofy comic book feel that to many have when they go from paper to film the film made it appear lifelike mutants could exist and it wasnt far fetched this is clearly the best movie of the summer this is a wonderful film for all ages to enjoy i saw with my wife and she liked it im looking forward to the sequels i saw this one on opening day and am going to see it again and i dont like to see movies at the theater more then once,fantasy
commendable casting suitable special effects  for a comic conversion this film rides well along its ambitions  ian mckellan and patrick stewart make the most out of the standard good guybad guy archnemesis relationship hugh jackman also lends an excellent helping hand in his portrayal of logan a down and out loose cannonhowever as a fan of the comic since the 80s and as a writer i feel the script falls far below what the film could have been  the strength of the comic lay not in the wild fantasy of a world where genetically evolved beings exists nor in the particular heroism of these particular characters but in the constant human drama these characters took part in  for the most part the story didnt need to be so belabored with explanations of powers or sinister plots but rather should have focused on why these characters were placed in the situations they were in  we were given a glimpse of magnetos past which gave a bit of insight to his motivations but the others were enshrined in mystery which is perhaps the intention the chance for a sequel seemingly goodthe special effects computer generated images massive explosions  overused rotocameras may have been enough to distract the average teen fan from the holes in the plot but at the expense of acquainting more mature audiences with characters in a situation which reflects existing racial tensions one of the issues which the creators of the comic sought to addressquite simply this is a film about fantastic heroes and a foreboding threat to mankind instead of being about a group of individuals feeling their existence threatened at every turn  these are singlefaceted characters come to life on the screen who have no resemblance to adults or oppressed peoplea pity,fantasy
comic book  fan or not you will enjoy this movie  the film is plot driven with twists and subtle turns not often found in an action movie  and of course there is the action and special effects we have come to expect in our age  there are differences that will disappoint the marvel comics readers but also some that are engaging which cant be said for all screen adaptations  the movie is well cast excepting cyclops and focuses on wolverine who is well played by hugh jackman even if he is taller than the 54 character  the movie is not an ensemble but relegates even patrick stewart professor x jean luc picard for you trekkies to a supporting cast role despite his strong performance  the movie certainly was a hit for my 13 and 11 year old kids and was appropriate viewing for children their age without excessive violence or adult content  there is some minor swearing there is obvious sex appeal for the adults in addition to the story and action  while famke janssen strong resemblance elizabeth hurley as jean grey halle berry as storm and rebecca romijnstamos  mystique will keep the men entertained my wife couldnt stop talking about wolverine on the way home  theres not much that i can say about the plot without giving too much away other than as expected bad guys try to take over the world and good guys try to stop them  certainly an old premise but done with flair ian mckellen does a masterful job of portraying the villain magneto without being over the top and maintaining a believable quality  in the end the movie left several openings for a sequel and the audience wanting more  as a fan of the comics etc i expected an ending with a little bit more flourish but was more than happy with the overall film 8,fantasy
the superhero film is a much maligned genre  in most cases this reputation is well deserved  face it  most superhero films stink  above the usual duds there are a few that stand out as adequate or slightly better such as superman or batman1 but even these miss the mark  the common failure with these films is that they do not capture the essence of the heroes involved in the stories  they too often ignore anywhere from 1050 years of history and they simply cover a typical story with a heros insignia or they parody what is wrongly regarded as only a kids genre they miss the comic book  does not  more than any superhero film ever it stays true to its source  it captures the spirit of 30 years of the uncanny  it treats its characters and subject matter seriously and makes it easy to believe that superheroes do exist in the world of this film  they are not campy parodies or distant icons but real heroes  the genre has always held tremendous potential  its nice to see someone finally capture some of that lightning,fantasy
an ok movie but not a great movie the story is not compelling maybe because it tries to stay too close to the original media the powers are cool at first but become quickly boring some of the give the impression they themselves arent very familiar with their own powers as if they just discovered themsave your 9,fantasy
from the time i was 11 until i was 15 i admit i came home every day and watched cartoons  and i loved them  so when i heard that there was going to be a movie i couldnt wait  but oh the wait was worth it  i dont care how many screenwriters it has many props to joss whedon of buffy fame or the fact that there was no danger room this movie flat out rocked  bryan singer is an amazing director and his touch kept from being campy and heavyhanded  hugh jackman as wolverine people in two years you wont be able to escape this guy  but why would you want to he was absolutely amazing for fanboys and nonfanboys alike hey im a chick the embodiment of everything wolverine could would and had to be anna paquin as rogue  you may laugh but she made me ache what with the canttouchyou problem and the inner strength  what i mean is just because she doesnt look like rogue in the comics doesnt mean she cant be rogue  i think it was a great opportunity for her to flex her acting ability a bit and hopefully in the sequels you know there will be shell really get to use the whole flying aspect of her power too  halle berry was not however the person for storm  growing up on the streets of cairo i think not  angela bassett would have been awesome to borrow an idea from the stranger  scott marsden played cyclops exactly as he should be a bit of a selfrighteous jerk but basically a good guy  famke janssen looks exactly like jean grey and patrick stewart was his normal elegant selfvillans  ian mckellan is great at whatever he does but even the magneto getup towards the end made him look like a little lego man  ms romijnstamos played a great mystique watch how guys in the theaters crane their necks for a better view and ray parks martial arts skills formerly showcased as darth maul were missing as toad  however did you catch the epone jokeall in all i very much appreciate the main arc of the story being wolverine and rogue not cyclops and jean  they were always my favorites  it was wellwritten wellacted all that good stuff  this is definitely the new yardstick to judge all comic book films by from now on  kevin smith is right in saying its one of the top five  its plain awesome which is exactly why i ended up dropping 16 this weekend to see it twice you have to so you catch all the little things you miss the first time  i cant wait for the sequel,fantasy
the movie has a lot of actioni saw that it had a lot of special effectsthe acting was alright and it could be a little better throught the movieother than that it was ok,fantasy
bryan singer has done it  without question the movie has done justice to all that i wanted it to be and more for a 100 minute movie it takes into account a complexity of character developments an intelligent plot mind blowing special effects and very well acted performances from all the cast especially hugh jackman ian mckellan and toadi will not talk about the plot but it is good the story line reveals itself with a great pace and i was actually tense in so many scenes that i could feel the hair on my back rise with the sound effects and the way the movie is shotno one will be disappointed  and to bryan singer hats off sir ,fantasy
i liked the comic book of so when i heard that this movie was playing i immediately wanted to go my favorite character is wolverine the visual effects in this are the one of the best others include the perfect storm if you dont have anything else plan go see,fantasy
dont want to add to any spoilers for this film i wish for anyone wanting to see it to be as surprised of its quality as i am i saw the preliminary character sketches for this film and was horrified at what the costuming and overall appearance of the characters were now ive done a complete 180 nearly everything worked in this film only really lacking was a kickbutt score for it im a firm believer that music accents the emotional value and can add a great deal of excitement to any given scene music was a bit weak but the rest was a gem first comic book to film adaptation i have ever seen that the characters actually had depth this should be a benchmark for any future comic book projects anyway go and see it and see it in a big dts or sdds sound screen youll be anxious for the sequel when you leave the theater great action mixed with explanatory and character building scenes and was actually very funny in spots,fantasy
ive been a fan of the comic series for a number of years and was delighted to see the treatment given to the the film has just the right blend of action and drama to keep you glued to the screen and the large numbers of students glimpsed in the mansion are sure to keep folks on the net identifying them for months  well worth your money even at full price  the only negative comment i would have is that it runs a bit short at circa 90 minutes next time lets get a full two hours worth of the dark phoenix saga,fantasy
this movie was pretty good in how it was madethere were no holes in the plot and i cant really say that there isnt anything that i didnt like the movie was more organized than the animated tv show different characters different plot very good,fantasy
if youve read the comics youll be happy with this adaptation and youll be the part of the audience that gets the yellow spandex joke my friends that i saw this with who were not familiar with the beyond the promos also enjoyed this very muchwolverines original costume in the comics was made primarily of yellow spandex,fantasy
ok this movie was great people have been saying its the best comic movie transfer everit would have been if they didnt make bladebecause that movie was amazing out of a million high points there were three drawbacks1 all of the characters from the comic were not in it 2 it focused too much on logan eventho he is my favorite character i wanted it to go deeper into the others history and 3it went too damn fast i was loving it then its over overall i loved it i give it 2 thumbs up and 5 out of 5 stars,fantasy
its about time for a marvel movie to be great  blade was good but is a great film  it hits all the right notes and doesnt descend into camp and self parody  hugh jackman is amazing as wolverine i didnt for an instant doubt him as logan  his scenes with rogue anna pacquin also excellent were believable and often touching  although the rest of the cast didnt have much to do i have high hopes for the inevitable sequelthe whole cast does an excellent job even if they dont have as much to do but jackman pacquin and ian mclennen bring real heart to what is simply one of the best superhero films ever made  its really hard to contain myself when im talking to friends who havent seen it yet who ask me how it was i cant wait to see it again,fantasy
after seeing today i decided to check out some print reviews many critics liked this film but some didnt thats not particularly unusual but what is unusual is some of their reasons for doing so of the dissenters i mean some say that the film is too serious whatare they saying they would rather have seen another dimwitted idiot summer movie filled with oneliners we ready have that in judge dread godzilla and batman  robin when they see a mindless movie they complain that it isnt serious enough when they do see a serious movie they complain that it isnt campy enough theyre all a bunch of winers if you ask me do not listen to them go see this movie,fantasy
i will pay this film my highest compliment  i want to see it againit was much more than i expected especially after reading some lukewarm reviews about the characters that aficionados felt were missing the special effects and other trivial minutiaebut  for someone me that has never read an comic and knew nothing about the characters this is an exciting welltold story with characters that had the boldness of comic book characters all told in a visually gripping stylethe story would appear to hinge on wolverine but it makes a smooth transition to the real lynchpin of the ploti am quietly grateful that hugh jackman was a last minute replacement for the actor that was originally scheduled for the part of wolverine he has an incredible intensity and screen presence that cannot be entirely attributed to his character  he rocksanna pacquin as the mutant unsure of who she is and how she fits in  either in the mutant society or the real world  turns in a performance with just the right amount of angst and still is believable and can be taken seriouslyone of the naysayers in another review i read said that halle barry was misscast as storm  i disagree  she is undeniably beautiful and looks more like a comic book hero especially with her blonde mane than anyone else in the filmian mckellen gods and monsters was suitably chilling as the evil magneto and dr xaviers patrick stewart arch nemesisray park darth maul from star wars was supremely disgusting as toad  i ended up wishing he had more screen timebut what held this film together above all was the dialogue  there had to be a certain amount of exposition for the non audience but it had the basics of the story and moved the plot along at a steadily increasing paceall things said i was not able to find many faults with this film and i cannot wait for the sequels,fantasy
being a diehard fan of the comic book genre i feel compelled to voice my opinion on this move  like all the classic popular comic books the transition to the big screen from the colorful pages of marvel comic was poorly done  the creators of this movie took too many creative licenses with the characters making them almost unrecognizable to their comic book counter parts  they cast a group of children to play the parts of adults and their selection of stars left much to be desired  the original were more then just a group of kids with strange powers they had definition and soul on the pages you actually cared what happened to them in the comics  however this is not the case on the big screenlets start off with cyclops he is portrayed as a mere child immature at that and not nearly as tall as he should have been yes i know im nit picking but its my review so tuffjean grey since when did she become a dr  and most of all when did she loose her telepathyrouge in the film she couldnt decide weather or not to hang on to that southern draw or give it up  from what i remember rouge was born and raised in louisiana and was raised by mystique who forced her to duel with ms marvel and absorb her powers making her virtually invulnerable and be able to fly  none of that was explained in the moviewolverine probably the only one that they did get right although they should have bulked him up a bit morestorm by far the most underrated character in the move whose idea was it to get halle berry  again they made her into a 2 dimensional charactes they never touched on her claustrophobia or her pastall in all the move was exactly what i expected it to be a cheap money making knock off attempt to bring the famous marvel name to the big screen did any one consult stan lee on this moviethe thing that ped me off the most was the costumes so much so im not even going to get into it  id write 5 pages on that aloneso for you hard core fans of the who think they are going to see a really good version of our marvel heroes brought to the screen all i can tell you is save your money,fantasy
when i went into today thats rightaustralia got a movie before the us for like the first time i was preparing for a let down ive been a huge fan of the cartoon and up until a year or two ago the comic however when i went in even from the special effects at the very beginning i was impressed this is one of the very best movies ever the storyline didnt move along too fast nor too slow as seen in some other comicturnedmoviemovies eg spawn and every scene was written and performed well the fight scenes at the end of the movie in and around the statue of liberty were absolutely amazing i especially loved the fight between mystique and wolverine  at least the first oneso yeah it was an incredible movie that even someone who didnt have a clue that it was a comic before would get it enthralling clever exciting and action all the way through a must see,fantasy
unlike most summer movies the perfect bore mi2 this is about the characters not the effects  despite that you get cool effects good action and some solid laughs on top of the deep characterization the movie centers on,fantasy
turning a comic book into a full length feature film is either wildly successful or a terrible flop  in recent years comic bookturnedmovies have left much to be desired judge dredd spawn  i went into expecting it to be good and i was pleasantly surpriseddirector brian singer does an excellent job of making the characters seem real as opposed to cartoonish or just actors wearing bad halloween costumes the opening scene is as powerful as anything to come out of hollywood since saving private ryan  the settings are realistic as opposed to the overly gothic style of batman and the intrusive colors of dick tracy  it is basically a few mutants fighting it out in an otherwise regular worldthe fight scenes are well thought out and the mutants powers are used effectively  for example magneto renders wolverine defenseless by controlling wolverines adamantium frame and claws  also the powers are not overexaggerated allowing clear winners and losers in fight scenesthe plot was solid and as intriguing as possible  of course it has to be some largescale diabolical plan to alter humanity or destroy it as in any super hero movie  the outstanding aspect of the plot is that it is a main story with interesting subplots often left out in comic book movies  we see the struggle between mutants and humans between magneto and professor x and genuine character development of the with an emphasis on wolverineim sure comic book stalwarts will be quick to point out several inconsistencies between the film and the comic book but i encourage them to dismiss it  you dont have to read 30 years worth of comics to appreciate the film but fans of the comic book should not be disappointed eitherthe entire cast gives above average to outstanding performances  hugh jackman is excellent as wolverine and the chemistry between ian mackellan and patrick stewart is just what the relationship between magneto and professor x calls for  despite comments from critics that anna paquin is too young to play rogue she delivers in that role as well although more of a southern accent is neededin short expect many sequels as there are quite a few ways the film can go the last 10 minutes scream for sequel and there is probably already plans to make it besides we still have to meet the beast gambit and a slew of others,fantasy
if youre an fan you will love this movie this is the best adaption of a comic book into a movie i have ever seen the movie mainly focuses on wolverinehugh jackman and his relationship with rogueanna paquin they both did a great job with their roles you believe that they actually care for each otherthere are some cool action scenes but what makes the movie is the development of the characters the only complaint i have is that the movie is too short you want to see more of these of characters i heard that they cut out 45 minutes of material i hope they include some of these scenes into the dvd release this was great comic book movie so all fans should definitely see this movie,fantasy
yes the movie does deviate a bit from the longstanding history of the as detailed in marvel comics however none of the changes were loathsome except perhaps to the comics purists everyone did a superb job of developing their characters some with very few actual lines to work with wolverine and rogue probably got the most screen time and hugh jackman and anna paquin did wonderful jobs,fantasy
i sit here reading your reviews and want to cry  comic fans are moaning about minor variances from the comics and the fact that wolverine just isnt short enough  summer blockbuster fans are complaining that the effects just werent big enough  most everyone seems to be missing the point  the as a comic as a series and as a movie are not about frustrating minutiae  they are about fighting racism living in a world that to quote the comics as well as hugh jackman hates and fears them and most of all they are about family  this was the greatest comic book movie since superman and may have even surpassed it  but more over this was one of the greatest movies i have ever seen  yes i read the comics but that only heightened my enjoyment of the film  the cast and crew are to be commended for a truly xcellent movie  they did not choose to go over the top with effects or inside jokes or anything like that  singer made an outstanding movie that would impress audiences across the board without letting down hardcore fans  how anyone can question this movie is beyond me  as a fan there were some discrepancies i didnt care for but they paled in comparison to everything that was done right  and for those of you whining about the effects im terribly sorry this wasnt matrix 2  thats not what this movie was about  the effects were there but they were merely the punctuation  some characters were a bit underdeveloped but with a core group of 6 heroes what could you really expect  cyke and storm werent the foci of this movie but still managed respectable parts for themselves and finally i weep for anyone who could not appreciate the final scene  this was a sheer masterpiece the music the dialog and the final move xquisite,fantasy
before i mention the movie in general my praise goes out to hugh jackman he brings such depth to wolverine that i forgot my bitterness at the exclusion of gambit  while recent comic based action films have developed into over priced rehashes of the 60s batman series is so much more than that  its true that not every character is developed but bryan singer did an excellent job considering the movies running time  plus as any comic fan might realize how many times did you actually see sabertooth in the comics before his motivations were discovered  this movie is an excellent blend of action character development and humor  it isnt the most action filled summer block buster mi2 nor is it the funniest scary movie but it is certainly the most entertaining and worth the ticket price  it manages to do what few movies canappeal to all movie goers the brains who want a story will be satisfied but not at the expense of anyone who wants a great action film  even if you have never read a comic it is definitely worth seeing,fantasy
i was a little weary when i had heard the were going to be made into a movie  at first sight of the guy who was playing wolverine i feared the worst  i mean what are you gonna expect from a bunch of people running around in spandex  thankfully however we were spared spandex in place of leather  i dont believe they couldve picked a better cast for the  halle berry was kinda weak as the part of storm  hugh jackman amazed me  even though he was much taller than wolverine he played him exactly like you would read in the comic  i was amazed  he has the character down  other than wolverine i enjoyed rogue  besides her being a total babe she did a great job  anna paquin was perfect for the role  the other actors were decent for their roles  patrick stewart makes a good professor x  ian mckellan an okay magneto but nothing like youd imagine from the comicall in all i think this movie did the comic justice  except for a few complaints it was good  i didnt however see cannonball or colossus in the movie  go figure  and who knows maybe the xfans will get their wish next time around  what better mutant to kick off the second movie than gambit least thats what theyre saying  ill definitely be in line for the next,fantasy
this movie redefines comic book movies  not since batman has there been a real quality movie made taking a plot line from a comic  this movie had it all  great story line great characters humor action and ray park  i will probably end up seeing this movie several more times before it leaves the theaters,fantasy
well i went in expecting good things and i was not disappointed  as with any comic the main plot was weak but there was reason behind it  they took the time to really get into the characters not all of them mind you but it was still very well done  bryan singer is an excellent director and i think i will continue to be impressed by his work  i only hope they bring him back for the sequal  i feel that this movie will do well and expect other comics to make the move to movie form shortly because of the success of the movie,fantasy
for the normal person this movie could be an okay movie to go see but for fans of the original comic this is a lot more than just any moviealthough i did enjoy it i found myself wondering why the movie has to be such a setup for a sequel because of the whole setup there really wasnt much time for any real plot story or character development singer the director did a good job on most of the details of the their powers but seemed to try to include too much information that he couldnt fully explain or elaborate onhowever hugh jackman as wolverine was amazing he brought the real human and edgy qualities of wolverine out into one person and made him more real than many of the other characters ian mckellen and patrick stewart were also really great in their scenes togetheroverall i liked the movie but there were a lot of places where it could have been better maybe if the studio hadnt rushed singer and made him cut nearly 30 minutes it could have been better but for now well have to wait until the second movie if it happens to see what can really be done with the story of thew andrew powell  the gate,fantasy
after much anticipation has arrived and it is one hell of a ridethere is little to criticise as the characters are established well and the fight scenes are evenly dispersed throughout the special effects are flawless and the action is wild however this would have left me cold if the plot dialogue and the characterisation had been ignored however the team behind have succeeded in every areathe few sore points in the film were as follows though 1 storm was grossly under developed the few bits of dialogue she was given were truly lame and she was the only sore point in the cast however this was not halle berrys fault but then again she did not look to be enjoying herself in the role 2 despite wolverines one liners the film for me truly lacked a sense of humour a few more laughs would have made the film a little less serious and was sorely needed 3 senator kelly was not a powerful enough presence however i say this only because he was the centre of the add  campaign yet where was heand that was it that is all that i didnt like the rest was excellent the standouts were obviously hugh jackmans wolvering who is being universally praised anna pacquin exuded innocence and the sex appeal of the comic character while also giving a very moving performance she was definetly the biggest surprise of the film mystique was amazing she was the perfect villain she had one line but the way she moved her eyes and her eventual fate was all spot on another surprise was ray parks toad who provided some nifty moves and some much needed comic reliefall in all one hell of a movie the two ppl i saw it with were nonfans but they agreed it was one hell of a ride im a big batman fan and this almost knocked the original batman from its perch they now sit side by side as the definitive comic to film translations so far however 2 has plenty of potential grade  a,fantasy
i saw the movie last night and was presently surprised  as a kid i collected the comic books so was quite intrigued by the movie  a few glitches from comic to movie but otherwise a good plot  the children of the atom are facing their most evil foe in magneto  the must stop magneto from turning all the worlds leaders who attend a un summit on ellis island into mutantsgetting patrick stewart to play charles xavier was a stroke of genius can anyone else see a resemblance between the two of them   anna paquin playing rogue is a bit iffy at times but she plays the role well  but the character of logan aka wolverine was the best  all in all i was quite pleased with the plot of the movie despite the glitches that ill put in goofs,fantasy
i am a fan of movies that do not conform to the traditional hollywood three act formula movies that break away from expectations and focus on character rather than effects and hence based on descriptions i thought i would enjoy much more than i did  let it be known that i have never read an comic and thus cannot compare the character development to those well loved tomes  the acting in the film ranges from charismatic and wonderfully larger than life mckellan jackman to awkward and forgettable halle berri sp and the effects are less impressive than i expected its not a bad film just not a particularly involving exciting or thrilling one  it seems ultimately like a long elaborate setup for a much more thrilling sequel  there are too many heroes for any tension to be built in the action scenes when you have so many mutants to save the day where is the danger and the climactic battle between magneto and the seemed like the middle of a movie not the end  i left the theater feeling like they had forgotten to show the final reel the one where the heros come dangerously close to failing and have a huge showdown with the bad guys resulting in one spectacular battle to the end  i guess i expected a comic book movie to satisfy the typical summermoviearc and this one did not  somewhat entertaining but wasting too much potential,fantasy
finally the blockbuster of the summer has arrived  want to take a actionpacked thrill ride loaded with some of the best visual effects terrific acting jobs and some of the best oneliner humor in recent films if so then you owe it to yourself to see  and soonplotline revolves around the plot of an evil mutant who is out to wage war against humanity and his old friend and now arch rival who believes that humans and mutants can coexistthis is such a star studded cast that im going to tone down my usual critique of the actors to insure i cover everybody  im going to start with charles xavior better known as professor x  smartly played by patrick stewart the cult status this role will provide him may even eclipse that of jeanluc picard and with good reasonhalle berry plays ororo munroe who goes by the name of storm  nicely played nothing spectacular but she fits in well and never detracts from the story  james marsden chimes in as scott summers the man they call cyclops  leader of the this is also a well played role if not a little thin  not a lot of meat in the script for any of the but ill explain that in a bitfamke janssen plays dr jean grey a telepathictelekinetic mutant who is professor xs right hand  she runs afowl of senator robert kelly maddeningly played by bruce davison only to be searched out by him when neededtyler mane plays wolverines nemesis sabretooth ray park follows up darth maul with a kinetically furious turn as toad  rebecca romijnstamos gives a stellar turn as mystique a shape shifting mutant  not much in the way of dialog from her but she plays smartly and figures in the ending of this one  sir ian mckellan plays the lead evil mutant magneto  seeing his parents drug away in nazi occupied poland simply because they were jewish is the impetus for his never wanting to be labeled again  he will control his own destiny  if normals force registration and identification as mutants then he willnow on to the real primary characters in this onehugh jackman plays logan  we all know him better as wolverine  living as a loner unable to remember his past logan moves from town to town engaging in local toughman contests to provide a living  this is so well done that i simply have to thank john woo and the entire mi2 cast for hanging on to dougray scott jackman oozes wolverine and delivers the best characterization in the movie  one day logan runs across a stowaway in his truck her name marie now calling herself rogue marie has the ability to draw out the life force of any normal human  well played by anna pacquin breathing new life into the voluptious southern belle  i have to admit i didnt think shed do well in the role but she proved me and every other naysayer wrongthe special effects are top notch the story is excellent  acting not a flaw or bad word to say about the entire bunch  bryan singer has done an outstanding job bringing this to the big screen  you dont have to be a fan of the comic series to enjoy this movie and if you are then the slight differences between the movie heroes and the drawn ones is inconsequential is classic summer popcorn fare and should provide fox studios with just the franchise it needs  three cheers for a sequel and 4 12 stars for this film4 12 out of 5,fantasy
some time back i announced that the trailer had roped me in although at 55 years old im not a comic book reader although i love fantasy and scifi so i have seen the x men and i rated it an 8 because it is an 8 comic book it is just exactly as advertised which is ok with meif i were rating it as a movie right along in there with episode 4 of star wars men in black independence day and the day the earth stood still directed by robert wise then it rates a 6 which incidentially where i would any other film without a good story line,fantasy
this movie plods along  moreover the film is quite dark violent and heavy and i would not recommend it to childrenthough i have seen many children viewing this film along with their parents who should know betterthe special effects overwhelm the film 8 special effects companies are listed at the end of the creditsand appear quite amateurish in partsnot a happy or feel good film,fantasy
no character developmentcheesiness stupid storyyet i still thought it was alright when the midnight showing on july 13 2000 was over alright so like rogue and wolverine were a pair of awesome characters that was a major high point the beginning of the film the holocaust scene up until the first scene with sabretooth in the snow i thought was mesmerising the darkness of wolverine at that fight club the shyness of rogue the powerful magnetoholocaust scene it all came down to a great start then we meet the other professor x was a dork storm was just well a dork and cyclops was the biggest dick of them all im not saying i hated the movie im not saying i loved the movie either it was justok,fantasy
aside from a couple of inconsequential incongruities this movie is definitely one worthy of sequels  not since matrix has a film entertained me so completelythis film challenges the viewers to review and evaluate their own social morals to the point of asking the question shall we repeat the trajedies and atrocities of the past just to exercise power over those less protected in our societysee this movie and put your prejudices where they belong,fantasy
when youre interpreting ideas from a different medium theres obviously a fine line between respecting your source material too much or too little i read the comic in its halcyon days 197886 when chris claremont wrote the glorious adventures of cyclops storm colossus nightcrawler wolverine et al i knew this film would use this legacy as it saw fit but would it sacrifice itself for the facts or just pillage the past for some cheap thrillswell in bryan singer seems to have perfectly captured the essence of every character every motivation every dynamic and melded them into a new adventure which is logical surprising and inspiring at the same time i couldnt be more touched by this display of intelligence sensitivity and artistry he is a wonderful director and this is a beautifully made film i assumed my biases would work against the film either lamenting the bad representations or lamenting the bad film but amazingly its good its all good and i cant wait to see it again,fantasy
in the past directors have given us weak attempts at translating the pages of our favorite comics on to the big screen  we have flops like punisher captain america and the batman sequels  in fact the only two remotely wellmade comic book adaptions i can think of are the original batman and im going out on a limb here spawn  movies are two hour pieces of eye candy while comics are a continuing epic that not only have time to focus in on action but also the character development of their heroines  it is in this rare occurrence though with the movie that that line between comics and movies has been crossed and a very successful crossing at thatbryan singer the director of has crafted the greatest adaption of a comic book on to the screen that i have ever seen  throughout the movie each character whether villain or has development with the exception of storm whose development i suppose was lost due to her being halle berry playing storm  logan aka wolverine is the focus and who better i ask  he is almost everyones favorite and with good reason he has frekin adamantium claws people  the script i must say gave me great delight  it is far better than what the early buzz gave it credit for  i didnt get a chance to discover the writer but kudos that that those certain person people  to me the script came off as very intelligent almost too intelligent  when you combine that with the great performances given by hugh jackman wolverine anna paquin rogue patrick stewart professor xavier ian mckellen magneto and of course how can i not mention ray park toad for his amazing moves and famke janneson for her being not only beautiful but also suiting jean gray just fine you get one helluva pace that just doesnt quit  the movie seriously flew bye as my childhood memories of reading the comic flashed before my eyes  it is a true bliss to finally see your favorite characters up their on the screen exactly the way you imagined itwhat is so great about this movie is not just the movie but the way it sets itself up for something even greater  this is truly one great setup for something bigger to come  as i said before each character had some sort of development  some examples include sabretooth and wolverines dilemma concerning wolvies dogtags also wolvies origin the love triangle between wolvie cyclops and jean gray magnetos struggle ice man growing up the mystique and rogue connection im not spoiling it and even new characters i can only hope gambit my favorite next to wolvie or coursebryan singer has left the door open and i can tell you that whatever comes again is going to make all the fans very happy  this movie is a gift from god  it not only satisfies for the two hours but it also leaves you thinking about the sequel and the sequel after that  only time will tell for now ignorance is bliss and you can bet your sweet that im seeing it again and again if i have to  cant nobody hold me down bub,fantasy
this movie has got to be the best movie of the year i am sure it will not win best movie award as the story and characters are not that widely know it does pay to have a knowledge of the background of the characters as the story sticks close to that i will definitely see this again on the bigscreen and buy it on videodvd if you remember the violence is only comic book related you will find this movie very enjoyable,fantasy
this was a pretty good summer movie its good to see marvel comics finally get a good film franchise startedthe characters were well done obviously patrick stewart and ian mckellen steal the show portraying scott summers as a preppie refugee from beverly hills 90210 was definitely a good move the special effects were great without overtaking the moviethat said this movie was a little confused on one hand it tried to deal with substantial themes of fear human rights being seen as a freak by others etc however when you get right down to it the plot could be summed up as the heroes must save the city from certain destruction at the hands of the villains this is standard 60sera dc comics boilerplate and the exact same plot as james bond the world is not enough and mystery men however mystery men was a spoof and the bond films were always a bit selfdeprecating tries to be much more serious but then opts for a formulaic plot and its not selfconscious about it at all it would have been a great summer movie if the deeper themes were more welldeveloped or if there were no deeper themes at all and they just opted for a fun action movie as it was i came away feeling that it claimed to be so much more but they coppedout at the end leaving me with just another bigbudget summer movieit was a nice setup for what i hope are good sequels thoughdean,fantasy
let me just say this improvement over the comics  i always thought they were silly oh and amen i always hated gambit  good riddance  the action sequences were the most amazing i think ive ever seen mystique was incredible  and of course ray parks came through  awesome man  i guess what i can say in summary is that i was expecting something along the lines of the later batman movies and man was i surprised  sillias happy boy,fantasy
i enjoyed more than i thought i would especially after some of the leaked reviews that tore the rough cuts to shreds  my only prior knowledge of the came from the fox cartoon but i was very pleased to see most of the characters make it into the first installment of the movie franchise standout performances from hugh jackman patrick stewart and ian mckellen anchored the movie along with very cool sfxbasically there were a few key problems with the movie but nothing that stopped me from enjoying it thoroughly  for one thing the film is at least 20 minutes too short  we could have gone more indepth with a lot of the background or the focus of the story or pretty much anythingthe movie was very condensed  also the fight scenes while interesting were not very impressive on a matrixepisode i level  i have to give the filmmakers credit because its hard to choreograph for somebody who has claws coming out of his hands making it pretty difficult for an opponent to block realistically  the movie was also definitely pg13 some of the humor could have been much more adult but i guess its nice that the mom sitting next to me with her 9year old didnt have to worry  james marsden famke janssen and halle berry all turned in fair performancesoverall a good movie worth the price of admission  i look forward to the sequels in which we should get to see the sentinels gambit nightcrawler colossus  should be cool 710,fantasy
a lot can be said for movies adapted from comics most of it bad occasionally though a gem will appear on the screen that will cause you to completely rethink your opinion of comic book adaptationsthe is one such moviethankfully 20th century fox has done away with long opening credits which allows the move to get right into the action  a godsend in my opinionthe movie opens hauntingly at nazi internment camp and the rollercoaster ride continues on to the deep south washington dc alaska and finally to new yorki have to admit when i first saw who had been cast in which roles i had my doubts  patrick stewart is excellent in his role as professor x but its hugh jackman who steals the show with his insightful interpretation of wolverine  astoundingly believable jackman takes the role of wolverine seriously putting every ounce of his acting ability into it and delivers the goods in spades  obviously jackman found the character of wolverine appealing as he seemed to have a ball playing what in my mind would have been a very difficult rolean addition that i found both fun and charming was the number of cameo appearances that brian singer added to this flick especially at xaviers school for gifted youngsters  i found myself trying to pick which particular mutant was which  i managed to spot shadowcat karma jubilee pyro and blob though im sure i missed as many as i spotted  added to this was a school with a  large number of students leading to greater plausibility to the cover of a school for gifted youngstersthe script writing was without flaw easily bringing the into the naughties and giving them  an air of modern streetwise heroes that the comic has lacked for some time  the script holds nothing back confidently reinforcing the relationships the characters share time and time againultimately though it was the the combat scenes that in my opinion were to make or break this movie and im happy to say that once again i was not disappointed  too many times a good movie has been destroyed by badly choreographed combat  the movie not only shows that a comic book fighting style can be successfully brought to the big screen but makes it breathtakingly believable  coupled with special effects that were used only so far as to enhance the story and not make the movie a circus of pyrotechnics had me feeling satisfied but wanting more at the storys conclusionthat having been said there were one or two aspects of the film that i found slightly disappointing  firstly i felt that the heroes were rather underpowered and lacked skill in the use of their powers  in particular i found jean grey and storms power levels were seriously curtailed and i cant help but feel that this was done so that they wouldnt outshine their males counterparts  one one hand storm and jean felt as if they were drawn from early in their comic careers whereas cyclops and wolverine seemed drawn from much later one with far more control of thier unique abilities granted this does leave the characters somewhere to go in future sequels i feel it could have been handled bettersecondly i found the relationship that the young rogue and wolverine shared was too much like the relationship wolverine shared with young shadowcat in the comics  this was disconcerting as i was expecting rogue and wolverine to have quite an antagonistic relationship as opposed to the almost fatherdaughter relationship that was portrayed  to me this felt wrong and i couldnt help but feel disgruntled at the reworked character dynamicsof course the good news is that i loved the movie regardless of its minor faults  i feel for the average viewer who has no real experience with the this movie is going to be a resounding hit  for xfans though i feel it may not be quite the same success,fantasy
this is everything a comic book movie should be i was extremely pleased with the faithfulness of the characterizations to the comics all of the actors were wonderful and newcomer jackman will definitely be a star after this he made a perfect wolverine completely capturing the complexity and rage of the characterthe movie is comprehensible for those uninitiated and unfamiliar with the world of the and satisfying for those who know and love itdont be scared off by recent bad attempts at bringing comic books to the big screen is worth every penny,fantasy
the movie is really good even for those of us that dont really follow the comics i have never even seen an comic and i was able to keep up with this the character development was perfect and im glad they only concentrated on a few of the main characters instead of all of them at once thoroughly satisfied the best 775 yes you read it right 775 ive paid in a while,fantasy
i saw this movie on july the 15th i loved it it has a mix of comedy action and scifi rolled into one the cast was superb in this movie the casting director did a excellent job i recommend this movie to anyone you will enjoy it the special effects were awesome so were the fight scenes once again i highly recommend this movie,fantasy
to all of those people who are worried that the movie will not  do justice to the comic book rest assured this film is brilliant  i have been a fan for over 12 years and i was not disappointed  there are a few minor inconsistencies with respect to the comic book but they can be easily overlooked  the special effects are pure genius and the characters are extremely well played  i had my doubts about some of the casting choices but as it turns out everyone carried their part beautifullysee this film even if you arent an fan  it was certainly worth the wait,fantasy
before i went to see this movie i read a lot of the reviews for it most of them saying it was okay or disappointing at some level  but i gotta say this was one of the best summer movies ive seen so far  the action was cool and seeing all the characters come to life were great  one thing though the climax could have been more climactic and whats up with rogue being a teenager  i dont remember her being anything but a voluptuous woman in the cartoons  wolverine was soo hot hugh jackman really portrayed him with all that brooding and raw sexiness  he was good  over all this movie was awesome i cant wait for the sequel,fantasy
lets get one thing straight patrick stewart is way too talented to be doing this kind of thing he is excellent as xavior but his talents are still wasted in an age when style counts more than substance fares better than most comic book adaptions it ranks better than any of the batman films but thats not so tough since they havent made a good one yet but this film makes the typical hollywood flaw it lets its visuals and volume level get in the way of story and character development sure it loud fast paced and visually impressive it makes for a good summer movie and its technical achievements assure it good sales when it hits video but is there anything really worthwhile here not really there is nothing within the characters or the story that really get to you you simply do not care about the characters and their situations you are not given the chance to instead youre beat over the head with more meaningless albeit impressive action sequences unfortunately we live in an age when that equates good filmmaking to mass audiences hollywood has only gotten the comic book translation right two times the most recent was the crow it like was visually stunning but the crow made room for character development you cared about what was going on it had real emotion and an incredible performance by brandon lee but the greatest comic adaption in hollywood history is superman the original and its sequel stand headandshoulders above all the others they had incredible visuals and epic action scenes but most importantly they had character dimension they all served a purpose to the story the action served the story they also remained loyal to the characters even the lesser supmerman sequels while not very good movies remained faithful to the characters if youve ever read an comic youll see many changes to the characters they are either flat background characters that are thrown in because the audience expects to see them storm cyclops or they are completely changed to fit into a modern movie the biggest example of that is wolverine first off he doesnt have the same demeanor or accent as the comic character he was just over 5 tall now hes over 6 and he wore a bright spandex costume not leather the leather may be more 90s but its just not true to the vibrant nature of the comic so all in all i was very disappointed its just another flash in the pan it will make a load of money but will not stand the test of time no one will remember this movie 20 years from now except the fanboys whose lives revolve around still it looks good so i give it 5 out of 10,fantasy
i really went into this movie prepared for the worst  as a lifelong comic fan i had found the and its family of titles were becoming practically unreadable  the unrelenting hype surrounding this film screamed flop  as if marvel were trying to milk everything they could out of it anyone who has been into comics for more than 3 years knows that this would be standard operating procedure  not to mention their abysmal parade of cinematic failures blade would be the exception but then again it hardly resembled the comic characterthankfully they got this one right  the opening scene made me sit up and take notice and they held me throughout most of the remainder of the movie  the first half in particular was perhaps the best adaptation of a comic i have ever seen  it did a great job of highlighting the characters and setting up the conflict  i am not particularly fond of the comic version of wolverine but they hit a home run with this one  he looks great  rough tough and ready to rumble without being a complete psychoneedless to say the effects were great  magneto in particular has some spectacular scenes  i did find the fight scenes to be a little cartoonish however  wolverinesabretooth promised to be the alltime heavyweight championship match but it didnt deliver a knockout hopefully theyll work on their choreography next time ray park is tragically underused in this oneafter the wellconceived and executed first half the film slowly grinds to the finish line  it wasnt a total letdown but i really expected more  of course they had to leave a few threads dangling these will no doubt be tied up in the sequelsall in all i came out of very satisfied  this is a very promising start to what will hopefully be a series of quality movies based on marvel comics  the high points of this movie more than balance out its flaws  i guess the best comment i can make is that it made me a fan of the again,fantasy
i read the comics as a kid whos parents were divorcing couldnt play football that great though in texas i was supposed to and my only real friends were my cousins  i got a five dollar allowance every two weeks and with that i bought the comics  without a doubt this movie is the truest adaption to a comic ever  i know they arent in spandex  i know that not every you want in there is in there  but a tale about unwanted people who fight for the rest of mankinds freedom despite the consequences that is what drew me in as a kid  i can relate to that  is some of the movie corny  sure  are some of the special effects not up to par with say matrix  sure  but can i identify root for and sympathize with these characters  absolutely and instantly  the dialogue is funny smart to the point and i mean this as a great compliment simple  the action is built very well and you are with everyone of these guys the moment you see them  there are great movies that take the entire movie to develop characters ie rain man driving miss daisy  there are even better ones that do it instantly ie star wars raiders of the lost ark having discussed a little about the movie lets discuss the best thing in the movie  hugh jackman is the most exciting presence on the screen since harrison ford blasted greedo in star wars  of the new generation of hollywood stars i like russell crowe edward norton matt damoni love brendan fraser  but hugh jackman had me on his side the first second i saw him in the film  i eagerly await anything his does in the future and i darn sure await the next installmentwolverine part ii maybe  if someone out there gives best newcomer awards to actors  hugh jackman can take it home now  im especially glad above all else i have a son who saw the moviewith his mom and dad  thanks,fantasy
i was very pleased with the movie granted it is true what ebert said that they focused too much on introducing the characters but nevertheless it was a good start since they plan on making this into a movie series ala star trek star wars and james bond i do wish they didnt cut out a 45 minute section however yes the movie is 45 minutes shorter than originally planned i feel that if they let it go a bit longer they might have been able to develop the plot slower and build towards a better climaxoverall the effects were stunning the plot was decent and the action even though not as much as the action in the matrix was great i never was a major fan but i have changed after seeing this movie and cannot wait until 2,fantasy
as a fan of the for 20 years i think this was a fine flick but it left me a little empty the character development was too shallow on everyone except rogue and logan that rogue was in the brotherhood albeit briefly and unwillingly was a nice touch overall though a job well done the addition of jubilee shadowcat and iceman was a bonus kudos all,fantasy
xcellent  the movie was credible and reasonably true to the original story as compared to the tv cartoon series  special effects were good and believable although used a bit sparingly as far as the in battle the one liners were good  i still chuckle out loud when i think of how wolverine identified himself to cyclops  a definite must see and the first movie in years that im considering going to see a second time,fantasy
i saw this movie this afternoon while waiting in line i was surprised at all of the different people waiting along with me old young guys and girls i am not a reader of the comic book so i went into it kind of blind to the whole phenomenon but i dont think that made me enjoy the movie any less it to my surprise was very welldone with a great caliber of actors and special effects it wasnt too long at all if anything it could have been a little longer regardless i am looking forward to the many sequels i am sure this will have heck id pay money just to see that incredible hugh jackman beating up the bad guys again and again 85 out of 10,fantasy
i grew up collecting the comic books and action figures and watched the cartoon every saturday morning i grew out of the routine as i got older but when i heard that they had made a movie i was so excited i couldnt wait to see it  well it was worth the long wait the movie was wonderful i think it was smart that they didnt put alot of the in the movie that would just make the story more complicated and i think anytime you base a movie on a comic dont use alot of the characters or youll just get a bad movie perfect example batman  robin  wolverine is played wonderfully by hugh jackman he is the toughest sob hes the guy everybody likes the special effects are wonderful and the movie is just great in fact im going to see it again this week i liked it so much  i recommend this movie for anybody even if youre not a fan  you will get your moneys worth in the theater out of ,fantasy
the story had always been about prejudice and acceptance and the routes in which we take it  bryan singer only changed what amounts to little things to create a story that realizes what has made one of the greatest stories ever writteni came into the movie with quite high expectations  ever since i had started reading the comics 10 years ago  the rumor mill had always been they had to make a moviethe movie realized two idealistic struggles of peace through coexistence martin luther king jr and physical fight for control malcolmxnot to give anymore to the plot and character development before the movie releases friday this movie is a must see  from the beginning we see a dark scene from the past that shapes magnetos thinking of his existence the experience of prejudice that leads to pain early in his life it just keeps goingthe story and the character developments are as deep as you can go in an hour and a half keeping it short for the kids and each actor and actress was believable as the comic characters they portrayedif there are two things i cant wait its this movie in a directors cut please and iimake mine marvel,fantasy
overall this was a pretty entertaining movie  the movie starts a bit slow but does pick up in the last third of the movie  i liked the characters especially wolverine  i do believe that the sequel will be much better because much of the character development will have already been established  i gave the movie an 8,fantasy
in the wrong hands x men could have been ruined a la joel schumacher and batman but thankfully x men was put in the right hands thank you bryan singer  this film delivers for both fans of the comic series as well as anyone who has never even heard of the x men and it does so with out the camp and the myriad of other traps comictofilm projects fall victim tocreating a film that lives up to decades worth of expectation is a difficult task but this film did it just right,fantasy
 is not a great movie in fact i ran out of things to throw at the screen the dialogue left something to be desired and the story line didnt allow the audience to create a strong bond with the characters the movie just assumed that everyone watching was a fan of the comic i didnt expect much going into the movie and i left with just thatps what happens to a toad when it gets struck by lightning the same thing that happens to everything elsenow thats a material,fantasy
a marvelous spectacular movie very unbatmanny uncartoony none of that dark brooding selfindulgent crap that has marred so many cartoon adaptations in the past in fact if i didnt know this was an adaptation of a comic book i honestly wouldnt have guessed itfirst the special effects are genuinely a new generation of anything seen before truly i know that may sound trite and maybe not appealing but thats one of the reasons the effects here are sooooo good they are so smooth and integrated into the story that at no time did i think oh a special effect i just found myself watching and believing and enjoying the movie without much self consciousness or selfawareness of being an audience member and thats a high achievement for any moviei am not a fan of the genre particularly but i thoroughly enjoyed myself at this one and i suspect that the great actor patrick stewart may find his star with this role he was so good and so believable and natural that i had to squint my brain to even recall that he was captain whatshisname for all those years and i love that portrayal too and hope to see a few more movies yet in that franchise and the entire cast was wonderful toogreat job fantastic accomplishment made a fan out of me stop reading this and go to the theater and see it right away youll be very glad you did i gave this a well deserved 10 out of 10,fantasy
bryan singer and crew did a great job on the film  the effects were not revolutionary as the matrix or anything but unlike many effectsladen no plot movies not the matrix the ones it did use were used to further the plot rather than just for a spectacle  it definitely kicked the living crap out of mi2 as far as summer movies go  if you are not a comic book movie fan dont go see this movie  if you are a fan or know something about the comic you will have a great time at this movie  despite the film looking like it could have been just a brainless effects heavy oneliner infected disappointment from its trailers it is hardly that  wolverine and mystique stood out a bit from the rest  storm halle berry was a bit disappointing not because of her acting ability obviously but because of the lack of use by the movie to make her interesting  she could be much improved upon  cant wait for the next one,fantasy
for so long audiences have had to put up with alot of crap during the american summer eg wild wild west well basically anything will will smith but finally a movie like has come along to hopefully show what a big budget studio can do if it actually tries to make the movie work effectively rather than just shove a big name into a bad script and expect 20 million in the first weekend x men is different because a its well written with good dialogue and characters you care about b uses its budget to show special effects that other films are too lazy to show and c when you walk out of the theater you dont feel ripped off again i praise the filmmakers also for allowing people like me who have no idea what x men was when they entered the cinema to understand where all the characters have come from and to finally enjoy what they can do,fantasy
hugh jackman nailed the part of loganwolverine didnt think anybody could do it but he nailed it i also enjoyed the young version of rogue and of course ian mckellen as magneto id like to say that you dont have to be a fan of the comic book to enjoy the movie but cant i think certain fans of scifi action will enjoy the others will find it predictable visually the movie offers a few neat effects but nothing at the caliber of the matrix still is worth a look it is fun fast paced and jackmans performance is one to see,fantasy
so the the worlds ultimate superteam finally reached the big screen at first i was a skeptic how could they adequately address each character will the movie have story or only action will these actors be able to portray these wellknown set characters accurately  the answer is a resounding yes this movie gave us the background and story that a really good scifi needs in order to make it  the characters were established and a basic yet intense good vs evil theme was set i got to know all the characters and got a taste of each personality true there is a wolverinerogue focus but the movie lost nothing the actors worried me  sure stewart and mckellen are big hitters and can hold a movie or series together but what about the rest of this basically new cast  i was amazed at how well the actors portrayed their comic counterparts  any hardcore marvel fan will be able to see the characters in each performance great accent halle overall with great action and great story promises to be a film worth noticing  stewart had better prepare for another movieseries because this film has sequel all over it and it will undoubtedly deliver,fantasy
as soon as came onto the screen my first reaction was whoa my friends and i were surprised this movie was as good as it was we were expecting a typical super hero movie like batman or superman what we got was not just a superhero movie but a movie movie meaning it had a great plot and great actingjames marsden cyclops was extremely good you could tell he was really ped at logan but didnt hate him halle berry was awesome she pulled it off extremely well and this is coming from a huge storm fan i think she was great and i want more of her in the sequels tyler mane sabertooth was simply a bad ass he was simply oozing badass scream for me was one of my favorite lines in the movie toad was awesome i was expecting him to just be this stupid little sidekick but he was extremely cool mystique is the only character i didnt like i really thought she was playing second fiddle the entire time a lot of people think shes sexy but shes just disgustingpatrick stewart is xavier he was born to play that role the same goes for ian mckellan as magneto throughout the entire movie i kind of felt sorry for magneto from the holocaust scene to the fact that he didnt know his machine would kill people hugh jackman is wolverine no one else would have been this cool he played the part canadian which was very good famke janssen was a very good jean grey i could feel her and marsdens chemistry when they were on screen together you could tell they were in lovethe special effects are very effective pardon the pun they werent like in the matrix which i hate the effects were good because they were only used when necessary not like in the matrix when theyd use slowmotion to show someone eating a potato chip lastly anna paquin was a very convincing rogue her accent was great as well as her actingin the end this movie makes you want only one thinga sequel if they can make the sentinels look good i mean really bad ass it will rock i give this movie an a 10 out of 10,fantasy
as an exavid reader ill start with my complaints  hugh jackman doesnt fit into what the comic book defines wolverines body type to be and the movie is too shorti was shocked at how much i liked this movie  i was expecting to be let down on many levels and i wasnt at all  jackman totally made up for his physical faults with his acting capturing wolverines whole character in 96 minutesas far as the movie being too short arent you supposed to be left wanting for more  the ending of the movie leaves room for so many sequels that you know youll get more in a couple of years  you have to keep in mind that some of the character development will be short  you also have to keep in mind that these characters have been developing for over 35 years in the comicsi cant wait to see it again this week,fantasy
i have collected comics for many years and was not expecting too much from the movie but i was pleasantly surprised  it was pretty good  based in reality and more science fiction than fantasy i believed such a future could exist just around the corner  unlike many comic book adapted movies is not cartoony  the spirit of the characters has been preserved although comic book continuity has not  although anna paquin rogue could not sustain a southern accent i sympathised with her ordeal as a confused young woman  hugh jackman won me over as wolverine although he was not gruff enough or hairy enough but i was disappointed with sabretooth what a wimp  not vicious enough and to see him as magnetos lapdog was embarrassing  mystique was pretty good but i do have one criticism here mystique is a shape shifter  she takes on the appearance of something or someone else including their clothes etc  when she becomes wolverine and mimics his claws the claws are still part of her flesh therefore when she battles the real wolverine they would not break off as portrayed but would be sliced off an she would bleed  it was interesting to see toad as a major baddie  i actually thought that he seemed the most powerful of the villains quite the opposite of his rather lame comic book persona  on the whole i recommend this movie both to the general public and to the fanboy although i did think the action sequences were a bit weak by comic book standards  watch for the cameo and background appearances of a multitude of marvel characters and enjoy the jibes and injokes if your a fanboy happy viewing,fantasy
excellent story and acting for an effects film the effects were second to the great acting of hugh jackman and the rest of the talent the effects from all the houses involved were great pleased and will watch again,fantasy
i just cant believe how everyones falling in line for this film  so disco balls didnt lower out of the ceilings during the fight scenes  is that how little you wanted  outdo batman  robin and everyone falls in love with you  well what kind of accomplishment is thatall they had to do was stay true to the source material do some competent casting and load it down with fx  but no  they decide to fail in each one of those categoriessource material  xavier has to introduce sabertooth to wolverine  enough saidcasting  halle barry as storm  shes like a child playing dressup cyclops looks trendy  jean is old enough to be everyones mother  magneto looks too old to go to the bathroom himself let alone threaten the world and wolverine  contrary to what everyone keeps on saying he is not wolverine  not even close  just what are you all on  hugh jackman is taller than cyclops and way too skinny  and singer decided to trade his log cabin feel for a harleytrucker feelfx  did you see any  if theres one thing you wouldve thought you could count on from hollywood its fx but not here  nor is there any good stuntwork choreography or anything  the action sucks  it looks like it was all done by ameteurs  where the hell did all of the budget go probably into things like halle barry and her three lines or the 3d morphing map  money well spent all rightoh there is so much more to complain aboutmagneto doesnt have a costume because singer wanted him to be more downtoearth so he gives him a lair instead  oh but no dr evil is complete without his obligatory invention of doom  tell me why did magneto need such a plot device as the mutationtriggering machine  isnt his magnetism itself the plot device  oh but thats not enough i guess  so instead of just showing magneto kicking ass they take the money they couldve spent on his electromagnetic sphere and put it towards lameass white radiation  other casualties of this stupid plot device include half the running time of the movie senator kelly and oh yeah  any hint of respectabilitythe thing that gets to me the most is i think i hate this movie more because i can picture watching it from a nonfan point of view  wolverine has a thing against cyclops  because  he has an attraction toward jean also just because  there is no flesh given to these relationships they just pop into existenceerik lewald should have made this movie,fantasy
i had my doubts about this movie being any good but bryan singer has pulled off a winner of a movie the makers of batman should take notes this movie is funny in all the right places and the action is handled in a serious way hugh jackman shines as wolverine and the chemistry between he and rogue gives the movie heart maybe with a bigger budget for the sequelno doubt about itthe next movie can really cut loose with truly comicbook action cant wait for the dvd to see the stuff they had to cut out bravo to director bryan singer bravo,fantasy
have been waiting a long time for marvel to get one good comic based movie out and this is it if your going to see a movie this summer see this one it kicks buttspecial effects are great the story is good pretty good stunts and the characters are just rightmay be disappointing for hardcore fans but dont despair it smells sequelnot enough character development but thats understandable its only 104mins long dont expect them to cram 40 some odd years of history into just one movie but expect some small surpriseshope you enjoy stphane,fantasy
warning spoilers at the endi went to this movie expecting to be blown away but left with less than i went in with  i am an ideal audience member to test because i am a longtime sf fan but an newbie  i admit it ive never read a single comicso going in i looked forward to some exposition of who these characters were how they came to be some glimpse of the backstory etc  well this movie left me empty like all the questions ill pose at the endgood stuff visually it is beautiful  the sets and lighting are wonderful  the little injokes are a treat  the introduction to the relationship of wolverine and rogue is very enjoyable the acting is very tight and wellcastbad stuff i am reminded of episode i  this is more of a long trailor for x than a satisfying story in itselfsome spoilers here      can you kill these guys  what does it take  three blades through the chest or a direct laser blast in the back while in a weakened condition dont seem to do it why are the good guys so inept at fighting  what makes a character with a fancy pair of glasses a mutant  why can the bad mutants be so many places at the same time  how are they able so easily to infiltrate and anticipate the so many questions no answers  more indepth biosketches and some back story at the marvel website would be appreciated,fantasy
i started collecting comic books back in the early 80s primarily the around 85 my friends and i got together to try to figure out how theyd make this a movie we knew then that it couldnt be done were wolverine storm collossus kitty pryde and nightcrawler at the time we could see the movie industry trying with the special effects they had then and failing miserably since then the makeup of the has changed  new and old characters joining and leaving technology is finally cuttingedge enough to make the mutant abilities believablei feared that the producers would make this a special effects and action movie with a script that would only equal the technology of the 80s i was more than pleased with the results this is the perhaps the best written script for an action and special effects movie that is intended to be the beginning of a new franchise  introduction to the characters getting the feel for the group in this version of the marvel universe setting up and resolving an introductory conflicti look forward to the next installment does wolverine find the weapon x laboratory what does he find there will he encounter this universes version of alpha flight which of the other known plot lines will they draw us into in the next movie im hooked,fantasy
not only does this do injustice to the not only does it do injustice to the amazing actors and actresses who worked on the project not only does it do injustice to all comic book movies created but this does an injustice to the movies im still trying to figure out where the heck they went wrong they got the oscarwinning director bryan singer who delivers amazing drama films they signed up perhaps two of the best british actors of all time patrick stewart wanted for the best long before this movie was conceived and ian mckellen they signed on golden globe winner for best actress last year halle berry and signed up for best actress winner at the academy awards anna pauqin this movie is a prime example of how a script can completely kill a movie this was supposed to be the huge jump forward the comic book movies needed they had been plauged by laughable batman  robinesque pictures but spawn and blade showed a glimpse of what could be done in hollywood with these kinds of strong storylines unfortunately will throw the comic book movie genre into a topspin even worse than it was in before for a short summary i was forced to come up with a line that seemed in the same vein as the movieshort and stupid no development bad use of actors in the movie halle berry was completely wrong for her role which was very diminished as it was they tried to focus on everyone having a part in the movie and maybe that was the problem overallacting was bad dialogue was horrid plot was tepid and stunts were laughable please do your self a favor and see a real movie i am a huge the comic book fan but even with my bias i could see that this not only did injustice to the comic book but it was just plain out a bad movie hype over content,fantasy
after months of anticipation the movie has finally arrived now as a big fan of the comic book i was worried that it wouldnt live up to it but not only is it the best movie of the summer it is the best comic to movie adaptation since the first batman movie this film is action packed but it also makes you feel for most of the characters and takes the time to tell a story in fact for kids its a story that teaches them about intolerence and being differenti wont give away the plot but heres the basics professor xavier leads a band of mutants known as who serve his purpose to unite humans and mutants peacefully he is in charged of a school for gifted youngsters who are young kids that are learning to control their mutant powers the include cyclops who can shot laser beams from his eyes storm who can control the weather and jean grey who possess telekenisis and mild telepathic powers on the opposing side we have magneto who can manipulate anytihng metallic he believes that mutants are the superior race and that the humans that fear and hate them should be destroyed on his side is mystique a shapechanger toad who possess incredible agility and a very trippy 15 ft long tongue that he shoots out of his mouth and sabertooth who possess fast healing factor and super human strength both sides are very dedicated to the people who lead them but whos right or wrong about how humans accept them is yet to be determined caught in the middle is wolverine and rogue wolverine possess fast healing factor and adamantium that was put into his body over 15 years ago and allows his retract claws from his hands rogue has the ability to drain a persons life force making it impossible to have skin to skin contact with anyone professor x wants to train wloverine and help him find his pass but magneto wants something from rouge that will help him with his planfirst off the acting is great form everyone patrick stewart is great as professor x i loved his performance and ian mckellan is perfect as magneto he may not look the part but he plays the part well famke janseen plays jean grey really well too combining smarts and sex appeal i wish they wouldve gave her more to do but she was still good halle berry is good as storm she looks the part and she gives storm a soul i hope they expand on her part in the sequel becuase theres a lot there in the character thayt is waiting to come out james marsden who has minimal screen time is cyclops is still very good hope they expand on his relationship with jean in the sequel becuase it isnt too apparent in this film you can tell he has grown though as an actor after been in not so good teen films such as gossip and disturbing behavior hugh jackman and anna paquin are the best performers in the film he brings the chracter of wolverine righ tof the comic books and unto the screen hes funny especially his frequent banter with cyclops hes emotional his fatherdaughter relationship with rogue is very well played in the film and hes a loner who is searching for answers to his past anna paquin plays the rogue chracter as a vulnerable confused teenaged girl who is just learning about her mutant powers this is a far cry from the strong southern belle in the comic but it will be interesting to see her grow in each film the villians are a real treat rebecca romjn stamos has only one line as mystique but she knows how to come off as simply evil she knows how to work her body and the trippy makeup helps too ray park is awesome as toad hes very funny and he brings his skills to the part such as he did in star wars episode i tyler mane who is a former pro wrestler is good as sabertooth he basically just growls and grunts but he also knows how to come off as evilthe action is fantastic in this film from the fight between wolverine and mystique which is beautifully executed to the fight between storm cyclops jean and toad when storm comes face to face with toad the special effects used here are great the fight between wolverine and sabertooth on the statue of liberty is a bit anticlimatic but is still goodone last point i would like to make is bryan singer thanks for putting together a wonderful film im a big fan of the comic book and i can honestly say you and everyone involved put together a great film it leaves you wanting more and i think thats a good sign of a successful movie1010,fantasy
the only complaint that my friends and i had was the lack of gambit in the movie otherwise it was excellent good acting good script good direction good effects id place this one right up there with batman and superman im sure there will be some sequels in the future i can only hope they will be on the same level but i doubt it somewhat the actor who played wolverine did an excellent job and somehow they managed to make his hair look right without overdoing it patrick stewart and ian mckellen were just awesome as professor x and magneto this show was well worth the price of a ticket,fantasy
i went in thinking that the main focus of the movie would probably be the fighting and the powers of the mutants  having been a fan of the comic series for some time now it was my opinion that the most important element would be the fight seen between wolverine and sabertooth  however i was very pleasantly surprised to see that not the mutant powers or the fighting was the focus but that the story and plot became the main focus and with intellegent twists and turns as well as some well timed and very humorous comic relief this quickly became my favorite movie of the year  though due to the academys obvious feelings about scifi the only oscar possibility i see in the future is for special effects,fantasy
watched the movie in the front row of a packed theater and heard more than half the audience clapping for the movie when it came to the end credits the movie was more than a solid beginningit was enough to give me hope that characters i have known for more than 35 years would come to live in more than one movie things and people may have been different between the comic universe and the movie universeand i was xstatic that studio didnt muck it up ill be going to see it again tomorrowcatching all of the cameos was hard from the first row grin i just hope that i will not be the only one there again hopefully this will hit 200 million gross within two months the movie rate it xxx xcellent xcellent xcellent,fantasy
its nice to see a movie adapt well to the big screen  even though im sure there are a lot of fanatics complaining it was a good story  sure its different than the comics but it would have been boring to have the same story line repeated from comiccartoon to the big screen  i feel the casting was great logan could have been a bit bigger  sabertooth and prof x were probably the best adaptations from comic to screen out of all of them  the total storyline was short but what do you get for 2hrs of film you have to make it appealing to both fans and nonfans ofand thats hard to do,fantasy
hugh jackman portrays a great wolverine  he seems to give real credibility to the producers choices of the actors that portrayed theoverall the movie is a big hit  although it did seem a little short on running time  i believe the movie will carry over to an audience that is not at all familiar with the comic,fantasy
even though they left out some of the original characters i still found the movie to be very exciting  hope they come out with a sequel  maybe they will include beast juggernaut gambit and jubilee anyway best movie ive seen come out of hollywood in a while,fantasy
all the actors were very good especially ones who played wolverine hugh jackman jane grey famke janssen and rogue anna paquin from star wars thought the overall plot was ok but the actors and effects make this movie a lot of fun to watch and you want it to just keep rollin  this will definetly not be the last moviehope to see 2 soon,fantasy
im not a comic book reader  im a big star wars fan and it actually makes me mad when star wars comic books are released because it means that theres more to the star wars story and ill probably never read it  so logically im not an avid follower of  ive seen the tv show enough to know the characters and with nothing to do on a friday night i went down to the theatre and sat in the front row ugh and watched this excellent movie with the exception of one really lame line from storm this was an amazing moviethe fx were great only one seemed really bad to me  wolverine was cool i definitely think this is a breakthrough performance for this guy  he will get more roles based on his very convincing role in this movie  rogue was cool and hot at the same time    a talented actress as well  the music was great the direction was great the story was pretty close to great and there is a really funny scene where toad who is played by the same guy as darth maul makes a hilarious reference to the double edged lightsaberwell ive rambled long enough  if youve reached this point youve made a mistake  you should be on the way to the theatre already,fantasy
first of all id like to note that im a huge fan of the so i went into the movie with a perspective unlike most  i was looking for every bit of anything that could be wrong with this film  despite this i loved this movie  im sure not too many people can boast of seeing it twice on opening night  thats how excellent i thought this movie was  all of the characters were protrayed remarkably  and the cameos of certain undergrad mutants were cool also  stunts and special effects were perfect also  i dont think they could have done a better job  although i do have to admit the chronology of it was quite off  but it definately made for a better story line  if you like the if you love the  if youve never heard of the go see this movie  it is definately worth the wait in line although i was first in line and its worth every penny  true believers unite,fantasy
when i sat down in the theatre and waited for the movie to begin i thought oh man this is gonna be so cheesy  i honestly believed it would be a movie with no plotline no character development just a bunch of guys beating on each other with super powers thrown into the mixnot so is a wellwritten beautifully acted film  the characters have substance some more than others and the plotline is sound  of course the incredible special effects helped make the movie what it was supposed to be hugh jackman is hilarious as the cynical logan and the rivalry between him and cyclops james marsden adds more humor toad ray park fills in the blanks  ian mckellan is very believable as the corrupted magneto and some fanfavorite have cameos as students at the xavier institute iceman pyro jubilee cannonball shadowcat and colossusthis movie was a dose of reality  it reinforced the idea that they can base a movie on a comic book or video game character that wont bomb in the box office,fantasy
i was a fan of the back in the early sixties when they first appeared on the comicbook scene then the members were cyclops marvel girl jean grey angel beast and iceman the group has evolved over the yearsand out of my life many moons ago the only contact i have with them now is thru my 12 year old nephew who is as excited about them now as i was back then i went to the movies friday to the very first showing of the movie from the first second the screen came alive to the final credit i was glued all of the main characters were explained perfectly so that even an oldie like me could understand who and why they were who they are the storyline was great the actors portraying anybody and everybody were right on the mark i want to thank and congratulate all of the people behind this movie from marvel itself thru to stan lee to the director the producers and even the guys driving the roach coach excellent job i rate this movie as the best movie of the summer even if it dies at the boxoffice which it wont it is a marvel of wonder in the history of filmlong live prof charles xavier and his school for gifted children,fantasy
the awesome special effects and many outstanding performances by the cast make for a thoroughly enjoyable movie the action is enough to hold you on the edge while the plot and character development keep you interested and in your seat i was never much of a comic book reader but i know this is very true to the original stories in my mind a good comic book provides a complete story yet leaves enough open that the imagination can take over where the plot doesnt go it also should leave enough unanswered questions that you cant wait for the next episode fulfilled my expectations and i look forward to perhaps a sequel this is the best comic book turned movie that i have seen and i have also learned to appreciate this genre a lot more because of it,fantasy
its always a treat for me to find a movie or tv series for that matter that treats both race and gender simply as a matter of fact and not made to make points one way or the other as i understand it as was more fully explained on the way home from the theater some of these characters have been around for almost 40 years and others for 20 men women black white all working together for the common good okay or bad if you were rooting for the other side it was a great experience for me since i wasnt at all familiar with the comic book at all when i was growing up i will make an effort though to seek out some old issues from what i understand theres a lot more of the whole story yes i can see four sequels easily well it was a long ride home,fantasy
my first introduction to the was in the summer of 1963 when i bought the first issue at a corner drug store  i was ten years old at the time ironically around that same time i would think about how old i would be when the year 2000 came and what life might be like in the far future it seemed so far away at the timethirtyseven years later the year 2000 has come i have turned 47 years old and my favorite comic book of my youth has made it to the big screen im very pleased to say that the writers have done considerable justice in capturing the key elements of why the book made such an impact on me when i was youngtwo defining moments of the original comic book series came in two early issues  in issue 5 1964 toad in disguise participates in a track meet shattering world records  in a state of shock and disbelief the crowd becomes suspicious of fraud and enraged attacks toad  a small riot ensues  in issue 8 1964 when one of the members of the original team rescues a child who has climbed to the top of a water tower the crowd reacts with fear anger and suspicion instead of gratitude  although marvel had successfully used the dramatic device of having the public fear and loath a superhero previously in the amazing spiderman series this was the first use of prejudice against an entire class of individuals or mutants who were different from birth solely due to a genetic accidentspoiler warning  spoiler warning   spoiler warningthis theme of blind prejudice against an entire race of individuals and the resulting fear anger and violence is introduced powerfully in two early scenes of the film  one is set in a 1944 nazi concentration camp  the next is in the near future at a congressional hearing which is debating if a law should be passed that would require all mutants to register with the government  sadly the years from 1963 to now have seen much prejudice racism bigotry and even ethnic cleansing so the theme of intolerance holds as much power today as it did in 1963 perhaps more soanother defining theme of the marvel comic books of the 60s was the sense of loneliness and isolation of the heroes   their super powers rather than bringing them fame and fortune became a curse something they often felt they would be better off not having  cyclops scott summers is deeply in love with jean grey yet his dread power issue 3 compels him to keep his feelings to himself  certainly no character could be more tragic than rogue whose touch can be fatal and who is potentially destined to never enjoy true human intimacy   oscar winner anna paquin is outstanding playing the young rogue charactera final defining theme of the marvel comic book revolution of the 60s was that of the antihero  these were characters that were angry often out of control loners who struggled to do the right thing  the incredible hulk comes to mind  yet the later 70s character wolverine may be the ultimate marvel antihero  a victim of horrendous human experimentation whose memories are largely repressed logan is bitter angry and alone the connection and interplay between logan played most convincingly by hugh jackman and rogue contains much of what sets this movie apart from any other comic book adaptation  logan has the ability to heal himself quickly rogue has the ability to temporarily steal the powers of another mutant  these powers are exploited to full advantage in this movie ill confess that certain scenes between them moved me to tears they are so strong surprising and compellingmuch of this film is expository  its designed to introduce a universe to an audience that is assumed to have little or no knowledge of the characters  its a fun exciting action movie  its also a somewhat faithful adaptation of the comic book series  given the fact that the movie lasts barely over ninety minutes the filmmakers have pulled off quite a featlooking at the film as a pure action scifi film id give it around 3 to 312 stars out of 4 or a 7 or 8 out of 10  its hurt a bit by the fact that its trying to do so much in so little time  also the film was originally intended to be released in the latter part of 2000  i think the shortened timeframe for the making of the film may have had an impact on its overall quality  nevertheless it is unquestionably in my opinion the best of the superhero comic book adaptations  i saw it in a packed theater and it was an obvious crowd pleaser  along with some very serious acting and themes it has stunning special effects and very funny oneliners  my wife who was never a comic reader thought the movie was fantastic and shes very hard to please  she will recommend this film to her friends and so will i  i will look forward to seeing a directors cut on dvd and a sequel  enjoy,fantasy
thus after the barrage of previews we went to see the  i found it to be a batmanish filmdark and brooding with excellent cinematography and special effects  my end reaction though was that it lacked story development  i sort of sensed that before i went in from all that i had preseenin the near future certain members of homo sapiens are born into the next phase of human evolution  this is what we are told  but why each evolves into a different life form is never explained  no two mutants are alike leaving us to question whether humanity is doomed beyond this simple show of genetic godfreaks for lack of an ability to mate the film is flawed by an all too sparse character development  the greatest insight we have of anyone is of rogue played by anna paquin whom most of us remember as the little girl in the piano and later in fly away home rogue is a teenage girl who can never touch another person for to do so drains their very life force  yet she seems almost content with this being a virtual leper never being able to so much as kiss another individual let alone have sex with anyone  all she could do was run away  here was a mutant who should have had the curse of immortality unable to end her own life  and with her acceptant attitude perceptions of plausibility faded from whom she was meant to betwo of the mutants had not so much as one linesabertooth and mystique the latter played by dropdead gorgeous rebecca romijnstamos whose face one could not even seen though the blue reptilian scales  patrick steward and ian mckellen gave adequate performances with what they were given  i remember watching gods and monsters recently and thinking how much ian mckellen sounded like patrick steward and how similar were their eyes and here they were like diametric twinsfamke janssen who plays jean grey although having considerable credits to her name is relatively unknown to the general public  star trek fans however may remember her in a next generation episode back in 1992 called the perfect mate a quasiremake of an original star trek episode elaan of troyius with france nuyan  in the next generation janssen played kamala a metamorph who would mentally bond with the man with chosen for her  a pawn of interplanetary politics as fate would have it she bonded tragically to jeanluc picard patrick steward her mentor in this film whom she would never see again at least as kamalamccarthyesque senator robert jefferson kelly  played by bruce davidson shared credits with mckellen in apt pupil back in 1996  hugh jackman gives a credible performance a wolverine the amnesiac mutant with metal talons someone has grafted into his arms which project outwards through his everhealing flesh in moments of rage  gone for the most part was the iceman a significant character throughout early comic book history probably because the special effects of creating bridges of ice would have been prohibitively expensive  gone too were some scenes shown in the making of the recently on fox including one where the senators daughter turns into a mutant before everyones eyes as her neck begins to stretch upward like plasticman whoever was responsible for the previews missed the point as did the writers  the was to represent the next stage of evolution  if only the screenplay could have evolved beyond the formula plot as well  this should have been a three hour film  character development and character interrelations were left on the cutting room floor in some mutantless dimension where quality takes precedence over box office sales how this brings to mind the theatrical release of the abyss and its unsatisfying endwell undoubtedly there will be a sequel and undoubtedly too some adult entertainment company will mutate this into the xx which more than likely and in totally contrast will have indepth character relations and absolutely no plot  welcome to america,fantasy
thank god it didnt suckafter having lived through the various incarnations of batman and superman its nice to finally see a superhero comic turned movie done rightgranted its not the kickass blockbuster summer movie it could have been but im just counting my lucky stars that it didnt suckit could have been much worseanybody see the fantastic four movie no not surprising youd be hard pressed to find it on videothere have been so many bad superhero movies youd think someone would have sat down viewed them all and finally figured out what wasnt done or was done wrong with all of them then they could have produced a good filmwell apparently bryan singer did just that along with the other writers tom desanto and david hayter bryan wrote and directed what may be considered the first good movie based on a comic seriesbut there were still things that didnt make it great and they all relate directly to the medium of movies itselfthings most people wont like about the film the first problem was the length ninety minutes is no where near enough time to present the full depth of history of professor xavier and his school of mutants but they made a valiant effort anyway unfortunately they only left the comic series fans wanting more and those unfamiliar with the comic going huhsecond is the ineffective sabertooth through numerous fight scenes we note that he is supposedly wild and beastlike thats it he has claws and occasionally when he opens his mouth we hear the mgm lion fans will know that sabertooth has the same healing abilities as logan and is in fact a much better killerfighter than logan in the comic series he has wiped the floor with logan repeatedlynonfans in the theatre will no doubt note that sabertooth is struck with several lethal blows including both of logans claws sunk knuckle deep into his chest and never seems to be hurt for those not familiar with sabertooths abilities these scenes will appear as gaffs or continuity errors heck they felt like continuity errors to me and i knew what was going onthings that will bother the fansrogue is young definitely in her early teens and you never get any explanation as to where she picked up her nickname but her age works for the movie the relationship that develops between her and logan is believable and surprisingly touching i also feel her young age played on the sympathy for her curse much more than the comic series ever could this is aided in no small part by anna paquins marvellous actingno danger room which is a big disappointment to me too but one i can live with including the danger room would have been fantastic and i would have been willing to sit through a three hour movie if theyd been willing to fit it inthings that will bother the fanatics bobby drake iceman one of the original in the series is just another teenage student in the movietoad is the best fighter of all the characters hero and villain now i actually enjoyed this and ray park darth maul did a kickass job of well kicking ass but this will bother the purists as in the comic series toad was always there more for comic relief than anythingwe didnt get to see more of the other mutants and their abilities but this is good in the long run for the film since so much of it is taken up with introducing the characters already if theyd added any more full characters like bobbyiceman the movie would have ended up being nothing but an roll callthe costumes are nothing like the comic book series again though this is very much a good thingwolverines skeleton is made out of adamantium supposedly unbendable and unbreakable magneto was twisting his blades around like they were tinorroro and jeans powers are pale shadows of their comic book versions i cant help but wonder if this isnt another indication of hollywoods vaguely misogynistic ruling class but thats a rant and better suited to a different articlethings that will bother the nonfans who the hell is this charles xavier and where the hell does he get the funding for this school of his we can assume magneto stole money for his nefarious offshore base and probably constructed most of it himself too but charles is supposedly a good guy and wouldnt stoop to anything illegal so whats his sourceactually i dont think this was ever explained in the comic eitherthings to absolutely love about the movie mystique kicks ass both figuratively and literally as a villain she is smart cunning and powerful she comes very close to defeating wolverine which is impressive in either incarnation another hollywood paranoia moment though only villainous murderous women can be powerful just a thoughtthe special effects are used effectively and sparingly the only gratuitous inclusion in my mind was magnetos little executive toy hovering above his desktoad kicks ass i cant help but feel that ray park is on his way to an action movie series i can only hope he winds up better than jeane claude van damme so far he is kept to short lines between fight scenes he gets to use his signature weapon spin at least once as he did in episode 1 and sleepy hollowquotes like dont kick him in the balls but you said anything goes yeah but if you kick him in the balls hell take it personallywait how do we know its you youre a dick okay its yourating for the fans 5 bottles out of six for the nonfans 4 bottles out of six,fantasy
 is a strange movie to review  its main problem is the same as its greatest strength  the best thing is the great characters of wolverine and rogue  the worst thing is the characters of every one else  patrick stewart is great as charles xavier and ian mckellen is great as magnito but their characters are not as developed as they should be  the other characters suck  storm cyclops toad  jean gray is the best secondary character some people have complained that the have human looking mutants and the brotherhood of mutants are all physically mutated  but if you think about it the reason the mutants in the brotherhood hate humans is that humans have rejected them hate them and fear them  it is easier to hate someone who looks different  each character looks great and are very true to the comic book  the only problem i found will the characters looks is that they had to cover up rebecca romaine stamoss gorgeous body with blue paint  halle berrys wig is kind of distracting too over all i heavily enjoyed the movie,fantasy
i saw the new film last night and approvedthough not entirely what i expected the movie did not disappoint and i was very pleased that it was not a campy overthetop production the film was too short and therefore did not allow for any type of development for all the charactersstorm was especially underusedthis was not an actionspecialeffects driven film as most comic booksummer movies tend to be but it has a good amount of action for most peoplei was also surprised by how funny the movie was at some pointsthe interactions between wolverine and cyclops are some of the better personal scenes of the moviehugh jackman delivers as wolverine 110 the films few errors fade when we see the first sniktno actor disappoints in their roles because most of them dont get the chance this film revolves around wolverine rogue and magneto the rest of the characters serve to occupy camera time even to an extent and im surprised to say patrick stewart dont get me wrong when hes onscreen he does the job but we dont see him that much throughout the filmsee this film today tomorrow and next weekend,fantasy
a definite must for those who like movies with big brash heroes with foibles  there are lines that are definitely made for the comic book fans but even nonfans will get a kick out of this movie  cant wait to own it on dvd,fantasy
this movie was awesome it is of course based on the stan leemarvel comic the uncanny ive never been a comic reader but saturday morning always meant a new cartoon so ive always been an fan and this movie does not disappoint the acting is excellent in all of the roles i am especially glad to see some of the minor roles such as halle berry as storm add a lot to the plot definitely a must see,fantasy
i will admit i am not an avid reader of the comics but have seen the cartoon show and trading cards my main reason for being disappointed with this film is that it of its slow pace and minimal storyline not enough character development and the colour scheme is too dark unlike the cartoon which is colorful but on the positives hugh jackman makes a cool wolverinehe delivers the lines with the dry humour you need anna paquin is absolutely stunning as rouge beautiful and dangerous overall they could have done better and i hope for a sequel  batman still rules,fantasy
while it was accessible to general audiences it was merely adequate for fans im no comic freak i did wait for 2 12 years to see this and i was impressed with singerwho ironically never read the comicfor visualizing a movie he had no idea where to begin that fact shows itself to serious fans but i did not feel i wasted money simply put there are just too many characters and not enough time action sequences are pretty fine but i kept recalling joel schumachers silly batman sequals its obvious the special fx were a bit shoestring but it was more or less better than average i wish they could have fleshed out magneto a bit more and explained his and pros xs previous friendship wolvie was cool and they even made his hair look cool sabretooth should not have been as oafish and assheaded as he was and fans will agree that a big fight bt certain characters was missingwink wink mystique was too cool for her own goodthough i still wanna marry romijnplot left a little to be desired but acting was top notch all aroundexcept james marsden which brings to mind the fact that jean grey was not supposed to be considerably older than cyclops i guess i could keep nit picking and while i know nothing compared to other people about the comic i still think that while it wasnt bad it couldve been better i do trust that the sequel will be better and i believe singer will again be up to the challenge all in allit missed the mark for serious fans but certainly couldve been much worse rating3 out of 5 stars,fantasy
i just saw this movie last night  even through i wouldnt know an from superman i loved it  it is wonderfully wellacted and a great story line  and wolverine  two words describe him  yum yum  it was also funny a surprising thing in an action and special effects movie  the lines were delivered well and dr xavier was wellplayed by our favorite bald guy patrick stewart  it wasnt just designed to be pleasing to the eyes but to the funnybone also  and believe me wolverine and cyclops in leather does not make you miss the yellow spandex let me tell you  the villiains were wellplayed sabretooth was very menacing  toad was very good especially his huge tongue that would put kiss to shame  i recommend even if you are not anaphilic see this movie its fantastic,fantasy
i didnt hate it i didnt love it  since i am in the middle please call medisappointed i didnt expect that much going into it  i am glad i didnt because i would of asked to see the 30mins of film cut out of it so i could get my moneys worthwhen i left i felt as if i just watched a 96 min long preview for the next moviethe character development was weak wolverine was pretty good but could of done more explaining covering up holes so they show flashes into wolverines past ok then explain some of it did halle berry really want to be there it didnt look that way to me  patrick stewart did an excellent job  i dont like the way the writer got rid of him could of explained that stuff in his cerebro machine which knocked him sillythe plot was horrible whooppe  mad man trying to destroy mankindthe effects were good  did they spend half the budget creating that radiation fieldfight scenes were ok  i liked the fight scene on the statue of liberty thought some parts of the fight between wolverine and mystique could of been better  i found it hard to believe that toad could take on three and whomp on themit was a decent movie  i know little kids and teens are going to love it i on the other hand need stronger movies to fuel my mind not just impress with with special fx  at least it was better than that last batman and robin moviei say go and watch the movie i think youll like it,fantasy
ok i admit i was really worried about how this film would turn out being a diehard fan i had already accepted the fact that i would most likely be disappointed with the film  but to my surprise is terrific  director bryan singer was faced with a really tough task in trying to find a way to introduce the to those who werent familiar with them while at the same time providing an engrossing adventure for diehard fanswell you can breathe a sigh of relief because singer pulls it off perfectly  much of the first part of the film is spent introducing the characters and their powers but i was never bored  singer also did a fantastic job with the relationships between the characters  the bickering between cyclops and wolverine had the entire theather howling with laughterin one scene wolverine comes back into a room where cyclops storm and jean are after he gets through fighting mystique  cyclops is about to blast him thinking its mystique and wolverine says hey wait its me  cyclops replies prove it  wolverine responds with youre a dick  cyclops ok good enough for me  the big brotherlittle sister relationship between wolverine and rogue helps us go deeper into the charactersthats the beauty of this film  you go for the fantastic action scenes and special effects and believe me theyre awesome and you also get treated to a cast of characters that you fall in love with  my gripes with the film are very few and far between  halle berry sucked as storm but i expected that going in  her dialogue consists of about 5 oneliners throughout the whole movie  those who arent familiar with the comic or cartoon wont notice anything wrong but those of us who know what an important and fantastic character storm is will be disappointed to see her reduced to thissecond xavier has a huge role in the first half of the film but very little in the 2nd half  professor x gets    incapacitated halfway through the film and spends the 2nd half of it lying in the infirmary doing nothing more than showing off his bald head and hairy chest  anyway these are very minor gripes  overall i would give a 9 out of 10,fantasy
this was a very good transition from comics to the big screen better than superman or any other dc comics attempt  the last time i saw a transition so accurate to the story was with captain america if you havent seen it then check it out its good  there were some flaws though that only fans of the series might see  ie  colossus is in the movie yet he is not young when he joins the  other than that not much wrong with the movie not much wrong what am i saying  it was awesome  it could have used professor x to have the golden chair instead of a regular wheelchair but i guess our own technology puts limits on movies at times if you are a fan of the series then you will love the movie  if you are not a fan but just want to see what the hype was all about then i am sure that the special effects and jokes will be enough to keep you entertained,fantasy
this was an excellent movie for the budget they were working with  the script did a great job of packing quite a bit of information into a short amount of time  by doing so they did skip some more indepth characterization but thats understandable  theres still plenty there to get a sense of where the characters stand  the story had some very entertaining and impressive action sequences as well as some occasional sarcastic humor which fit the characters nicely  i went to the movie with my wife and four others who had never touched any comic or other comic most likely and knew nothing about the heroes that they did not learn in the movie  they all enjoyed it  my wife wants to see it again which surprises me  even the person in the group who is non action movie oriented gave it a thumbs up not a superexcitedwow thumbs up but a thumbs up nonetheless  having read the comics as a child which i like to think wasnt too long ago i caught a few inside jokes which were nice to see  there are some changes to some characters for instance the original comic had an iceman character as a charter memberhere hes a younger more minor character but they do not seem like they would be detrimental to the story for longtime fans  i would venture a guess that there will be sequels and that the budget will be much larger next time and the running time will probably be extended  im sure that there will be more development of relationships throughout the series  this was a very good start with what they had to work with  if you talk to someone who has read the comic after you see the movie they will probably fill you in on a couple things about the characters and their pasts that would be interesting in reflection and setup the next couple of films  like i said i was the only person who had any background knowledge of the and our whole party enjoyed it thoroughly  job well donehave fun,fantasy
well it was better than battlefield earth i will give it that first off it should have been called wolverine in big letters and the in small letters off to the side the whole movie focuss on wolverine and rouge the flashbacks to wolverines past seem like just an excuse to make a sequel later  the rest of the team is just there as an excuse for some fx the villains dont really do anything either they fight with the now and then but dont really do anything then toad and mystique kick all of thes asses by themselves huh  storm just sits and gets her butt kicked twice and only seems to use her powers at just the right time and when that is all that will save everyone same with cyclops and jean speaking of jean she is a tk yet outside of a few useless times she never uses her power there is more than one time where she could end the fight and win the day if she used her tk but she just sits there whining the pointless cameos are annoying as well  kitty pyro iceman and others are there for no reason other than to be there   i dont know where i should start in pointing out the many many moronic plot details and problems first the mutant making machine what the hell is that  magneto has a machine that can make a human into a mutant  fing stupid i also guess that being stuck in a mutant making battery and dying turns some not all of your hair white  when mystique changes form the cgi people have no idea what mass is she is sneaking into a thesion as a young boy and when she changes back to her she doesnt change size height or anything  in the comics she could also never have kicked the crap out of wolverine but seems to do it with barely any effort here sabertooth is just a big hairy bum toad is just annoying and really stupid the fights are so overblown and over the top that they are funny to watch every time someone gets hit they go flying back or up as if there was a stagehand off camera pulling them there is no logic shown in the movie by any of the characters and especially not by the cops i cant explain it but when you see the scene with the cops you will end up beating your head against the wall at how dumb it is next the fx some look good and others like mystiques transformation are such obvious cgi layovers they look ridiculous the sets look like something stolen from a james bond film come on there is no way you could subcontract out the work needed to build these complexes and keep it a secret and not cost billions of dollars  the dialog was awful and was really  forced the performances where either bad or average and the plot twists can be seen 10 minutes before they happen now the fact that none of the characters even come close to their comic counterparts is something i was willing to over look but these are so far off it is blasphemous  this is yet in a long line of awful comic movies and is up there with batman and robin and superman 4 avoid at all costs at least i got to see the trailer for highlander endgame,fantasy
as a long time fan of the comics i entered the movie with some prejudice however director bryan singer did an excellent job transforming the comic universe on to film  special effects story line and casting were all excellent  when i first heard of the team of used i was disappointed when i learned that they were not using the original team of jean grey cyclops iceman beast and angel however i soon realized that to tell a story that everyone would enjoy that some changes would have to be made  i was also concerned when i learned that rogue would not have her flight capabilities and super human strength like she has in the comic but singers use of her powers was a great way to move the plot i hope other comic fans will go in with an open mind if so i believe that they will enjoy the film and hopefully will discover the wonderful comic universe singer salute you thank you for doing the justice,fantasy
xamining the xfactor panthera july 12th 2000wolverine fans are going to love this movie storm fans are going to get a real kick about halfway through but if your favourite happens to be one of the other you could well be in for disappointmentjudged on its own merits the movie is well worth seeing granted the major plot twist is more than a little predictable but the character interaction is nicely done and without any cheesiness or schmaltz for example the conflict between xavier and magneto is excellent not least due to the talent of the actors there is no posturing or rhetoric these men have known respected and opposed each other for many years and that is exactly the effect that patrick stewart and ian mckellan conveyunderstated isnt a word usually associated with a comicbook movie but strangely enough it applies to this one alongside the character interaction the special effects that give the their powers on screen are elegantly done depicting the various mutant abilities with a subtlety that makes them all the easier to imagine in the real worldgiven that it would be impossible to cram 30 years of comicbook history into a twohour movie the creators of have aimed for a blend of old and new and also attempted to make the movie easier to understand for those who have never read the comic unfortunately neither gambit pun intended is entirely successfulaside from the aforementioned wolvie fans comic diehards are going to need a good dose of charity toward this movie of the major characters only wolverine and xavier seem entirely themselves cyclops in manner at least is a posturing adolescent and one wonders what the far more mature dr jean grey yes doctor grey  shades of hank mccoy perhaps ever sees in him jean herself seems rather flat and bland as does storm but this may be because their purpose in the movie is to provide background for wolverine and roguerogue is depicted at the time of her life immediately after her powers appear she is lost and alone and it is easy to believe that the comic book rogue was once this way along with wolverine she finds herself inside xaviers school for the gifted the school too is different from the comics it actually has classes of students in attendance and among these we find some familiar characters such as shadowcat and iceman whose presence the movie as in jokes for the initiated is both entertaining and annoying at the same timeof the villains mystique is stunning although the character is once again quite different from the comic book version the toad is closer to being himself and proves to be the most interesting and entertaining of the baddies while sabretooth is not nearly as formidable or as engaging as he could bethe movie has plucked the characters and the character traits from different times in the comic books history  a young cyke an older jean  and thrown them together a combination which doesnt quite mesh longtime fans can spot the discrepancies and new initiates are left confusedalso for firsttime viewers there are some minor details left unexplained  wolverines heightened senses for example are never mentioned but suddenly hes sniffing and identifying people by scent likewise storms claustrophobia while not essential to the action or the plot is never mentioned even though she is placed in a situation which would trigger iton the whole the movie manages to portray the action and adventure of the original without going overboard either with the characters or the effects but longtime xfans will need to cut it some slack sit back relax and let it come at you,fantasy
more movies should be made with this much care  it certainly did everything that movies are supposed to do  it was entertaining it held my attention throughout i was able to suspend my belief and i was drawn in by the story and kept inside the movies reality with engaging and welldrawn charactersthis is truly a rarity  a summer blockbuster with a real story most are analogous to porn  in that there is no plot but manages to do what it is supposed to do at the basest and fleeting of ways  the effects were made for the story not the other way around  i am not an fan but i know who they are  i am sure there are fans who dont like the movie just like people who have read the book first  it can never be the samei was especially taken with the underlying story of prejudice and how the downtrodden feel and react to their oppressors  this is a scary view into the history of man  it explores one of our potentially harmful traits  wanting to judge and blame certain peoples for our troubles  fear and a feeling of a lack of control is something you can see as a motivating force for some of the main characters  with this you get a really good idea of magneto not simply as mainvillainwearesupposedtohate to more of a man with his own ideas of how best to deal with the prejudice against him and his kindthe acting was very good especially with patrick stewart and ian mckellan the man who plays wolverine was especially into his role and very effective it was great to see anna paquin again  i doubt she will get a nod for this role from the academy but she played it as it was supposed to be played  as a sad young innocent just trying to find her place in the world the relationship between rogue and wolverine was well written and grew as the picture playedabove all it is the best summer blockbuster i have seen in a long time the action sequences were engaging and cool   there are a lot of details to see i think this is a movie worth paying for to see more than once  the great thing about it is that there isnt just one or two things that work in this film  the whole thing works  i am sure i can find its weakness after more viewings but i still think its strengths far outweigh any mistakes i am 31 and i really enjoyed it  my brother went with me and he said that he believed that at least it would be nominated for an oscar tm for makeup  i agreebryon singer surrounded himself with credited and uncredited talent and it shows  fortunately the movie did not drown in this pool of talent  of course there seemed that some things were left out the only antihuman mutants background we know about is magnetos but that just means i was interested enough in what i was told to want to know more  besides noone wants to see a ten hour movie and there are always sequels  this movie does promise a sequel but not with a cheesy cliffhanger  it offers enough to stand on its own while making you care enough about the characters and their situation to want to see moreand that is the greatest compliment i can give this movie  it left me satisfied but at the same time it ended making me want more,fantasy
some twenty years ago i became a fan of the comics  i followed the story for about five years before drifting on  so i was intrigued by the notion of the liveaction movie  i was skeptical as comic book characters as a rule do not translate well to live action christopher reeves superman 1st movie only and the first batman movie notwithstanding the spiderman and hulk live actions were pretty lamei was not disappointed in this movie  the characterizations are deadon accurate the special effects are satisfying and the storyline was solid if i have one problem it might be the casting of anna paquin as rogue she did a fine job but rogue is about 7 years older than paquins character the one performance that was a tad weak was halle berrys storm but then they didnt do too much with the character for her to sink her teeth intoin particular wolverine was everything i hoped he would beall in all a must see movie for comic book fans and fans everywhere as well as those who like a good fantasy yarn,fantasy
this was easily the best comicbook movie ever done faithful where it needed to be and taking liberties only where necessary and only to make the story better they avoided most of the common pitfalls like making it campy and while most of the characters are pretty light hugh jackman and anna paquin really bring life to their roles and mckellen shines as magnetoif you dont like superheroes you may not care for it but if you dont like superheroes because of goofy dialogue strange spandex costumes and totally ludicrous plots rather than just hating the concept youll probably enjoy it a lot and superhero especially fans will greatly enjoy it,fantasy
while it was accessible to general audiences it was merely adequate for fans though im no comic freak i did wait for 2 12 years to see this and i was impressed with singerwho ironically never read the comicfor visualizing a movie he had no idea where to begin that fact shows itself to serious fans but i did not feel i wasted money simply put there are just too many characters and not enough time action sequences are pretty fine but i kept recalling joel schumachers silly batman sequels its obvious the special fx were a bit shoestring but it was more or less better than average i wish they could have fleshed out magneto a bit more and explained his and prof xs previous friendship wolvie was cool and they even made his hair look cool sabretooth should not have been as oafish and assheaded as he was and fans will agree that a big fight bt certain characters was missingwink wink mystique was too cool for her own goodthough i still wanna marry romijnplot left a little to be desired but acting was top notch all aroundexcept james marsden which brings to mind the fact that jean grey was not supposed to be considerably older than cyclops i guess i could keep nit picking and while i know nothing compared to other people about the comic i still think that while it wasnt bad it couldve been better i do trust that the sequel will be better and i believe singer will again be up to the challenge all in allit missed the mark for serious fans but certainly couldve been much worse rating3 out of 5 stars,fantasy
many times in college my roommates and i would sit around and muse about how much we wished certain comics would become movies sure enough was top of that list for us well after all those years it was worth the wait although i am an old school kind of guy i must admit that the overall atmosphere and feel of the movie was very refreshing yes the colors are gone but the new sleek look is very very cool and while i yearn for nightcrawler colussus iceman angel and beast oh hank where were you it would have been overkill for those not familiar with the comic it was an interesting twist to see them portrayed as youngsters at the institute though fans of the comic and cartoons pay real close attention to the scene in the jet when they get ready to go save the world i am not going to spoil it for you but the little exchange between cyclops and wolverine is priceless all in all i was quite pleased for once the movie lived up to the hype oh and michael kamens soundtrack was a nice touch too you knew the music was there but it never distracted from the action of which there is plenty give this one a chance even the most pessimistic among you may be surprised an excellent way to spend 2 hours of your day,fantasy
if you like comic books or scifi actionadventure this movie is for you do not be turned away by the pg13 rating  this movie is for young and old and all those in between  it stays true to the comic book line  theres not a lot on character background but i think that adds to the mystery youre given enough to keep you interested and wanting more  the fight scenes are acrobatic actionpacked and believable for mutants that is definitely well worth seeing,fantasy
like everyone else i was a little worried about seeing this film but i was truly surprised by the long line at the theater i had no problem getting into phantom menace on its opening day but i barely managed to make the second showing of anyway i gave this film an 8 out of 10 although it probably only deserves a 7 heres why the direction pretty good though bryan singer needs to improve his fight sequences a bit the fight between wolverine and sabretooth on the statue of liberty cut to so many angles i lost track of which was up or down but i give him credit for taking the charactors seriously the story pretty much like a marvel comic not very original but at least we were explained magnetos motivations i would have liked this film to have been a half hour longer i keep reading great charactorization from other reviews and thats true for wolverine rogue and magneto but what about the rest of the cast and will non fans understand what happens to professor x with cerebro yep another half hour would have been great the acting hugh jackman now has a career in hollywood everyone else did a satisfactory job except for tyler mane who growls like a lion more than he speaks but thats the writers fault and of course halle berry who except for the elevator scene walked around with a blank look on her face it didnt help that she was given the worst lines to read which brings me to the worst line storm would you like to know what lightning does to a toad toadaaah zapped by lightening storm the same thing it does to anything else i have to say that despite the above flaws it was still a very entertaining movie that hopefully will create an even better sequal,fantasy
many of the website reviews on the internet overly praise this moviesome sites have rated it higher than gladiatordo not believe the hypethe thing is if your expectaions were low for this moviethe movie would be great for youand think that is the problem with these reviewsthe movie is okthe action is okbut definitely not equal to the action in bladeintensity was lacking in this movie and the action could have been a lot better,fantasy
i will not give a long review giving away any of the plot i just have three words to say  go see it  it is the best comic book movie that i have ever seen and i have seen them all  true to the fan and good for the public  go see it,fantasy
the teaser for looked interesting the trailer looked good the movie was great it follows the xploits hah of professor charles xavier patrick stewart and his band of evil doer whoopers led by poster boy cyclops james marsden  together they fight bad guy magneto ian mckellan and his band of stone cold crazies  the movie that ensues is an intriguing and entertaining comic book adaption that great director bryan singer the usual suspects apt pupil delivers with enough artistic merit to please us film buffs  having been a fan of singers i was sketchy for a while to hear that he was directing but all in all he did a fine job  great performances by stewart and mckellan but the show stealer is aussie hugh jackman  hollywood is going to come a knocking for mr j,fantasy
i didnt hate it i didnt love it  since i am in the middle please call medisappointed i didnt expect that much going into it  i am glad i didnt because i would of asked to see the 30mins of film cut out of it so i could get my moneys worthwhen i left i felt as if i just watched a 96 min long preview for the next moviethe character development was weak wolverine was pretty good but could of done more explaining covering up holes so they show flashes into wolverines past ok then explain some of it did halle berry really want to be there it didnt look that way to me  patrick stewart did an excellent job  i dont like the way the write got rid of him could of explained that stuff in his cerebro machine  ok kill off sen kelly what about the sentinnels he builds please dont be like the people who work on the spiderman comics and say he was a clonethe plot was horrible a big machine that uses radiation to turn the normals into mutants  whooppe  mad man trying to destroy mankindthe effects were good  did they spend half the budget creating that radiation fieldfight scenes were ok  i liked the fight scene on the statue of liberty thought some parts of the fight between wolverine and mystique could of been better  i found it hard to believe that toad could take on three and whomp on themit was a decent movie  i know little kids and teens are going to love it i on the other hand need stronger movies to fuel my mind not just impress with with special fx  at least it was better than that last batman and robin moviei say go and watch the movie i think youll like it,fantasy
wow  i was blown away  just seeing these characters ive read for so long come to life was too much  i dont see how the casting could have been any better  each actor captured the essence of their character  i cant wait to see it again,fantasy
i must say i thouroughly enjoyed  i thought the action scenes were well directed courtesy of bryan singer who directs my favorite movie of all time usual suspects and most of the costumes were consistent with the comic  i though that wolverine was one bad dude but storm was a little weak with some cheezy lines  some of the humor was funny with the little second grade quarrel between cyclops and wolverine  i also enjoyed the crack that cyclops made about wolverines old costume my one true beef with this movie is that it is too short  it seemed as if it was an extended preview  if it were a little more complex and longer it could be one of my favorites in a long time i must say get to this one in the theatres,fantasy
when i first heard of this movie and seen the previews i was excited to go see it  after a few weeks though i began to wander  would it be as horrible as most but not all movies based on super heros and comics would the acting be below average  would the running time be enough to tell the storyeven with my doubts i went to see it and im glad i did  i cant think of a single real complaint aside from little picky things  this movie is filled with great action story and humor  there was at least 4 to 5 times where the whole audience got a good laugh going and many chuckling moments here and there  the story was good and really gets you interested and the action was great enough to cause cheeringill be glad to see a sequel and as long as most of this cast is in the next ill probably see it  i say this movie is a 10 easy when compared to other movies of this type super heros action etc  highly worth seeing,fantasy
you might as well as said wolverine as wolverine because jackman was at home in this role  from his first scene smokin a cigar and fightin in a barjackman brought wolvies character out like no one else could have you had no preconcieved notions of him because youve never heard of him and that was the best start  aside from jackmans awesome portrayal of wolverine this movie was awesome  the is quite possibly the greatest comic to movie adaptation ever  it is definitely one of the best of the summer,fantasy
what a moviewhat an actor hugh jackman takes us by the throat in his portrayal of wolverine is soooo good its damn good he oozes all the typical wolverine characteristics will ease and without breaking a sweat the physical characteristics 1 he looks identical to wolverine eg hair buildetchis portrayal is so realistic its worth many viewings over and over againthis is not just a special effects driven movie its worth it to see aussie hugh in action from cyclops bike to drinking beer in the bar to his fierce rivalry with sabretooth its all there to his romantic love interest with jeangreyjackman portrays the rebellious man so well indeedhe doesnt believe prof x about the laughing it off as a jokehe will definitely be filled with many many opportunities in the months to come definitely a potential a list star among the likes of russell crowe and mel gibsonboth australians cant wait for 2 i heard it will be gambits movie,fantasy
some spoilers read at your own risk i walked in expecting a great movie walked out and saw a movie that was basically a masterpiece first the cast hugh jackman as loganwolverine hugh jackman is wolverine his gruff looks beard and mannerisms everytime he snikts his claws you almost feel transported into the comic book however i agree that he did do a little too much but he was awesome patrick stewart as professor x perfect ps is the spitting image of xavier and although he didnt require much physical activity he did a great job anna paquin as rogues good although i know shes still a teenager i kinda wanted her to do more she screamed a lot and gave a hard look a lot as well but she was still good ian mckellen as magneto awesome ian mckellen portrays magneto in all his nastiness when he flies its outstanding hes just so evil and looks cool in that cape and hat everyone else famke janssen was good a perfect love interest for scott but didnt do much james mardsen was great as cylcops he looks like him but also acts like him a nononsense leader why immediately despises logan and the two chit chats make up for some of the funniest lines in the movie gotta love it when logan flips off cyclops halle berry wasnt that great at all with storm she didnt do much the most underdeveloped character and she had few lines and when spoke them sounded like she was reading cue cards ray park was kool as toad and ended up being the most interesting baddie he had these eyes his mannerisms and gotta love it when hes onscreen and finally ray talks well not a lot tyler mane did his best job as a disappointing sabretooth who sadly was riddled with bad cliche lines like when he picks up storm and tells her to scream for him but that wasnt his fault and finally rebecca stamos i wouldnt even bother trying to spell her maiden name they made such a big deal about her but she was onscreen for like a total of ten minutes but she did surprise us every now and then bruce davidson was the perfect condescending baddie who in one scene made me almost throw up surprised me a lot it had way more humor than i expected it to just seeing logan and scott onscreen would equal a chuckle because of the tension between them i personally thought that storm and sabretooth two of my most favorite characters were a little under developed but good the action is relentless and i only counted one boring scene some people had say this is a short movie but really isnt its around 105 minutes but so good it seems like 80 minutes i loved the way bryan singer directed it but of course we gotta respect the writers because without em no movies would exist we gotta thank them for giving us a real dimensional comic book movie for healing the cuts batman made sure blade and spawn were goodbut not this good and of course making everyone forget marvel went bankrupt and made punisher but lets not bring that up i know it wasnt a comic book movie but in my opinion blew matrix out of the water simply because i thought some of the characters were better developed than in matrix i loved the heck outta this movie it was so good look out for shadowcat jubilee i think i saw nightcrawlerbut not positive and iceman had a small role and of course many answers arent answered mystique is still alive judging by the sen kelly video magneto isnt dead and im not quite sure if sabretooth and toad are dead either wolverines got to come back and of course theres bishop cable gambit angel and many others especially beast to explore also we saw shots of prof x walking and wolverine having dreams of his surgery these are never explained so all this adds up to another movie i hope its as actionpacked funny suspenseful surprising and downright awesome as the first one 1010,fantasy
well has finally hit australian shores and in front of a packed cinema last night we finally got to see what all the hype is about after the trailers the web sites and the numerous bits of gossip that have leaked out about this highly anticipated entry into the superhero franchiseit does not disappoint  its got something for everyone  it has lots of backstory setting up the whole thing for three of our main characters rogue wolverine and magneto its got a fantastic english actor playing magneto mckellen and it has plenty of action to keep the adrenaline junkies happyas i said it does go into the backstory quite extensively for three of the leads though it does add a richness to the whole thing that you would otherwise not think instead of being bored with the backstory it instead intrigues you  they have certainly left plenty there for a sequel  in fact is probably the most open ended movie i have seen for quite a whilewith such a relatively large cast some characters are left underdeveloped or underused  cyclops jean grey and storm are the notable candidates  but in a story that focusses its energies elsewhere it is understandable that this had to happen  i am sure they will get more to do in the next filmit does have plenty of good one liners to keep it bobbing along my personal favourite and one to look out for is the youre a dick lineits also over very quickly  i am sure it went for no more than 90 minutes  once the climactic battle on top of the statue of liberty is finished you realise just how quickly the time has goneon the negative side the score is absolutely woeful  michael kamen does just not deliver the goods in this case  this movie called for a big majestic score to go with the impressive visuals  what we get is some tink tink in the background with the tv series theme thrown in once or twice for good measurethe effects are quite good but not as good as their boast best special effects since the matrix  but they should slow down the graphical representations they use when planning their battles they often flowed by and you couldnt make out what the hell they were looking at promises and delivers  it is big dumb fun that will please the entire audience  i am certainly looking forward to more entries in this particular franchise9 out of 10,fantasy
yup this movie stands above mortal kombat street fighter spawn judge dredd and the likes of it hell all the following i mentioned above are not even good it was even better than blade and the original batman movie i finally realize what makes a superhero movie work a good director and a production crew who actually cares most of these other shameful attempts are made by people who either have a long list of bad movies under their name or have no list at all backed by the companies who are shamelessly using their trademark names looking for a quick buckfortunately theyve now learned their lesson i guess after watching spawn and mortal kombat flopping at the box office theyve figured that they can no longer fool the audience with theyve finally picked a critically acclaimed director in bryan singer usual suspects im quiet impressed by what he achieved because making this movie is a very hard task if you were one of those comic book junkies like am i you know what i mean the original story of the is so complex and broad that i thought it would be impossible to create in a less than two hours movie but this guy actually made it workthis movie beats the gladiator for the title best movie of the year its a must see dont forget though people in the future when you start hearing big hypes on certain movies check who are actually making them,fantasy
not being an avid comic book reader but being familiar with the characters i went into this movie wondering if the same mistake made  the batman sequels would be made  that mistake being too many characters and trying to give them all screen time which results in a hurried feeling and no plot or character development  im glad to say that wasnt the case at all some people complained there were not enough fight scenes they were fine for me as a mattter of fact i thought the character development and storyline were fantastic and looked at the fight scenes as great bonuses this movie is a must see and ill probably watch it again you wont be disappointed   i cant wait for the sequel,fantasy
there are no words to express how fabulous this movie was  as an collector of 13 years i was not disappointed  in the future i hope my children will have the same divine experience at the movies  how often do we go to the movies wishing we could get a refund truly this was not the case with this movie  see it a couple times people  i doubt we are going to see another really good movie for quite sometime,fantasy
this movie has a great and unique quality  it is a comicbook movie that develops its own story while at the same time keeping loyal to its characters and backgrounds theres the usual good points to mention  the heroes and villains look great the fx are good the action is satisfactory but if you were looking for an intense edgeofyourseat action movieie something like the matrix you may be disappointment this is not where the heart of this movie lies what drives this movie is not the unique fightscenes that only superhuman individuals could reach but the characters this movie is about the personal struggles of the characters against their enemies and among each other  the director bryan singer uses his experience as an apt director to carry this through singer does a lot for this movie great camera angles editing and a sleak and serious overall look but his best contribution is how he directs the actors character development is done with very few words of dialogue and singer seems to know that the right expression and gestures will say more about a person than any great shakespeareesque speech could ever hope to do this movie has not only made is plausible but tasteful to have a sequel perhaps even a series of movies by the end of this film important questions were unanswered and personal issues were left unresolved  just like life i loved this movie and i hope that a sequel follows tightly to the style of the original,fantasy
i took my nineyear old to see and he loved it which was to be expected i guess  but i enjoyed it too  i found the batman series to be pretty tedious  too dark and brooding for a  comic bookinspired movie superman on the other hand was too light  it left no impression that lasted beyond exiting the theatrethe movie on the other hand though not perfect at least has an interesting cast that doesnt get completely overshadowed by the special effects which are very good  hugh jackman gives a convincing performance as the angstridden wolverine and anna paquin is a very believable rogue with considerable depth to her performance  patrick stewart is perfect for the role of professor x and the rest of the cast is adequatetrue the introduction of the characters takes up quite a bit of time but that is a lot more engrossing than the formulaic whizbang james bond kind of intro that moves from one special effect to the next with tedious predictability  the action when it came was good and sharply directed the big finale was a bit diffuse though  i kept wondering if it was going to be just the precursor to an even bigger showdown with magneto and crew and i dont think i would have been thinking that if it had had a bit more oomph to itbut that is a small quibble  i liked it  i think it is going to be a big hit,fantasy
the action sequences particularly those involving wolverine could have benefitted greatly from a director and choreographer more focused on making those scenes shine  while the matrix style action wouldnt have fit the fights came off as flat id put the plot on par with jurassic park  oh and there will be a sequel,fantasy
 is a great action movie it is an action movie based on comic book heros and finally a good comic book heroes movie adaption the best since batman returns they gave the fan of the comics what they wanted to seefirst of all hugh jackman is wolverine he steals the show he could not have been better casted the rest of the cast is pretty good also except maybe for halle berry her accent is pretty lame at least she looked perfect for the rolethe action was well executed overall it was a fast paced movie the jokes in the movie were not forced they belonged in the situation they were not placed in there just so there was jokes there was not crappy things like the bat express card or anything like thatthis movie is the foundation for a few sequels i think if so they need to continue to orient it for an adult audience if they do what they did with batman then they will kill it,fantasy
having never been a true fan of the comic books although i knew almost every character and what they didi wasnt sure how i would react to this film  the movie was fabulous though and i cant wait for the sequels hugh jackman is awesome i really hope hes gonna get the credit he deserves not to degrade russell crowe or anything but hugh would kick his a in an outback brawl anyday if ya ask me  anyway i think everyone was perfect for their role especially rebecca romijnstamosmmmmmm mmmmmm mmmm  halle berry was good too but her acting abilities werent really put to the test although she looked perfect for her role  all in all the movie was really great and special effects were never overused not in a matrix way or anything  i just wanna say bryan singer is a film genius and will be a legend someday and if you dont think is enough evidence for me to say thatyouve obviously never seen the usual suspects,fantasy
x men was one of the best movies i have seen all summerit was exciting and kept me on the edge of my seat patrick stewart and halle barry did wonderful jobs as professor charles xavier and stormororo munroe as well as hugh jackman  wolverinelogan  james marsden cyclopsscott summers famke janssen dr jean grey and anna paquin  rogue  the plot was great as logan and rogue try to find themselves and end up in the clutches of professer xavier and the x men together the x men try to rescue rogue from the evil magneto and together learn trust and friendship as well as dependence bryan singer did an excellent job directing this movie and the special affects were great i recommend this movie to anyone that was a fan of the x men cartoon series or anyone that wasnt i guarantee that you will be impressed with this movie,fantasy
this movie is so exactly what it should be  the characters are well realized and well acted they are as true to the comics feel as they could get and still be a live action movie  it was definitely in my opinion worth the wait  the story was a little on the skinny side but it really just left you hungry for a sequel  i am already planning to spend my entire entertainment allowance for a month on seeing this movie over and over and over,fantasy
im sure i wasnt the only comic fan wary of the movie i couldnt wait for it to come out but halfexpected it to disappoint so imagine my surprise when it turned out to be a very slick wellproduced filmthe makers obviously identified the problem of having too many heroes so reduced it five and did well with their choices predictably wolverine steals the show in fact hugh jackman turns in a firstrate performance as logan  making up for my early disappointment when i heard last year that russel crowe turned down the role scott and jean were both underused i thought and i didnt really like the dumbing down of jeans abilities but they can develop in fact the sequel should be even more impressive this movie has defined the characters culture and context very well the next one can just be an actionpacked rompcan you imagine a bondstyle opening featuring the how cool would that be and a very good way to introduce a new mutant or two hint hint writersproducersspecial mention for the cameo mutant appearances such as bobby kitty and jubilee hopre to see more of them next timean xlent film nothing too cerebral just great fun,fantasy
on friday morning july 14th the was released nationwide and this is a day that i had awaited with some anticipation  i had honestly looked forward to this movie more than any other that i can rememberwhy  well im certainly a fan and i know that filmmaking has the technology to do justice to the presentation of superheroes without the effects looking cheesy  if the story is solid this should be a good film i thought  i was disappointed when both of chicagos daily newspapers reviewers gave the film a less than stunning reviewroger ebert of the sun times was the more generous giving it 2 12 stars a lukewarm endorsement while michael wilmington of the tribune panned the film with 1 12 stars  everyones a critic and i think both these reviewers missed the mark  wilmington described the story as being so bad that the script must have been written in crayon  this from a person who gave titan a e 3 12 stars  if you enjoyed titan a e please do not take offense  while i thought that movie was visually appealing i thought its story was weak in numerous places  hey everyones a critic righti think roger ebert touched on two points that indicate that he failed to follow the story and does not appreciate the feel of the comic nor the film  he wondered openly why magneto would risk empowering his enemies by turning them into mutants  this was clearly explained in the movie magnetos motive in turning everyone into mutants was that he reasoned if everyone were a mutant the need to persecute persons on the basis of their differences would go away  this is arguably a good plan  i for one assume that if the world were all mutants we would find some other way to discriminate  like we would decide that some types of mutations were better than otherslater he allows that he does not understand the appeal of wolverine and what would make him a major character  afterall he reasons storm can control the weather and is the most powerful of the bunch  wouldnt that make her more important  surely mr ebert should understand the appeal of the laconic hero such as mifune toshiros yojimbo or clint eastwoods the man with no name  like wolverine these are people who might easily be bad but choose to fight on the side of good more or less  they are ultimately more interesting than well defined good guys and play a pivotal role in the story  not that you wouldnt want storm or cyclops on your sidebut im not here to critique the critics  i say all this merely to provide the backdrop against which i took friday afternoon off and went to see the matinee performance of  i was not disappointed  was i blown away by the movie  no  it wasnt like seeing raiders of the lost ark which left me worn out from its seemingly nonstop action  nor was i as impressed as i was with the matrix whose fresh story and astounding special effects caught me unpreparedin the case of i can say simply that my expectations were met  the effects were good convincing but did not dominate the story  they got wolverines claws just right sound and all  storm and magneto both manifested their control over the elements as you might expect and cyclops power blast was perfect  the story was straight from the comics in that it was true to the theme of the but its very basic just about bad guys versus good guys  it wasnt victor hugo nor herman melville but it was a good enough story for you to care  and i thought they did a good job of introducing characters and getting people who wouldnt know anything about the into the framework of the film  it wasnt an easy job given that there was a wide ensemble to be introduced  they had to compress a lot of history into what is just a few minutes  i thought the sets were good and the dialog was decent no speeches but the few lines were distributed fairly evenly across a number of characters  finally just as the effects did not dominate the story nor was it all out action  there was a story in between the fights and the effectswere there downsides  i suppose that i was disappointed that we didnt get to see a lot more interaction between mutants and nonmutants to bolster the sense of the strained relationship between them  similarly we are basically trapped in the mansion or magnetos lair for much of the film what we do see of the outside world indicates that it is not so different from our own and that is a plus for this film versus the comic book worlds of films such as batman or the crow  all in all though i would say they did a credible job in the time alloted to the filmperhaps this doesnt sound like a ringing endorsement and its true that i am not going around telling people that they cannot afford to miss this film  rather i would say that if you think you might like the then you will  they did a good job on this film and im looking forward to their adventures in the futureps  i took my wife to see the film later that evening and she liked it too,fantasy
while is far from flawless at least mr singer seems to respect the characters and the source material enough to take them seriously which is more than i can say for mr shumacher or mr burton the first half of the film works surprisingly well especially the haulocost sequence and logans introduction  whats also fascinating is that bryan singer seems more interested in the quiet moments than in the pyrotechnics  wolverines conversation with rogue at the train station for example  there is a certain fragile quality to those scenes unfortunately things fall apart in the third act mainly because of the thin plot and surprisingly lifeless action sequences  although the train station battle and magnetos stand off with the police are handled well  you can almost feel the film pulling its punches  i would have preferred a more straight forward approach to the fight coreography instead of all the hong kong style wire work  note to bryan singer and company just because the matrix grossed nearly two hundred million does not mean that every comic book movie has to look like iron monkey i liked what i saw but i wanted more  im really curious as to what was in those 35 to 45 minutes that fox took out of this film just prior to release  ill bet it consisted mostly of character development and plot hopefully bryan will get a bigger budget and a longer running time with the sequel after fox sees this weekends box office results bryan seems to aiming for a thinking mans popcorn movie and while he wasnt completly successful this time i can see what hes getting at  if nothing else youve earned my respect mr singer  i give you a well deserved b this time  maybe fox will take you more seriously now that youve delivered the 4th biggest opening in history  with 2 i think you should have a reasonable shot at an a,fantasy
a true scifi gem  its reassuring to see hollywood have finally produced another welladapted comic they seemed to lose the plot after tim burtons batman  as one would expect the special effects are nothing short of mesmerising the script is wonderful  with more than a few inside jokes and the cast is fabulous  patrick stewart apparently had a ball as professor x and anna paquin and ian mckellan played their respective roles to perfection however it was hugh jackman who stole the show with his accurate portrayal of wolverinethis movie is destined to be an alltime scifi success parts 2  3 cant be too far away,fantasy
you know there are a great many things that could easily have wrecked this movie completely  marvel comics adaptations have a pretty poor track record of coming across in liveaction to either tv or the movies especially when compared against their competition from dc  witness the punisher the trial of the incredible hulk captain america doctor strange and a good handful more  balance these with the successes of the old 70s spider man series cheesy but not a bad effort at all for its time the majority of the incredible hulk series and the recent blade and you can imagine how terrified i was that simply wasnt going to cut iti mean bring in the biggest overall franchise marvel has had in the last 20 years throw in that guy from star trek that guy from apt pupil and several supermodels and everything points to an expensive disaster that would kill the credibility of what used to be a really good comic book granted im talking 1520 years ago but i am after all at least that old and it was after all really that good for a whilei was worried to say the leastbut then i noticed who was directing  bryan singer most assuredly did not screw up with the usual suspects  not a bad pedigree that  also one of the aforementioned supermodels famke janssen proved she can actually act a while back when she bloody well held her own against that very same guy from star trek  in star trek no less  she also added a great deal to goldeneye and im not just talking about visuals eitheronotopponotoppsorry  where was i  oh yes  then theres this whole hugh jackman guy never heard of him and he gets to play what is potentially the pivotal role in the contracted trilogy  granted i was pulling for robin williams or gary sinise but that just goes to show what an idiot i can be when i put my mind to it  so wolverine was a big question marki went to see it the friday night it opened  you know what it does not suck  not only does it not suck but its actually pretty goodremember im from minnesota  up here winning the lottery is considered pretty good tooyou know what  it was such a solid pretty good that i went back on saturday and paid to see it again this time with my friends they came out saying the same thing  you know what  that did not suck  in fact it was pretty goodthis of course led to the many details underlying the concept of pretty goodness including hugh jackmans absolute nailing of his part the rest of the cast doing their jobs and then some without trying to take over and most of all bryan singer showing that rarest of qualities in a hollywood director restraint  not one shot stood out as being biggerbadderbloodier than it needed to be and that is saying something these daysbottom line  go see it  comic book movies are very rarely this good and one like this deserves to make enough money so that we might actually see the other two for which the cast has been contractedif were lucky well get bryan singer back tooimdb rating  9,fantasy
i was a little nervous when i heard they were making an movie i was afraid hollywood was gonna butcher it  but after seeing the film i am totally pleased with it  all the actors did a great job with their characters the plot was good and it was pretty intelligent for a popcorn flick  add that to great special effects and cool action scenes plus the fact that the spirit of the comic book and the characters is intact and you have one great film,fantasy
the was a solid outing of entertainment  not too action oriented good plot stayed away from trying to be the comic bookpatrick stewart was a believable professor x  wolverine stole the show and rogue was a good surprisesabertooth was a bore toad wasnt too good either but besides that the charactersactors did a nice jobthere is plenty of story to tell so there should be a couple sequels hopefully they can get stewart back and explore wolverine some moregood job not perfect or great but a good way to spend a sunday afternoon,fantasy
this was the best movie adaption of a comic book i have seen since the original batman i was disappointed with the limited role a star like halle berry played but i can forgive them if they make up for it in the upcoming sequels in addition i owe an apology to whoever did the casting i cursed them night and day when i heard hugh jackman won the part i was wrong in fact he became wolverine right down to the cigar this movie is a must see for anyone who loved the comic,fantasy
i had a lot of hope leading up to this movie fox had a 30 minute special on tv to hype the movie and initially i thought was going to be like street fighter and be really cheezy but then seeing some of the clips i became really impressed one review said its better then the matrix which really shot up my expectations with such high expectations i was a bit let down the special effects were great i liked the premise of the story and the story line but the pace was too casual and the  movie lacked intensity storm was pretty useless cyclops was too young and didnt really say anything when hes supposed to be next in command after xavier they seemed to want to touch upon wolverines past and then skipped that part over though i was listening to howard stern this morning and they had the executive producer on he was saying theyre in talks of  working on a sequel,fantasy
when i came to see this film on the 12th of july this year 2000 i had my doubts  could singer pull of the greatest comic book movie of all time well yes  for the true fanboys the film might seem drawn out exploring the relationships between the characters but for everyone else what a film the action is mind blowing and wolverine really carries the film the casting is great and the plot stupendous  and stan the man makes a cameoxcellent,fantasy
i went in expecting a bad movie i was surprised it was actually good not great but it had this feeling of not wanting to be great or at least not trying to be great just fun and tightly done which it was the movie is really focused on wolverine which is good i guess they recognized that wolverine is most peoples favorite rogue would be the second banana i guess she doesnt get to do much but she is the key everyone is aftersome very welldone super hero fight scenes the strong point of the movie they are really handled well some good special effects although they dont make a movie they are used well herethe story trucks along at a brisk pace a little too brisk in some points but you are never left too long to think about how silly it all ispatrick stewart and ian mckellen are great together hugh jackman carries the movieits greatest fault is it feels like it has been overedited it is very streamlined and it leaves with the feeling that they could have taken another half an hour and it would of been great,fantasy
for comics fans this is one of the best adaptations of a comic book yet equal with the first batman movie for people who are not comics fans the story is very clear so that they will not be in the dark  the special effects are outstanding  a very enjoyable film,fantasy
obviously i liked ehem loved i came in expecting a movie with effects but not believable good characters but not feeling excitement but not thrill it was believable i felt for the characters i was so thrilled i had to control myself from shaking and freaking the person sitting next to me others have said that the movie was too serious i think that most movies are not serious enough with too many jokes but that this movie was just right wolverine made a few punches to keep us slightly relaxed while still on the edge of our seatsokay so the movie was obviously slamming conservative christians but hey i am one and i can live with that mutants are different and so are therefore bad homosexualsetc are different and are therefore bad yes we christians do enjoy slamming and judging those who are different and this movie i think was in a way saying that christians are just like the humans in this story but lets not think too hard enjoy it was clean i have not enjoyed a movie so much since the matrixas a christian i loved it and i dont really care if there is a double meaning in this film but i am a teen and i am a generation xer this movie is awesome fun thrilling see it,fantasy
when i went to see the movie earlier today i was expecting something good something like the original batman a dark comic book movie that had a good story and some good action scenes well this movie doesnt deliver them this movie is basically introducing the characters that all the fans already know and the film makers are also telling us about there special powers by the time we get to know them the movie is half way done this movie is like the phantom menace it introduces the characters and its set them up for the next sequels the only problem is that the phantom menace sets the characters up for the story we all know while is setting them all for the sequels not only that the phantom menace had some very good action sequences like the pod race and the final battle while has some action sequences there not every good the battle between wolverine and sabertooth something all the fans want is every short and aint that good a few punches and then wolverine defeats sabertooth with two punches also the special effects were pretty lame they werent that good also what is it with the costumes does every super villain has to have some sort of cape to say that there some special force with super powers there were many things that were done wrong with the movie that could have been done better and those things could have made the movie better one thing  that i didnt like was wolverines claws they look like plastic  the claws dont look any dangerous they just look like some toys the movie could have been better and so could the action thats the weakest points of the movie for a movie like this you need a good story and very good action sequences to support it this movie has a good story but the action sequences arent that good nor are the special effects this could have been a good or maybe a great action movie but it wasnt,fantasy
this movie is great  the characters are well developed the storyline is coherent and the special effects are well special  i am a comic collector and am fairly well versed in lore  this movie respects the comic readers but even if youve never heard of the youll love this film  the actors portray their characters flawlessly especially logan  even if youre not into fantasy scifi or comic books youll enjoy this,fantasy
i wasnt a huge fan as a kid but it was one of the better comic books i was all set for for a sloppy failure but i was pleasantly suprised everyone seems younger than i remember guess it took them to long to make it the story was fairly well told without going into boring details for those who came in clueless i think another half an hour for some extra character development would have been worth sitting through all in all well worth two hours and the price ill see it again,fantasy
this was the summer movie i was most anticipating  the trailers assured me that it would be great  i watched the behind the scenes special on the fox network several times to hold me over until july 14  i was very excited in the theater as the opening credits rolled  lived up to my own personal hype  it surpassed comic book films such as blade men in black and the batman sequels  the characters were realistic in terms of speech and emotions  their powers looked great on the big screen  the plot reminded me of that of an comic  but that was a good thing  all of the characters were portrayed as i thought of them  the acting was very well done  wolverine hugh jackman was the most interesting character he had the best lines  through the entire movie i was convinced that i was actually watching the fight evil rather than people acting  ray park did a particularly good job as the amphibious toad a member of magnetos brotherhood  his agility was amazing to watch  great special effects enhanced his top notch performance  my only complaint is storms stupid lines  im surprised they werent replaced with something at least a little better  the movie focuses mainly on wolverine rogue magneto and professor x  the other characters are given a sufficient amount of screen time  i dont want to get too much into the plot because it gradually unfolds throughout the movie  the action was on the same level as last years the matrix and the phantom menace  there are a lot of violent situations but there isnt much blood or gore  this was done for the pg13 rating  was an excellent movie that was great the first time around i cant wait until i see it again  even if youre not an fan i think you will enjoy it if you like fast paced action and fine acting,fantasy
do not miss this movie  fan or not you will love it  the characters are interesting their interaction is compelling the action is nonstop and the special effects are extraordinary  this movie is top rate  at only 96 minutes nobody will be bored  bring on the sequel,fantasy
i went to see this movie expecting it to be hokey full of cursing and with a lot of sexual innuendo  well i was disappointed in that respect  this movie is not entirely too predictable  it doesnt have a lot of cursing and there was almost no innuendo  that may not be too important to some people but it was for me  i found myself cheering for my present favourite character wolverine and i was even sort of cheering for the bad guys  i didnt want them to win but i didnt want them to be destroyed either all of the characters are what you would expect and a little bit more  this was a fabulous movie and since i have seen some of the cartoons i cant wait for the sequel to this film when they will hopefully bring in my other favourite gambit  anyone who likes clean action great humour and the will love this movie  im going to go see it again,fantasy
the flat best adaptation of a comic to the big screen ever while i expected great action and good fights i was very pleased to see they kept the big issues mutants as metaphors for any oppressed minority laws driven by fear rather than justice etc and the character conflicts not everybody gets along from the comics if you want a summer movie with great action and a plot then see,fantasy
comic book movies in hollywood generally mean nice guys with superpowers versus evil guys with superpowers lots of special effects and overdone settings and some very onedimensional characters well changes all that at last hollywood has dared to deliver a comic book film with depth and some real issues to discuss and  we actually have a villain with layers and complexity who could be any one of us who has been persecuted and decided to strike backthe story tells of children born with genetic mutations and how they learn to cope with their abilities once they grow up and society turns against them some decide to use their powers for beneficial means others decide to live alone eking out an existence and raising a finger to those who scorn them and some decide to hit back against prejudice and persecution the conflict is between the mutants themselves  in particular professor xavier patrick stewart a telepath who has established a school for mutant children  he calls them gifted and magneto ian mckellen a nazi victim who wages war against antimutant sentiment both are fighting for the same cause  acceptance of mutations  but both take different paths and end up on opposite sidesinto this conflict is drawn logan hugh jackman an angry savage loner with some interesting physical mutations and a past he can only remember in nightmares he joins up with rogue anna paquin a teenage runaway who finds her touch drains the life from her boyfriends they become crucial pawns in the chess battle between xaviers and magnetos opposing teams of mutantswhat i like about the film is that it has faith in its universe and stands up for the premise and the characters it portrays  there are no gimmicky features to distract you from the story colours are muted and realistic  no garish costumes or noirish black shadows and gothic settings the film focuses on its characters and lets them stand on their own no hokey villains magneto is just a man with a different agenda and his solution to antimutant sentiment actually makes you think a bit remember the romans and the christiansoverall this is a really good film that can match it with the best of 2000 releases as a comic book film its different and bryan singer director has created something new which raises the bar for others to follow the casting is excellent as are the performances the standouts being mckellen and jackman whose loganwolverine is complex and brilliantly portrayedthe script is very good and the dialogue is superb there are some very funny lines the characters get laughs from the lines not from their costumes or their overthetop mannerisms the effects are excellent but the film does not rely on them just uses them when the story demands it the mutants powers really blow you away thoughits well paced although a little short but a good introduction to the xuniverse for those who dont know it if youve never heard of you will still enjoy and follow the films storyline if youre a long xfan or comic fan well this is the movie youve been waiting for hats off to everybody involvedthe only disappointment is the score its pretty averageoverall 8 out of 10,fantasy
i read one review that suggested the makers of lighten up with the next in the series if a sequel is in the future  it is clear to me having seen that this person and those critics like him have obviously seen a different movie  is full of exciting action wonderful characters and a surprising amount of humor  the exchanges between cyclops and wolverine are worth the price of admission  im not sure how one gets to become a movie critic but i imagine it entails sticking ones head way up ones behind  if i sound a somewhat bitter it is because critics tend to crush the chances of great comic book movies with meanspirited reviews while praising pieces of crap like the latter parts of the superman series and the batman series respectively  isnt that something  in my opinion there have only been two really good comic book filmsblade and all the others tend to disappoint when it should be so easy to please with 150 million dollar budgets  im curious what mr maltin will have to say about this one,fantasy
when i first saw the preview for this movie i said to my friends we have to go see this the day it comes out not to sound like a total geek but i even requested the day off work before we entered the theater we thoughtoh nowhat if this turns out to be like godzillagood preview but bad film after exiting the theater all i have to say isthat was an excellent film i was not at all disappointed i hope there will be a sequel and if there is i cant wait for it i advise you to go see it even if you arent a huge fan great plot great cast great special effects all around good movie well there are my two cents about it,fantasy
 finally raises the quality of movies based on comic books  i enjoyed this movie thoroughly  the characters are great especially wolverine hugh jackman does a wonderful job capturing wolverines character  this movie works because it takes not only the story but the audience very seriously this is not a kiddie flick with fart jokes abound see john leguizamos violator in spawn  since i never read the original series i can also say that anyone who watches this movie will enjoy it as much as i did and perhaps more,fantasy
when i saw the many previews of being a follower of the comics i was somewhat disappointed they didnt even keep the costumes which to me was a somewhat big part of the it was what separated each of themaside from the powers duh in the movie apparently they wore all black taking away that uniqueness each had aside from their powers they didnt have angel or beast even characters there since the beginning they had rogue but not gambitfor me you should have had both not just one moreover about rogue she didnt have that white hair you see in the comicsand even the cartoon and she wore a cloak not a leather jacket which she wore in the comics and cartoons mystique was naked the whole timenot that bad a thing whereas she should have a costume sabretooth looked nothing like himself and who the hell was toadso upon arriving at the theater i was expecting not much at all however i sure was wrong about the movie the movie still captured many aspects of the comic even though it missed out on others the conflict between wolverine and cyclops was great charles was as hopeful as ever with magneto forever opposing him and wolverine still had the thing for jean even more rogue does happen to get her unique blotch of white hair in the endif you want to know how watch the movie there will be no spoilers here the action was pretty cool i was seeing some of my favorite super heroes come to life watching wolverine break out those awesome adamantium claws of his was so damn cool as was seeing storm hit sabretooth with a bolt of lightning and cyclops hitting them with his optic blasts the toad wasnt bad either but sabretooth still needed some work the plot was something really pulled out a comic book which i wanted  liked and the actors played their roles well enough for me even if youre not a fan give a try bub its not as bad as you may think,fantasy
i just watched the film today as it is the canadian opening  from the start of the film you can tell the excellent graphic designs that went into it from the plane and mansion to magnetos lair and everything inbetween was amazingly done  you would think there would only be action in a movie like this but there also was a lot of humour  the depiction of northern alberta in this film was quite amusing because i am from edmonton alberta which is central albertathe actor that played wolverine was fantastic  he actually looks like the comic book wolverine and he was everything i pictured wolverine to look act and sound like in real lifethis movie was awesome and i gave it a 1010 hope theres a sequel,fantasy
it rocked  no even more than that  it really rocked  i was so happy it was a fantastic film with no gaping plot problems and wonderful acting especially in wolverine prof x and magneto  great action sequences too  they made the toad into a worthwhile villain  it had superb design sense on sets and costumes not going overboard like the batman films while still retaining the essence of the original  that is one of its greatest strengths a balance between fantastic powers and realistic characters never being too corny or too melodramatic  my highest recommendation for summer family fun,fantasy
let the franchise beginthis new entry in the comic book character fight for box office glory and the geeks hearts delivers  but as good as this film is it makes one wonder if the sequel can a live up to the first film or b be even better than the original  sure some were left out but thats the reason to make a sequel  and while were on that subject why do we call it a sequel the james bond films have never been sequels the star wars films are certainly not sequels  the story was dead on for origins  wolvies powers and abilities rogues fear of her powers all beautifully explored  anna paquin really delivers in her performance here and if the academy didnt have their noses in the air about these kinds of films she should be considered for another oscar hugh jackman is now a movie star in this country  halle berry was pretty good as the weather controller  james mardsen could have been a little taller but he made a good revisionist cyclopsthe audience leaves wanting a little more  that is a great thing at the start of a franchise  heres hoping the mutation sorry continues well into this and hopefully the next decade,fantasy
i loved the movie it is the first movie based on a comic book since the original batman to stand on its own without the comic book history hugh jackman is almost undiscernable from great character actor gary sinise wich is a good thin halle barry has never been better in a movie without many lines she used great facial expressions to portray storm anna paquin has also stepped it up to play a great role in this film,fantasy
i went to the premier in dc with some friends last night and it was a blast once the movie starts dont leave your seat  i must point out that patrick stuart is the bomb and was the glue that held this film together a lot of imagination was put into his one  the ending leaves room for almost anything to be possible for the future,fantasy
yes ill admit it i read comic books and yes ive read the comic books in fact i started reading when i was about thirteen and got quickly hookedfor those of you who dont know as if the media juggernaut for this movie hasnt run you over yet the are mutants theyre born with genetic abnormalities which give them super powers these powers usually manifest around puberty mutants in general are feared and hated by the rest of humanityis it any wonder teenagers eat this stuff upwell we all grow up i still read from time to time but not with the fanatical devotion of my teenage years at one point i was reading xfactor excalibur xforce and wolverine much to the detriment of my savings account now maybe im just being an old fart but i swear the comics had better quality when i was younger the thing that always drew me to the book well aside from the adolescent male power fantasies was that unlike many superteam funnybooks was character driven most of the heroes had major flaws and the villains werent really evil they just saw the world with a different set of ethics best of all their superpowers were often as much a curse as a blessingrecently the writer who brought comicsdom its best stories and characters such as wolverine storm and rogue has come back to the titlewhich is good because recently has been all about a bunch of superpowered spandexclad yahoos who go out and beat up on the bad guysnow i was afraid that might be like that fortunately its notokay much as director bryan singer the usual suspects has denied it is an action movie but its most decidedly not a childrens film the pg13 is there for a reasondont bring your eight year old assuming its just a comic book movie youll scare him he also wont be able to follow itill admit i was rooting for this film i wanted it to be good well it met my expectations and exceeded themfirst point you dont have to read a single comic book to enjoy this film it actually opens in poland 1944 in order to explain the motivations of its villain that from the getgo let me know that theyd done this movie right any movie which uses its opening sequence to humanize the bad guy especially a summer specialeffects blockbuster gets major props in my book next we see the harrowing trauma one young girl goes through when her powers manifest in fact we dont really see an action sequence until about 20 minutes in when were introduced to wolverine hugh jackmanyoure gonna be seeing more of this hugh jackman guy mark my words in fact unlike most comicbook adaptations the producers of went out and found themselves actors who could actually act one big fanboy complaint has been the casting of anna paquin as rogue now in the comicbooks rogue is a incredibly wellendowed babe anna paquin well shes cute and all but no one would call her the comicbook model of babeitude well lemme tell yarogue was not an easy role a lesser actress would have come off as a whiny annoying selfpitying asskind of like lacey chabert in well in anything fanboys everywhere should thank their lucky stars that the producers didnt listen to themsecond point if youve read the comic books youll especially like the metallic clang when wolverine hits a guy youll also like the cameos such as shadowcat iceman jubilee and even pyro but especially youll like that bryan singer and writers tom desanto apt pupil and david hayter do justice to the characters theyre also smart enough to keep the story focused on the more interesting characters wolverine and rogue while giving the more twodimensional characters cyclops and jean grey a backseatanyway if you like action movies run right out and see this sucker if youre not a big action movie fan but you find yourself sucked into seeing them by family or friends then you could do a whole lot worse thanlike any jerry bruckheimer movie for example gets 487632 out of 5 woobs just about perfect for its genre,fantasy
i must admit i was unsure whether or not id enjoy the movie when i first heard about it  i went into the advance screening of expecting the worst  im happy to say i wasnt disappointed  in fact i was pretty pleased along with the rest of the audience  singers film is not without faults but it is a highly enjoyable interpretation of one of the biggest comic properties around the film opens in the 1940s as we see a young magneto being separated from his parents in the middle of a nazi concentration camp  we quickly see the awesome power this young man possesses  jump to the not too distant future where we meet a confused girl named rogue who learns of her power in a frightening way  the film doesnt waste too much time on story but rather jumps forward with numerous character introductions  we learn that mutants are the subject of fear within the american public  one man in particular senator kelley has determined that mutants must not be tolerated due to their unpredictable nature  meanwhile rogue leaves home only to find another mutant in the form of the rough and rugged wolverine  they are attacked in the snow filled woods of canada by another vicious mutant named sabretooth  just when things start to look really bad two more mutants show up to save the day  jump to the xavier school where wolverine and rogue find safety among others like them  we learn that professor x played casually by patrick stewart has assembled a bevy of mutant youngsters in an attempt to teach them and help them understand their powers  we also find out that magneto all grown up and immensely powerful has devised a lethal plan to get back at his human persecutors  the first thirty to forty minutes of the film simply introduce and explain all of the key characters and plot points to us  we then become aware that magnetos plan is contingent on acquiring the power of one of our heroes  then the major action starts and pretty much doesnt stop for the rest of the film the movie is paced fairly well  we never really get much of a chance to be bored and there are plenty of nice effects to gaze at  singer tries to spend a fair amount of time on each character but its obvious he wants to focus on wolverine  hugh jackman does a fantastic job of portraying the popular hero but i cant help feeling that some of the other characters get neglected  cyclops who has always been one of my favorite characters doesnt really have much to do here  oh sure he stands around and looks tough but i wanted to see more depth from him  he and storm played quietly by halle berry are for the most part just set dressing  i really got the sense that we were missing some development scenes here and there i hate to say this but i really got the feeling that wolverine was doing too much  during the films finale our rugged hero fights three battles one after the other  why couldnt cyclops jump in there  perhaps if the franchise continues the sequels will spend more time with the other heroes all in all the film is pretty well done  we get most of what we want which is fastpaced action and lots of groovy effects  the film is not without surprises either  look for cameos by other or shall i say soon to be  judging by the audience reaction this film is really going to do well  in my opinion the best thing about the film is the fact that it will open some doors in hollywood for others like it  singer has provided a nice template to work from lets just see which artist uses it next,fantasy
being a fan of the comic growing up i wasnt too sure that i wanted to see it took a jump and i would have to say i was impressed the movie should appeal even to those who arent familiar with the and the vast world behind the comic action with enough left for a few sequels grin some die hard fans may be disappointed but going in with an open mind it was worthy in my humble opinion great special effects and i believe a great portrayal of my all time favorite wolverine,fantasy
one thing that impressed me about this movie is that it explained the history of the without slowing down the movie visually its wonderful with some tremendous special effects from the get go and theres some great dialogue too especially wolverines comment to cyclops when asked to prove he was wolverine but the storyline was a bit lacking in intrigue and that kind of ruined the experience for me,fantasy
i have never read the comic books i found the movie to be very violent dark and heavy movie is not suitable for children and there were many children in the audiencemost left quietly and seemed dazed parents should not bring young ones to this filmshould be at least 13 years of age i liked the storyline but felt special effects overwhelmed it sound was phenomenal thanks to regal theaters excellent setup,fantasy
finally someone has done a superhero movie right none of that cheesy batman stuffhugh jackmans potrayal of wolverine was dead on especially his interactions with cyclopsian mckellan was as strong as a rock as magneto just seeing him use his powers was incredible and you get to know about his stancethe whole cast did a terrific job rebbeca stamos as mystique came off without a hitch sexy and dangeroushalle berry as storm wow i cant wait to see it againhopefully will see 2with quicksilver and scarlet witch magnetos kids,fantasy
i have just spent the last one hundred minutes in total bliss i have just come out from watching the movie and it has at last proven to me that to make a good comic book film takes a major company to employ a very good director to direct exceptional actors who take their profession serious enough to make it feel like youve known their world all of your lifeas youve probably guessed i am a big fan and have been for the last twentyfive years i have watched the development of characters within the books watched members die and seen new members born seen brother fights their own brother and even their own father i have felt their pain and joy and as a family they have become part of my lifewhen i first heard that they where about to make this movie the first thought that came to mind was the original series of spiderman films then i remembered the last comic book hero that i had seen in films of which i enjoyed watching which was batman things just had to get better today was the day that things would change for better or for worse today was the day i got to see people that i have known most of my life in the flesh dying with anticipation i arrived at the cinema took my seat then waited there was not much wrong with the film apart from the obvious differences in age with some of the major and minor characters and the obvious lack of stronger personalities it was just great to see people that you could feel for feelings either of warmth or disdain i am not going to mention scenes from the film as i urge all to see for themselves all i can say is thank you bryan singer for making the world of the real for the rest of the world  roll on 2,fantasy
yes its true delivers where even superman ii and batman stumbled it captures the spirit of its subject and the fun of comics in general credit jackman who has presence to burn and singer who makes almost every fight fun to watch and allows us to feel awe at the characters powers  some roles are a bit smaller than one would like but thats why there are sequels also notable are paquin whose acting saves the movies heart as a younger and less vavoom rogue than in the books  and mckellan with all of magnetos smoothness and ruthlessness  berry however seems bored but looks great this works not just as a comics movie but as a movie and that is why it succeeds where others have failed instead of stringing together set pieces it tells a story a good one well told,fantasy
probably the most anticipated movie of the year the have finally arrived a lot of fans have been eagerly awaiting this film while having to barge through all the gossip and fortelling that stemmed from the internet well the movie actually turned out fairly well it revolves a lot around wolverine played brilliantly by hugh jackman lets just be glad that dougray scott had to bow out to finish mi2 and was unable to bring his level of sucktitude to this film look out for jackman he could become a major star if he picks the right roles surprisingly patrick stewarts role is rather small as well as most of the other characters like toad mystique and thankfully storm halley berry just looks and sounds awful in this look for a funny little moment when ray park gives a little darth maul twist to toad the dialogue had its stupid moments as most blockbusters do but the banter between wolvie and cyclops is often hilarious and well written overall go see it if you like action flicks the special effects are pretty good and its worth it just to see wolvies claws and of course the hair bryan singer did an excellent job translating the comic to film and if there is a sequel as the ending suggests of course lets hope he helms it afterall who wants to see joel,fantasy
when it comes to comic book movies there are more disappointments then not but is not one  this movie could not be any better  bryan singer proves to the world that he can make a fun movie but still keep his noir edgea problem with every comic book movie is too many characters too many back stories and not enough time  but in the case the film was very balanced the only real back story is magneto and wolverine the other characters are just thrown into the mix right along with the audiencealong with the first batman movie is a 10 out of 10 the top of the game it truly does its job it appeals to the mass audience along with the die hard fans,fantasy
even if you dont read the comic go see this movie bryan singer has crafted a movie about people not characters the acting is heartfelt and reverent the story is engaging and there is plenty to whet the appetite for whats to comea must see this could be the film that redeems comics after the batman and robin fiasco,fantasy
im writing for the people who are on the ropes  i saw the film at a prerelease screening this week and my biggest criticism is that i couldnt stay in my seat for the next showing had i stayed i would have been stuck with scary movie thats screenings for youthis film will break every box office record,fantasy
i cannot remember much about reading comics but i remember the characters  this movie has totally stimulated my interest in the serieshaving being a bit apprehensive about seeing comic movies after the string of batman shockers turning into a police academy franchise of the 90s but i did see it  what a movie the length was just right but was curious about other characters beginnings it played like a comic book  also giving me an appetite for a sequel performances  hughy jackman makes me proud to be oz and anzac compatriot anna paquin holds her own beautifully  all others put in decent performances love toadray parks  star wars jokebest i have seen this year,fantasy
why bother going to see the  it comes out tomorrow but it seems that i have seen most of the film already in the previews which have appeared in theatres on television and on the web  i must have watched a quarter of it by nowthe premise finds its way into a mccarthyesque era where superevolved human mutants stand trial for the mere fact that they are different from the rest of mankind  in a world where anything can happen quite often happenstance it seems takes the shape of human evolution  oddly enough it occurs beyond the realm of darwinian theory for each mutation here is different from the next  no new species appears to come into being but rather a hodgepodge of supermen each unique unto themselvesthere is cyclops whose vision is like laser blasts  there is storm who can influence the weather and cause hitandrun car accidents  wolverine has great physical prowess and a high threshold for painful critical reviews  rogue absorbs the emotions and memories of other individuals and wild geese struggling to keep her own thoughts and emotions in the forefront of her ultralight mind    jean grey has telekinetic abilities as troubled as those she had aboard the enterprise when she mentally bonded with captain makeitso  professor charles xavier nee captain makeitso possesses telepathy often speaking into others minds as he was wont to do with i am loqutus of borg resistance is futile  magneto god or monster holds the power of magnetism  sabertooth an orthodontists dream can heal himself so quickly he is virtually invulnerable immortal and may thus survive into any sequels  mystique who has chameleonlike abilities is able to morph herself into anyone alive including rebecca romijnstamos finally toad has superhuman lower body strength and may well be the envy of every adult male film star but thats a tail to be wagged not tolledthe basic plot of the appears to be rather formula  boy meets girl boy faces nsc hearings  boy battles mutants  boy saves world and wins respect of humanity  great special effects   wonderful costumes and in the case of rebecca romijnstamos wonderful paint  predictably bombastic script  too bad there probably will not be any great scenes about how being unique will affect each mutants ability to live among the less fortunate and less imperilled masses of homo audiensusin any event i wish the producers could have waited with all of their promotion to allow me to be either pleasantly or unpleasantly surprised i know how it ends before it starts  the only question remains is is it worth watching twice,fantasy
as the film opens up to a very dark and morbid scene an encapsulating atmosphere surrounds the audience into a stunned silence x men begins continues and ends with an aphrodisiac that keeps you hooked for a good two hours i walked into the cinema with extremely high expectations being a fan and was surprised that a film i have waited for since its filming status cleanly and easily satisfied me leaving me open mouthed in awe with australian hugh jackman and new zealand academy award winner anna paquin i was glad to watch the film not only for the sharp special effects and familiar abilities but also for the deeper and darker involvement in want and need for acceptance anna paquinrouge and the pain and agony of a lost past hugh jackmanwolverine i especially liked how in first knowing of who the actors were to be portraying and their appearance compared to that of their comic counter parts the disappointment and uncertainty completely vanished as the actors all of them slid into the age old characters and played the parts with a rubato that was almost flawless it is easy to go on and on about a film such as this only i wanted not to mention the flaws i myself had picked up leaving this only my opinion on how the films success by far exceeds the conventional successful action film and falls much further beyond that a pleasure to watch and much more then a movie referring to the typical hollywood films of course,fantasy
i saw one of the first ads for about four months ago and said to myself this is the movie ive been waiting for since i was nine years old  as i entered the theater for the screening i have connections in management at the local multiplex and took my seat i prepared for a childhood dream smiling but worried deep down that this would ruin my fanciesguess what  i was absolutely blown away the first scene alone was enough to satisfy my liveaction xguys craving the craving id felt since childhood  this movie was an almost perfect adaptation of the essence of the comic with just enough artistic license taken to make the movie both remotely believeable and utterly entertaining  the production design was nearly flawless taking what would translate horribly to the big screen the garish yellow and blue spandex wolverine wears in the comics was translated into black leather with gold accents for instance and turning it into something you want to seei wasnt expecting citizen kane or the empire strikes back from this movie but i got what i came to see the whomping on magneto and his lackeys and getting a whompin right back wolverine in a berserker rage and mystique being well mystique  i cannot stress enough how thoroughly enjoyable this movie was albeit lacking in the heavy plot department though the race relations tone was handled very well   but thats not what one wants from the  one wants wolverine kicking the living crud outta sabertooth or the professor tooling about in his wheelchair  and thats what we got fortunately  and i couldnt have asked for more,fantasy
any kind of an adaptation bears a heavy risk of missing the balance of compromise between tradition of its source material and dramatic license comic book adaptations seem even more prone to this balance then most media works because it finds this balance quite handilythe are products of a representation of racism and inequality they were created in a time when these factors were predominant in society the film actually chooses to focus on this as the story instead of setting up a reason for everyone to fight this makes the characters not only more believable but when the inevitable fight scenes do occur you actually want to root for the good guys because you actually care about themany person who writes this movie off as another comic book adaptation may have based on precedent some reason to do so but itd be a shame to deny yourself a glimpse at what it looks like when its done just right,fantasy
i am not a comic freak  i rarely even watched the cartoon  but this movie rocked my world it never bored me never got overly cheesy  was obviously sequel material but that doesnt even bother me  was too delicious to bother me the acting was outstanding the character development just satisfying enough  i want more and they know it,fantasy
i just got back from a sneak preview midnight screening of this movie and i just had to comment on this  this was hands down the best comic made into a movie ever  i have been a fan of the comics for years starting reading comics at a very young age and has always been one of my favorites now as a hardcore fan i feel that we tend to be the most critical to a movie and i feel they did a spectacular job making it  the special effects are great there is action there is drama  even some humor and there is actually a cool story  i thought some things could have been explained a little better for people who werent familiar with the comics but it was still good and had plenty of injokes that the comic book fans would get i feel that everyone looking for a good superhero movie or a good actiondrama should go out and see this now,fantasy
much like the mutants that brings to the screen this movie is of a different breed instead of falling into the mold of the prototypical summer blockbuster movie has raised the bar for action films in general and especially for comic book adaptations what sets it apart is that it exceeds certain expectations for a movie released between may and august amazingly has been blessed with several mutations which give it an edge over typical summer fare a welldeveloped story abnormal amounts of character depth and the ability to give its characters good dialogue also the performances are good the scenes between wolverine  rogue and xavier  magneto are especially impressive like most anything released these days the special effects are above par and the cinematography is fine plus bryan singer has shown that he has what it takes to direct an action filmdespite its relatively modest budget the makers of have done something that the people behind movies like the perfect storm mi2 and gone in sixty seconds did not do make a movie for an intelligent audience and give them what they deserve  an intelligent action movie is not just another sensory overload of pretty special effects and loud noises and after watching this movie audiences will be wondering why theyve put up with the same old song and dance every summer,fantasy
ok so im a big fan of the comic book and have been reading it for over 20 years  i was skeptical of this film ive been criticizing its casting from the beginning except for patrick stewart as professor xavier  thats perfect casting  so i watched with trepidation and was pleasantly surprised  it works  and most of the cast is just right  the story mucks about with some of the mythology missing some major like colossus nightcrawler angel and the beast and iceman is just a kid in the film but so what  the action scenes work the story is true to the comic and both hugh jackman and anna paquin are absolutely excellent and theyre the main stars so you know youre doing well when your two leads are good most of the supporting cast is fine except for halle berry as storm weak and james marsden as cyclops bland  plus he looks way too young to be famke janssens love interest  but even rather scrawny ian mckellen makes a good magneto  so its pretty good not great but pretty good and this summer which has been very very bad for movies what more can you ask for,fantasy
 would not be half as good a movie as it is without hugh jackman as wolverine he portrays the character with brute anger at times along with a little sensitivity as well also patrick stewart was born to play professor x noone in the world is perfectly suited for the rolei wished the movie wouldnt end thats how enthralling the experience was for me,fantasy
stingray back from the movies and let me tell you that i still have the biggest smile on my face this movie is better than i expected as i sat there and watched the opening scenes i just knew this movie would be goodand it was the introduction of wolverine go the aussies gave me chills he kicks some major ass great actors  great story and great effects the best thing about the movie was that you actually feel for these characters i loved the special effects but i was more interested in the people not the effects and this movie delivers on all accounts i have been a comic fan for most of my 28 years and i love this movie i will be seeing this a lot more times in the near future my dad saw it with me and he loved it and for all those who think that if you dont know you wont enjoy ityour wrong the movie explains enough to keep all satisfied 2 here we come ,fantasy
the movie was by far the best movie i have seen this year and i hardly followed the comic book at allwho really cares if it didnt have character development because all people want to see is some actiontheres plenty of it in this movieand what the characters look like compared to the comic book and they actually all look better in the moviethe special effects in this movie are amazing and one of my favourite characters would of had to of been the shape shifter mystique because the way she morphed from one person to the other reminded me of the terminator or something along those linesone thing i didnt like though was the pointless plot of the villain magnetoi didnt quite get what he was trying to do and it didnt really go anywhere but again i say who cares because the whole movie in general kicked butt and is by far the best comic adaption everand being australian i think wolverine was the best character and the australian actor hugh jackman who played wolverine pulled it off quite nicely and if u didnt like his performancewell then i think u are expecting a bit too much because he did an excellent jobi cant wait for the 2,fantasy
i havent read in 15 years and i loved it hugh jackman is wolverine he is tough nasty has a heart and even gets a bub in xavier magneto storm cyclops jean rogue theyre all there its like coming home and meeting old friends sure it isnt the comic but you cant do the comic straight up but the essence the interaction the family that is are all there im not saying its perfect but compared to mi2 its heaven marsden is great as cyclops despite what some say cyke was always stiff jawed goody two shoes prof xs boy where wolverine would talk back as you might have gathered i liked it a lot im not sure how well any non xinitiate will take it it is a good story for a comic but being purely selfish i want the dvd tomorrow and the sequel the day after i guess ill just have to live with seeing it again and again,fantasy
ive been a follower of the series for a long time and i was stoked to see a film was being released and directed by bryan singer to boot this is the first movie adapted from a comiccartoon series that i can think of that actually works and sticks to the original guidelines of the series all of the characters are spot on especially hugh jackman as wolverine who plays the constantly ped off part exceptionally well a great cast with strong performances brilliant effects that support the film not the other way around for once and a fairly decent storyline make for an entertaining film for fans and newcomers dont miss this it blows mi2 out of the water,fantasy
i have been waiting for the film to be made for quite some time finally the film has dawned upon our cinema screens and its actually quite goodthe comic was always going to be a difficult to transfer onto the film medium simply because there is so many heroes and villains this film cleverly chooses its characters wisely and we also see a glimpse of what may be future pivotal characters in the hopeful sequels to comethe main players for the are prof x wolverine cyclops jean grey rogue and storm the villains are also very cool with the obvious choice of magneto as the main bad guy and sabretooth mystique and toad all look exceptional in this film unlike the first batman film has chosen to include more villains in its first outingthe acting and special effects are extremely good with notable performances from hugh jackman ian mckellan and patrick stewart hugh jackman managed to bring wolverine to life very convincingly singers direction adds a more realistic feel to the film and i liked the design of the costumes and the theme of the film a great introduction to this mutant world so hopefully there will be sequelsas a fan of the comic i was impressed by this film version and my only gripe is that is was too short  out of ,fantasy
excellent film that doesnt stray too far away from classic comic book origins and storylines  a great way to introduce people to the characters but doesnt insult or bore the longtime x men fan  this could be the best comic book superhero to big screen adaptation yet up there with the first batman with michael keaton  a great flick by itself and a great way to start a franchise,fantasy
i saw this twice in its opening weekend an unprecedentedfeat for me this was partially because i wanted to watchaustralian newcomer hugh jackman as wolverine in action again hes charismatic and has rugged good looksbetween jackman and russell crowe i wonder whats inthe water down under but more importantly he expertlyplays the most fascinating character even if he hadntessentially been the star i think he wouldve stolen themovie  from ian mckellen and patrick stewart no lessive associated with enough fans that i was acquainted with wolverine rogue storm xavier and magneto but im not a big comics fan and no one couldmistake me for an expert that wasnt a handicap becausethe film manages to juggle many characters and situationswithout being as confusing as one might think i do wish ithad been 15 minutes longer so we couldve seen more history on wolverine and rogue but perhaps the rumouredsequel will do that ill be there on opening night again 910,fantasy
when i first heard of the plans for a filmed version of the i was skeptical  many times in the past comics have been adapted into films  some have met with a great degree of success superman batman and some have been total disasters batman  robin steel  after seeing i can safely say that my fears were unwarrented  bryan singer crafted a superb story that condenses thirty years of backstory into a movie that moves quickly but gives you enough information on the main characters  as for the characters the cast was perfect  patrick stewart and ian mckellan are professor x and magneto  the scenes between these two powerful mutants show their common respect for each other but also illustraits the differences between them  hugh jackman is perfect as wolverine  hes got attitude he smokes and hes got a mean streak a mile wide  as in the comic there is an immediate dislike for cyclops and a small degree of attraction to jean grey  famke janssen was perfect as the telekinetic doctor and james marsden was perfectly stiff as the teams stalwart leader  halle barry was a good choice as storm and i suspect that well see more of this team hopefully it will be soon  facing off against the is magnetos team of mutants mystique a vicious shapeshifter does some neat quick changes  toad and sabretooth round out magnetos team and these guys are a formidable force for the  i think well see more of them soon  so all of the xfans can relax  our favorite mutant superhero team has made the giant leap from page to screen with outstanding results  with the overwhelming repsonse the movie has generated i hope and pray that there will be a sequel  it would be interesting to see where professor x and his gifted students lead us,fantasy
hollywood didnt screw it up  thank you  i had such a low expectation of this movie i almost wanted to throw something at the screen every time i saw the trailer  even that couldnt keep me from the theater on opening night  i was the one with my eyes closed and my hands together praying for this to be what i had dreamed for an film  i was not let downsure there are a lot of changes from the comics but it didnt stop me from enjoying the movie  the movie is centered around two future wolverine and rogue  the others are just scenery mostly  their characters will probably be viewed with more depth in sequels  hugh jackman may be to tall and skinny for wolverine but who cares  he plays the part with the right wit and attitude you would expect  anna paquin works well as rogue even though she is very young  she is the mutant that we feel sorry for throughout the movie and rightfully so  the villans are there to provide an opposing view on how mutants should handle humanitys hatred of them  magneto ian mckellan is almost understandable in his violence still i found myself rooting on the heroes at the end i couldnt be happier with this stunning adaptation  it has just the right amount of humor action and memorable characters you would expect from an film  that is what kept me glued to the seat of the theater on opening night  i was the one with a smile on my face,fantasy
as a fan of comics but by no means an expert i was pleasantly surprised to find that the movie catered fairly evenly for all members of the audience  both fans and the general public wont be disappointed  there are plenty of injokes and spot the junior to keep the fans happyfinally a director has been able to walk that very thin tight rope and create a super hero movie that doesnt compromise the history or what makes the comic popular in the first place in taking it to the big screen  it also shows that you dont have to dumb down or camp up a comic to create a memorable movie experiencethe casting was pretty well spot on as was the character setup all character were believable and well fleshed outhopefully will become the benchmark for future comic book adaptations well done to all concerned and roll on 2,fantasy
hey i ran out of space in my review so i decided to  continue itthe characters are well developedwith the exception of stormsadly and magnetos henchmen but all we really need to know isthey are bad so its acceptable with them intelligentlywritten modern heroeswolverine has more character developmentthen most summer films in the last ten yearsspeaking ofwolverine this was where the picture truly shined i didntthink it was possible to say this with a summer movie but hughjackmans performance is a tour de force anyone who says thathe didnt have a hard part to play is an idiot jackman has todo something that most accomplished actors couldntpotray acharacter that most everyone in the theater knowspotray acharacter who has a good 25 or 30 years of history to himacharacter that the fans know better then anyonewolverine is byfar the most well known of all the and by that rationalethe most important wolverine has so many mannerisms so many little characteristics that it would be impossible to list them allherewolverine is a tough character but ultimately has a heartof goldforgive the cheesejackman nails that perfectlyhealso gets the mannerisms perfectlybeing an unknown actorhelps because he becomes wolverinehe is wolverine throughand throughi consider this to be a amazing performancebecause jackman makes wolverine realhe gives the films trulybest performance also deserving praise is anna paquin as rogue who makes rogue areal person by showing the fear the young girl experiences bybeing unable to touch those around her and of course patrick stewart and ian mcklellan as professor xand magneto respectivelythey give the characters the true 3dimensional feel they deserve everyone else in the film gives commendable performances and ipraise them all but jackman deserves much praise for his deadon wolverine performance however i need to give a lot to bryan singerhe delivers afilm that could have been an absolute cheese fest and does sowithout ever dropping into camphe makes the film real makesyou care about the characters and ultimately delivers aexcellent exhilarting aderaline and story packe,fantasy
i have been a fan for quite a long time i watched thecartoon read the comics and collected the cardsthere wasalways something great about it so that was why i approached the movie with trepridation comic book movies with the exception of the excellentbatmanthe firstnot the others and superman1 and 2 havereally sucked however showed potential with the fact that bryan singerwas directing and that powerhouse actors patrick stewart andian mckellanface itthese guys are so serious about theiracting that i know they saw something beyond the pay check werescheduled for the leading roles of magneto and professor xso as i sat down last night in a darkened theater i prayedthat would hit hardthen it startedand any worries ihad subsided now that i have seen it i can honestly say thatfew films have captured my attention for their entire runninglength more then now i know this isnt the godfather oranything but it is good i feel that this honestly had betterperformancesmore on those later better writingthe script wasnever ever cheesy directionsinger made it feel real andstory then most big budget films in a long timeafter a trulyheart breaking opening the film kicks into high gear that neverslows down for one second even though a good portion of thefilm is not action focusedas important as the action andspecial effects are to a summer film with a film likewhere the story is long running37 years young and thecharacters are truly realized heroes the most important thingtruly is the characters this is where,fantasy
this marveldesigned flick has a great storyline action and humor to offer moviegoers i originally had doubts about yet another marvel comic movie launch but this one is unstoppable all characters are wellwritten and with a futuristic action yet human drama story like this it leaves the possibility of a sequel open,fantasy
as one would expect delivers on visual spectacle there are lots of good effects things being blown up and broken and so forthwhat one wouldnt expect from an action and effectsdriven summer film is the performances two veteran actors patrick steward as professor xavier and ian mckellen as magneto provide depth to their roles as antagonists on the mutant issue newcomer to the american screen anyway hugh jackman is a sensitive and effective wolverine and anna paquin holds up her part as rogue nicelythe film also provides some depth to the issue of mutants and their place in society three sides are presented xavier magneto and sen robert kelly and the film doesnt treat it as a black and white goodvsevil situation instead we see that there is good and bad in all their positionshighly recommended im looking forward to future installments in the story and hoping that they continue to develop the characters and the depth of the story,fantasy
if i could describe in one word i would call it surprising having gotten used to the overblown and bloated batman films i was expecting another bombastic pointless neon filled superhero movie replete with dumb illogical villains and heroes who are seemingly an afterthought in the plotwell what do you knowfor an expected summer blockbuster is a nice little movie fans of the comic are treated to a remarkably faithful adaptation of the characters they know and love the casual movie goer is treated to a summer movie that has an easy to understand and not needlessly convoluted plot good but not over the top action and no mindless smirking quipster villains to groan atthe villain magneto is very essential to the plot but is not made the core of the film as the joker was successfully in the original batman movie and the likes of catwoman riddler and mr freeze were in the subsequent not so successful sequels even better the supporting villains are just that supporting it is obvious that magneto is the main man and he does not compete for screen time with his henchmen it is also an extra bonus that magneto is played as an intelligent villain with purpose and not just some loony guy in a colorful suit   the film is filled with special effects but does not depend on them to carry the proceedings the special effects are necessary to the plot and are never overused they may even be underused but read onthe only complaint would be that the story really centers on two main characters wolverine and rogue and to a great degree the other characters though perfectly cast are defined but not truly developed also at an extremely manageable hour and a half running time you leave the theater thinking the film could have benefited from another 10 to 15 minutes to come to a satisfactory conclusion the ultimate final battle is a bit anticlimatic somehow seems to conclude with a whimper and not a bang still id rather leave a film being pleased but wanting more than feeling like i just threw my money down the drain i hope all the stars are signed to a multiple movie deal because i look forward to a sequelkudos to fox for putting a superhero movie together that does not play for laughs or cornball antics but instead attempts to find a way to take the essence of their subject which makes them successful in their own genre and communicate it on the big screen for the mainstream audience i can only hope that this message resonates with the noncomic book based audience and brings the super hero genre back from its current doldrums who knows if is a hit we just might get a batman film with a decent plot that is about batman someday soon,fantasy
despite the fact that my days as an avid devotee finished a half decade ago i was ecstatic upon being subjected to the reputation that this film was beginning to garner a couple of months prior to its release  thus i patiently awaited for the movie to arrive with the anticipation level rising more and more as the days neared my longlost fanboy traits making every single fraction of a second nearly unbearable to experience afterall who could resist seeing the legendary emerge on the silver screen after so many years of bidingunfortunately i allowed my expectations to get the best of me and as a result walked out of the theater not only slightly disappointed but ashamed that i had expected this to be one of the best movies of the yearthe first factor that disillusioned me was the commercial campaign of the moviethings such as the television special which revolved rather heavily on governmental mutant control and the mutant watch website  both painted the image that this particular film would not only bring forth the subject of discrimination but in addition discuss it to depths which could be deemed unprecedented in the genre of superheroaction films  yet alas the foregoing does not happen to prove true and the fashion in which the subject emerges and thrives in the film adds the proverbial lackluster hollywood flare that so many of us hold dearsecondly it is to be expected that villains in superhero movies should possess a certain degree of superficiality  but everything up to this point had suggested that at the very least magneto and mystique would be the antagonists who would be most explored while toad and sabretooth would play relatively minor roles  on the other hand the reality of the situation is that magneto is characterized by relatively weak scenes with the exception of the opening of the movie whereas all of the other characters utter no more than two or three lines each in the entirety of the film  a real disappointment indeed as the major fights in the movie become devoid of any emotion whatsoever due to thisas far as the protagonists of the story are concernedill simply state that this movie should have been called the adventures of wolverine and rogue  they are the only two characters that are explored to a satisfactory degree with rather excellent scenes in the beginning and end of the movie no less while cyclops jean grey and storm are simply there to provide a higher number to the group should the need for battle ever arise with a slightlyexplored charles xavier serving as mentor  honestly where are the admirable leadership traits of cyclops the legendary rivalry between him and wolverine the get away from jean or ill kill you scenes the rivalry is essentially established by wolverine demanding that cyclops move away from a door and despite the fact that cyclops at one point mentions for wolverine to stay away from his woman not once do we see the couple togetherand this may seem like a bit of nitpicking but for such a highbudget movie there are a number of scenes that really could have afforded to be redone in different techniques  at one point in the movie wolverine is flung about and his body becomes contorted as it slides across the ground to the point where it elicited laughter from the audience in a rather serious moment  the blackbird looks like a miniature toy as it lands and moves about half of the time and the characters when punched or kicked fly backwards for yards on wires and arch their way upwards in a very unrealistic manner  and thats not mentioning the preposterous scenes where we see somebody flying aboutthe common notion for comic book films is that if one is familiar with the comic book and its characters the film will be better understood  perhaps with this proves true to a certain extent as in understanding where the rivalry between cyclops and wolverine comes from  yet the one thing to keep in mind is that oneline characters are the order of the day in this movie even when it comes to some of the larger parts like that of storms for what its worth is indeed one of the better comicbooktofilm adaptations ever simply read positive reviews to find all that there is to like in this movie and i did come out feeling that it was not as much of a waste as a batman film could have been  but i will forever remain adamant in my conviction that with thirty more minutes detailing the characters and the world that they live in this film could have turned out to be a contemporary classic,fantasy
not since the days of christopher reevesupermanor micheal keatonfrom the first two batman filmsthere hasnt been a movie that rocks nonstop from start to finishand here its the blockbusterrollercoaster ride of the summerand its one of those pictures that gives you the bang for the buck based on the marvel comics bookit combines great special effectsthe best ive seen this yearwith a great plot that gives it one of the best cimematic experience that you will see at the movies when wolverinehugh jackmanand storm halle berrycame outthe audience went completely crazyand it was one of those films were the audience was cheering them on to take out the bad guys the part that scared me was mystiquerebecca romijnstamosand it was one of those characters that youll never know what to expect from hersince she changes colors like a chameleonor a personat any given moment it stayed very true to the comic stripwhich ive thought it wasntbut with all the excitementyou just cant take your eyes off itreallyit was just that good and off the hook toogreat chemistry between patrick stewartprofessor xavierand ian mckellenmagentoand solid performances from anna paquin rogueand famke janessenjean greygreat action of the summer flick all the wayand there should be a sequel to this as well worth seeing if youre a diehard fan of the series,fantasy
movies based on comics characters tend to apologize the filmmakers often transmit an embarrassment to the screen and like to throw little moments into the film that show us that theyre not really taking it seriously and they know how silly it all really is does not have those moments thank god this is a real adaptation of a superhero comic by far the most faithful ever made anyone familiar with the comic will recognize the characters and situations presented here and without apology or condescensiondoes that mean that only comics fans will enjoy it  honestly i dont think so but i cant be sure  i was too overjoyed with the adaptation of characters i was familiar with  even the good comictofilm transfers have messed with the characters batmans rubber armor comes to mindthe film has its problems of course theres very little time to develop all of the characters  storm in particular gets short shrift in the screen time department  at 95 minutes this is one economical piece of filmmaking but at a time when even fluff like meet joe black can clock in at three hours this is actually very refreshing and keeps from bogging down in the selfimportant philosophizing that the comic often indulges inas expected wolverine quickly takes center stage  given that the casting was vital and fortunately the ball was not dropped hugh jackman is wolverine to the point that its impossible to see anyone else in the role similarly patrick stewart and ian mckellen have now become professor xavier and magneto  i will not be able to see the comics characters without seeing these actors theyre that perfect the award for most improved character goes to rogue whom ive always found irritating in the comic but who is very nicely reimagined herethis is a great introduction whose only real flaw is that it does feel somewhat like a mere introduction hopefully the alreadycontracted sequels will flesh out this very promising beginning,fantasy
so far there has been and dark cloud over the realm of comic book movies such as spawn and blade cheesey hokey overtones glued over dark characters doesnt work with the this dark cloud has moved on and the comic book movie franchise has seen its light and leading the way is bryan singer he did for the what he did for kevin spacy in the usual suspects there was not one thing that was wrong with the movie the people looked like they should they acted like they were supposed to the effects were great the sound cranked and the over all feel to the movie was the i went in expecting a decent movie i came out seeing a masterpiece,fantasy
i went into this movie with high expectations ive been an xfan for years and like many others i was going to pick apart the movie however i also knew that comic books movies especially marvel comic book movies suck most of the timeim happy to say that every expectation i had was met this movie was great from the writing to the directing to the characers to the acting to the dialogue to the cast to the music sure it wasnt perfect but it was damn near close a perfect way to start out of new wing of the already blooming xfranschise,fantasy
seeing the come alive on the screen sure was something special enough praise should go to director bryan singer who seemed to have a lot of pressure making this project since a lot of diehard fans didnt think it would be made right thinking that it would be another weak comic flickwell this diehard fan was pleased big time at first i was skeptical about hugh jackman who playing the one and only  wolverine after seeing a few early publicity stills of him i wasnt really impressed but all that changes once you see this picture this is a strong candidate for breakthrough performance of the year yet i do agree little with some of the other comments here regarding the other characters while professor x and magneto shine on the screen the other and brotherhood of the mutants rarely have much to do yes sabretooth is much more than just a roaring henchman but lets face it  not everything can be perfect in films so ill let this one slidethats just about it there are no other flaws that turn the film into a mushypredictable flop it all runs so smoothly the action the special fx the soundbe sure to catch this flick at a new theatre with special surround sound or youll miss professor x lurking around in your brainand the story of course there will be more story to tell when the sequels come around and i wont mind catching all of them as well as this one for a second time   4ever,fantasy
i have been an fan for years now and of course all you ever heard were rumours of a film  i kind of felt sorry for the makers of the film as they would have such a large burden on their shoulders i have to say that despite the difficulty they carried it off quite well the casting was perfect as far as im concerned all the actors ranged between good and incredible and special mention must go to hugh jackman i thought he really was wolverineprobably one of the hardest characters to pull off the film was entertaining and stuck to the true form of the original comic book changing what was necessary eg the costumes the story while nothing special was interesting at the least one problem was the lack of involvement of a number of the cyclops and jean grey dont have much to do in comarison to wolvie and storm is simply a background character with like two lines al round every single fan needs to see this and get the dvd while non fans will be suitably entertained this film did convert a lot of nonfans into fans,fantasy
the long awaited movie has arrived and its a pretty entertaining film however its not a great film most of the characters could have used a little more development because theyre so interesting one character in is developed effectively and thats wolverine well played by australian newcomer hugh jackman we get to know him pretty well during the course of the film another character that has a good amount of screen time is rogue played by oscar winner anna paquin we get to know these two characters very well but i would have liked to have seen professor x patrick stewart storm halle berry cyclops james marsden and dr jean grey famke janssen on screen a little more often same goes for the bad guys in i recently heard that this movie was originally 45 minutes longer that might be the problem nevertheless all the actors are perfectly cast and if their is going to be sequel i hope that well get to know them better in the next movie and get more screen time the action scenes special effects art direction costume designs and makeup are firstrate and that helps to make a whole lot of fun out of four,fantasy
let me start out by saying that this movie was not perfect  however it was an excellent movie that successfully set up a solid foundation for the franchise  bryan singer did an amazing job with what he was given to work with  he had a relatively small budget and very little time to shoot yet he managed to pull together a solid movie  although i would have liked to see more development from storm jean and cyclops most of the roles were properly developed  wolverine was displayed perfectly as were professor x and magneto  rogue also came across well  the acting was also done very well  hugh jackman patrick stewart and ian mckellen were perfect in each of their roles respectively and the rest of the cast played their parts well  the story was also well thought out  magnetos plot although somewhat overdone fit the themes of racism the movie put across  i give a 910  definitely worth seeing,fantasy
seemingly a cartoon played by real actors on big screen is a serious story of the two old men conflictingtogether with their follower mutantsover liberation of estranged and segregated minority magneto try to free the mutantkind by terrorism and the domination over humankind xavier do it by education and enlightenment this can be applied to regionalethnical and religious conflicts we have around in the real world and make this film something special and i noticed the mutants are described as thouse burdened with useless and almost funny gifts such as cyclopstoo dangerous to seeand roguetoo fatal to touch and mistyque is a symbol of strong desire to be accepted maybe i am taking too it seriouslybut its allegorical awareness of the problems of the real world today saved me from feeling foolishas is often with me after seeing a comic book of a film like superman and batman34 may be un satisfactory for the fans of its comic versioni enjoyed it very much im looking forward the sequelsx2 is going to be released in 2003oh make it 2002,fantasy
in the not too distant future a small number of human beings have evolved into complex mutants with remarkable powers that cause an outbreak of fear and prejudice frustrated vengeful and believing that all mutants should rein supreme megalomaniacal mutant mckellen and his devious brotherhood devise a scheme to retaliate against all humans this attracts the attention and resistance of stewarts a heroic gang of mutants who believe that the two groups can live in peace and harmony unremarkable occasionally cheesy but the story is good and there are many engrossing and believable moments showing how humans fear and discriminate against that which they do not understand fans should have a great time yet theres still enough razzledazzle effects to satisfy a few others ,fantasy
 the moviewow  i thought this movie was great lotta actiongreat special fx i cant stop watching it hugh jackman was excellent as loganwolverine as was patrick stewart as professor xavier if ya havnt got this movie yetget it,fantasy
i really had no expectations that this film would be even be modestly good so it was a pleasant surprise to see a very well made film unfold perhaps some fans of the comic strip  may find too many variables however as cinema entertainment it hits the spot with inevitable comparison to some of the batman offerings i tend to like better the batman offerings seem more ponderous and overblown compared to and somehow despite its comicstrip origin seems to appeal on a more adult level much of this is due to the deftness and light touch of the director great cg work  this is one genre where cg really works well  alongside very good real sets makes for an excellent looking film patrick stewart at last gets a chance for once to unleash his screen presence  shamefully squandered by the star trek folks  and does a great job teamed against the awesome ian mckellen these two add the sinister darker aspect of the film hugh jackman looking eerily like a young clint eastwood in many shots and the rest of the cast very ably fill the young cast roles oddly i had heard very little about and it would seem it has been greatly underrated from the look of things it appears that this was intended to be the first in a series of films i hope this team gets a chance to bring us some more good fare enjoy ,fantasy
comic movies tend to suck or at least be a little embarrassing for us normal welladjusted comic readers  its painfully true  amazingly was great  it was easily the best comic adaptation to date  even the reviews are better than average and as of today 71600 imdb score is an 83 which is very respectable  unfortunately it doesnt look like people are turning out for the movie like i expected  it had a few flaws such as rushing into the movie and a couple of hokey lines not many though  the humor was cute and the interplay between the characters was essential to having a decent story  the few 1520 minutes were absolutely incredible my favorite part as it explored the characters as human beings rather than superheroes  there was lots of action as well so we didnt get bored  my biggest problem and i can overlook it was that some of the characters im mostly bothered by mystique werent true to the comics  i mean mystique fought wolverine to a standstill using incredible martial arts no way would this have happened in the comics  of course wolverine was trying to kill everyone so that was pretty cool this comic movie even stands up to normal movies  it was really great  i was split between giving it a 9 or a 10 but i ended up giving it a 10  if youre a comic fan youll really enjoy  if not its still great,fantasy
a crackin good comic book adaptation the cast was superb jackman a sensation janssen sexy park loadsa fun stewart inimitable and mckellan giving his villain some classi know that there were complaints about rogue being too wimpy but hopefully this is to highlight how shes going to grow more powerful in the next few films in the franchise there were also complaints about the budget me i hardly noticed i was just grateful that it wasnt swamped with special effects in the star wars episode one tradition where in certain scenes you might as well be watching toy story for all the human action taking placei thought that each character was alotted enough time and that the set pieces were expertly handled the film was also made easily accessible to fans and newcomers alike topped off with a great score by michael kamen this along with fight club is also probably one of the most rewatchable films i have ever seen definitely one of the best comic book to big screen transistions since mr burtons terrific job watch it now,fantasy
this movie is noisy it works if accepted in a comic book way otherwise it is rather unengaging and is saved by excellent efx and top rate acting performancesif you watch it for no other reason then watch it to see halle berry surely an alltime movie babe,fantasy
after years of watching dc comics characters get good movies marvel finally scores one for their recognizable superheroes  as an antifan of the mutant hero phenomenon i was pleasantly surprised to find that apart from the expected great work of patrick stewart and ian mackellan there were also standout performances in the roles of wolverine and rogue  they turned my least favorite xcharacters into my favorite ones for the span of one movie anyway  of course theres much to be said for their costume and makeup designers work on the mystique character but thats not for a family web site,fantasy
very rarely does a movie come along that is worthy of the comic book it emulates captain americadoctor strange and even the flashare some examples of movies that failed to live up to their comic book equivalents but is off to a good start5 years in the making uses elements from the comic book nearly 40 yrs oldwith special effects and decent actors to provide a very enjoyable experience at the movie theater the movie landed on many executives and directors desks but it was bryan singer who finally took the helm and directed itin an people magazine interview singer himself admits he knew nothing about the and immediately started reading comics to learn as much as he could about the charactersthis is one of the few times that a movie does live up to its hypein this movie like in the comic book war is being made on mutants specifically by a senator robert jefferson who sees mutants as a threat to mankind mutants are among us you must know who they are and what they can doit is here that we meet jean grey cyclops woman that tries to defend mutants in a hearing trying to decide what to do about mutantsbefore that we see erik magnus lehnsherr or magneto as a child during wwii as his mom and dad are taking away from him we see magnetos power as moves barb wire and steel around himyet he is only a kid his power will grow in timethe movie then goes to the present and for the first time we see wolverine or logan played by newcomer hugh jackman as a guy who fights for a living literally he gets paid to win fighting matcheshere is where we see rogue played by anna paquinrogue ends up with wolverine heading to shelter then two are attacked by sabretoothwolverines enemythe two are saved by cyclops and storm james marsden and halle berry who got away with manslaughter after she hit a car in santa monica and leftlolso then we are transferred to the mutant academy or professor xavier school of the gifted where patrick stewark takes the role of charles xavier stewart plays this part perfectly i cant see anyone else playing dr xavier in the sequelsthe conflict in the movie comes when magneto battles his old friend drxavier and his band of mutantsmagneto has mutants of his own called the brotherhood of mutants magneto kidnaps senator jefferson and proceeds to turn him into a mutantthe movie has some brilliant effects especially at the end where a model of the statue of liberty was used in the final fight scenethe only complaint about this film is that it does not feature the original uncanny collosus night crawler kitty and so on also the evil mutants like apocalypse blob pyro and others dont appearmake no mistake though is worthy of a great christmas gift its available on vhs and dvddvd features extra footage and even a screen test of hugh jackman wolverine,fantasy
how long did you take to recognize that the first scene of this film was used for the reason for the evil mutant kings revenge against the whole world the plot is extremely excellent and the pictures are all the way fantastic isnt matrix next to this one,fantasy
here we are 1 year before the franchise waiting to see the unanswered questions the plot gaps and the underdeveloped characters to be fulfilled well you sees basic problem is that it so keen on to be a franchise that forgets to be a decent fulfilling and selfcontained 100mins feature film but lets take things from the beggingfirstly brian singer isnt joel schumacherthank god and so isnt a garish nightmarish batman  robin se but it is not a slick and stylish batman either it has a magic but it has flaws that after a certain pointeg thinking about the movie became really obvious so what is it singer said this aint gonna be a brainless actionpacked superheroes in tights et la he proves it when we actually see the opening auschwitz sequence with the very emotionally powerfull scene of the young magneto the message is obvious mutants are like the jews chased and hated by normal people they live in prejudice and in terror a terror which is leading the humans against the mutants in a  nutshell they are hated by the people they are trying to save and who themselves must deal with their own fears and emotionsa very powerfull storylinefor whom director b singer receives a credit a set of very strong charactersroguea very good anna paquin a teen misfit who is doomed to a life where skin touch must be avoideda character that best embodies the sense of the mutant dislocation magneto kickass ian mckellen who does great although he is notoriously atracted by brian singers direction and wolverinewith the almost famousnow hugh jackman he kinda pretty and too tall for wolvie but he kicks some serious but there and some subplotsthe romance between wolverine and jean gray the mystery behind the mask of wolverine et la who are never really answered and are left hanging there like a poop on a stick and what about the underdeveloped cyclopsa coldass madsen storma coooooool hallewhite haired berry and the evil guys characters who are like something more of cameos and bit less than bitparts and forgetting that the although excellent patrick stewart is serving the duties of an onscreen narratorexcept all these we also get the feeling that we are missing something maybe some setpieces or something like that we got some very good inside jokesdont you people just die or would you prefer tights and yellow suits hillarius but the shows is not good we have great fight sequencesthe bigtonguethe clawsthe thundersthe touchmyheadbullet etc but the climactic sequences is disappointing to say the least because instead of a jawdropping moments we get rutine stuff lacking of nerve and no feeling of impactat the end what we see is a very good 35 say 40 mins of a different blockbuster but the rest is lowlife action and plot gaps underdeveloped characters a feeling of rush and less excitment than expected we get nearly nothing new but it is very entairtaining and i cant wait to see the sequelalthough i now know what to expecti gave it a 610,fantasy
passes batman as best comic book adaptation ever edge to for super powers edge to batman for single character focus not that its a problem but to somehaving to follow several characters and understand what isgoing on can be trouble very well directed written and acted also with great effectsthat enhance and do not interfere with the story that istrying to be told my only problem with it is not really aproblem i think it should have been about 15 minutes longer to develop a couple points a bit further but overall igive a 93 and a best of genre it goes on my top 10list of the year and really is the best movie that i have seenin 2000 besides gladiator by the critics was the best reviewed major filmsince gladiator and for once they are right if you are an comics nut you will be happy to knowthat the characters are handled well most of their quirksand character traits are in here a vague example cyclopswas annoying to me in this movie but then he was annoying to me in the comics too if you never read asingle issue of an comic book wow are you gonnalike this movie,fantasy
i really thought they would screw this completely upafter seeing various superhero movies that have been very mediocre or worse  i expected a craptacular movie i mean heylook at marvels track recordone good movieblade what a surprise this wasthe characters were just slightly changed from the norm and the personality each represented was dead onwolverine was definitely the highlight thoughperfectly castedwonderfully acted and never out of characterif you havent seen this but read comics i have one question where have you been   in a cave   lol  watch itenjoy itand be prepared to be pleasantly amazed at the subtle changesps  someone needs to tell the powers that be at marvel that the movie character  toad  should be the normive seen people write a character horribly but never better than the actual creatorshard to believe,fantasy
im a huge dc comics fan but unfortunately the superman and batman movies have always been pretty lousy save the first two supes flicks and the watchmen never made it to screen marvel seems to be doing the right thing and having stan the man lee aboard helps alot the spiderman trailer looks great and the hulk sounds promising  i just wish the marvel stock was still up there on the nyse  its worth next to nothing now since they claimed bunkruptcy in 1995 anyway keeps you interested and tells you enough about each character while tossing in a bit of a plot at the same time its smart and worth seeing halle berry and the cyclops guy could have been better but ian picard and the wolverine guy are great hopefully this will start a small new genre for the 200s  the ok superhero movie original rating a b but bumped it up to an a after seeing it a second time looking forward to the sequel,fantasy
this movie is a cross of a brian singer movie and the comic book  brian singer has once again made a hit with this movie with the special effects at todays standards they picked the best characters for each role and hugh jackman is going to be the next russel crowe  maybe but this movie is very good,fantasy
there were two reasons i rented this movie out a i used to love the cartoon and had missed it when it was released at the theaters and b i had just gotten back from a school camp with anna paquins father no im not kidding nice guyanyway the film itself is really cool a special fx an actual storyline and the actors chosen to play the mutants were wellpicked and intriguingthe story goes rogue anna paquin  a nz native who won an oscar for the piano runs away from home after discovering her mutant abilities and jumps on wolverine hugh jackmans truck where they are attacked saved and taken to professor xs school for gifted youngsters or somethingthere they are taught how to use their powers and are told about the brewing war between mutants and the rest of humanitythe movie features some big names halle berry an ok storm but she should have used something for the voice james marsden the everannoying cylops and rebecca romjinstamos as mystique who was put into fullbody make up for 5 hoursheres hoping 2 continues the highcallibre entertainment this one carries but it was a let down to hear that theyre not introducing any new mutants good bad or otherwiseps anna has said that she felt her character was just a helpless little girl so im betting theyll improve her character a bit but anyways this is one of the best comictobigscreen adaptions next to the batman franchise,fantasy
this opinion is written from a womansmoms perspective  this was actually a much better movie than i thought it would be  women dont usually go for movies like this one  though this is rated pg13 its okay for kids for watch  there is violence but not very gory or bloody there is some profanity but i think it was only a couple of words  its not dark and sinister like the batman movies i gave it a 7,fantasy
since tim burton left the franchise and batmans archenemy the schumacher took over there havent been any comic book adaptations that were worth while enter  i had no intention to see it i was afraid it would nerd up my time but the word of mouth finally got to me  to my surprise i have to admit that is quite good  there could have been a bit more action and bit more explanation for the firsttimers but generally it worked very well  ian mckellen stands out as always but hugh jackman shows much promise as wolverine this is the best comic adaptation of the 00s or at least until spiderman comes outmost memorable movie momentwolverine its me cyclops prove it wolverine youre a dick cyclops okrating 710,fantasy
the is a great movie it beats out blade and the underrated punisher movie hands down has some really cool fx making the movie a excellent moviethe comicbook heroes take on an evil mutant who plans to turn everybody into a mutantmarvel has never had great luck with adaptionsa lot of the movies are flat out duds with exceptions of the punisher and blade the is a truly spectacular showcase of how a comicbook movie should be only real flaw is cyclops played horribly by marsden he grinds the movie down but still is a great movie 12 out of four,fantasy
i am an fan for many years and watched the movie develop i must say i was pleassed beside  the fact that  magnto plan was a bit stupid the movie was well done the movie is filled with realisim and great  acting  the special bond between magnto and charles creates a beutifull tragic story one of the greatest achievement of the movie was keeping the main idea of the comics that is pepole hate what they dont understand that racisim comes in many forms great movie,fantasy
i was happy to see that wolverine talked less and slashed more  a welcomed change from the 1990s cartoon serieshalle berry was good as storm however i was dissapointed that more of her power wasnt used in the moviecasting patrick stewart for the role of prof x was a good choice  come to think about it i cant picture anyone else playing that rolei look forward to seeing the sequel especially when i saw rogue and the soon to be iceman chapone more thing  mystique was brilliant in her fighting sceneswell done,fantasy
im not sure how i ended up watching this film as ive never seen the series nor read the comic book but having been a huge fan of films like flash gordon and superman as a child i decided to give it a chance the basic premise is mutant humans who each possess unique and incredible powers are in a struggle to save themselves and regular humans who are threatened by and afraid of the mutants from evil mutants i would give the story a mere 5 nothing too exciting there but based on the films visual appeal i took my rating up a notch to a 6,fantasy
i really cant say i am a purist  i did collect the comic book for 6 years starting when bishop appeared and stopped about 4 years agoi really cant say that this movie was the best i have seen because it isnt  the special effects and storyline were both very good  however there is one part of this movie that could have been improved  that is the character development  they tried to cram a two and a half hour movie into a hour and a half and it shows  hugh wolverine had the main part in the flick probably because he is the most popular and all the others had to share the time that was leftoverall though this movie was very worthwhile to see  i wont see it again in the theaters though but i will probably buy it on dvd to see again7 out of 10 stars,fantasy
 should engender hope in the hearts of longsuffering comic book aficionados perhaps this film will raise the bar for this longabused genre maybe the key is to have the screenplay written by a fan of the original comics as was done here whatever the reason is a winner this is a characterdriven story that never sags but just marches through from opening scene to the credits skillfully incorporating just the right amount of action dialogue and scenery there are plenty of great special effects shots but they never overwhelm the characters the quality of the fight scenes is also excellent and they also dont overwhelm the story in contrast to just about any actionadventure movie in recent memoryspecial accolades go to hugh jackman as wolverine perhaps this is a breakthrough role for him this is not to detract from the other actors all of whom handled their roles perfectly rebecca romijnstamos having to work through tons of makeup as mystique still projects humor and personality into her character i wish we had seen more of patrick stewart and ian mckellen but unanswered questions in the story combined with what appears to be enthusiastic viewer response assures us of a sequel featuring both of these journeyman actors,fantasy
im very surprised about the voting of this filmi think this kind of cinema is really awfulits the most boring movie of the yeari dont like nothing this film and i vote 1and i reccomended this film for the americans with it awful movies and the europeans with our great moviesviva el cine europeofuera el cine americano,fantasy
i am and have always been a true fan i made it through three of the movies before i vowed to never watch another one again as they completely destroyed one of my best childhood memories of checking the comic store week after week waiting for the newest issues to be released if you have never read the comic books or even watched the cartoon series you will probably find it entertaining the fans of stan lees finest work should be able to empower him to rip away from fox as they have completely slaughtered the saga just a few of the problems mutants that are related dont even recognize each other missing integral parts of story line mutant powers are changed lessened missing actorsactresses did not grasp the characters virtues bryan singer took people that could look the part but did not ensure the actors knew how to play the role and i dont believe he ever actually read the original comics,fantasy
ok first of all to tall the reviewers that are claiming that this movie stayed true to its roots you have clearly never read an comicthis is the worst thing to ever happen to the title that i have ever seen this movie was a disaster brian singer needs to be punished for what he created here the only thing he got right was patrick stewart as proff x and yes i blame singer for the whole thing because as the director it was his responsibility to make choices and deny choices which as far as i can tell he did using a magic 8 ballhis punishment should be that he will be taken to an empty field and tied to the ground then all the worlds fans will begin to stack their boxes of comics on top of him until we hear the pop,fantasy
decaf film making  im getting very tired of hearing how risky it is to make a costume hero film and how they had to play it safe to guarantee box office and sequels  question why would i want to see a sequel of this id be as well just playing the game of the film over and over and over andcompare with the gorgeously stylish and daring batman 1989 which spawned a series of increasingly mundane and lack lustre sequels  when were all heartily sick of the whole x men franchise we wont even be able to look back and lament over how good it used to be,fantasy
  2000 12 out of four    it is never a good sign when a movie features a theatrical trailer more entertaining than the movie itself but bryan singers the live action version of the outdated cartoon is as disposable and lightweight as its characters on helium the film brings new meaning to the art of science fiction where it attempts to portray futuristic ideas in human evolution without drastically changing the world around them there is no explanation behind the movies concepts that become lost in an overzealous and dramatically disappointing script      the story takes place in the not so distant future where the government considers mutants people with extraordinary powers a threat to society us senator robert kelly bruce davison is proposing a plan to expose these individuals to the public although most mutants are decent ordinary lawabiding citizens kelly feels others have the right to be informed about their powers and potential dangers     humanity has greater concerns however like continuing their ordinary existence magneto ian mckellen the aging but magnetism controlling madman who believes humans are mutants nemesis and his gang including sabertooth tyler mane fierce and beastlike toad ray park who has abilities similar to his namesake species and mystique rebecca romijnstamos who can transform into anyone plan on conquering the planet with complex technology      there is the good hearted professor charles xavier patrick stewart the handicapped but telepathic leader of the a group of mutants bent on peace between humans and themselves he owns a school for the mutants and among his longtime students is cyclops james marsden a young man with laserfiring eyes jean grey famke janssen who has telekinetic powers and storm halle berry who is able to control the weather newcomers wolverine hugh jackman a man with retractable claws and the ability to heal himself quickly and rouge anna paquin a young confused teenage girl that drains the power from anyone she touches are quickly woke up to the dangers of their counterparts and his plan to seek total denomination ,fantasy
the x men franchise has been spun off into lots of various directions since the series began on film way back in 2000 but this is the film that started it alland it must have done pretty well to be the one that started it all most of the success is down to the casting not least hugh jackman as wolverinethere are some slow moments along the way in this film its not all perfect but there are enough big set pieces and examples of snappy dialogue to grab the audiences attention for as long as the director demands it,fantasy
this movie is not the best or worst movie ive seen but its not great or good at the same time the story is about mutants battling other mutants one side wants to protect the humans and the other side wants all of them dead this film has some nice action sequences including some of the battles between the good guys and the bad guys the cast does a good job but dont have much to work with sometimes it will get boring by just having the characters talking if your a comic book fan go see blade overall 66,fantasy
ridiculous hugh jackman vehicle you cant laugh or cry thats how bad this one isarent oscar winners halle berry and anna paquin able to find better material than this i thought that famke johnson had promise if she keeps up with trite like this forget it at the end she flies in the air as if she is mary poppins miss johnson you are no marythis offthewall film deals with mutants who supposedly have been accepted by society nonetheless a pharmaceutical concern had come up with a cure of course the owner of the concern has a mutant for a son naturally there is divisiveness in the mutant group part of the group led by patrick stewart want accommodation with the rest of the world stewart leads students in a gifted program no gifted student would participate in a film as awful as this ian mckellen is up to his old tricks as the evil mutant with quite a ghastly crewthe special effects here are great see a house torn up and the golden gate bridge demolished as alcatraz is invaded yet the effects cant make up for bad script writing in this totally idiotic film is it any wonder why our youths react to the world they live in so violently when they view junk like this,fantasy
 is a rare treat a blockbuster that lives up to its hype and a comic book adaptation that hits the markalong with tim burtons batman this stands head and shoulders above all other superhero movies its a genre thats usually synonymous with silly campy cartoonish crap but bryan singer delivers a longawaited exception to the rule is smart stylish and very cool one of the better sci fifantasy films of the last decade,fantasy
plot overview humans have evolved over the years but the next step is in the form of mutants humans with extraordinary abilities when mankind tries to revolt against the mutant race eric lashferian mckellen leads an army back at them with a war brewing its up to charles xavierpatrick stewarts to save everyonedirected by bryan singerstarring ian mckellen patrick stewart and hugh jackman no spoilersoverall this is an amazing superhero movies that works without the superheroes it transcends the genre and becomes something much more than it appears its a beautiful story about acceptance and was a huge step in the life of superhero movies possible spoilerspatrick stewart is great as charles xavier however ian ian mckellen was absolutely phenomenal as eric lashner and became one of the greatest comic book villains of all time hugh jackman was also awesome as wolverine and began his 17 year journey as the character halle berry was pretty good as storm as was james marsden as cyclops famke janssen was a good jean grey and rebecca romjin was a good mystique anna paquin was however quite weak as rougeit holds a pretty good story and is a nice introduction to the universe themes of acceptance run throughout this movie and i think that is a truly excellent thing its the story and themes that makes this casual superhero flick transcend what is expected from comic book movies and made it something so much more its an excellent idea and works perfectly it also contains an excellent ending and the doomsday weapon was not a sky beam which is nicei feel like the movie was pretty poorly edited but apart from that the cinematography was reasonablethe effects were pretty good and looked reasonablethis movie needed to give a good amount of well directed and choreographed action  introduce new audiences to the wonderful universe personally i really enjoyed this movie and thought it was excellently done710would recommend,fantasy
1 this film is very topical today with the current debate of muslims and terrorism this film was written and made before 911 based on real life events such as the holocaust and the civil rights movement but its themes are so universal that they still apply many innocent mutantsmuslims want only to live peacefully but are instead subject to fear violence and hatred at being identified showing your powers is no different to wearing a turban or reading the qoran or saying an islamic prayer treating all mutants the same is likely to drive more mutantsmuslims into the arms of radicals like magnetoisis who argue that violence is the answer2 the films sharp and perceptive dialogue does a lot to help it though uncredited christopher mcquarries fingerprints can be seen all over this the debate between senator kelly and jean gray at the start of the film is intelligent but also sets the stage tremendously for the film we are about to watch the final exchange between charles and erik paraphrases how a conversation between malcolm x and martin luther king might have gone 3 the film is nearly flawless in its editing we jump from scene to scene with each one serving its purpose and not staying overlong we are able to establish magneto rogue senator kelly and wolverine in quick succession and despite the sometimes significant time gaps between those scenes the film never feels like its going too fast 4 the casting of ian mckellen is inspired not only can the great thespian get into magnetos shoes as a marginalised homosexual himself but he instantly elevates every single one of the screenplays lines with his dramatic delivery his little speech to rogue about how america was meant to be a land of tolerance and peace stands out as a highlight his humour and charisma make him not only believable but plausible as a revolutionary leader5 hugh jackman suits the role of wolverine perfectly whilst i believe there are other enormously talented casting choices in the film it is jackmans ability to easily establish the perfect chemistry with each that makes the film work he and james marsden instantly clash as rivals for jeans affection whilst he and famke jansen practically have sparks flying from their first interaction his older brother relationship with anna paquin is the films most important 6 singers decision to make rogue then a relatively minor character a focal point for the story was brilliant rogue especially through anna paquins powerful performance represents everything about mutants that the film needed  fear of your own powers fear of others powers and most importantly a crushing feeling of isolation 7 singer does an amazing job at creating a high tension high stakes movie within pg13 limits the scene where magneto controls the guns is supremely tense without being dark as is the powerful scene in which wolverine accidentally lashes out at rogue in his sleep the senator kelly subplot is dramatic without being gory theres no blood and therefore the scenes work in a pg13 setting singer shows us that we can have superhero movies where the stakes are higher than oh no the cars are all being blown up8 the ability of toad mystique and sabertooth to physically deal with the in abundance creates some amazing fight scenes rebecca romijn barely speaks for the entire movie but says so much in her amazing body language and eyes the sequence in which mystique impersonates different members of the team is again something i attribute to singer and mcquarrie the fight scenes are tense because toad is able to physically fend off all three of storm jean and cyclops with ease9 if i have one complaint its that too often the film comes off as cheesy ray park and tyler mane are physically impressive but neither has the acting ability necessary to compete with the rest of the cast halle berry as storm also makes it hard to get into the movie due to her cheesy delivery some elements of magnetos plan simply rely on our going okay sure that makes sense because we dont have a whole lot of reality to base them on10 there are some topnotch visuals especially with mystique i cant fathom just how much effort went into creating mystiques makeup and prosthetics or in doing that seamless midair transition from hugh jackman to rebecca romijn as she jump kicks himbryan singer should be recognised for relaunching the superhero movie were it not for the performances of park mane and berry id say that this movie transcended its genre and became an important civil rights commentary it comes pretty darn close as it does,fantasy
the first is at the time of this review 16 years old wow it is amazing if you seat and think that for a minute then you will realize that this movie is older from a large percent of the people who now believe that superhero movies are the norm of hollywood blockbusters so it is an important flickbut i have to be honest though here we have the moviewhich restarted the superhero as a genre in general after the death of it from batman and robin it is a little dated by todays standards but its legacy it is unquestionable for it gave birth to the great superhero flicks of the new millaia which dominate the box officeas for the casting patrick sturat as professor x ian mackellen as magneto were wish fulfillment to fans around the world dispute these great casting hugh jackman as wolverine is the showstealer here and his portrait is the reason why most films have him as a center character and he was the only one to get solo films apart from deadpool and something mindblowing is that when he was first announced many disagree because he didnt looked the part but after that film mouths shutas for the action is well directed and entertaining though the final plan of magneto is quit cartoony which a bit ruins the film for me but that is my only major drawback as for the theme on which were made prejudice against the persons who are different from the average joe or jane is handle in a mature way and not shoved inall in all if you havent seen it for a long time rewatch it worth your time,fantasy
 2000 is of course the first film in the franchise of course hugh jackman was amazing in this film as he is in everything else hugh just really fits the role of wolverine its almost the role he was born to play he was rugged sexy tough and very likable also anna paquin was perfect for her role and her and hugh have awesome chemistry together the script was pretty well written too also the action sequences were entertaining and fun to watch and enjoy what i do like about this movie is that its pretty intelligently written and filmed its not just one of those mindless run of the mill action romps i have not watched the rest of the films in movie series but after seeing this first movie i do plan to see the rest of them sometime soon i would suggest 2000 710,fantasy
i am doing a superhero franchise review and it isin 1994 20th century fox and producer prawan singh bought the film rights to the andrew kevin walker was hired to write and james cameron expressed interest in directing eventually bryan singer signed on to direct in july 1996 thought not a fan of the comicbooks singer was fascinated by the analogies of prejudice and discrimination it offeredjohn logan joss whedon ed solomon christopher mcquarrie and david hayter wrote the script with hayter receiving sole credit production began in september 1999 in toronto canado and ended in march 2000the film was released on july 14 2000 to positive reviews and critical success and spawned a reemergence of superhero films and it would prove to movie studios that superhero films could succeedthe film introduces us to wolverine and rogue into the conflict between professor xaviers and the brotherhood of mutants led by magneto magneto intends to mutate world leaders at a united nations summit with a machine he has built to bring about acceptance of mutant kind but xavoer realizes this forced mutation will only result in their deathshugh jackman was the perfect choice of wolverine and this film would lead him into being in the sequels and two spinoffs and other movies including van helsing and prisoners patrick stewart plays professor x and ian mckellen plays magneto and they were also really good casting choicesanna paquin was the perfect choice to play rogue  marie and this would lead her into playing in true blood as the main character which ended in 2014 and my 25yearold sister watches the show but i dont famke janssen and the rest of the cast were all cast perfectly in this film as their rolesthe action sequences were amazing and there is less cgi in this film because some of the visual effects are really amazing and this film only had a 75 million dollar budget and i really liked the way this movie turned out and the story is not actionpacked but i will say it is really amazing but there is just one major flaw this was 2000 and it did not make me feel any emotion for the characters except for wolverine and roguethe musical score is really good and i think michael kamen did a really good job with his theme but i like john ottmans theme in the next filmoverall i like but the one thing that had me confused is that the story is not actionpacked enough and it does not make me feel any emotion for the characters except for wolverine and rogue is the reason why we have superhero films today like batman begins spiderman iron man the dark knight the dark knight rises man of steel 300 blade watchmen and of course both the avengers and avengers age of ultron810,fantasy
this film here was clearly the big winner at the academy of science fiction fantasy  horror films awards in 2001 it was the beginning to a super successful new franchise the movies writer and director bryan singer was mostly known for his academy award winning work on the usual suspects and it was definitely quite a leap from the world of crime into the world of superheroes or i should maybe say mutants with superpowers the cast may appear to include some big names but thats only because of what happened in the last 15 years there is certainly some irony to the fact that only anna paquin the youngest cast member was an academy award winner back in 2000 berry had her win not much later famke janssen looks absolutely stunning in here and was mostly known for her portrayal of the very memorable xenia onatopp at this point james marsden was fairly unknown and same can be said about hugh jackman an australian actor that nobody knew before this film was made but who since has risen up into the elite of hollywood patrick stewart and ian mckellen were both very established actors already even if mckellen did not yet have the lotrtrilogy under his belt and finally rebecca romijn who received lots of recognition and awards for her portrayal here which baffles me as i felt her character was 99 makeup and special effects than a really convincing performance even if she played a memorable character oh yeah and bruce davison is in here as well a golden globe winner and oscar nomineeso yeah the story here is that the world of humans is also full with mutants and there are obviously skepticisms coming from both sides towards the other mutants are also separated into two groups the ones who aim at piece with humans and the ones who look forward to war anna paquin plays a young mutant who is a key figure in the evil mutants plans but the main character wolverine is still portrayed by hugh jackman these days and i think it was a bold move by bryan singer who also wrote the characters to have jackman carry this franchise on his shoulders at least in this first film quite a vote of trust i assume singer was already planning a second film when he made this one here he included an ending where it was left open if jackman may return depending on how audiences would like him and also an ending in which mckellen could very well return as the main antagonist even if he was not 100 evil just disappointed and desperate i guess i expected a final fight between stewarts and mckellens character as they really built up that storyline but stewart was pretty much missinginaction for the entire final fight sequence and the young guns took responsibility still they reunited the two for the very final scene which again shows that mckellens character is not 100 evil playing chess with his mentor and antagonist the two just have completely different political positionsthis was a good film in terms of special effects and characters they were all fairly memorable and easy to distinguish with their costumes and abilities which is always important in scifi films it was unusually short for a superhero movie only 95 minutes without credits and completely different compared to todays standards i must say this one got me curious about the next installments to the series and i will certainly check these out at some point as for this very first i recommend it good watch,fantasy
as a kid i loved the cartoon series strange as it is coming from a young girl who grew up in the 90s but still though i loved watching x menspiderman to name a few as a kid and to this day i still love them so in the new millennium 20th century fox gave us a movie adaptation based on the famous marvel comic books and cartoon series the story is as follows a young woman named marierogue played by anna paquin from true blood is a introvert who discovers she has superhero powers as she can kill anyone if you touch her and she could absorb someone elses powersshe kinda reminds me of elsa from frozen but anywaysshe runs away after nearly killing her boyfriend and bumps into a arrogant man named loganwolverine as he is later known asplayed by aussie star hugh jackman in his hollywood debut and the movie that gained his career in showbiz together logan and rogue end up being kept captured by other mutants called storm and cyclopsplayed by halle berry and enchanteds james marsdenand they both work for professor charles x played by patrick stewart from star trek tv series logan and rogue must fight for mankind as well as battling other mutants one who can change into anyone she wants called mystiqueplayed by rebecca romijnand sabbatoothplayed by tyler maneas both of these are working for a former friend of professor x magneto played by ian mckellan so will roguewolverine and co save mankindoverall i really enjoyed this movie is it the best movie ever no its not and i tell you my only problem with this film were the effectsespecially when hugh jackman as wolverine took out his claws you can clearly tell that it was prosthetic hands as it felt kinda false to me compare to x men orgins wolverine which was better with the effects but hey this is the year 2000 we are talking about here also the rest of the film seemed kinda fake like one where the senator was also a mutant and he can change into water and he blew up in the end as well as moving like rubberand i thought he looked very false looking too mystique and wolverine are literally the coolest superheros ever in my opinion as wolverine is rough and arrogant and mystiquewho said nothing in this filmwas cool for changing into different people as for the rest of the superheros they are all good too the cast was all very good especially hugh jackman who was a newcomer in hollywood as he hails from austrailia and to have him change his persona and accent in every film he is in is brilliant not only is this guy handsome and down to earth but he is a remarkable actor and isnt one of those typecast actors who just walks in and be themselves in every godforsaken film they are ini am looking at you adam sandlermeg ryan etc james marsden was also very good as cyclops and the rest like i said were all very good but it was a shame we couldnt get into everyones backstory as in every x men movie wolverine is the star of the show in x men why i may never know but i guess its got to do with his powers and thatbottom line i liked it and i was glad to see it again after all those years and finally got the original box set of the franchise from 2000 2006 at a very reasonable pricenow all i have to watch next time is x men 2united stick around for that review which will be the next reviewc 7010355good fun,fantasy
my son brought me into the foray of comic book movies i had low expectations this one is quite expository bringing us into contact with the principles of the we are introduced to wolverine and the lot the plot involves all of the planning government meddling and supervillains with whom i am not familiar one thing that impressed me is the quality of the acting and the big time performers that contributed to this it does leave unanswered questions but i would assume there are answers galore as the blockbusters of the day seem to be about 90 percent directed to fanboys i really enjoyed this but am still a bit bewildered by who these guys are,fantasy
superhero films are a dimeadozen these days regardless of whether you think thats good or bad we all have the original film to thank prior to this superhero movies were limited in scope scale and conception after all comic book stories are so largerthanlife that its hard to adapt them for the big screen much less justify a big enough budget for it with the and arguably blade released a couple of years earlier filmmakers took a chance on modern effects and techniques to bring a whole team of heroes to life ushering in a massive wave of comicbook movies that would eventually lead to marvels rise as a new studio a cinematic force to be reckoned withas the firstever film it has its share of limitations especially compared to later films action is kept to a minimum the biggest highlights being the train station scenes and the big climax on liberty island special effects are plentiful but used sparingly what really matters is that you get to see a whole world of mutants showing off their varied powers the film blasts so many memorable details with sporadic bursts of short scenes crafting just enough spectacle to wow us but also just enough to tell the story it needs toit is a decent enough story the film takes its time tracking various characters and bringing them together so we get a solid and wellcomposed introduction to the and the world they inhabit there are a ton of characters involved but the film juggles them well enough a good amount of attention is given to wolverine rogue magneto and professor x who are all endearing characters we can appreciate most of the others tend to be lacking there is no real development involved with storm cyclops jean grey or mystique and toad and sabretooth stand as two of the weakest villains in the franchise for they are lacking in presence and depth all things considering the film covers so much ground that theres really no room for extraneous character beats what matters the most is the plot which is intriguing as it builds up to a fairly decent climax at its core its a film that underscores themes of prejudice which provides all the dynamics for the character and the conflicts they go throughthis film is very tightlycomposed with excellent photography and very rapid editing it is especially noteworthy how the film manages to relay so much information with a constant stream of short revealing images acting is a little dry but the casting choices are mostly perfect hugh jackman is easily the most iconic character of the lot thanks to his perfect portrayal of wolverine patrick stewart ian mckellen anna paquin and bruce davidson are great in their roles and i enjoyed watching famke janssen and rebecca romijnstamos i got to admit that the more i watch this film the more i dislike halle berry as storm she does deliver one of the worst lines ever in this film writing is pretty blunt but it gets the job done this production uses some very slick and coollooking sets props and costumes special effects hold up mostly well with just a few weaknesses the music score is alrightthe first original film was an inspiring hit at its time but would only be a small taste of even greater things to come it still holds up thanks to its storytelling and nuanced attention to detail its worth seeing at least once especially for genre fans45 entertainment good  story good  film good,fantasy
i used to watch the tv series as a kid all the time i remember when this movie first came out in 2000 i was so excited and was not disappointedi watched 2000 again with fresh eyes and despite the special effects which are nothing compared to what can be accomplished today which for being made in 2000 is not bad at all  the movie is a classic adaptation of the comics the casting is done perfectly to reflect the characters had my cartoon come to life this is precisely what they would look like a good old action film appropriate for any age marvel never fails to deliver,fantasy
there have been so many comic book movies since the year 2000 and quite a few of them movies that it may be a good idea to think back to when this movie came out and remember this got the ball rolling yes there had been batman and superman before that but they were dc properties that seemed to exist within a little bubble all their own there was also blade but that was a supernatural action movie a lot of people didnt even know it was based on a comic book character this movie was the first successful superhero movie based on marvel comics characters it took the source material seriously and treated it with respect it did away with the notion that superheroes were solely kids stuff and what followed was a wave of comic movies based on marvel properties that is still going strong todaythe casting is mostly spoton hugh jackman became a star overnight due to his performance as wolverine its hard to imagine hell ever have another role to top this one or that theyll ever be able to recast with an actor bettersuited for the part and no nerds dont say hes not the perfect wolverine just because hes not physically identical to the comics version open a window people the casting of patrick stewart as professor x was a nobrainer and hes also perfectly suited for the part ian mckellens excellent as magneto its arguable hes older than he should be but hes so good in the role it really doesnt matter rebecca romijn mystique halle berry storm anna paquin rogue and famke janssen jean grey are all great as well i especially enjoyed the chemistry between jackman and paquin their scenes are some of the films best moments not all of it is a home run james marsdens wooden performance as cyclops is something of a negative he has no chemistry with famke janssen which ultimately weakens that portion of the film tyler manes monosyllabic sabretooth and ray parks ridiculous toad are both lame these two are frequently mentioned by the movies detractors and i find it hard to defend them they are also the worst of the hollywoodizations of the characters appearances something they all suffer from despite the movies many strengths it still exists within the narrow mindset that you cant do movies with people in colorful costumes without it appearing silly so hey black leather yall because thats not something you literally see all the time in moviesfor some reason this first movie gets a lot of flack today in certain circles is it perfect no but neither are some of these more recent superhero movies that have been hailed as masterpieces the direction is strong the script is smart the acting is wonderful there are some flaws and ive addressed a few but on the whole its a fantastic film that entertains me every time i watch it there have been some good and bad movies since this one but this stands as the one i rewatch most often,fantasy
well look what we have here the movie that started the superhero craze but we should not focus on that but the acting here is good with some characters bad with others the best is wolverine it takes you on a epic journey on a group of people forced out of towns cites villages because of fear many end up in the charles xavier collage where they are free burt now all the world is going to be turned into mutants and they have to stop it for some reason even though they would stop being rejected by people but whatever and i learn a lesson never ever think like a baby that scared of different people but it also stared the superhero craze withs is getting boring oh look a new thor movie a new iron man movie i hope this will stop soon,fantasy
back in the summer of 2000 no other movie had been more hyped up and anticipated than x men nowadays the reactions from people ranges from it sizzles to its just ok the movie itself adapted by director bryan singer supports all those responseswhat sizzles start with hugh jackman as loganalso known as wolverine jackman energizes x men with power doses of fire flashy humor and somehow creates the character as his own many people were skeptical about a broadway actor playing one of the most badass characters in comic book history however jackman gives wolverine an identity of his won while trying to be faithful to the source material the other characters also shine in this movie patrick stewart and ian mckellen play the ongoing characters of charles xavier and magneto they arent enemies so much as ideological opposites magneto having seen the holocaust has a deep pessimism about human nature xavier who runs a school for mutants in westchester county where it doubtless seems no stranger than the other private schools hopes these new powers can be used for goodothers like storm halle berry cyclops james marsden jeangrey famke janssen and rogue anna paquin all lend great performances the brotherhood of evil also make a great rogue of villains that stand in the way between the otherwhats just ok the thin excuse for a plot while it boasts a great cast that doesnt mean that all of them are developed wolverine and rogue are and they have great chemistry between each other in fact i wouldnt have minded if the movie was about these two two mutants that are lost and need help from each other sounds like a great plot unfortunately great actors like mckellan and stewart are just supporting characters i wish they were more scenes of them discussing their plans and the reasons why they are against each other also magnetos villains arent as memorable as xaviers they just seem like pawns rather than real characters i respect this movie rather than i do view it without this movie and arguably blade the comic book movies that we know today wouldnt have existed or wouldve been drastically different its a good movie but with a lot of flaws however it was just the stepping stone to what would become a great franchise,fantasy
undoubtedly we live in the golden age of superhero movies  in the last several years there have been more superhero movies than ever and the majority of them were big box office successes and the movie which is almost solely responsible for this current situation  the movie because of which the superhero movie fad reemerged after it nearly died in the 90s  is bryan singers 2000 in spite of being considered a low budget movie in the summer blockbuster season managed to earn almost 300 million world wide thus spawning more movies in the franchise and making way for other superhero movies in its own way played an important role in cinematic historyset in the near future follows mutants extraordinary individuals with superhuman powers in their plight to be accepted by the human race there are two notable fractions among the mutants the led by the peaceful intelligent professor charles xavier patrick stewart and the brotherhood of mutants who operate as terrorists and are led by the brilliant but vengeful magneto ian mckellen two mutants  wolverine hugh jackman a former military personnel who cant remember his past and rogue anna paquin a confused teenager  get caught up in the rivalry between the fractions works both as a decent actiondrama movie and a superhero movie what differentiates from other superhero movies is how seriously it deals with its source materials and topics  the topics of homosexuality racism and even americas fear of communism in the hands of another director could have been nothing more than a generic mindless action movie but in the hands of bryan singer himself a homosexual who also worked on the movie as a writer definitely stands out among other superhero moviesfranchises although it deals with serious topics never comes off as preachy it equally portrays two legitimate opposing views  that of charles xavier and that of magneto in spite of magneto being the movies bad guy he makes some interesting remarks about the nature of humans and the audience can easily side with him morally which is unquestionably a sign of a well written villain casting patrick stewart and ian mckellen in their respective roles of charles xavier and magneto was a genius move since both of them give magnificent memorable performances the then actor newcomer hugh jackman doesnt fall behind in his most iconic role to date  that of logan aka wolverineunfortunately not everyone in the movie was on the same acting level as mckellenstewart especially not halle berry whose acting was clingy and awkward and created a very unnatural storm to her defense she did have possibly the worst lines of dialogue in the movie especially the infamous you know what happens when a toad gets struck by lightning line but she still was the weakest link in the acting crew and speaking of dialogue it seemed like throughout the movie the dialogue slowly started deteriorating with the dialogue in the movies third act being sub par to the rest of the dialogue in the movie in addition to that clearly could have benefited from a bigger budget since some of the action sequences in the movie were oddly executed luckily for the audience the sequel x2 learned from its predecessors mistakes and was an even better movierating 710 read more reviews at httppasspopcorncom,fantasy

its hard to believe that back in 2000 marvels first crack at creating a superhero universe on the big screen was a near perfect summer movie 14 years on and the cracks are as clear as day in bryan singers hesitant and rather tame blockbuster dont get me wrong still has plenty to enjoy but the meatier more confident recent efforts such as christopher nolans batman trilogy and marvels own iron man 2008 and thor 2011 as well as the vastly superior sequel two years later form a rather large shadow over professor x and his pupils first outingin the near future evolution has taken a huge leap forward creating mutants  humans with special powers and abilities that defy anything science has seen before tensions between humans and mutants is at an alltime high with the idea of mutant cataloguing being passed around by senator kelly bruce davison despite the efforts of telepaths professor charles xavier patrick stewart and jean grey famke janssen mutant magneto ian mckellen a holocaust survivor with the ability to control anything magnetic has different ideas and plans to induce mutation on world leaders gathering on ellis islandas the machine powered by magnetics could easily kill him magneto seeks rogue anna paquin a young girl with the ability to temporarily steal a mutants power having just met wolverine hugh jackman a beast of a man with a skeleton covered in an indestructible metal which he can shoot out like claws and an uncanny healing ability rogues abduction fails and is foiled by storm halle berry and cyclops james marsden they end up in professor xaviers school for gifted children where wolverine learns about mutant struggle and falls in love with the powerful jean greywith a film this packed with personalities and powers its only natural that it loses its grip on a lot of its characters sensibly the main focus is on wolverine who has always been the most interesting and is perfectly played by jackman a performance that made him a huge star the rest of the characters with the exception of professor x and magneto do little but fall flat they either suffer because their powers arent particularly interesting or spend the duration of the film using what little dialogue they have to explain who they are and what they can do the movie also has one of the worst lines in cinema history uttered by storm youll know it when you hear itfor all its lack of ambition and absence of any real setpieces is still the first of its kind refusing to give in to the idea of comic books being light colourful and mainly for kids which was still the general idea back in 2000 the opening scene depicting a young magneto in a concentration camp ensures this is something that should be taken seriously yet still enjoyed singer grew in confidence and made x2 two years later which is still considered by myself and many others to be one of the best superhero movies ever made x2 showed that the vast ensemble can be given room to breathe and had the setpieces to match and in hindsight makes a much tamer yet still very entertaining animalwwwthewrathofblogblogspotcom,fantasy
marvel first found success with blade in 1998 but their really big breakthrough came when bryan singer directed the first that was the moment that started the renaissance of comic book films and lifted marvel studios from obscurity it wasnt by accident that fueled the mania because this was a production that was taken very seriously it was at once faithful to the comic book a little darker than it and portrayed the characters well without making them ridiculous a good director can bring the most out of even the silliest concept and bryan singer really is a good director it was a courageous step to direct a comic book film after films like the usual suspect and apt pupil but he did a marvelous job it was critically and viewer acclaimed the story opens in a concentration camp in poland 1944 erik lensherr is separated from his parents by the nazis which causes his powers to manifest in the not too distant future a world where both mutants and humans fear each other marie better known as rogue runs away from home and hitches a ride with another mutant known as logan aka wolverine charles xavier who owns a school for young mutants sends storm and cyclops to bring them back before it is too late magneto who believes a war is approaching has an evil plan in mind and needs young rogue to help him is a unique film even in that its very first scene is a nazi death camp even after the many years since its release i get goose bumps during the first scene the film is deep and layered with meaning it shows us how sick the human race still is how intolerant we are with each other by showing us how the mutants are treated luckily singer paid attention to the personality of the characters giving them depth and layers the films three most developed characters are professor x magneto and wolverine the actors playing the three of them take the cake the script is good making sure that the film is never outrageous but rather dark and serious the most unforgettable scenes are the conversations of the two veterans at the beginning and the end the special effects are good but you can tell that it was made in 2000 but its okay because there arent too many action scenes in the film it only has a few mistakes that are things that the die hard fans may not like for instance wolverine being the main character which he isnt in the comics but what can i say hugh jackman australias gift to woman everywhere kind of steals the show or he would if the whole thing wasnt the great mr mckellens one man production singer got it right and could bring out the most he could from the film the first part may not have exploded but it was the perfect lead in singer bit off as much as was chewable doing a perfect job now 14 years after the release date we can say was perfectly placed into his hands cause if he wasnt around marvel most probably wouldnt be where it is today 810 max  httpswwwyoutubecomusersilverscreenreviews1,fantasy
i have seen this film so many times and enjoy it time after time even though this is an original story separate to the comic books i think it works well as the first instalment in this particular sequence of films the story begins with rogue and wolverine and takes them through their journey into the mutant world and meeting the professor x and magneto it also focuses on the at times hostile human interaction with the mutant world setting it up for later film and comic story lineshugh jackman patrick stewart and ian mckellen give strong performances throughout and considering the film is now coming up 1415 years old the special effects are pretty good overall it is definitely worth a watch especially for fans of the original marvel comics though i did enjoy 2 x2 more,fantasy

i remember lining up along fellow marvel fans in dire anticipation of the spectacle that was finally a marvel movie was brought to the big screen with intensity and storyline that would drive the hollywood film industry for the next decade with the exception of the blade franchise which represents more of a minor characters appearance on the big screen marvel fans had only witnessed the disastrous and preposterous films based upon nick fury captain america fantastic four and the punisherin 1989 tim burton demonstrated to the world how comic book movies could be adapted revolutionized and modernized with his creation of batman marvel fans had to wait 11 years to experience this same sensationfrom the futuristic opening credits director bryan singer plunges his audience into the mutant world of thea solid plot which explores the idea of eliminating the mutant problem uncovering wolverines origin and the comparative yet dissimilar perspectives of friends yet enemies magneto and professor xmagneto ian mckellen assembles a modernday brotherhood consisting of a crafty and sinister mystiquea too dumb for his own good sabertoothed and a surprisingly productive toadprofessor x relies on his typical entourage cyclops rogue anna paquin jean grey storm hale berry and ideally cast newcomer wolverine hugh jackman who begins the movie living on the outskirts of society making ends meat as an unbeatable cage fighterhank mccoy the beast is noticeably missing from the team but is still mentioned within the human world as he attempts to fight for mutant equalityoverall the movie delivers dont expect the special effects of 2012 but this movie was certainly ahead of its time solid plot good pace well cast excellent rewatchability factor for comic book fans dont expect the same climactic thunder packed into avengers or the complexity of the more tightly written first class is a good film not a great oneprimarily i recommend this movie basically because of its groundbreaking affect in terms of beginning the dictation of the marvel universe on the silver screen,fantasy
i was always a dc comics fan so i dont have as great a familiarity with the marvel characters but i have to say this was a fairly entertaining film the characters were cool and id say the casting was pretty dead on for the principal players  patrick stewart for charles xavier ian mckellan for magneto and hugh jackman for everyones favorite mutant wolverine i dont think there were any better choices out there halle berry aside from her acting in this flick was also a slick dead ringer for the comic book stormin retrospect the entire concept of the government attempting to legislate mutant behavior seems pretty nonsensical though doesnt it consider senator kelly bruce davison railing about how a powerful mutant may even be able to control ones thoughts does anyone see a problem here if they have that kind of power how effective would civil authorities be in trying to bring them under control you have to look beyond that aspect of human vs mutant behavior if the story is ultimately going to workthe best fun moments for me occurred when wolvie gave cyclops james marsden the middle claw and later on when wolverine commented on the lack of uniforms and cyclops responded what would you prefer yellow spandex mostly an inside joke for marvel fans but ive seen enough comic book covers to know what he was talking about,fantasy
the and spiderman movie series started the ball rolling on comic book movies being mega movie events like they are now prior to the 2000s there was comic book movies but they were more of a novelty then legitimate box office threatsthe quality of the overall production of comic book movies is just drastically higher then ever before youre getting some of the best actors directors writers cinematographers and special effects people participating in the making of these movies now which wasnt always the case when you had dolph lundgren starring in the punisherthis movie has a stellar cast with patrick stewart hugh jackman ian mckellan halle berry rebecca romijn famke janssen anna paquin and bruce davison,fantasy
 is directed by bryan singer and based on marvel comics characters the screenplay is by david hayler and based around uncanny written by stan lee  jack kirby it stars patrick stewart hugh jackman ian mckellen halle berry famke jansen james marsden  anna paquinits a future world where mutants with special powers coexist with humans congress wants to out all mutants magneto wants to form an army of mutants to take over the world but professor xavier wants mutants to only use their powers to do good somethings got to give long in gestation 1989 was when it was first mooted finally made it to the big screen in 2000 with much anticipation and apprehension cast and director changes occurred as did rewrites  reshoots while the film was considerably lean with a running time of just over an hour and half throw into the equation that early in proceedings bryan singer had declared he wasnt really a fan of the source material and the apprehension of marvel fans was understandable nice then that the final product has actually ended up rather goodsinger had been turned around by the comics due to its thematics of prejudice and assimilation the comic was born out of the civil rights movement in fact it was this that also got mckellen on board with the project substitute magneto  xavier with martin luther king  malcolm x and you get the picture the whole theme of the outsiders trying to get onto a level playing field of acceptance is what gives its serious heartbeat sure its fun and you got to have some silliness in a superhero picture but thankfully singer has managed to marry up all the threads to keep it accessible to film watchers of all ageswhere falls down is with its needy reliance on being the first film of a franchise come the midpoint of the film one cant help thinking about the sequel that was always going to come problem number two comes with too many characters purely existing within a short running time the film is dependent on stewart and mckellens battle of wills and jackmans wolverine carrying the weight of the movie that all three men are great softens the blow of knowing next to nothing about the other and their foes credit to singer and his team tho for cloaking a very simple story with an impressive production the sets effects and setpieces are treats for the eyes even if the finale is not as jaw dropping as one reasonably expects of a well budgeted super hero picturebut maybe the point is that the finale is merely a bridge to a second film with that in mind us the viewers get an appetiser relief then that its of the very tasty kind heres hoping that 2 is a delicious main course follow up 710,fantasy
the first superhero movie by bryan singer that i saw was superman returns and i knew at once that here was a director that had all the art to make a good artistic movie but just could not deliver too well on the action front superman returns had some really neat and nice effects but the movie just moved too slow to leave a lasting impression on me same i found with which i repeat i saw after i saw superman returnsthe movie of just fails to weave all the pieces together it is about a group of mutants divided into two sections one led by a good man named xavier a psychic who believes that the powers of the mutants can be used for the good of the mankind and the other section led by magneto a man who believes in condemning humans and needless to say the movie is all about how the bad guys scheme in order to get their work done and somehow the good guys managed to prevent them and no points for guessing  no prominent good guy dies in the endthe special effects are decent but i always believed that there is nothing in this world that can substitute a good old closeup fight cgi rarely manages to give you the impact that a goodold staged fight can give you the best example is the comparison of fight between jackie chans cgi based the medallion and the older movies of chan where he does everything for real none of the fights were truly enjoyable to me and i also do not believe that it is the fact that the fighters are not humans that ticked me off because even in the matrix trilogy the fighters were superhuman but the movie makers managed to add some believable aspect to the moviemaybe just maybe it is possible that for someone who has read the original comic books by marvel might like the movie for it gives them a chance to see their comic book characters come alive but for someone like me who wants the story told from scratch i do not see anything great in this movie the cast is good but the movie is either too short for all of them or maybe too dumb i am again not sure of thatto briefly summarize what i felt about the movie is that it fails to impress there is no character you can sympathize with there is no character whose profile you can construct at the end of movie simply because the movie does not spend any amount of time telling you about anyone anyone watching the movie can easily guess that there has to be a sequel and two more sequels have been released how they score i do not know but i am going to get right to seeing the second and third installments of the movies to see if bryan has been able to do something good to them,fantasy
i saw x men for the first time yesterday i thought it was ok but it could have been much better for one thing the only character who really is developed and explained how he came to be is wolverine for the most part the other mutants cyclops jean grey storm really get no explanation at all as to why they are mutants this film was not very long either so they could have taken a minute or two to explain how each mutant got their powers did they just expect everyone to know each of their back stories i knew a little about x men before seeing this film because i have read some of the comics and also watched the show back in the day but what if someone who had no prior knowledge watched the film they would be lost a little also there are not nearly enough action scenes the fight at the end is quick and not spectacular also wolverine is on screen way more than any of the other x men this really is a wolverine film the scenes with him are nice but they could have shown some other x men as well like cyclops cyclops does not have enough dialogue but i liked the scenes with wolverine those were well done but this is not a film about just wolverine it is titled x men and they do not show enough about each x men maybe they will in the sequel which i will see soon but for the most part this film is too short and should have made more scenes to describe each x men members back story and the action scenes are ok but there are not enough of them not strongly recommended but it is ok five out of ten,fantasy
are they because theyre e and exwomen or because x is such a nifty little letter for scifi and comicbooks kind of like z all ye comicbook nerds reading this feel free to answer me that one i am soooo interested to find outever since mystique entered the picture i found the movie a bit laughable all along i was thinking why magneto i feel very silly using these names simply doesnt send her to impersonate the senator and end the antimutant political propaganda and voila in the end magneto finally realizes that the ol switcheroo can be used to solve their problem with the politician so she does exactly that yawnoh the ol switcheroo its been milked dry  and then some  in star trek and many others so i thought how boring and stupid to have that blue woman changing bodies all the time with her in his arsenal there is no logical reason magneto that dumb name again shouldnt win this war in a flash especially when faced against a pathetic pacifist patrick stewartwere told that mutants have special powers fine however we were never told that they all have far superior iqs which they must have because both stewart and magneto oh are scientifically far ahead of the rest of mankind what with their fancy little laboratories starwarslike spaceships and other gadgetson the other hand why nitpick i forget that this is just a dumb comicbook adaptation unnecessarily trying to be darki see a lot comedic potential in this for example rogue she stunscomatoseskills whomever she touches she has three encounters with wolfy which kind of started to get funny by the time they touched each other on the eiffel tower sorry the statue of libertyall in all watchable but far from thrillingi found the messages of tolerance a little pathetic  in a damn kiddie comicbook action yarn,fantasy
enter hugh jackman as wolverine enter ian mckellen as magneto enter patrick stewart as professor xavier enter halle berry as storm with a cast like that how could any movie go wrong the answer it cant i fell hooklineandsinker for this movie the moment i saw how awesome magnetos metalwarping powers were portrayed this movie doesnt limit his powers at all allowing him to snatch hundreds of bullets out of thin air simultaneously and use a small metal plate to cross huge open chasms last but certainly not least is the fact that magneto is portrayed by as far as i am concerned one of the greatest actors of all timeian mckellen while mckellens masterful role as gandalf in lord of the rings was undoubtedly his crowning achievement mckellens portrayal of magneto is a close second he is charismatic domineering and yet has a shed of humanity left in hima remnant of what he once was i dont mean to spend so much time on magneto and i normally dont like villainous characters that much but there is just no way around it magneto made the movie certainly patrick stewart as professor x and hugh jackman as wolverine contributed greatly as well and halle berrys portrayal of storm was flawless overall this movie is the whole package dont miss it,fantasy
i enjoy certain comic book characters on film notably the batman begins film because i like the way it comes close to being realistic i also enjoyed spiderman and the superman filmsi was never a reader of x men comic books and admittedly knew little about the characters before watching the film i knew the characters had powers due to genetic mutations and they lived in a school for such mutants but not much elseto me there were too many characters and the story was fairly typical and what you would expect there wasnt any elements of this film that made me say wow the story was predictableif you are a fan of the x men comic books or if you like a good popcorn movie you will probably enjoy this however if you are not familiar with the characters from the comic book and enjoy a more complex story and rich character development this may not be worth your time rating 5 of 10 stars,fantasy
i have to say this film sucks x2 was a hell of a lot better than this and x3 blew the both of them right out of the water a question remains about this film what the hell has to be my 2nd fav comic series right after spiderman and right before hulk thank god the next two were awesome that seems to be the thing with marvel films they always improve with sequels except the blade series which sucked all the way through hopefully the next prequels wont suck like this one i guess i give this film at least a c but i was still very disappointed with the film altogether you did youre best on this one singer it just wasnt good enough,fantasy
i really disliked this film acting was not good characters were not portrayed well visually script was a mess halle berry was way over the top for storm too much focus trying to cash in on wolverine popularity for the first half of the moviefailed to deliver next to greats like spidermanmagneto looks nothing like his comic self cyclops was good but rarely uses his powers everyone was way too shy on using there powers there was no robots or humans hunting them down like in the comics it was mutants save the world from other mutants whereas in the comics its man kind fears mutants an its a 3 way battle,fantasy
 is a very good stylish exciting comicbook movie which is a positive thing considering the last big superhero flick released before this one was uh batman  robin this first movie featuring stan lees children of the atom is not based on a particular story with the exception of the characters origins as director bryan singer uses a plot almost entirely made from scratch to introduce us to a new world the mutant onethe setting is the united states in a soontocome future mutants people born with a genetic alteration the so called xgene which gives them superhuman abilities are becoming more and more common unfortunately the rest of humanity fears them and some even try to destroy them this brings us to the current situation charles xavier patrick stewart and his students the which include storm halle berry cyclops james marsden and jean grey famke janssen think peace is possible his old friend magneto ian mckellen on the other hand is firmly convinced war is inevitable since he already has witnessed genocide hes jewish and his parents were killed in auschwitz as such he and his allies the brotherhood of mutants will not allow us senator robert kelly bruce davison to pass the mutant registration act and the only thing that can stop them is xaviers students plus two new mutants the clawwearing virtually invincible wolverine hugh jackman and the powerstealing rogue anna paquinthe comic books have always been an interesting scifi oriented reflection on such concepts as racism and alienation a theme that emerges quite vividly throughout singers filmography his previous movie apt pupil dealt with a lonely kid who forms a morbid bond with a former nazi in particular xavier and magneto are seen as the mutant versions of martin luther king and malcolm x  two people who respect each other but choose to respectfully disagree on how to deal with specific problems the movie takes this one step further by highlighting the philosophical and moral contradiction of magneto an auschwitz survivor trying to prevent a new extermination by causing another one himself the role is made even more ironic by the fact that mckellen played the nazi in apt pupilalongside the thematic relevance singer also has to deliver in terms of action and deliver he does thanks to a spectacular third act which features the kind of iconic moments fans will love instantly that being said the film does have a defect and thats the plot being structured as if it were the pilot episode of a tv show in fairness though several first installments are written that way but less directly or as patrick stewart put it an extended trailer in which all the main characters except for a couple of villains are thoroughly introduced so that the audience will understand who they are and what they do then again such a move is justified by the solid cast the director has assembled stewart and mckellen were a quality guarantee from the getgo and everyone else complies as well particularly jackman and paquin the outsiders who act as our guides in this new exciting cinematic universeso entirely satisfying it may not be but the first is the film that effectively started the new wave of intelligent aboveaverage comic book movies and that can only be considered a good thing,fantasy

normally im not a fan of comic books or the movies that are derived from it but because this movie got such a high rating on imdb i watched it anyway and im sorry that i did i should have known better this movie really wasnt what i was looking for its story is very predictable and poor all it has to offer is a fight about freedom between good and evil saying that people from minority groups are never understood and always feared by others yes you might see some political messages in this movie im sure most americans love this because they still believe that their nation is the only good one in the world and that they have to protect the others from the evil ones all i could think was oh come on youve got to be kidding me there has got to be something better after this scene but there wasnt the only thing that i liked were the special effects i have to admit that they were nice to watch but that wasnt enough for me to like this movie no unless you are an ultrarepublican american or a big fan of comic books you better leave this movie on the shelve i wont watch it again i give it a 510 only because of the special effects,fantasy
this isnt exactly my type of film but i thought id watch it anywayi thought it was an alright film i dont want to use the word cheesy but a few of the bits got me thinking okay then i must add i thought all the acting was good jackman was good better than van helsing stewart and mckellan are both good as the two leaders and the rest behind themthe standout thing ill remember from the film was a great performance by anna paquin i thought she reminded me of someone but turns out i havent seen any of her other films but she was gooda 510 for me im afraid but 910 for annadave,fantasy
the movie was not what i had hoped to be although im not a diehard fan i still grew watching the 1992 cartoon and consider myself fairly familiar with the franchise having that said i must concluded that this movie was not what i had hoped and expected it to bethere are several things which i didnt liked about the movie one of them is the visual style i dont know but it was just all to dark for me it didnt had a comic book feeling like movies as spiderman hulk and batman all had the uniforms also bothered me yes i would had preferred yellow spandex inside movie joke the movie also wasted too much time on character development and some characters are highly underused mainly storm and jean greyi must say that let the movie mainly focus on wolverinelogan was brilliant for me wolverine always was the most interesting character in the cartoon its too bad that they changed rogues character so intensely its not that its not a good character its just that i preferred the cartoon rogueone last thing that disappointed me was the musical score by michael kamen it lacked a good main theme and while it is a fairly good score on its own it is not really fitting the moviebut yet again i make it sound like this is a bad movie no its not a bad movie its far from it the special effects are great and never overused there are some spectacular fights and action sequences although the entire end fight was slightly disappointing for me the movie in general is also too shortthe entire movie was very well casted ian mckellen patrick stewart hugh jackman were all brilliantly cast it was especially hugh jackman who was simply perfect in his role hugh jackman  wolverineall in all it was not what i had hoped it to be but it still is a very entertaining well cast movie with some spectacular moments very well worth watching710httpbobafett1138blogspotcom,fantasy
fantasy and science fiction films and literature are a personal favourite but this film isntmy dissatisfaction derives from three sourcesfirst the film is very dull there is a great deal of philosophising indeed a great deal of talk of all kinds then when the action finally arrives it is distressingly predictable one can hear the minds of the writers ticking over their minds obviously never ran faster than idle  pun intended well lets see this mutant has this set of powers so lets invent a situation that allows him to save the day ok thats him done now lets invent a different situation for the next mutant to solve and the next and the nextand the next oh no even writing these words makes the film live  or rather die  again in my mindthe second problem is the central premise the mutants are going to replace us and i am supposed to be happy about this to cheer for them forget itfinally there is the problem of the constant promotion of liberal doctrine thou shalt be tolerant thou shalt not be racist thou shalt worship diversity  and on and on and on and on hey with that kind of repetition i could be a scriptwriter  well for the films anyway yes we get it  the mutants and their situation are a metaphor for racism in our society and they represent what we are told will be the future  the supposedly desirable mixing of races into an eventual universal racial homogeneitythis repetitive political message has no place in a popular entertainment movie and can only detract from the enjoyment of the audience alright there isnt much entertainment in this film anyway but this propaganda just makes it worse its not the message thats the problem specifically  its the endless dull repetition and the fundamental objection to indoctrination in entertainment i would have the same objection regardless of the nature of the message being promotedwatching such films only makes me more aware of the increasing similarities between western societies and those of such countries as saudi arabian china or north korea very different countries very different beliefs  yet they all have a lack of individual freedom in common and a media that knows its place a media that only creates productions that promote the politically correct doctrine of the homeland you doubt the similarities well when was the last time you saw a production from western media that promoted the idea that homosexuality is undesirable that immigration is bad that racial interbreeding should be avoided that women should have more children instead of pursuing a career  or even that women are not as strong or physically able as men its not that i agree with these ideas  or disagree with them my views are irrelevant the point is that many people both inside and outside the western world do hold some or all of these views indeed at least one of these views women are not as strong or physically able as men is held almost universally yet how often is the exact opposite view portrayed in the western media with women outmuscling and outfighting men my concern is that ideas that do not conform to politically correct doctrine are not allowed to be portrayed this is not freedom  it is totalitarianism we are on a dangerous path and is one of the signposts pointing the wayok rant over you get the point  i really dont like this film with more imagination less proselytizing and a storyline that didnt contain the central premise that we should cheer for our own destruction could have been so much morean opportunity lostrating  2510,fantasy
thats what professor xavier patrick stewart captain picard of star trek the next generation fame said of human beings in a scene ultimately deleted from the theatrical film but used in one of the trailersbased on the popular marvel comic book this somewhat overlong surprisingly unaction packed but not completely uninteresting film chronicles the exploits of runaway misfit rogue a miscast anna paquin before she acquires the powers of flight and super strength and brawling loner logan aka wolverine hugh jackman in the role that made him a star and their crossing paths with the and joining them to help thwart magnet master magnetos ian mckellan gandalf of the lord of the rings trilogy evil scheme to mutate human beings so that all life on earth can be united in commonly being mutants then again unification doesnt sound quite so bad after all magnetos reasoning of course is that there can no longer be prejudice against mutants if everyone is a mutant ironically as this film depicts it mutants will eventually inherit the earth anyway because they are after all the next step in human evolutionand in real life the mutants probably would have taken over the world by now but for the sake of drama mutants are made just slightly less powerful enough to keep them from completely taking over the worldnow this isnt a bad film but as a comic book fan im not sure i like it as a comic book adaptation hugh jackman is a capable albeit less bad ass and less gruff wolverine and patrick stewart  ian mckellan are well cast and well matched as professor x  magneto but the film is too tightly focused on the overly popular wolverine character to give enough space for character development for the other james marsden is already too young to be an effective cyclops but its even harder to gage his acting ability when he has so little to say and do halle berry and famke janssen make the most of their roles as storm  jean grey respectively tyler mane is an imposing saber tooth and rebecca rstamos is hard to ignore as the blue shape shifter mystique ray park darth maul of phantom menace is just annoying as toadthe special effects are bright and colorful but there isnt enough action to go along with it the are also made down right pathetic during their fight with the obnoxious toad character that is when storm isnt blowing stuff at him and zapping him with lightningall in all i preferred the animated series fox had back in 1992 the sequel is an improvement of sorts,fantasy
this movie was too much hype for a mediocre movie  the holocaust scene atthe beginning is just down rigth depressing and it satys with you the entire movie  good end sequences  everything before that sucked really badly  i recommend spider man if you want to see a good comic book movie and that got nominated for an oscar  shame on you ian mckellen youre better than this  i highly recommend the sequel x2 x men united  a major improvement over this rubbish,fantasy
x  men actors as hugh jackman patrick stewart halle berry famke janssen and ian mckellen cooperates in this limit exploding action packed adventure that is really out of the ordinarystory logan is living on the edge and earns some cash on kicking ass in cage  battles logan understands that he has got some very special abilities and soon he gets hooked up into a school for mutants that are by many meant to threathen man kind logan or wolverine starts fighting side by side with other mutants like storm cyclops and jean grey and soon they have to start an war against magneto and his mutantsjackman kicks ass in this movie as the part as cold and frustrated wolverine and there is more stunning combat on the statue of liberty  world war ii flashback  awesome effects and more bryan singer has after the great usual suspects falled into the shadows but now he returns big and after this blockbuster he fast decided to make an sequel the directing is superb and so is music producing acting and mood with a interesting story the movie brings you into a special universe filled of supernatural happenings and i urge you too see it entertaining explosive cool and pretty awesome some times yes i coming superhero  classicyou can forget about batman spiderman and superman when wolverine and storm enters the scene with undispensable excitement and high dramatics you really get dragged with the flow the cartoon x  men hvehad enormous success and when the film got released on the cinemas people ran to see it  and that with good reason the music composed by michael kamen smacks you threw it with great suspense and techno inspired melody brutally good the dark mood that covers the characters threw the sequences makes it all fascinating and a bit odd feeling and it is after all very good stars  45,fantasy
i just watched for the 10th time or so i think its a great movie and im a huge fan of bryan singers work however this film contains some of the most stupid sentences ive ever heard in a film for instance in the scene where the are captured by magneto in the statue of liberty storm says that she saw senator kelly die magneto answers are you sure you saw what you saw i mean what were they thinking another major one is at the point when storm is about to fry toad its so idiotic you probably all remember do you know what happens to a toad when its struck by lightening the same thing that happens to everything else i have not yet seen x2 but i sure hope the dialogue has improved since the first moviemikkel drewsen snderborg denmark,fantasy
directed by  brian singer written by  david hayter  tom desanto and bryan singerstarring  hugh jackman  patrick stewart  anna paquin  ian mckellen and famke janssenbefore i begin i should say that i am quite unrelated with the universe  i have never read comics and the only character i knew apart from the celebrated worldwide wolverine  was cyclops  i can understand that the film by brian singer followed accurately the story and the origin of the characters so the fans liked the movie  unfortunately the film hasnt got much to offer to the rest of the scifi and comics  transferred  to  celluloid aficionados  the 73  rating is too much and i dont care about how much some fans will protest  but comparing to classics like superman or batman is an insult  i have already written in my mortal kombat annihilation review read it if you like that it is strictly for well knowing fans of the video game and the rest are advised to keep away because most probably they will be lost  s fatal flaw is the same  too many characters in one short movie  but where at least mka had wonderful fight scenes and some decent sfx  fails miserably not only actionwise but the character development is also a letdown  now  i would like to think that the deleted scenes which are included in the dvd will improve the unfinished elements but only time will tell  for now  the official cut is disappointing  dont believe the hype  is an ok film but really nothing special  the critics for once again are proven to be wrong  there is actually nothing that differentiates the film from other ones  the comments about adult themes and futuristic imagery make me want to laugh  batman 1989 had much more adult atmosphere and movies like dark city or even demolition man deal much better with social and political issues than this latest cinematic adaptation of the famous characters  cannot hide its comics origins and it is not as dark as the official critics alleged  it definitely doesnt reach an intellectual level plot synopsis   the not so distant future  in the usa there is a great number of mutants  although it is never explained how the mutations occurred  it is probably due to perturbations of dna the mutants have some amazing superpowers which have caused people to be afraid of them  the mutants cannot live ordinary lives and try to hide their secret because they now that a disclosure will ostracize them from society for good  as if this wasnt enough  a senator called robert kelly bruce davison has started a campaign against mutants and wants to confine them so their superpowers will not be a threaten to society  unbeknownst to his plans  there is a powerful mutant who is also a wise scientist  professor charles xavier patrick stewart with enhanced telekinetic and telepathic abilities ironically he is stuck in a wheelchair  professor xavier aka professor x has founded an occluded academy for mutant children  he teaches them how to use the powers they have and learn how to control them  he is an idealist and believes that some day the mutants will be incorporated as a healthy tissue of the society along normal humans  there is also another equally powerful mutant scientist eric lensherr aka magneto with the ability to manipulate metal objects within a remarkable range and scale with exceptional timing and synchrony  magneto ian mckellen believes that a war is coming and he wants to exterminate humans before they get the chance to strike first  professor x and magneto were old friends  but now their philosophies are bound to clash  professor xs key assistants in the academy are scott summers james marsden alias cyclops whose eyes emit deadly energy blasts  orore munroe halle berry alias storm with the ability to control thunders and air and dr jean grey famke janssen a skilled scientist with limited telekinetic and telepathetic powers  the basic star of the film is actually wolverine a brilliant hugh jackman a mysterious man with amnesia who has the power to heal himself rapidly from serious injuries he meets with a mutant girl called mari d ancanto anna paquin alias rogue who has an energydraining ability and her touch can be deadly  when the two of them are attacked by magneto s henchmen they are rescued by cyclops and storm and are taken in the academy for security  rogue is adjusted easily and makes new friends but wolverine doesnt want to stay despite professor xs warnings that magneto is after him  predictably more fights among the and magneto s gang will ensue this is the socalled plot of the movie  the first half hour before we enter the academy is extremely weak and boring  if you are not familiar with you will not understand much  towards the end there is a master plan by magneto but it is a desperate and futile attempt to create a plot where there isnt there any  so what happens in between  first of all magneto is not evil and his henchmen are ugly and repelling freaks with lousy makeup  mystique s blue body is cheaply made and disgusting  the villains are not interesting  on the side things are not better  storm a woefully underdeveloped halle berry and cyclops hardly ever use their powers  even worse they are decorative  the entire movie looks cheap i don t care how much money it cost but it looks cheap  most of the sfx are nothing special and i was expecting better from a 2000 newtech film  i have seen better sfx from older movies superman or tv shows  mystique s shapeshifting  cyclops s red rays or even magneto s white lightemitting device are cheap and could be included in a 1970 s bmovie  what i liked was storm s abilities to fly and control the weather but as i already said she hardly uses them  most of the fight scenes are also disappointing  as for character development forget it  patrick stewart was an ideal choice for the role but even he is not given much to do except from reciting his history to wolverine  the interesting characters are dr jean grey and rogue famke janssen and anna paquin try valiantly but suffer from a shallow script  there are also cameos from pyro a young man with pyrokinetic abilities  the well known iceman and kitty pride   a girl who can pass through walls with momentary dematerialization  who are all students at the academy  i guess we will have to wait for the next film to see their characters stretched out  professor x  storm  cyclops  dr jean grey and rogue have great potential and worth more screen time  this is another great problem of the film apart from the cheap sfx  the leads are never given origin or motives  they simply are there and act mechanistically  is clearly an introductory film and it leaves you wanting for more  as for the messages about racism and the obvious parallelism to mac carthys politics  cute and welcomed but havent we really seen it all over again in other films  so this is not an innovation there is one thing i liked and of course this is hugh jackman as wolverine  the man was born for to play this role  wolverine is the lead of the movie  his claws is the most convincing sfx and he is the most developed character  in the future we will probably dig up more information about his past and how he obtained his powers  hugh jackman gives a great performance and survives the script s flaws  on the acting side famke janssen  anna paquin and the ever reliable patrick stewart give solid appearances despite the onedimensional roles  has this film any other virtues  quite a few i am afraid  the academy s scenery is quite psychedelic and who can forget the scene with wolverine walking through the corridor with the mirrors  some of the costumes are also nice  jackman and paquin share an interesting quasierotic chemistry  i also liked bruce davison as the congressman and i believe he should be used more  and no matter how cheaply directed and unoriginal  the final showdown between and magneto s mutants succeeds in being memorablein conclusion is not a great movie  brian singer is definitely an overrated director usual suspects was also ok but nothing great but i have sincere hopes that the sequel will be better  if however you are sucker for comics  movies like i am see it  it is not batman but it is not howard the duck either x  men        7  10ps    in case you wonder about the corny line  do you know what happens to a toad when it is hit by a thunder   what happens to everything else  this wasnt in the script  the rational explanation comes from the original version  the plausible answer is  it croaks,fantasy
there have been a lot of comments here from people who loved the comic books  well i used to read comic books but actually i never liked i dont know why its nothing i could put my finger on  i just didnt like the general plotlinelikewise i cant really point out why i didnt like this movie  im never impressed by fancy expensive effects so those didnt save it for me  i just didnt like it  but most people did so if you havent seen it yet give it a try,fantasy
this movie is one of the most hollywood washed down heartless films in which to ever make a huge profit not only did the movie itself suck but they had to go out and make another sequal to supply to the dumbed down mind of the american youths of the 00s the screen play just might be the worst one i have ever  ever seen and halle barreys character states quite possible the worst line in big budget cinema history do you know what happends to a toad when it gets struck by lightning the same thing as everyone else  that by far is the worst line ever delivered by an oscar winner what crap not only does the script suck but so does the acting the acting is horrible and i know in a movie like this the acting is not suppose to mean that much but when you have a cast ensomble as patrick stewart anna paquin halle barrey and hugh jackman you would expect better acting than the high school amateur ability that was shown in this film at points in this movie i found myself laughing at how bad the acting and script was though the special effects looked cool this movie still sucked and is what is wrong with the movie industry today and now this summer we are going to be giving nothing but sequals which will mostly all suck because movies such as makes a killing even though it sucks,fantasy
im not an buff by any means but i do read comics though i prefer vertigo to marvel and i love bryan singers the usual suspects so i was expecting a lot from this movie i really hoped that this would finally be the movie that takes comics seriously and takes them to the next level sadly it isnt as comic adaptations go its one of the better ones but thats not high praise as most of them stink not being a fan i didnt mind that some details were played around with but i did think that the script left a bit to be desired the bruce davidson character and the mccarthy witchhunt aspects of the plot were heavyhanded and obvious and basically all the potentially interesting ideas raised throughout the movie were never explored maybe if singer had asked his talented former collaborator christopher mcquarrie to write the script things would have been meatier and less predictable i dont know i did like the way the movie didnt get bogged down in origin stories or flashbacks something that usually drags these kinds of movies down but really runs out of steam in the last third with an anticlimatic finale that fails to satisfy plus the movie is blatantly left open for the inevitable sequels and this comes across as a very cynical move the best thing about the film is the casting of patrick stewart and ian mckellen as professor x and magento respectively both are much better than the weak material they have to work with hugh jackman as wolverine and famke janssen as drjean grey were both good but the rest of the cast were pretty dull especially halle berry as storm who might as well not have been in it  so a missed opportunity all round that is adequate but not much more i hope the sequel is a big improvement but im not holding my breath,fantasy
i have seen lots and lots of bad movies in my short life im 16 but this is surely one of the worst everything in this picture is out of order the plot is totally idiotic and its not even original when i was younger watched the tv series from time to time and they were at least interesting but this movie seems it wasnt based on the tv serie but on a trash can i have seen the movie almost two years ago so i dont remember exactly what the plot was i only remember it was awful i only remember that here we have wolverine as the lead character and that we learn how he got into the academy of mutant or whatever it wasperformances are indeed bad hugh jackman gaves a ridiculous and boring performance as wolveine and the others such as halle berry anna paquin and james marsden ian mckellen dissapointed me  he did very good movies like the lord of the rings fellowship of the ring that was excellent compared to the sequel ttt that sucks and he also did gods and monsters i dont know why he is so bad in this one another dissapointment was famke janssen who was excellent in goldeneye and good in rounders here shes plain badthe most irracional thing for me is that the guy who directed one of my favorite movie the usual suspects has directed this crap and oh no  he has also directed the sequel of this socalled movie yucksgood stunts and the ok performance of patrick stewart cant make up for all its flaws i warn you dont see this movie in fact try to avoid any contact with it 110,fantasy
it was alright i didnt really liked the show when it was on so i dont understand how i thought the movie was ok but whatever i saw it at a drive in with my parents and all i can say is i reccomend it for kids they might have liked it more then me but who knows all i say is dont go see it u probably already have but yeah well byeeee,fantasy
im a reasonably loyal fan of the comic so i went in wanting to like this a lot but it came off as not quite translating thes actual appeal to be fair the film is burdened with setting up the groundwork for the characters and their factions though in truth the conflict between xavier and magneto isnt the most compelling aspect of the story and didnt seem particularly engaging in its depiction here i would have liked to see a little more character interaction and a little less matrixlite action some of the casting choices could have been given more thought as well if you were underwhelmed by the movie but are still interested in the story id recommend the graphic novels god lovesman kills and the dark phoenix saga,fantasy
its always nice to see a superhero tale told with an amount of respect shown to the source material rather than taking the easy route to campy humour and frivolity the one of marvel comics most popular titles if not the most popular concerns itself with a group of young mutants using their powers to protect humankindthe movie focuses on two of the more interesting characters as they discover their powers come to terms with being ostracised from society and eventually find a home at professor xaviers school for gifted children from where the launch their missions to protect mankindmuch of the casting is inspired patrick stewart would have been a popular choice for professor xavier if it had gone to a vote anyway but shakespearian thesp sir ian mckellen turns up in the unlikely role of a costumed supervillain he pulls it off in fine style as for the themselves hugh jackman was a great choice for the pivotal wolverine character and halle berrys icycool storm was perfect as always though berry seems to be underused a shame as shes a great actress anna paquins youthful rogue was cute but didnt seem to have much to do except play a hapless captive hopefully shell get her chance to kick some ass in the sequel janssen and marsden were fine as jean grey and cyclops but they seemed to be secondary characters again maybe therell be more for them to do second time aroundas far as the sequel goes hopefully well be getting more action as the necessary exposition about the mutants and their world is now out of the way its slightly disappointing that well be seeing the same villains again as apart from magneto himself they were a little drab for all her lithe sexiness romijnstamoss mystique was little more than the dull old shapeshifting villain and manes sabretooth nothing but a bumbling musclehead ray park seemed to be having fun as toad though and itll be worth seeing more of this particular villain one of the best movie adaptations of a comic book then and we should be looking forward to an exciting sequel next year,fantasy
 was a pleasant surprise first things  i do not usually like action movies definitely not ones on comic book heroes however was slickly made tight and best of all short a lot of style singer doesnt let the weak story get in the waynothing great on the acting front or even the special effects its just that the little bits all add upto one slick flick the dialogues are short and snappy like they should be in all good action movies esp considering their target audienceall the big hooplah towards the climax is pretty grating but i guess ull live through them again  short singer knows his audience well a toprate action moviea spicy 8,fantasy
oh  well i knew that movie was judged as boring but in fact i didnt expected such a mess of movie the whole story just surrounded some special effects of whom most appeared such often in the movie that they started to get boring tothe actors were poor and stereotypes  and since i didnt know the comics or any animated series i have seen the movie as it should have been judged as without regarding anything else and without preferences i just dont like it if anyone really knows why all of the world seems to love this movie id love to know why,fantasy
i went in to this movie wanting to like it but after movies like battlefield earth and mission impossible 2 i thought hollywood would spoil another good thing luckily it didnt although i would like to know what fottage they supposedly cut to reduce it to less than 2 hours i liked the movie and it was well acted and the special effects didnt take presidence over the story like a certain star wars movie from last summer i left the theatre wanting more i only wish we could have found out more of the characters pasts and alittle more team effort instead of wolverine and rogue getting most of the screen time i wanted more of storm and cyclops and more scenes with xaviar and magneto perhaps in the next one hats off to brian singer for giving us an intelligent action filmsomething we dont see much of anymore,fantasy
am i getting too old to see certain movies that are out of my realm of possibly liking  or did this movie just stink on iceeither way i had a perfectly mediocre time watching it  hugh jackman reminded me of goat boy the character created by jim breuer on saturday night live  james marsden looked like levar burton in his star trek getup and anna paquin looked like she was doing the french lieutenants woman for the high school play  i had to conjure up something to keep myself entertainedits not that i was expecting this to change my life or anything but it would have been nice to have been left with one memory of what i saw when it was done  i am glad most of you enjoyed it  i think the best movies are the ones people like whether they are good or not is secondary  i just cant join the majority this time,fantasy
one of the highest budget most boring movies of the year the stunts were awful see crouching tiger for great stunts and the characters absurd worse than the batman villains a competent cast and poor directing couldnt make this film interesting although it did do well at the box office as most comic book movies do,fantasy
bruce wayne vocal diaryhaving just seen the movie i feel as if i have a deeper understanding of these controversial public figures and their dangerous terrorist antagonists couldnt get professor xs opinion on the movie fictionalized from their battle with peace bigotry and equal rights but needless to say some of the actors used arent very flattering to the actual members as i know them per se halle berry shes a very beautiful actress but the real storm is a little exotic looking kind of like vanessa williams i suppose its the african blood the only actress i know who comes close to the beautiful jean grey is nicole kidman and rogue is flattered by anne paquins portrayal but the rogue i know looks more like a cross between brooke shields and carmen electra toad and mystique are a lot more sinister looking in the movie than their truer counterparts but the mystique i know isnt quite that sexy otherwise the similarities are rather precise there i go ramblingbut then im still irked at those val kilmer and george clooney movies  continuing the movie is a very dark and sometimes lighthearted adventure somewhat patterned after the style of the recent batman films of recent so im sure theyll be some sort of sequel this bryan singer seems to display the same artful repertoire of joel schumacher and tim burton the violence is played down for a more action feeli wonder how the video store clerks are going to label this movieaction fantasy the masses who go to these movies have predominantly declared views that are mixed on the exemplary special effects and the less than satisfactory script the true stars of the movie are the costumes and less so the actors in them the televisions flash and lois and clark being good examples of when the costumes carry the entertainment stillthe movie is a big departure from when all heroes wore spandex that adam west television show still gives me nightmares to this day yetthe hulk still speaks fondly of lou ferrigno the movie fortunately has a very realistic feel unlike the campy atmosphere seen in the generation x television pilot and the spiderman television series memo remind alfred to pick up copy of vhs as soon as it is available,fantasy
spawn is a dark and humorous comic book that totally rocks the film contains none of the pathos imagination or spirit that the comic book had its main fault is that it was toned down for a young audience and had to many cgi fx suffers from exactly the same problem there is very very little or action and what little there is is very tame and stolen from other movies matrix t2 nothing much happens for long periods of time the dialogue is nothing but mumbojumbo and there are plot holes all over the place professor x can sense the presence of mutants from far away but cannot notice a bad mutant walking all over his house duhthe ending was ridiculous it was completely senseless and did not impress me one iota the word contrivance echoed around in my head if the whole scene had been set on the roof of a supermarket instead of the statue of libertywould it be cool of course the reason it is on the big statue is because magneto wants to turn a bunch of people into mutants with what looks like a giant whisk uhyeahthats inspired anna paquin was competent enough jackman was pretty cool stewart was picardish jansen was underused mckellen was campy as hell and james marsden was as woodenly wooden as he was in gossip and disturbing behavior thank mother nature he only had about 2 lines of dialoguei cannot think of any reason why this trash is in the imdb top 250 it stinks perhaps fans of the comic book who were so disappointed with the film gave it 1010 because they felt they owed it to the me i just wasted my money,fantasy
the is is ok if you like seeing hollywood trash everything in the animates series and comicsi watch the animates series on fox the storyline was lame the acting wooden and it seemed to remind of several comics turned movies like bladejudge dreddthe phantomsuperman 1234 and batman 1234 if you have seen any if these movies this movie is basically any comic book turned into a big screen movie for its fans the special effects were at times  they could of done a better a job as for the people in the movie where the following beastjubille and gambiti hear the cast is supposed to make two or more sequelsbet they have a contract and have to make them lets see if maybe the indie movie market can make a better movie off a comic book rather than mainstream hollywood if you want to see this movie fineit just belong in the same caterogy as gone with the wind it aint no classic more like a bgrade comic movie done over and over againi bet this movie will on videodvd by christmas 2000i can only hope the dvd has more stuff like delated parts than in the theater run,fantasy
the story is just not good enough for thinking people which all of us should be eh i mean just escaping from humans because they are all against mutants is what the film is about and it does not work if this movie contained anything more than special effects it could perhaps stand on its legs but now its sadly just limpingi put my hope in ai the film that stanley kubrick was to direct now let us all pray steven spielberg does the trick,fantasy
first admittedly i went to see this movie after scores of people told me of its greatness after not expecting much  then i in turn went to see it expecting greatness  what an awful movie  this really is standard bigbudget hollywood garbage plus the added bonus of the loosened grip on reality that comic book based movies afford us where pray tell does a school for the gifted turn out the kind of money necessary for all the insanely hightech crap involved here  i wont go on about the absurdities of the story but we have here a movie long on generic cgi short on plausible plot,fantasy
i didnt think another comic book based movie could be as bad as george clooneys batman and robin  but i saw it last night when i wasted my time watching the  this movie is in a word  dreadful the dialogue is extremely weak the acting is average the only thing that is good in this film is the eyecandy the effects but even the effects just cant make this bad film worth the premium price of a movie ticket hopefully there wont be money wasted on a sequel,fantasy
well i wasnt expecting to love it  and i didnt  it had a few cool effects and a few cool characters  but for the most part i found myself a bit bored  i didnt think the film makers really went as far with it as they could have  but it was entertaining enough although i dont know how happy i am to have paid 900 for the experience,fantasy
if you are familiar with the comicsee it  it will be the most exciting film you see this summer  if your not familiarforget it   it will be the most boring film ever made  this movie is nothing without special effects,fantasy
there were some nice fx and the acting was okay  the plot was pretty thin but the biggest problem i found with the film was the lack of continuity between the movie and the comic book  there are too many instances elaborate on  i suppose that marvel made the movie accessible for people who have no knowledge of the comic  in that case i suppose it was alright but im an oldschool fan of the  this movie did not do the comic book justice,fantasy
i must admit i was really scared that i would be disappointed but nope this film is really something for the fans some missing characters colossus nightcrawler and some changes in the characters age a young rouge young icemanstill this is a must see if you like marvel comics just hoping that the sequel will be just as good perhaps with juggernaut as another member of the brotherhood of evil mutants  btw patrick stewart is perfect as xavier,fantasy
at first i didnt want to see this movie becuase i thought another mortal kombat or stupid comic book adapation i was wrong and right the first 12 hour kept me interested and wanting more but everything after that had me saying when will this end their is too many charcter develpments as if we care and not enough action the action comes at the end to save the likeness of the movie but it cant save my thought,fantasy
 fails in its bid to entice viewers into some general interest the action looks unrealistic the plot merely stupid and the acting abysmal a complete waste of time even typical xers will find fault in this ridiculous film the moviedont see it,fantasy
worst movie i ever saw most disturbing was the applause from the audience at the films end,fantasy
one of the neverending debates about popular culture is whether it reflects the times or dictates them  i tend toward the former view and comic books are no exceptions to this rule  batman and superman the popular comic book heroes of the 30s and 40s came during the depression and wwii where people wanted largerthanlife heroes to look up to  whereas in the 60s and 70s when society was becoming ripped apart and people were feeling confused and didnt trust society comic book heroes like spiderman and the fantastic four who had as many everyday problems as they did evil ones were the popular heroes  square in that tradition are thei was only a casual reader of the comics when i grew up it was more the excellent animated series of several years back i became a fan of  it was on late at night and the times shifted around so i couldnt always watch but i enjoyed watching the adventures of professor x storm wolverine rogue and the others and how they struggled to find their place in the world and to help other mutants do the same  now director bryan singer and a host of writersin addition to credited writers singer tom desanto and david hayter writers including john logan christopher mcquarrie ed solomon and joss whedon took a whack at it have delivered their version of and im pleased to say it deliversone of the reasons it works is singer his usual director of photography newton thomas sigel and production designer john myhre eschew the usual look of comic book films  even though this is set in the futurethe near future everything looks close to like it is todayexcept of course magnetos hideout and professor xaviers school  this emphasizes even more the alienation mutants feel from society  and while there are visual effects used in both the battles and when the show their stuffespecially mystique they dont come at the expense of the story but serve itsome have complained the film is overly serious as if being a comic book automatically meant it wasnt worth taking seriously  yes singer is making parallels to bigotry today with some direct antecedentsthe antimutant senator robert kelly is clearly modeled on joe mccarthy magneto is a holocaust survivor and he quotes malcolm x near the end  by any means necessary  which also suggests professor xavier is parallel to martin luther king but theyre handled well and not overplayed  its also refreshing to see how little melodrama creeps inspoiler alert when professor xavier becomes bedridden and the rest of the must carry on without him its good to see he doesnt suddenly come back just in time to save the day  end spoiler alert  and to those who suggest the movie is without humor there are jokes both visuali dont know the characters but at the school one boy makes a fireball and another sneaks up behind him and turns it into ice  also wolverines version of flipping someone the bird and through dialoguewhen wolverine puts down the costumes everyones wearing cyclops shoots back would you prefer yellow spandexone criticism of comic book movies has generally been that they spend too much time trying to explain things to people who dont know anything about them all at the expense of the story  thats certainly a valid point but the stories of wolverine and roguethough admittedly hers is supposedly changed radically from the source are a good way of getting into the story and magnetos short past is necessary to show while he is a villain hes not your standard one  and the stories of wolverine and rogue provide an emotional counterpoint to the information disseminated about thethe fact that patrick stewart is handling the exposition keeps these scenes from bogging downwhich leads to the performances  in order for this to work you need actors with tremendous presence and authority to play professor xavier and magneto and someone who can fully handle the complexity of wolverine and this is where the film truly scores  stewart and ian mckellen are terrific in their roles both resisting the urge to camp it upthe fact that they sound alike also illustrates how the characters are two sides of the same coin and especially play well together  and while i had wanted russell crowethe first name mentioned during casting talks for wolverine newcomer hugh jackman does quite well capturing all the feelings wolverine feels plus having a great physical presence  and he also does a great job working with all the other actors and acting with his facespoiler alert especially in the scene when he rescues rogue near the end end spoiler alertthe rest of the cast is more of a mixed bag  on the minus side tyler mane has very little to do as sabretooth though magneto and mystique are the main villains here anyway  halle berry has a great physical presence as storm her battle scenes come off well and shes quietly powerful in her one dramatic scene with senator kelly but her african accentstorm of course lived there much of her life is wayward and she gets stuck with some awkward dialogueher scene with wolverine  and while james marsden is appropriately cocky as cyclops and spars well with wolverine isnt quite convincing as a leader in his one dramatic scenewith professor xavier hes wooden rather than moving and he and jean gray dont have much chemistryin fairness that was probably among the footage cut out after previews  on the plus side rebecca romijnstamos only has one line of dialogue but shes quite a presence as mystique shes a visual effect all to herself  and unlike the tiresome faceswapping of mission impossible 2 her shapeshifting never becomes tiresome because its always used right for terror or a joke  ray park also makes a good presence as toad and contributes some humor as well  bruce davison doesnt overplay as kelly but brings the right amount of edge  famke jannsen brings quiet strength to jean gray and her scenes with wolverine sparkleespecially when she looks into his mind  finally while some have complained that rogue is too passive a character i would argue its appropriate for this conception she doesnt use her power in fights because she hasnt learned to control it and is afraid to use it  and anna paquin captures this emotional confusion well especially with her scenes with wolverinealong with mckellen and stewart jackman and paquin are the best pair in the filmoverall this was quite a good effort and while im normally leery of sequels the same people are back for the second film so im looking forward to it,fantasy
if you like comic books you will love this film if you dont like comic books you will love this film  in case you are a fan of the comic book you will enjoy this incarnation patrick stewart is xavier and hugh jackman plays wolverine like he was born to  if you have never picked up a comic book before its not a comic book movie  its a heavily character driven action film  the writing is spectacular if a fan you will catch alot of injokes if not it doesnt matter the jokes are still funny  i admit i had my doubts but i shouldnt have i want to see it over and over  do yourself a favor and treat yourself to some great entertainment,fantasy

theres little i can really say about everything is done well enough and yet nothing stands out patrick stewart is perfect as professor x opposed by ian gandalf mckellen everyone else is adequate but theres no outstanding performanceswhat of the script again shrug essentially terrorists trying to sabotage a political conference  not exactly innovative thinking theres little in the way of surpriseshow does it look director bryan singer decides not to make this movie into a tongueincheek affair which is perhaps wise considering how the batman series fared from that approach the movie is fairly dark a fact struck home by the bleak visuals in the opening theres an almost sombre feel to the picture with the humorous moments delivered dryly  and yet singer never got me caught up in the movie  the visuals the sound the characters  nothing dragged me and made me think was really good as these action blockbusters go it was certainly better made than most and looked nice et cetera and yet it was missing that  x factor that makes a movie great perhaps the sequel will do better but i can only give it a 610 somewhat disappointing,fantasy
i really hate comic strips and so have avoided this film for some time however i really enjoyed this flick a movie about mutants at war could have slipped easily to farce but thanks to the tight direction of brian singer and earnest performances particulary from hugh jackman and anna paquin it stays on the right of credulity just not high brow stuff but definately a film that entertainsenjoy,fantasy
mostly i agree with the others its not a bad movie but its also not a great one at least for people like me who had not known about the comics before because i felt as if i didnt know something throughout the film the characters were introduced rather fast and some strands definitely have the purpose of justifying a sequel thus the movie itself seems somehow incomplete to me its probably more fun watching it when you know the background stories of the plot,fantasy
good points  it is an entertaining flick in spite of its flaws with plenty of sweet eye candy  the mutants powers are nicely brought to life through the miracle of cgi  kudos to patrick stewart who played a wonderful professor x ian mckellen as the perfect magneto and hugh jackman who deserves every penny he gets for playing wolverine with charisma and style without coming across cheesy like everyone else in the cast  bad points its not that the movie is bad per se but theres nothing outstanding about it  the directing is decent but not groundbreaking and aside from stewart mckellen and jackman the acting is nothing special  bottom line kids will love it  for the adults dont expect much and you wont be disappointed,fantasy
as an action movie this more or less works as an accurate cinematic portrayal of the there are more than a few flaws does it detract from the experience not entirely a few nagging points constantly scratch at your brainfirst the casting is somewhat mixed i think the only deadon casting was of cyclops perfect match magneto and professor x who else but patrick stewart could play him the rest is alright but nothing special hugh jackman can handle the wolverine attitude later bub would not sound wrong coming out of his lips but hes just a little too tall and a few decisions really get you halle berry as storm i say if you dont see storm as anything more than halle berry in a platinum wig dont put her in the movie even at the climax when she rises from the elevator shaft eyes glossed over hair and cape flowing i still wasnt seeing her as stormrogue deserves her own paragraph where is the tall striking southern brawler we all know and love gone replaced by anna paquin who is about half the size and has none of the bravado fire and spirit of rogue in fact she looks like a whiny kid sorry anna but that travesty of a southern accent which rapidly disappears anyway does not rogue makethe chronology of what mutants join when is a little confused they attempted to make it a cross between a historical account of the forming of the team and a hit parade of mutants if they want a historical account then it should start with angel iceman cyclops jean grey marvel girl and beast the rest rogue storm wolverine would join later in the film no angel barely any iceman and beast was canned due to makeup restraints so much for that ideathe hit parade idea holds a little more water but not much where the heck is gambit and what is colossus doing painting when the team is in desperate need of muscle betsy braddock aka psylockeand the villains magneto mystique sabretooth and toad thats it some army when will the cytorak gem turn cain marko into the juggernaut where are the sentinels omega redwhen will we see the danger room in all of its might the savageland sure the yellow spandex line gets a few laughs but why are the costumes so generic this film asks more questions than it answers but if you take it on its own terms its an alright movie but nothing more,fantasy
the only thing good about this movie is the opening scene why didnt the director make the characters more interestingthis movie could and should have been much biggermost of the actors arent right for the parts they play acting is poor special effects dont look bad but also dont do the job the story iswack i really liked the opening scenemakes me wonder why the director didnt continue the movie with a intelligent storya superhero movie that really aint super at alli rate this film with a 1,fantasy
this is almost the worst movie i have ever seen  the plot is so thin i nearly fell asleep  there was no conclusion whatsoever no character growth soso special effects corny jokes and blah sound effects  yet it was sold out at our theater  this was mainly because of the braindead audience  it might pass as a kids movie but its way to violent for the disney crowd  im just glad that i live in iowa and i only blew 650 on a ticket  please if you want to see it wait until it comes out on video  otherwise youll want your money back  at least you will if you like quality movies  other movies of summers past might have been a little lacking but at least they were entertaining,fantasy
first of all i like comic books ive been a fan of the not a very big fan but ive always found the story extremely fascinating heck i found the 30 minute animated episodes better than this film i understand that its a challenge turning the into a live feature film with real characters and i shouldnt compare the animated series with the movie too much with that being said heres why i think this movie is awful 1 the saying goes its better to be the only country with a nuclear bomb in the world then to have a thousand nuclear bombsin a world where everybody else has one what do i mean too many mutants with super powers isnt as impressive as having a few superpowered mutants that was a very big let down they shouldnt have used the whole mutant school angle i dont really care about a bunch of kids who dont contribute anything to the story who have powers 2 the fight sequences mystique being a kungfu master that just doesnt seem right its not about mystique the collision between the bad guys and good guys seems very bad i wasnt impressed at all by the battles they needed better fighting scenes 3 like some other reviewer has suggested by saying that a movie focusing on just wolverine could have been more successful i agree that the story of a few key mutant characters could have been the better way to go character development the story could have gone deeper 4 love triangles havent they been overdone by now they really annoy me for heavens sake choose someone and get it over with the route taken in cinderella man is better a love affair between a husband and wife for a change 5 i didnt want to mention the plot but ive seen the first two movies the plot is dreadfulin conclusionvery disappointing i expected more i know its a challenge but hasnt hollywood had enough experience experimenting with comic book heroes this is unacceptable quality,fantasy

the franchise got better and better but this the first in the series is a fine beginning there is very little origin to the storythis was probably done because many in the audience not familiar with the long and deep history of the comics wouldnt have the patience for the complex back story and wildly amazing lineage for all of those characters and subplotsso we jump right into the action and there is enough dialog and exposition for it all to work well the casting is good too patrick stewarts professorx hugh jackmans wolverine and ian mckellens magneto are the standouts but the rest fit nicely into their characters and costumes rebecca romijnstamos as mystique fits quite nicelythe cgi looks flat at times as does the overall template of the movie which is strange for a comicbook film but there are some outstanding set pieces like magnetos standoff with the police and the train sequence the ending statue of liberty battle comes off rather lackluster the mutant vs human confrontation can obviously be analogous to real life prejudices as magneto says humans always fear what they dont understand on a comic book level this is fine and is the story that the franchise will exploit for the most of the series and why notthats exactly what the comics are about the struggle has been going on in the pages of the stan lee and jack kirby creation since 1963 in its many and varied mutations,fantasy
this in addition to being the start of the franchise was also the first superhero film of the 2000s as well as the first major adaption of a marvel comic this was a pretty solid movie with plenty going for it even if there was better to comeof course one of the best things about this franchise is hugh jackmans portrayal of loganwolverine he is a tough joker and someone you dont wanna mess with and also very interesting to watch he was made for the role just like how christopher reeve was made for superman and robert downey jr was made for iron manmany of the supporting characters are also interesting patrick stewart is great as professor charles xavier and ian mckellen makes for a great villain in magneto mystique storm cyclops and sabertooth also compliment the film nicelythe film has a solid enough story and some pretty exciting action sequences i also liked the music scorehowever one issue is that a lot of the supporting characters while cool werent developed quite enough one character i didnt care for was anna paquins rogue who was a bit whinythere isnt really anything to make the film anything more than solid it really kind of felt like they were holding back some with this film it isnt surprising that director bryan singer considers this to be the prologue to the seriesits still a good solid movie that laid the groundwork for the movies there would be better superhero films to come but this is still worth watchingrating b,fantasy
 can be said to be the movie that by itself launched the modern superhero film madness there had been superhero movies before some of them even somewhat successful but this was the film that defined the new style it paid homage to the comics taking its inspiration from them but it took liberties with its characters story lines and most importantly the visuals transforming and translating them to the silver screenit also helped that it had an amazing ensemble cast behind its characters patrick stewart ian mckellen and halle berry were already wellknown by this point but the film also helped to put several people on the map most prominently hugh jackman and their newfound fame is welldeserved as they all give fantastic performances breathing life into their characters sure some of their lines okay about half their lines were very cheesy but thats the fault of the script which while revolutionary in its own way was still looking its way and thus contained a significant amount of silliness from the previous decades which had made those previous films so hard to sell to the larger audiencesanother minor problem is the story and dont get me wrong i like the story but right now fifteen years and an impressive amount of superhero films later i can say that its a bit juvenile and to the films credit it shies away from pure blacknwhite morality with its villain magneto mckellen as well as it should but overall the tone and the events dont reach that same magnitude and epicness that later movies wouldin the end this makes very important for the whole superhero genre but keeps it from being more than an average film with some very impressive features,fantasy
a scifi action fantasy squanders an excellent cast powerful camera and sound work and a visual feast of special effects on a flimsy and sometimes silly goodmutant vs badmutant story this film will play best with young nintendo geek gamertypes and worst with mature audiences who may tire of trying to remember which mutant has what power which can thwart what mutant with which poweretc blaa blaa open ended and with a mission unanswered theres plenty of sequel room,fantasy
for whatever reasons a film might be good or it might be bad but no film has any excuse to be boring and would have to be the most boring film ive probably ever seen  it had the ingredients for a great film and bryan singers the usual suspects was probably one of the best american films of the 90s but somehow the result wasboredom and apathyho hum avoid it,fantasy
im not a huge comic book fan so i went to see in 2000 with hesitation i was blown away bryan singer the usual suspects introduces nonfans to the world of the extraordinarily while still implementing references to the series for the die hard fanswhat separates this from a lot of other comic book films is that the mix of fantasy and reality makes the film more than what it could have been  a corny remake of a comic booktelevision show singers choice to make the part of this world and his decision to have a backdrop of antimutation rallies is really what makes this film great and hugh jackman as wolverine is pitchperfect never would have guessed he was an aussie and he seems like a genuinely nice guy in person tooinferior to the 2003 sequel x2 but a mustsee for an introduction to a world within our world relaunched the comic book films weve been seeing lately spiderman daredevil and is the rare series that is almost guaranteed to have better sequels as it comes along this is just the beginning45 stars x2 455 starsjohn ulmer,fantasy
ive never been all that keen on comic strips  the only exception being the strips that appeared in the issues of the doctor who weekly by marvel comics from over 20 years ago that featured early work from legends like dave gibbons  paul nearey and alan moore  but apart from that i have no interest in what some people pretentiously describe as  graphic novels   come to think of it shouldnt books be called  literary comics  in that case  no  well thank gawd for thatmy knowledge of the strip exactly matches my interest ie zero  so i was surprised when the movies opening sequence takes place in a nazi death camp which led me to think this topic didnt belong in this movie  but as the story progresses this ties in with the subtext of the movie  unfortunately this subtext of xenophobia is quickly forgotten about as the movie mutates  geddit   into a yawn stifilling battle between good and evil  the only difference being that both the goodies and baddies have superhuman powers  it goes without saying that theres a lot of make up and special effects involved and both are disappointing especially the cgi  its also obvious that before was shot it was going to be a franchise movie which means we have a fair amount of exposition which holds up the story is just as i expected it to be for the most part  a summer blockbuster heavy on fx and light on plotting and characterisation  its not the worst summer blockbuster youll ever see but just like a comic strip it lacks substance,fantasy
the movies for me have always been a disappointment i love the and the marvel  dc universes however the story lines for the movies always left me somewhat coldthe storylines were 2 dimensional and basically lacking any depthi am all for making improvements when transitioning from comic book to cartoon to big screen movie  however the storylines in the cartoons had more depth and interest then the moviesok maybe there are limitations when transitioning from cartoons to big screen movies i get that  but there is no excuse when the film makers tone down and over simplify the storylines or in the case of the change the storylines completely into something that just lacks substance,fantasy
decided to go back and start watching the movies from the start i will keep this short i expected to not be impressed and to have found this to date poorly but i still thought it was pretty good i was never a reader of the comics but i did watch the animated tv show as a young teen i think they did great sabertooth would be the only character they wrote incorrectly  they wrote sabertooth right in the origins wolverine but this is a better movie its a solid movie in the franchise and i recommend it,fantasy
everything about this film is done perfectly hugh jackman surprisingly is great as wolverine despite this being his odd one out performance and patrick stewart is especially memorable as proffesor x i also liked the casting decisions of james marsden as cyclops and halle berry as storm but i wasnt a huge fan of how their characters were somewhat underdevelopedso basically the plot revolves around magneto sir ian mckellen trying to hunt down wolverine for some unknown reason even though spoiler alert he actually wants rogue the biggest problem i have with the plot is that it doesnt make sense to me why magneto wants rogue because all she can do is make someone have a heart attack meanwhile wolverine has a full skeleton made of adamantiumsurprisingly this movie holds up in a dated sort of way because its an all around 1990s2000s movie its theme still holds true today and i felt that it was presented in the best way possible not to mention that,fantasy

 2000 dir bryan singer  cast patrick stewart ian mckellen hugh jackman famke janssen anna paquin visual wonder lacking a plot but the title is curious because x is the symbol of marked individuals who contain strange powers plot regards the war between humans and mutants these mutants are indemnified by their power because the screenwriter is unable to provide personalities much of the film is incomplete the senator protesting the mutants suddenly disappears he undergoes a transformation after his capture and dies as if that matters directed by bryan singer who previously made the usual suspects the initial problem is that the film seems too pleased with being associated with the comic book as oppose to being a great plot the cast don colourful costumes but their lives seem pasted into a screenplay bent on throwing them within the middle of action and violence patrick stewart plays the leader who can control minds ian mckellen plays a villain who can attract metal objects and at one point has the police at bay with their own guns these cops are gifted at overacting hugh jackman plays woverine who lives in solitude and cage fights famke janssen also appears etc anna paquin plays rogue who joins wolverine in some pointless opening fight scenes racial theme is symbolized through mutant characters and the array of visual artistry they possess score 4  10,fantasy
x men this movie should be called hugh jackman the movie as he dominates the film people idolise wolverine at the expense of others basically the film is the live action version of the comic books featuring mutants with superhuman powers one group led by charles xavier starring patrick stewart and the other group by magneto starring ian mckellen the potential was there to have more mutants better character development and a stronger plot alas they went with a conventional story about logan an angry person looking to know who he is my favourite x men was in fact a women storm played by halle berry her character was well acted and interesting and the nightmare that was catwomen had not yet been made poor choice in having so few characters and focusing on wolverine on the plus side more give us the chance of having more characters introduced and having better plots so let us hope new the films are a lot better,fantasy
a promising start of the universe on the silver screen is a fascinating work of sciencefiction  a terrific addition to the superhero genre film this is the first time ive watched this film  now im wondering what the hell actually stopped me from checking this out in the first place the only other film ive seen is first class  if it wasnt for its upcoming sequel which brings back the cast from the original trilogy i wouldnt have bothered to give this one a chance  wouldve again missed what actually is a pretty good filmset in a not so distant future in which few people around the world are mutants possessing superhuman powers that has also resulted in them being outcasted by the society it tells the story of two mutants named wolverine  rogue who find themselves in between the ongoing battle between two mutant groups is led by professor charles xavier who believes that mutants  humans can coexist while the brotherhood of mutants is led by magneto who believes that humans will never accept the mutants  will always fear themthe direction by bryan singer provides this franchise the kickstart it needed  singer makes sure that the story is easily absorbed by even those who were never aware of marvels comic books the writing also is nicely carried out with fine introduction of its mutant characters  is detailed with enough information for the first chapter the film features a strong cast in hugh jackman patrick stewart ian mckellen halle berry etc but its jackman who impresses the most as wolverine followed by composed performances from wilson  mckellenthe story is nothing great as per se but it does provide the start it needed the action sequences are nicely carried out although there are few vfx moments that look dated  unintentionally funny now most of the characters present in the film are intriguing especially mystique about whom i would love to find out more the music however is a let down  the overall production design manages to work just fine on an overall scale getting more rights than wrongs is an admirable satisfying  amazingly balanced work thatll manage to grip its audience from start to finish,fantasy
 has been the sole marvel franchise to exist during the campier and less serious times of the superhero genre and the more serious ubiquitous times of the genre in a way its difficult to believe the film is fourteen years old but the franchise it spawned is still going strong to this datefor a fourteenyearold film revolving around mutants genetic modifications and including seven superheros it needs to acquaint audiences with is still much better than anyone probably wouldve initially imagined in a shockingly short onehundred and four minutes the film manages to give all seven of its heroes some time to shine while offering us some seriously contemplative political drama on the ethical ideas of allowing mutants and geneticallymodified humans to coexist with traditional humans the result is a pretty intriguing endeavorset in the notso distant future we see that the idea of mutants  or those who possess special powers as a result of dna modificationsmutations  being able to declare themselves through the means of public registration has surpassed issues of gay marriage abortion and immigration in the united states congress senator robert kelly bruce davison is the leader of this movement using congressional hearings as his opportunity to stand on his soapbox and sermonize about how mutant registration needs to exist for the safety and wellbeing of americameanwhile professor x patrick stewart is busy constructing his merryband of or mutants in order for them to bring about their own line of vigilante justice we have cyclops james marsden with his lasereyes dr jean greay famke janssen whose telekinetic powers prove limitless in size and scope and storm halle berry who lives up to her name with powers that can manipulate meteorology and weatherprofessor x runs a school called the school for gifted children where those with unforeseen powers can go and still have their own free will and dignity intact two new students with incredible potential arrive at xs school one day rogue anna paquin a shy recluse who discovers that she cannot touch another being without the life of them being literally sucked out of them and wolverine hugh jackman a muscular individual with retractable claws that sprout from his knuckles both contemplate whether or not they should join xs band of and make an attempt at defeating magento ian mckellen and his band of loyal comradesfor a film that works to assemble a barrage of different heroes and utilize them in creative ways its sort of admirable how doesnt get lost in the shuffle while not each hero bears a great deal of personality each is humanized to the point where you feel you could at least recognize and find yourself acquainted with them on a basic level then theres the fact that despite bearing a lot of heroes in the film adaptation had enough heroes for multiple different franchises when it was confined to the captivating colorful pages of a comic bookfor what it has and for what writer david hayter and director bryan singer choose to do with it manages to be a surprisingly solid especially given its cluttered array of characters the film avoids the pitfalls of a dry origin story by not only giving each character time to showcase their powers and utilize them accordingly but usher in biting political debate about the ethics and value of having a world with known mutants toss in some uniformly strong acting especially by the likes of jackman paquin mckellen and stewart and you have a stronglyconstructed package deal really marks the drastic change in tone superhero films of the 2000s ushered in the genre that was once looked at as a piece of escapist camp ultimately became one to show people that things arent forever and that genres can undergo a drastic change overtime what became of the superhero genre is something to praise and commend albeit critique in aspects and this particular pictures serves as a winning time capsule to that enormous revitalizationstarring hugh jackman ian mckellen patrick stewart halle berry famke janssen james marsden anna paquin bruce davison rebecca romijnstamos and ray park directed by bryan singer,fantasy
this first part of the series begins with the induction of two new mutants wolverine and rogue in professor xs academy intros to these characters are interesting but the characters could have been developed a little more the talented actors chosen to play these two characters hugh jackman and anna paquin is an interesting choice and are utilized quite well though mystique doesnt have much of a character rebecca romijn is exquisitely hot as the seductive shapechanging accomplice of magneto patrick stewart and ian mckellen are good as the leads of the two sides actors like halle berry and james marsden are quite underutilized and i hated the way the movie undermines cyclops character and pays too much focus on wolverines in the animation series cyclops is the formidable and admirable leader i loved the way they show how rogues front white hair came aboutoverall its a good and interesting start to an amazing marvel series which is the most mainstream allegory on the gay  lesbian community but it didnt have the overall impact it could have had,fantasy
this movie is a great movie if youre into action and lots of fighting the movie stays pretty close to the comic books hugh jackman is the best possible choice to play the wolverine you cant help but cheer for him to finally figure out how he became the wolverine and when you do find out you cant help but feel his pain but also happiness that he finally finds what he was looking for halle berry played storm to perfection this movie is setup to the movies that followed by explaining some of the back story of the beginning of the the battle between charles xavier and magneto for power as an ongoing theme throughout the movie throughout the movie you become introduced to other members of the family that will become bigger players in upcoming movies if you are a fan of the comics this movie will not disappoint,fantasy
x men is one of the earliest marvel movies adapted to the big screen released in 2000 the film gained satisfactory reviews and many audiences were pumped for the sequel the film introduces the heroes in x men in a fun and enjoyable way and makes many references to the comics this is my personal favorite of the x men series and today ill tell you why first off the introduction of wolverine is awesome and is very much in reality the film has the most enjoyable moments of all the x men films and the special effects hold up very well even after 14 years the cast is played out brilliantly and there are little to no mistakes made on screen the villains are portrayed in a nice manner and i think no other film of the x men series can capture the true character of wolverine than in this film of course hugh jackman played wolverine several times but it is here where he actually reminds you of that guy with razor sharp claws known in the comics this film is definitely must see if youre seeking out the good marvel movies because this one is truly in the top 10 list for me bryan singer delivers a great shot at marvels x men,fantasy
before this film the realm of comic book films had been looked at but mostly laughed at but that all changed with in 2000 that can be truly heralded as the saviour of comic book films this film sees two outcast mutants  humans with special powers who are recruited to a school for their kind while a group of enemy mutants are attempting to start the war between mutants and humanity now when we think of the character wolverine we automatically think of hugh jackman and this all started with this film he portrayed the character of logan so well with the mixture of tough guy attitude heart felt moments and quick witted humour providing a great lead for this first film and the many that would follow the supporting cast do a good job as well with patrick stewart doing a phenomenal job as professor xavier by really coming across strongly as a good father figure but also powerful likewise ian mckellen as magneto was great and the delivery of his lines was so perfect that i couldnt imagine anybody else delivering them famike janssen was also really good as jean grey especially with the fact that i find her character quite boring in the comics so that is impressive the one i am not a huge fan of though is that of james marsden as cyclops because they make him really boring and like a boyscout which is totally against his character in the comics the story was good with magnetos plot and some of the twists being well thought out but i feel it would have been better if they had left a certain story arc out of the film that i hate the script was okay with some of the dialogue being fun and witty or well delivered but then their are other lines that are just bad and have no place in this film the style of the film is great with the powers and action scenes really working and providing a solid platform for them to improve which they did overall this film is definitely worth a watch especially if you are an fan like i am,fantasy
 is the first movie of series and this movie has to do about a superhero team which has to oppose a terrorist organization with similar powersi liked this movie because when it came out in 2000 it was something really new and unique i also liked it because of the plot and the story of this movie the cast and because of the interpretations of this cast i think that many actors in this movie made one of their best interpretations of all time i liked very much the interpretation of hugh jackman who played as wolverine ian mckellen who plays as magneto patrick stewart who plays as professor charles xavier rebecca romijn who plays as mystique and halle berry who plays as stormfinally i have to tell you that this movie is the starting movie of the series and is really worth seeing it,fantasy
in a world where both mutants and humans fear each other a woman named marie better known as rogue runs away from home when she renders a young man into a comatose state with her unique skill set she goes to alberta to hitch a ride with a man known as logan aka wolverine after initially vetoing her request to hitch with him logan gives in they are almost killed when sabretooth makes an unexpected attack on logan  rogue storm  cyclops save their lives and take them to a mutant school run by professor charles xavier his old friend magneto believes a war is brewing has an evil plan in mind and kidnaps rogue now this is how you start off a franchise there isnt anything fancy about this one but its incredibly effective and enormously entertaining everything clicks in this one unlike the overblown iii the last stand this one is able to combine action with terrific storytelling i also liked how it delivered a message about how everyone should be viewed as equals no matter what your condition is there are a few things that would set the tone for future installments wolverines flashbacks would be told in lengthy detail with the movie wolverine it also has a great love triangle with wolverine cyclops and dr jean grey but wolverine  jeans attraction towards each other is subtly hinted at but that would change i always thought anna paquin was terrific as rogue it is kind of a shame that her screen time would decrease with each installment hugh jackman is fantastic as wolverine he plays the perfect antihero and is the coolest character as far as im concerned patrick stewart oozes class as prof xavier he was a joy to watch and his scenes with ian mckellen were awesome ian mckellen is awesome as magneto famke janssen isnt unstable in this one she is rather tame compared to how she would become as phoenix i thought she was excellent though and drop dead gorgeous james marsden fits the arrogant cyclops to a t halle berry is absolutely beautiful but she felt a little off at times as storm tyler mane does fine as sabretooth but i find sabretooth to be insignificant and rather useless rebecca romijn is awesome as the devious mystique wait until you see wolverine battle himself when she turns into wolverine bruce davison is good as senator kelly the finale is filled with amazing action scenes and leaves you wanting more with the short running timefinal thoughts this isnt the best in the original trilogy id have to give that honor to ii but its a damn good way to kick things off it is exciting well written and a lot of fun to watch you have no excuse not to see this if youre an fan8610,fantasy
in the near future the evolution of mutants begins and the general public is made afraid of them through the demagoguery of a politician named senator kelly bruce davison because his fear tactics present a threat two separate mutant organizations form with radically different agendas the first group wants to wage war on the human race for their hostility towards them they are led by a man named magneto ian mckellen the second group calls themselves the and their leader goes by the name of professor charles xavier patrick stewart they seek peace through cooperation and better understanding soon the find themselves locked in combat with the other group in order to stop the terrorist attacks on innocent people anyway rather than divulge the rest of the story let me just say that this is a fun and exciting movie which should appeal to most fans of the comic book genre i liked the performances of both ian mckellen and patrick stewart and it didnt hurt to have several attractive actresses like halle berry as storm famke janssen dr jean grey and rebecca romjin mystique also appearing in the movie likewise i appreciated the fact that this movie consisted of more than just mindless action and cgi it was a refreshing changeofpace considering thats all hollywood seems capable of lately be that as it may i rate this movie as above average and recommend it to those who might be interested in something of this nature,fantasy

at this point in time november 2013 as i write this the comic book and superhero have become the worlds modern greek mythology and the comic book movie adaptation is common in fact it seems that now we get at least three highprofile films adapted from comics every year and they are often films of spectacle quality and excitement for audiences as studios have finally begun to understand how just incredible complex and important these superheroes and stories aresand there are two films that are often credited with getting the gears rolling on the comic book movie 1998s blade and this film 2000s both took their source materials seriously and without irony and both were boxoffice hits that were also warmly received by fans and critics they paved the way for later classics like spiderman 2 the dark knight and the avengersbryan singer directs this stirring thrilling and often thought provoking action film from a screenplay by david hayterset sometime in the near future mutations have become something of a controversy in the human population for whatever reason many people exhibit strange unique and often dangerous gifts that set them apart from others we follow two such mutants a teenaged girl who calls herself rogue anna paquin and an amnesiac loner with a rough violent side who goes by wolverine hugh jackman whom are both rescued by a team of mutants calling themselves the lead by professor charles xavier patrick stewart the team aspire to be protectors for human and mutant alike despite the prejudices they face from the nonmutants they also fight against the brotherhood a dark group of mutants lead by the nefarious magneto ian mckellen whom sees war with the nonmutants as their only option leftthis film is very much a large ensemble film and this is one of the great successes as the cast is uniformly magnificent jackman who has sort of become the lead in the entire series having been given the spotlight in almost every entry is fantastic as wolverine he brings a toughness to the role but also a curiosity as he is unsure of his past and even touches of sadness and selfhatred as well as a touch of humor patrick stewart is phenomenal as xavier bringing about both touches of a loving fatherly figure as well as a fearless leader mckellen is both frightening and tragic as magneto our villain who has become lost due to hatred and other performances by the likes of paquin james marsden famke janssen halle berry bruce davison and many others are all just a joy to watch i just unfortunately dont have the space here to properly address everyonethe production is fantastic singers direction is topnotch and he is able to balance not only a bit of an origin story for the series but also the action pathos symbolism and themes such as oppression and prejudice this is definitely helped by a wonderfully crafted script by david solid snake hayter which blends together many themes and story lines wonderfully without them stepping over each other or losing focus those very themes are a large part of what makes work so well while many superhero and comicbook films have issues for their characters to overcome or be defined by makes the issue larger on a societal level and the mutant heroes often come across as sort of metaphors for oppressed groups like african americans women homosexuals etc and it does a lot to aid the films realism impact and provocative storylinethe set and costume design is also a lot of fun and the musical score by michael kamen while not particularly memorable is still a wonderfully crafted piece of music that adds mood and atmosphere to the imagesreally this is just a darnedgood film with a few problems here and there for starters although singers direction is almost perfect some of his actionsequences do feel a bit flat he didnt seem to have too much experience with action prior to this film so it can be forgiven my other issues is that the film is perhaps a bit too stylized and therefore in retrospect a bit too dated for it to be taken quite as seriously as it should be while it is a wellmade film some of it just oozes late 90s early 2000s style and it does sort of hurt the film in retrospectbut those complaints aside this is still a good film and is definitely wellworth seeing and investing some thought into and the fact that this series is still ongoing with the seventh entry coming next year it should definitely be a priority film to see if you already haventi give a very good 8 out of 10,fantasy

based on the marvel comics this is a great introduction to these characters and thats the biggest job in this movie for director bryan singer he needed the right actors to play these characters properly in a viable story the fact that he did it well meant that a new movie franchise is launchedof all the actors the most important ones are hugh jackman and patrick stewart jackman is a find before this hes done mostly australian tv thats really lucky hes not a meathead weight lifter hes the real deal patrick stewart is the more easier choice not only is he captain picard but hes a great british actor with a vast repertoirethe story itself is a great persecution and outsider story the characters are already well established and well tested as long as they had good actors the good chemistry is almost automatic,fantasy
with the superhero franchises get a push ahead the setup is similar superheroes with somewhat weird powers villains  their confrontation although has some kind of peculiarity in it that not only appeals but stands outi am not surprised by the plot but the singers skill of introducing characters is amazing with proper balance of story character depth cgi marks one of the bestever introductory installation for one the cast lineup is appealing for another dialogs and humor are proportionatebut still it lacks newness and borrows elements from published superhero movies i am not accusing it for any superhero movies will look the samebottom line a decade later if the charm of evidently sways in the atmosphere it definitely gets a head up aint it recommended,fantasy
we are the future charles not them they no longer matter  magnetobryan singers plagued me with a wealth of interest based on my academic involvement in evolutionary science it also deals with modern social struggles superiority complexes among intelligent superminds quickwitted one liners and some downright incredible haircuts this is a fond throwback to one of the key comic book films of all time which i would argue gave faith to film companies to stick with the genre after some poor efforts in the late 90sthe story is very simple the antagonist magneto has built a machine that can force mutations within human beings at great cost to the operators strength by using the machine powered by young marierogue infused with magnetos metal controlling abilities magneto will transform several world leaders and dignitaries who are gathered on ellis island nyc for a peace summit into mutants wolverine cyclops storm and jean grey must stop him as his device is not only deemed immoral by the but they have witnessed the potential for it to kill humans whos cells arent equipped to deal with forced mutation it is however the subplot of mutant alienation and criminalisation victimisation and how the mutant characters deal with the shackles placed on them by society which makes a complex original superhero film and indeed series takes real life issues such as homosexuality and disability and places them in a surreal world where mutants are feared by mankind because they are deemed unnatural by key figures in society senator kelly bruce davison is that divisive figure in this film seeking to instill a sense of fear of the unknown in the american populous he suggests that mutants could be dangerous and are national security liabilities unless they can be registered this causes a reaction within one particular mutant named magneto who is ready to initiate war against humans under the darwinian theory that a species must adapt or be replaced by a stronger fitter one rather than forcing an entity of pure evil upon us in magneto singer opens the film by showing the torment and evil that has befallen him under mankind as a young boy he is separated from his parents in a concentration camp triggering a dormant powerful mutation within him along with a burning hatred for human beings mckellen is the perfect magneto a man who has lived a life as a member of an outcast community understood the role perfectly and was even able to offer help to singer and his crew understanding the more subtle social issues behind mutants equally convincing is his role as an egomaniacal wouldbedictatorunfortunately magnetos crew fall far short of the mark in representing what he stands for sabretooth doesnt have any dialogue but offers nothing in the way of body language or facial expression to compensate toad makes an excellent resilient fighter and brings some comic relief to the brotherhood but his character just lacks the seriousness needed to fill the gap for the mute sabretooth and the quiet mystique mystiques make up is astounding and her character is sleek and deadly in and out of combat although later films focus on her a great deal more she just doesnt get enough screen time or dialogue in the original film to have any real impact in the way that the lesser dothe under the calm yet powerful guidance of professor x expertly portrayed by patrick stewart against mckellens magneto seek to prevent all out conflict between magnetos brotherhood of mutants and man with a goal to help the two understand one another and live harmoniously the are portrayed faithfully but just seem a little diluted which is a shame as some sparks of on screen chemistry are quite visible particularly between wolverine and cyclops hugh jackman really is the perfect candidate for wolverine forgiving him a 12 inch height difference his accent facial expressions delivery of both snappy one liners what d they call you wheels and confrontational snarls are all in perfect character call it teething problems but his later performances are more naturally aggressive and cantankerous than in this film but hes easily forgiven as wolverine is probably the strongest character alongside xavier and magnetocyclops and jean grey are both competent on screen but seem to rely much like the entire franchise at times on jackmans wolverine to help character development this also holds true for storm her moral deliberation with wolverine in xaviers mansion is her most prominent nonbattle scene moment in the filmrogue is the final main though she doesnt become fully fledged in this film her character is portrayed as an innocent misunderstood teenager who has a mutation which leaves her feeling isolated from others of both human and mutant kind again her character clings to wolverine but far more closely than any of the others several poignant scenes are shared between paquin and jackmans characters indeed wolverine is the only one who can soothe rogues troubled mind when she is most vulnerable though she did inadvertently almost kill him twice she along with magneto embodies the ideologies behind the film isolation suffering and alienation from normality was a very good film for a time when mainstream audiences were disenchanted with the superhero genre the expertise of actors such as jackman stewart and mckellen an inventive plot dealing with issues beyond just fighting bad guys and personal feuds and flaws aside a passable gallery of superheros and villains immersed in a world where regular humans are an active component in the battlefield gave hollywood something new and arguably gave birth to the 21st century comic book film explosion 2000allans score 6510,fantasy
 offers the viewer good special effects  nice action and decent story  the movie suffers from the fact that this is kinda origin story yet there is too little time to explore the universe  in comic books there is endless time to explore characters and introduce them to reader  here we get to know only about the few of them  xavier  magneto  wolverine and rogue others like cyclops or jean grey are barely introduced  some are just instrumental characters like sabertooth or storm  the characters arent too complex  because time doesnt allows for that  yet  thanks to the actors their likable and memorable with the exception of halle berry as storm she seems too young and not too charismatic  the casting is top notch  hugh jackman patrick stewart and ian mckellen seem to be born to play wolverine  xavier and magnetothere is nice love triangle here and good friendshiprivalry relationship between wolverinecyclopsjean grey  some things were changed here compared to the comic books still  the changes were good and logical such as with the costumes the special effects are unfortunately quite outdated by today standards the whole movie feels like a tv episode  pilot for a tv series instead of epic science fiction action movie the action is nice  but nothing really spectacular it feels like bryan singer famous for usual suspects doesnt feels confident with them the story is rather thin and the whole movie really feels more like an introduction to the world of than anything else thankfully  in the sequel the action  story and special effects were improvedits one of the first of new wave of comic book movies its not one of the best  but not one of the worst either i give it 610,fantasy
the original movie has been roundly criticized as deviating too much from the official canon i kind of suspect these people are the same geniuses who leveled the same criticism at batman so i will run the following question by you all suppose that you had some kind of trait that made you extremely different from the rest of the populace would you be running around in multicolored spandex parading around like a hero or would you be having deep crises about how you react to other peoples fear as a sufferer of a presentday equivalent of the mutations shown in this film i know what my answer isthe modification of the story to show rogue as a young woman who has only just discovered that everyone she touches is severely wounded by it was a master stroke not only was it great to see how human the mutants really are more so than the minorities in this film as a matter of fact but casting a delicate intelligent young woman like anna paquin in the role was a perfect capitalization on the writing coupling this with the way wolverine is shown as the result of a horrid military experiment who is now just trying to survive as best he can was a brilliant idea too hugh jackman was a perfect choice for the role as a man whose past combines pieces of these two characters histories in a more figurative sense i found these two actors utterly believable in all respectsthe only thing wrong with the movie in my view is that the think tank which made these excellent moves with the good guys ran out of steam when the bad guys were written mystique toad and sabre tooth just dont have the same level of character development allocated to them as wolverine rogue cyclops and storm mystique gets one line in the whole film the rest are her pretending to be someone else and toad is merely there to provide excuses for gratuitous special effects shots capping that off is the fact that magneto is shown as a survivor of the holocaust who takes on the same kind of attitude as the nazis granted he is being somewhat provoked by the section of humanity that is afraid of mutants but once again my experience as part of a small percentile of the populace that has had outright lies told about it by the rest tells me that more motivation would have been required for magneto to become so like his real enemyaside from the uneven development of the characters however this is another neargreat modern adaptation of a comic book it works on numerous levels and is extremely pleasant to watch,fantasy
rated 7210 rounded to 7i am a big fan of superhero movies when i first saw i was excited and i was right to be is a very good movie it couldnt have been much better the acting is pretty good hugh jackman makes a great wolverine and any movie with halle berry i believe to be worth watching except maybe catwoman there are more good actors as well including ian mckellen who makes a great magneto and patrick stewart the directing is good but nothing to be too excited about what makes the film good is mostly the special effects and the acting not much needs to be explained here but the effects and the acting are really what make this film great definitely a film to watch if you enjoy a fun actionpacked filmwas this review helpful if so check out my other reviews or visit my website at wwwtmb2kcom,fantasy
the first movie is an entertaining film but an extremely basic film it is definitely not bad but it is not great either i spoiled myself by watching united first after watching that brilliant film a number of times watching this film for the first time felt very underwhelming after watching in a number of times after that i came to enjoy the flick i also thank the film for helping to open the doors to a long chain of superhero films throughout the 2000s and still going strong if it was not for this film or the first spiderman film we might not have nearly as many superhero films as we have today let alone great ones however it is still basic superhero film compared to films compared to later movies like x2most of the cast does a good job i like most of the characters the majority of the actors fit their characters perfectly especially hugh jackman wolverine and patrick stewart professor x famke janssen does a good jean grey and james marsden does a really good cyclops one thing that this movie does right that the other after it does not is have cyclops be relevant this is the only movie that we get to see cyclops do anythingsome actors were miscast though anna paquin does not do a good job as rogue i think she would have been better a kiddy pride the character of rogue in this movie is a far cry from the character in the comics and the tv shows rogue is supposed to be a spitfire this rogue is the complete opposite of that halle berry does okay as storm but there are plenty of people that could have played the role betterthe villain magneto is a great in this film he is played brilliantly by ian mckellen mckellen is one of my favorite actors he does great in every movie he is in whether the movie is good or bad he got the character of magneto down to a tee magneto is one of the best parts of the film i like him because he is not really a full villain but more of an antagonist you feel for him and can see where he is coming from i even like his ultimate plan in the film it is really not that bad of a plan if it wasnt for an unfortunate side effect the other villains are very onenote and not worth talking aboutthe score is nothing special the fight scenes are well done and entertaining the effects are quite good too i also love the social commentary the film presents which is primarily based aroundoverall i think is a decent and entertaining superhero film if you are a fan of definitely check it out however do not expect anything too deep about the film watch x2 for that,fantasy
 2000  12 out of 4 professor xavier patrick stewart builds a safe haven where mutants from around the world can feel normal among one another soon wolverine hugh jackman cyclops james marsden storm halle berry and rogue anna paquin must come together when magneto ian mckellen plans to use some mutants for bad reasons i dont see why any comic book fan will be disappointed with this film from bryan singer as the director manages to make it look extremely good and were given a nice cast of actors for these parts if youre looking for action youre certainly going to find plenty of it here and youre even going to get a few laughs along the way to me this here was a fairly good movie that at least didnt run too long but at the same time it just seemed that the majority of the running time was just letting you get to know the characters as if the filmmakers were just using this here as an introduction film and then the real stuff would take place with the sequels while this film has quite a bit of stuff going on the majority of it is just scattered out as the characters try to come to terms with being mutants and of course were introduced to them and what its like being someone with special powers all of this is well and good but i think theres a bit too much time spent on this because after a while you get it i will say that i enjoyed the cast in their roles with jackman clearly stealing the film with the angered up wolverine berry was also quite impressive in her costumes if you know what i mean and rebecca romijn was extremely good as mystique the visuals in the film were quite impressive as well and theres no question that director singer knows how to stage an action scene including a terrific one early on in the snowy woods,fantasy
 is the marvel super hero movie that finally made it and launched them on a series of quality film it made it because it was greatthe good lots of super action nice displays of powers interesting story a bit of intrigue well done bantering a few odd references to the comic books for the fans great battlesthe actors hugh jackman is perfect as the wolverine hes just missing a bit of bulk but the attitude is there patrick stewart is also right on as professor x ian mckellen makes a great super villain as magneto at that point james marsden wasnt well known and this role is a little bit weak for him he can perform better although halle berry was already a star and she fits her role to perfection it didnt stretch her acting talent at all anna paquin plays the sweet rogue with a good sense of dramatic flairthe bad the cg are starting to show theyre not too old yet but we can see them on the edge the story is pretty basic compared to the intrigue we can find in the comics and cyclops never was such a twerp in the booksthe ugly nothingthe result great super hero entertainment,fantasy
i remember looking forward to finally seeing a big marvel comics character on the big screen while i thought the movie was ok it really felt to safe and a bit like a tv pilot the movie actually starts off well and is well shot and until sabertooth attacks logan in the woods and we get a sense of whats to come the major action sequences in the train station and statue of liberty are darkpoorly shot and staged as if there was no time to rehearse or train the movie also feel like its missing a middle act somewhere to build up to the finale the highlight of the production design is the x mansions basement levels which do look pretty cool its unfortunate that the movie didnt have a larger budgetmore time and a more experience crew it could really have been a big blockbuster instead of an average summer movie,fantasy
i have to admit i wasnt the biggest fan of growing up in the late 90s early 2000s i fell more into the crowd of spiderman power rangers and harry potter fanatics but then i saw bryan singers the live action adaptation of the comic book of the same name immediately i was hooked and since then i have become a hardcore buff watching all the cartoon series with the exception of wolverine and the and even breezing through some of the comics takes place in a time of mutant discrimination and protesting on the good side there is charles xavier the leader of the who believes that mutants and humans can live together in harmony on the bad side there is magneto the leader of the brotherhood of mutants who believes a war is coming between mankind and mutant kind charles and magneto are very similar to real life civil rights leaders like martin luther king jr and malcolm x and patrick stewart and ian mckellen do a magnificent job portraying their respective characters in my opinion its one of stewarts best roles since jeanluc picard and ebenezer scrooge in the heat of all this tension and travesty xaviers get themselves into quite a few confrontations with magnetos brotherhood of mutants of course there are several members on both teams so everyone can have their favorite heroes and baddies theres the optic blasting cyclops the weather witch storm the telepathic jean grey the power absorbing rogue and of course the adamantium claw clashing bub wolverine on the enemy side there is the hairy beast sabretooth the long tongued toad and the blue shapeshifting mystique all these characters are just as classic in the movie as they are in the comics although i believe that some of the characters should have had a little bit more character development and a tad more dimension some of the acting is wooden yes but thats not enough for me to totally despise the movie it has a lot of things to love and every time i watch i find something i have never seen before in previous viewings i like to think of this movie as an end of the 90s and the beginning of the 2000s movie setting the stage for more superhero flicks to follow does indeed have some dated elements like some of the special effects but when you get right down to it its just a fun entertaining action packed high flying thrill ride that has you captivated all the way to the end credits this is the film that got me into the mood and i was pumped up for more and although the franchise has had its share of scrutinized elements it still has things i go absolutely wild over sure x2 and first class came along to take the place of my favorite xflick but i always look back at this film and say what an experience this movie is and this would only be the beginning of a new age of superhero silver screen successes we are the future charles,fantasy

i finally had the pleasure of seeing this film after all the long years i went into watching the film not to be blown away by anything but at the end of the day i was pleasantly shocked at how good this movie was it was fun it was exciting it was thrilling it was lovable and it certainly was epic the story of is that of a group of mutants calling themselves the who must stand up to another mutant the evil and powerful magneto who plans on starting a war between the evil mutants and humanity after senator kelly applies a law that hopes to force mutants to reveal themselves to the public there were so many things that worked well in the movie i thought sir ian mckellen was easily the standout of the movie and simply every minute of him was a scene stealer at first i didnt like hugh jackman playing wolverine and thought he wasnt right but i was glad that i was completely wrong he was amazing and anna paquin as rogue did a decent job patrick stewart playing professor xavier the almighty mutant was brilliant the characters were portrayed very well and i certainly look forward to seeing all the other movies of this franchise these characters struck to me in a similar way to how the characters from harry potter used to strike me they seem interesting characters that each have some sort of personality and dont act like cardboard cutouts the writing and direction of the film was handled very well and i thought that due to the great writing the actors and actresses were able to deliver their lines very well the special effects in the movie are mindblowing movies with great special effects make you believe that it actually occurs in reality and this film certainly made me believe that the action scenes were handled very well and i found myself being able to watch and enjoy these scenes due to the good cinematography during these action scenes definitely worth a watch for any lover of sci fi and action movies,fantasy
 is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and a terrific cast and charactersthe movie is action packed but still manages to focus a lot on its characters and not get too carried away with special effectsthe cast all suit their characters perfectlythe movie is great for fans of the comics and for newcomerswhich is what i really like to see in a comic book moviethis film is the career starter for hugh jackmana great actor who got a big break in this movieand it was perfect castinghe is great as loganwolverine and i couldnt imagine him being played by anyone else is a frat movie that fans and newcomers will enjoyi would recommend to anyone looking for a great action or scifisuperman mutants lead by dr charles xavier patrick stewartbattle against the evil magneto ian mckellen and his organisationand set out to prove mutants are innocent people and should be treated equallybest performance hugh jackman,fantasy
the same as everything elsein a world where both mutants and humans fear each other marie dancanto better known as rogue runs away from home and hitches a ride with another mutant known as wolverinecharles xavier who owns a school for young mutants sends storm and cyclops to bring them back before it is too latemagneto who believes a war is approaching has an evil plan in mind and needs young rogue to help himi know bryan singer was introducing a huge amount of characters to the big screen and while the film is very well made did it really have to be so boring in certain places stewart mckellan jackman and janssen are blistering in this movie whenever they are on screen the film is at its peakon the other end of the spectrum though we have berry marsden and paquin who are mundane on the verge of being offensive which is what singers major flaw is he didnt think of the other characters instead just having somebody slightly big at the time would make the more interesting it doesnt workso all in all its not bad just compared to other movies in the genre it feels very lethargic and longer that it actually is,fantasy
energetic surprisingly loyal action  adventure with some brilliant casting choices and a tight cohesive visual style patrick stewart and ian mckellen are brilliant choices as xavier and magneto dueling civil rights figureheads on opposite sides of the moral spectrum but dont get nearly enough scenes together of course hugh jackman absolutely defines the role of wolverine playing a very clearly defined potentially cheesy character and pulling it off with vigor the films not entirely confident in itself evidenced by a few hokey plot devices and a handful of godawful lines of comic relief basically anything that comes out of halle berrys mouth but considering its age and status as the makeorbreak point for comic book properties spoiler it made i can overlook a few missteps light fun with the kernel of a deeper message nestled beneath several layers of black leather titanium veneer and bright colorful effects,fantasy
i think the films have been so popular because the dare to be different the concept of the strays far from superhero conventions if you approach the films thinking youre getting something akin to superman spiderman or batman forget itthe unique concept of the is that humanity is starting to evolve to the next level and a small percentage of humans all over the globe are starting to manifest superhuman powers from the mutant x gene two mutant leaders who are old friends take totally contrasting positions charles xavier starts a school for mutant youths in upstate new york his attitude is positive and his goal benign eric lensherr or magneto on the other hand is fed up with the paranoia of nonmutants he starts a brotherhood of mutants with an attitude of superiority unfortunately power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutelyyou could say that xavier takes the approach of martin luther king jr while magneto goes the route of malcolm x an interesting comparisonalthough everybody has their favorite i feel all three films in the original trilogy are of the same general quality 2000 x2 united 2003 and the last stand 2006 naturally lays the foundation by introducing the principle characters and the plight of the mutants wolverine and rogue are introduced and slowly develop an interesting big brotherlittle sister type relationship they come into contact with both magnetos brotherhood and xaviers school and nobly opt for the latter magnetos bunch includes sabertooth toad and mystique while xaviers team includes cyclops jean grey and storm as well as adolescents iceman and pyro both groups of mutants meet and tussle at liberty island in new york harbor which is the weakest part of the film but not badwhen debuted in 2000 it was easily the best comictofilm adaption since superman 1978 and superman ii 1980 it was the precursor to all the great superhero films that came out in the 2000s and has only lost some of its allure due to the quality of many of those filmsthe movie runs 1 hour 44 minutes with several interesting deleted scenes availablegrade a,fantasy
another marvel comic book superhero adventure movie with an interesting and diverse cast my personal favorite is halle berry in a platinum blonde wig she is storm with the unique ability to control the weather nothing special about the character but halls looks awesome as usualrogueanna paquin is fooling around with her boyfriend and when she kisses him he is knocked out she discover that anyone she touches transfers their strength and memories to herian mckellen is magneto and he is a walking powerful magnet with scientific abilities regarding genetics he is also a survivor of world war 2hugh jackman is wolverine a tough fighter with claws animal senses and rapid healing powerspatrick stuart is professor charles xavier who runs a school for the gifted and although confined to a wheelchair he has unusual mental telepathic sensesthere are several other crew with various super powers and they get to showcase them throughout some very well choreographed battles with bad guys oh and did i mention that halle berry looks great in a platinum blonde wig please forgive me my obsession with her is not as good as spiderman but it is entertaining,fantasy
i have never really liked comic book adaptations all that much because they have always seemed to be to be quite dull with the exception of tintin and asterix i never really got into comic books as a kid or even as an adult in particular i never really liked superman but when one takes some of these comic books and step back and consider the world in which it is set it begins to take on a new life most comic book heroes tend to be incredibly wealthy and in their spare time they are off saving the world for super villainswhile it can be suggested that this is the case with the it is actually quite a lot more complicated than that the marvel universe has three types of people there are the normal humans like you and i then there are the heroes normal people who during their life have gained some form of superpower such as spiderman when he was bitten by the radioactive spider and finally there are the mutants people born with superpowers it is these mutants that this particular film exploresthe setup is complex first of all you have the humans than fear the appearance of these mutants and because of the powers that they possess they are threatened and as such are looking for ways to restrict and control these people that are appearing then there are the mutants themselves divided into two opposing camps there are the who are lead by professor charles xavier patrick stewart and they seek to protect and defend humanity only using their powers for good then there are the mutants who follow magneto ian mackellan who believe that because of their powers they should rule humanity there are mutants that do not follow either of these two philosophies but in this film it is these three groups that are fighting against each otherthe movie opens with rogue about to kiss her boyfriend only to discover that when she does so she drains all of the life out of him so she is forced to flee running to north canada she falls in with logan hugh jackman otherwise known as wolverine after convincing him to let her travel with him he is a loner they are attacked by mutants who are loyal to magneto but the arrive in time and take them back to the xaviers school of the gifted thes base it is from there that we begin to learn of magnetos plan to cripple humanity and pave the way for a mutant takeoverthe question with this film is the continuity while this is the first film in the series there are films that occur before hand such as wolverine in that film we discover that wolverine and sabretooth are brothers but that does not seem to come out in this film however wolverine has lost him memory we dont know how that happened at this stage but when he is told about sabretooth it seems to jog his memory slightly as for sabretooth at the end of wolverine he cries out nobody kills wolverine but me in this film this is suggested particularly when sabretooth takes a particular interest in wolverines dogtagswhen one stands back a bit and considers the movie as a whole it really comes down to magneto having a plan to make him more powerful and to rule over humanity and the going out to beat them however one thing that was a little disappointing was how easy it was to kill sabretooth he got blasted with a laser and that was it however in wolverine he was much harder to kill he had claws and like wolverine he could regenerate we see none of that here however one probably does have to consider the comics a bit more something which i really do not have the time of inclination to do however while the plot may be a little dull it is the background as well as having some heaps cool actors that attracts me to this filmthere is also the issue of discrimination and i guess it is a thing that we all need to confront discrimination is something created by fear we fear that we are going to lose our place in the world and because of that we will discriminate against another race i remember in the 80s in australia when the target of discrimination were the asians and it is true that the asians are much more populous than us we fear that by letting a few in they will then flood in and we will lose our identity and power in our country it is the same fear that rules humanity here despite the seeking the best for humanity humanity fears them and this is because it is clear that the mutants are so much more powerful than us discrimination is actually a theme that seems to not only run through all of the movies but through all of the comics as well though wolverine has a somewhat different theme running through it as does first class,fantasy
the was one of the first of the decade long superhero revivals it stands as one of the best and in many ways is a benchmark for most superhero films a lot of the action choreography will be and has been copied by many others what i find most intriguing about this film is that despite the number of superheroes and villains the film does not rely on a sequence of continuous bangs flashes and superhero power dissipation to keep the audience glued the action is perfectly and often quite finely balanced another great feature is that it is often quite a challenge getting a good meaningful performance from a number of big actors brewed together into a blockbuster that isnt the problem in this case the performances are perfectly measured and significant nevertheless in short this is a good solid family blockbuster entertainment which may yet become quite timeless,fantasy
this movie got me thinking about who is today stealing ok borrowing ideas from whom and why are original movies so scarce i really dont know am not willing to investigatewho came up first with the idea of a special school for gifted and why is everybody so obsessed with supernatural powers in todays world being simply a bit more intelligent compared to average population makes one very very special of course only a few rich get the chance to develop their intelligence and contribute to the rest of the society basically packed with idiots nevertheless the movie is pretty well done considering the template good directing appropriate acting casting could be better though at least for the supporting roles sfx and the rest of technical aspects as well as the other movies in the series 2 and last stand its a good entertainment dont expect too much if you do watch the prequel first class and have fun it is a bit more of an experience if you watch all three in a row then wolverine and finally first class the best of them all,fantasy
 is what i call the beginning of marvel and the superhero era after this movie was released eleven years ago studios have been releasing superhero movies in force i wouldnt say this is the best but its up there i had a fun time watching this movie and the great special effectsthis is a movie about mutants pretty much there are two sides a group of mutants under professor xavier and another group under the nefarious magneto pretty much magneto does not believe that humans and mutants should live together so he has plans to get rid of the humans and the mutants of xavier must stop themthe ensemble acting here is very good this is the breakout role for hugh jackman he is the best guy to portray wolverine patrick stewart and the great ian mckellan are perfect for their rival leader rolesoverall this is a fun movie with great special effects that hold up even in todays movies there is some charm and wit that i was pleased i rate this film a 910,fantasy
 is one of marvels few successful film adaptations that manages to give us a fun scifi flick while giving us a meaningful storythe good 1 patrick stewart hugh jackman and ian mckellan are acting powerhouses as professor x wolverine and magneto2 the story even though the story wasnt really in the comics it still portrays the conflict between professor x and magneto who are both fighting for the same ideal but with different points of view3 the special effects were spectacular and managed not to make the film style over substance4 the supporting cast including james marsden famke janssen and bruce davison all do a terrific job5 the score was terrific 6 the film manages to fit in some humorous parts to give the film a lighter touch in the midst of the dark tone of the film the bad 1 how rogues look and personality was much different from the comics2 halle berrys african accent when she played stormoverall this is a fun scifi flick and it is easy to see why the superhero genre has taken a successful turn since the films release this film is highly recommended and simply rocksrating 8510,fantasy
rating 75 is an introduction to the iconic characters from the comic book that has been around for more than 30 years it tells the story of two mutants rogue and wolverine who are recruited by professor x to fight the terrorist group led by an old friend magneto is the first film of the franchise it shows the audience who the are what they are why they do what they do and who the archenemy of the is and thats all it really is an introductory movie with fun and entertaining action sequences that provides background information on the characters as for performances in this film everyone was cast perfectly in their respective roles this is the role that brought the aussie actor hugh jackman to the worlds attention he shined in this film as wolverine he brings wolverine to life not with just his iconic looks as wolverine but with superb acting others also gave good supporting performances that helped hugh jackman carry the movie to perfection these actors include patrick stewart professor x ian mckellen magneto famke janssen jean grey james marsden cyclops halle berry  storm last but not least anna paquin who portrayed the young mutant marie aka rogue who ran away from home and hit the road with logan aka wolverine a special mention to the writers of this who transferred the comic book to a fun action pack 90 minute movie deals with important elements that good storytelling includes rejection loneliness hope fear distrust love selfishness power and doing what you believe is rightin conclusion succeeded what the movie set out to be a good intro movie this movie explains why magneto is the person he is or why professor x is against what magneto does now seeing this after watching  first class its so fascinating to see the relationship between these two characters after what happened in first class how they disagree with each others opinions but still have great respect for each other i cant deny that a fun time but its the type of movie that you would forget in a couple of days its a good action flick and i had fun watching it however i felt like could do some work with the soundtrack which not only was it not memorable it also reduced the intensity of the action scenes if youre looking for incredible acting and superb dialogues i wouldnt recommend to you but if you just want a good thrill ride to entertain yourself definitely check out x men,fantasy
adapting xm is a hard task because there are so many teams and so many visions here the production chooses its own path and comes to a great result if the movie is original they have captured the soul of xm and the flavor of hundred comics xm is really that evolution political issue with humans outcast and the dream of professor x say like this its seems very serious but the strength of marvel unlike the direct concurent is that the philosophy is mixed with humor here thanks wolvie to be so funnily rebellious next if spiderman could only goes for the red and blue suit it was more difficult with xm thus the futuristic and uncluttered design of the movie is a good idea i like how the x motif appeared throughout the sets and props especially the wheels of pr x locating the showdown at the statue of liberty is brilliantly symbolicnext the cast is extraordinary they are really like their penciled parts and the mix between newcomers jackman paquin and old crew stewart jansen mckellen blends totallyin conclusionits great to realize that all the movies we make reading those comics have also been shared by a true filmmaker the movie was so good that the feedback happens and this movie becomes an inspiration for the comics especially the ultimate line,fantasy
i remember watching this in theater when it first came out it was probably the first superhero movie that i thought was done right it didnt have a lot of comic book feel to the movie in my personal opinion but it was a good comic book movie it was fun and engaging from the beginning scene all the way to the end some scenes seem a bit lame at times but for the most part the action sequences were pretty good and the dialogue wasnt too bad just about every character in this movie was near excellent for there roles not all but some especially hugh jackman as wolverine i cant think of anyone else who would have played this character better it was simply near flawless this movie is directed very well and just by watching this movie i could tell bryan singer is a comic book fan or just really good at adapting even if its not completely like the comics in some aspects it still did a pretty good job with everything else7510,fantasy
 2000 the movie that treated the comic book properties seriously still stands the test of time and it is comparable and matches perfectly with the recent first class starting with the powerful introductory scene with erik lensher being forcefully introduced to his power in the form of anguish and pain that is comparable to any emotional scene from the pianist or schindlers list this is a very good start logan and rogues relationship carries the movie because of their similarities of being outcasts and very good performance on both of their part when they are together however paquin does come off a little dry when she is without her costar jackman though but this is just nitpicking the score is excellent and dramatic when it needs to be especially at magnetos defeat pure epicness logan and scotts bantering is hilarious with humor that is subtle but always hilarious i personally criticized the film by stating that powerful characters such as storm or jean should never be intimidated by a weak mutant like toad but seeing it with closer examination it makes sense how he caught them by surprise and storm looks completely badass when she rises out of the elevator granted she does state one of the worst lines in movie history to toad being what happens to a toad when he gets struck by lightning the same thing that happens to everything else ridiculous and unnecessary also it kills off the climax of seeing storm at her peak charles and erik feel like they have been friends for a long time and have genuine respect for one another and the scene at the end in the plastic prison summarizes their rivalry by comparing their battles to a chess match between old friends this is especially resonant if you have seen first class as this film perfectly matches the friendship between the two as mcavoy and fassbender were as powerful as stewart and mckellen overall the movie is definitely worth buying and is a nice companion to first class to which they tied it nicely to this movie another flaw that has to be pointed out is the fact that magneto does not seem to have that powerful essence when he used his power since he was not being as menacing when he controlled the guns for instance he just stood there and bantered with xavier for a while probably because i could not help but compare him to fassbender in first class who completely dominated that movie as magneto so im going to have to say that mckellen makes a better magneto when he is planning or more of a behind the scenes villain especially when he is with xavier and they feel as if they have a history,fantasy
backgroundlet me begin by saying ive never read a single or better yet any marvel comic book when i saw this film having no die hard fan anger over the liberties taken on this first installment of the franchise  i found this film to be good and in some parts even great the story is about people with mutated dna  mutants having special powers that differentiate them from society and label them outcasts there are three sides to the conflict in  the mutants who see themselves as the next stage in the evolution of humanity and believing they should rise up and seize the power of the world revolution then theres the mutants who feels they should work with humanity towards some sort of common ground  peace the last aspect of the conflict are the humans who are afraid of the capabilities of mutants powers story characters lives and dies primarily by its characters in this movie while many different people are brought to the table only a select few are given any depth the two chief characters that carry the weight of the film are magneto  sir ian mckellen and wolverine  hugh jackman magneto being the mutant supremacist leads to his group called the brotherhood trying to take the power from humanity wolverine is a loner with living in canada who cant remember his past coming across a special school for mutants  he begins to become an activist in the mutant conflict of the world  there are many many more characters introduced during this movie  so much so that it seems to be its entire purpose that many are left undeveloped in turn making them less interesting overall very well done with what they had to work with and setups possible plots and subplots for the sequels the story easily being the weakest component of this movie should only be an after thought in the minds of the viewer what sounds like a cheap comic book story magneto and his group of badies built a convenient machine that can turn all people it affects into defective mutants naturally it is thes job to stop them i dont want to write to much on the flaws of the story because it will diminish the already feeble attempt to make a good story moremiscellaneousthis section is for all aspects of filmmaking i havent covered yet the acting in is well done magneto proffesor x  patrick stuart and wolverine really standout for me in the film mostly due to their very different opinions on the overall conflict the director handles the movie well never letting it get to boring and his shouldnt be taken for granted since its an introductory story into a much larger world the action sequences are surprisingly weak and only one or two scenes ever standout in the whole thing the special effects were good for their time and dont really feel that dated with the exception of the mutant shape shifter mystique the setting and atmosphere of the film is pretty large with a worldwide conflict focusing on the issues of minorities and the different ways to handle a problem through revolution or peace  with the exception of the story nothing feels cheesy and it all seems rather believable because of solid acting across the boardfinal opinionthere was so many ways i could see this film failing from the artistic taste of the costumes to the special effects not holding up surprisingly though this film does work and at times it works very well this is a character driven film not story i cant stress enough how silly i find the firsts story  between that and the action are the only reasons i didnt give this film a higher rating overall the varying array of characters saves this movie with their uniqueness although some dont get enough screen time another twenty minutes of building a firmer base and understanding of the different would have done this film well not just snap shot glimpses final rating 72 10,fantasy
 is a great superhero film with great characters a simple plot and great fun wolverine is clearly the leading character yet the film allows us to enjoy the other cool characters such as storm cyclops charles xavier etc the plot is simple not in a bad way but its great the story doesnt overshadow the characters vise versa the actors were really good and had some depth also its great there was no blaspheming sexual scenes which is great this film paved the way for future superhero franchises spierman batman fantastic four etc its interesting to see that having powers is something which the government is trying to control,fantasy
 was one of the very first good adaptations of a comic book into a movie unlike many of other comic book adaptations that came years before this one that were cheesy boring and poorly made this movie took itself seriously and had a great direction good performances and great special effectsbryan singer did a great job with the comics making an excellent adaptation that made justice to the original material and also works very well as a flick completely independent of the original comic booksthe sequel was even better and the third part was a decent ending for a great trilogy this movie was quite good,fantasy
 tested the water for big budget superheroics and met with huge successbryan singers ensemble movie does so many things right 1 it starts off as a mystery to hook the audience in 2 it uses its large ensemble cast extremely well 3 it makes a star of hugh jackman 4 it delivers the brilliant stroke of casting heavyweights patrick stewart and ian mckellen as partnersadversaries xavier and lensherr giving the 3cornered conflict immense gravitas 5 it doesnt betray the expectations of any but the fussiest fans of the source material 6 and it does all this on a broad canvas which rolls out the race prejudice subtext of leekirbys original comicoh and it gets some highly varied special effects absolutely perfect and has a pretty good script tooi wouldnt say that all the casting is spot on but its close enough that i have no major quibblesthis very successful film is the biggest of big fun,fantasy
i remember when this movie came out in france some ten years ago my brother was truly a fan of those and he would regularly talk with me about them especially wolverine ten years later i decided solemnly to watch the movie and guess what i liked it though the plot is very simple the action is far more better as well as the dialogs so that you cannot be bored all the film long  which is only 90 min long  besides the fxs are not aging of course you can easily pinpoint them in the course of the movie but really that is no pain in the  the question that i asked after i saw this movie was  who on earth is wolverine  i used to read the comics but i was surely too young to understand for what i remember the characters are pretty close to the comics  except the disguise i particularly liked the mystique character who is to my mind very welldone knowing that she probably was the most difficult superhuman to release i mean physically you can see the makeup in several shots the only criticism that i may add to this review is that the end is too prompt while i hoped to learn what had happened to mystique sabretooth and toad that is probably the reason why i am going to watch the sequel tonight if you have not seen the movie yet and it turns out that you hesitate to watch it or buy it for christmas do it you will be entertained for sure and if you become a fan that is up to you but know that you are not alone ,fantasy
three years had gone since the disastrous batman  robin the movie had destroyed the batman movie franchise and still today the low point of comic book movies then the genre was back on its feet with this smart and serious yet also fun and entertaining film first of all the cast has been chosen with great respect for the characters hugh jackman is spot on as the beerdrinking savage antihero wolverine patrick stewart is the one and only professor x ian mckellen is wonderful as magneto and famke janssen isnt half bad as jean grey but great actors wont work without a solid screenplay and while the movie does have minor plot holes the story is unpredictable and well paced enough to keep you invested of course some characters have not enough time to develop in an hour and a half movie but thats ok because then the movie would have been much to slow director bryan singer is obviously aware that the comics themes of fear of the unknown is to be taken seriously but there is also a touch of humor and selfirony that makes deliciously self aware it doesnt really have that many action scenes but those there are really do entertain all in all a great achievement for comic book movies,fantasy
now to be honest it took me a few years to find this movie to be any good strangely i did not like this movie very much when i first saw it because it was quite different than the comics and television shows after getting a little older and watching it a few more times it grew on me i now recognize this movie as a classic superhero film that helped pave the way for other comic book moviesthe movie does away with the colorful costumes of the comics in favor of all black suits for what this film was trying to do i actually think changing the costumes was the right way to go the film was covering some pretty serious themes and the colorful costumes would have taken away from the seriousness has just the right tone seriousness and believability to work the plot focuses on the war between mutants and regular humans with professor xavier trying to make peace and magneto trying to fight against them the acting is a huge part of why this movie works patrick stewart as professor xavier and ian mckellen as magneto was the best casting choices that could have been made both men brought so much to their characters hugh jackmon as wolverine was also probably the best casting choice that could have been made hugh was fantastic as wolverine the downfall of this film is the lack of screen time for some of the characters such as cyclops and jean grey they try to make us care about wolverine being in love with jean grey but we dont know her enough to really care cyclops is the most important in the comics and he barely has anything to do in the movie anytime he is on screen there doesnt even seem to be a purpose other than hes there because he was in the comics another downfall is that the movie lacks that epicness that it could have had although its a cool movie and it entertains the movie does leave you kind of disappointed it ends with a generic battle against the bad guys and nothing about the mutant rights is ever resolved is very important to the superhero and comic book movie genre overall is certainly missing that certain something that could have made it great but its still a good movie and it is a great set up for x2,fantasy
mutants are feared and hated they have special abilities that humans dont magneto is a mutant who believes a war is brewing between mutants and mankind so he sets out to turn everyone into a mutant professor xavier and his team of believe mankind is good and can live peacefully with mutants they must stop himthere have been many comic book films before the most notable ones are superman and batman yet there have even been lesser known comic book characters getting their big screen debut before the mutants tank girl blade and the crow all got their chance and they did pretty well well maybe not tank girl but i think it was that kick started this wave of comic book films that we have today 2 years later we got spiderman and then every other film coming out was based on a comic book ten years later still remains to be one of the better adaptationsthe key role in the success of this film was the casting choices patrick stewart as professor charles xavier is not only a stroke of genius but the most obvious choice newcomer hugh jackman gives us a dead on portrayal of logan aka wolverine and since this film has become a superstar in hollywood even getting his own film origins wolverine ian mckellen plays the villain magneto and even though his physical appears make him appear fragile his use of speech and demeanor make him terrifying in a unique way you believe that he is as dangerous as they say being a big fan of the comics i was anticipating this film with a big smile on my face i liked it then and as i mentioned earlier it still holds up today there are some shoddy special effects that jump out at you more now than ever but as a whole this comic book adaptation hits the right notes bryan singer uses homosexuality as a comparing theme for mutants being a homosexual himself he seemed to be able to portray the issues of separation and isolation that mutants feel this is further explored in the sequeli can help but feel that by the films conclusion they could have gone a little bigger the conflict between sabretooth and wolverine is not as engaging as a fan of the comics would want and the changing of rogue into the jubliee character from the animated series might rub some people the wrong way sabretooth is not as vicious as he could be and rogue is an annoying teenage girl is a good film that is shy of being great everything that was mishandled here was made right in the sequel proved that comic book films can be smart and not just for fansgeeks who collect comics,fantasy
 bryan singer 2000 is a superior comic book yarn thanks to intelligent writing and deft characterisation alongside the whizzbang thrills anna paquin is rogue a teenage girl who goes for her first kiss and leaves the recipient in a coma shes one of a breed of mutants left with powers they cant control after a leap forward in evolution allying herself with a fellow mutant cage fighter wolverine hugh jackman rogue is taken under the wing of professor xavier patrick stewart who wants to forge a peaceful future for mutants and humans alike unfortunately his old ally magneto ian mckellen thinks a war is brewing and is keen to get in some preemptive strikes ideally using the superpowers of xaviers students the film has its shortcomings relying too heavily on cgi effects  which date very quickly and dont really have the requisite movie magic  and failing to flesh out several minor characters but its a very wellscripted engaging film sometimes funny frequently touching and with impressive star turns from paquin and jackman,fantasy
i think i watched this in the theater i thought oh no im not into comic book heroes movies the 90s was a great example of how comic book heroes sucked on the big screen is by far in the top 10 of super hero flicks meant for a specific audience it is spectacular because of its great fx but also because of the special comic book vibe i truly bought it the characters are great and should please fansthe characterization is perfect the social message works perfect and adds this special vibe of heroism they have faith principles and special powers now thats what i expected in a super hero flick the direction is solid dynamic spectacular demonstration of how big budgets work whenever its done with a heart,fantasy
ill admit im not one for origin stories even with the original superman the movie iron man and the rebooted batman begins im thoroughly impatient for them to get to what i camepaid for to see the character in the suit that said i enjoyed every minute of even the nazi introi dont even know how they couldve made these characters any more interesting especially wolverine hugh jackman who seemed to fit perfectly in those claws and though most of the superheroes were younger the main characters were much older  a rarity in superhero movies that was refreshing to see more of an adult and comic book adventuredr xavier stewart has taken the high road in educating young runaway mutants at his school while his old pal eric or magneto mckellen curved left and wants to prove to the world mutants are the next big thing by any means he feels necessary pretty much both were at opposite ends of the same goal mutant acceptance unfortunately this is an ageold story of true life wars on racism and homophobia and it never seems to end here in at least we can enjoy an adventure movie while learning tolerancei definitely liked both characters and stewart was perfect for his role but mckellen was delicious as the deep magneto he played the bad guy as not so bad if you pull back the layersmeanwhile we have a least a dozen other characters all given a perfect amount of time to develop and make us care who lives or dies wolverine a personal favorite of mine probably has the biggest background so much so they continue his journey into his sordid past through 2 sequels and a spin off enough already but its also the most interesting this time around the weakest is rogue paquin and like wolverine they stretch out her story to the thinnest level in sequels to comewhile some of the characters were as weak as rogue  namely cyclops marsden most were awesome to watch and even better on how each persons power and personality fed off each other to further the plot alongand speaking of whichmagneto has developed the power to make us mortals into the evolved mutants and plans to use a summit to prove mutants are superior its the to the rescue though the movie had a decent budget it almost felt like they held back a little avoiding some of the more popular characters so they could test the waters obviously for further installments that was probably the movies biggest flaw they didnt do that with superman the movie or batman thankfully the film was a deservedly hit and they were able to expandthis movie is highly recommended great action score acting depth originality anda message i would even say to see it for noncomic book fans if they ever make a justice league movie or the avengers lets hope its even a 110 of how great this movie was,fantasy
at first i did not really care for this film because it was not true to the comic book story but an old friend of mine gave me some advice just take it as a story from a different point of view once i did that i really found this movie to be quite enjoyablethe overall story is probably a little sub par in comparison to x2 and the last stand it is by far the weakest of the three where there are now four titles out we are accustom to the actors in the roles that they play but when this originally came out i was astounded at the near spoton job that they did with the cast from wolverine to professor x to magneto i feel as though they did a wonderful job getting the characters to look like who they are supposed to be and then there are new renditions such and the visually interesting mystique however that being said i feel that they really missed the boat on sabertooth and to a lesser extent rogue there could have been better actors to play each part and the character of sabertooth could have definitely been more interesting on a side note they didnt get it right in origins wolverine either the action was cool and had they not had to spend time with character introductions they might have had more time to develop a better story but for what it is its a good movie to see to get you amped up for the superior sequels that follow,fantasy
we all know wolverine now the you get thousands of mutants  their opposer senator robert kelly  their patriot magneto who uses extreme measures to attack the mutants okay the plot is that a mysterious man by the name of wolverine gets attacked by sabretooth  is saved by the  he joins them to fight magneto this is a true comic book film that is great in every aspect except 1 part wolverine is supposed to be an ultimate killing machine  he didnt kill anybody rebecca rojimn has already been in the punisher  she did a great job as mystique bryan singer did a better job at directing than eieter brett ratner or gavin hood this is a marvel movie worth seeing rating 1010,fantasy
i am not a fan of the comic book  never read it that i recall but one of the things that bothers me is the role changes they made in the moviethe professor is abrupt with wolverine defending his mind games with gorgeous jean  which apparently lead her to the dark side of the force this sets us up for his demise we are disappointed especially since new students with new abilities and problems coming to his school would be an ideal setting for continues the series but not sad in the previous movie the evil magneto wants the mutants to dominate the world because of their superior powers this cause is muted in this movie instead the evil magneto is merely fighting for humane treatment of mutants one cant help but feel that he is right a majority of mutants will choose the cure except for those who excel at sports entertainment and finance and become normal not only that but he is right about society too at first it will pressure young mutants to conform when they dont and more mutants dominate the lucative industries society will force the cure upon them so in this movie the audience is left siding with the evil magneto instead of the democratic professorthe best of the 2006 movie season may be upon us for it is far too early for even whispers of what hollywood contenders for the golden oscar await us three very good blockbusters fill the start of summer for action movie lovers the only other big action movie left to make the season that comes to mind is the painted face of captain jack sparrow ok superman with kevin spacey as the evil lex luther might be good so far each of these thrillers provides the goods while not better than king kong or lord of the rings none of them was worse either they are not too long or too blurry with cgi effects therefore it is hard for me to pick a favorite among themthe superstar status of tom cruise and modern weapons of mi3 provides a worldly edge to the first the fantastic scope of powers and sights provides the hook in the comic book world of the last think sokurt russell is on a roll with what two three movies in a row this only proves what women know so well their shelf life is short no more so shorter than in the blink of hollywoods eye while the staying power of mens graceful aging endures in poseidon russell and josh lucas whose name i will now remember give memorable performances in a fresh gripping remake of the watery adventurebecause some new movie theaters do have larger screens and sometimes slightly better sound than big ole horn systems each of these thrillers rate 78 s on my dollar scale worth the price of theater admission this scale also includes the lower cost of rental and that is true i think this trio is worth renting at the video store but if i were the producers i would not be rushing them into stores just yetownership well i am not the one to ask as much as i enjoy the thunder of master  commander total recall and u571 again and again for my reviews i generally prefer to watch even mediocre new fare over a repeat costing several times the price,fantasy
 is a decent comic book film not quite as good as some of the ones we have nowadays but i still think its a good film i didnt even think it was the best in the series i preferred x2 is from director bryan singer who has done some damn good films like the usual suspects singer does a good job with the first two films and shouldve stayed with this series instead he left the films for superman returns which wasnt so good i found that film irritating and too long none of the films are that long and they kept my interest the are cooler more unique and more interesting than superman a big chunk of the are interesting like wolverine who had an unexplained cast until his prequel came out i also like rogueanna paquin mystiquerobecca romajnstamosis sort of sexy but kind of blue i even think that magnetoian mckellan even though hes an evil bastard i cant quite understand why hes evil though i feel sorry for him because he was in a concentration camp is a well made comic book film that deserves more credit than its received it isnt quite the best in the series but its a good entry i wont go into much detail with the plot but i think is definitely a recommendation,fantasy
this film is based on the lives of americas greatest heroes the men and women who were both experimented on and exposed to radioactive radiation and subsessfully their cells changed them into freaks the american government ran these tests in secrecy in the hope to make an army of super soldiers who could attack the germans and french in the first world war between 19701952 the government hoped to give one man the powers of a spider one the powers of a bat one the powers of a superintendent etc of course things went wrong and they all escaped into hiding the natural human dna meant that good people stayed good and didnt want to fight the english while the bad humans went worse and decided to gang up and destroy the world this is why there are bad and good guys any time you see a film or book or tv with goodies and bad guys it is because of this incident known as the holy resolution this was mostly a secret until one of the robots auptocop i think befriended a young boy called stanley and told him his story stanley decided to write comics for a living when he grew up and thus comics were bornthe is one of stanleys most famous and least known works having been turned into a book a play an ice theatre a series of tv series and a series of movies there have been countless toys posters cds featuring all our favourite xers singing in their favourite styles wolfy sings death metal xwafer sings morissey covers storm sings naked rnb jean gay just cries for 3 minutes gandalf does progcountry rogue sings blues songs about rapin and a killin hambit does reggae debbie does dallas and memento sings old shakespeare bits but in rapping couplets you get the idea of course there are plenty of action figures and other junk top tramps playing cards vehicles games for your home video game entertainment computer system the one for the nintendy segibox in 1984 a rolling beat you up is a particle favourite posters bed quilts condoms featuring humphry jackmans face on them bubbly gum guns gum shields gun shields paint ladders mp3 players diapers shaped like captain jean luc pickals head phones and answering machines and of course staplesthis is the first movie based on the comic which was based on the real events of the second world war which was in turn based on the vietnam war stanley pops up in the film as a young boy being crushed to death by a tree sadly this actually occurred and stanley is still alive the film shows some of the histories of some of the main characters but i was quite annoyed that superman wasnt in it he could have just punched all the bad guys across to india anyway magenta wants revenge for something that happened once and he tries to recruit wolfy and raque as they are very strong he wants as many as possible so that he can turn the statue of liberty into a giant sentinel which will then crush all the cities of america meaning he will become rich and indestructionable some of the fights and excitements here are second to none second only to the second film which has scenes which are second to none except when comparing them to those in the first the fight on top of her majesty liberty is a good and when the statue comes alive and walks through new york it look like nothing can stop them she eventually climbs the entire state building and is about to eat everyone inside when slimer being carried in rogues bra jumps out and leaves a trail of slime around the top so liberty loses her grip and falls into the ocean carrying all the bad xers with her hooray but will they return for a sequel probably not one extra note the music here is very good written by jon willyams and merging his previous scores from other superhero movies like big transformers and the princley bridebest scene when wolfmarine is fighting beastor with trees its like croucing tiger hiding lager but with 200 foot redwoods being swung around instead of swords it is truly a sight to behead,fantasy
im too young to have ever read or even had a glimpse at any marvel comic so i watched this movie having no clue about the or their story i only had other super hero movies to compare to such as spiderman and fantastic four in my opinion doesnt compare to the other marvel films out there its a film on its own not your average comic book adaption it has more action than you could wish for a brilliant cast of actors and seems to have everything and moreother superhero movies out there have a very power rangers feel to them i feel which make them too young and they hold back from the hardcore action we want to see but doesnt shy away from the violence the occasional swearing and the pure emotion and sense of actual danger and mystery that other super hero movies miss out onthere is a real sense of threat throughout which makes it so much more enticing and entertainingi thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish each character was given their own part to play their own meaning and given pretty much an equal amount of screen time which i know the sequels ever so slightly lackedfor the first in the trilogy an excellent movie that i can easily watch again and again and not tire of its quick full of action and funny one liners really good acting theret not one faultits a movie to see and enjoy,fantasy
i gotta say that this movie started the beginning of a great adventure because it was so cool even though its almost 10 yrs old its still ini love the cast with halle berry and hugh jackman and james mardsen my favorite characters would be those three wolverine storm and cyclops they all have really cool powers in fact i gotta say that this movie is much better than the original comicbook from back in the 90s and i remember because i used to read them when i was like 9 or 10 the movie in my opinion has more detail and more action and even though some of the characters in the whole movies didnt exist in the early comics they still make the movie good i gotta give it a 1010 xellent movie to watch highly recommended to watch,fantasy
ive always enjoyed watching comic book and comic strip characters come alive on screen whether tv or movies even the cheesy serials of the 1940s  50s were wonderful to watch as kids with spiderman and now this genre has been reborn as for i couldnt agree more with the superlatives used by reviewers here brian singer has given this film energy style and class sophistication believability and he has raised the genre to a new level not being a previous follower i can say with honesty that he introduced us to the many characters and their world superbly and told a terrific story to boot what a challenge that had to be the cast is so perfect from wolverine hugh jackman on down to sabretooth tyler mayne who wed like to see more of the special effects are absolutely dazzling the music score cinematography everything is so perfect singer and his cast have made these complex characters believable and that alone is astounding kudos must go to stan lee who has a cameo in the film the genius behind and the marvel comics empire now his unique imagination can be shared with moviegoers even better is the fact that this is just part 1 of a trilogy and hopefully there will be more films to come,fantasy
i base this on the 15 dvd one option of that is to watch this with six extended scenesthat add character moments and vary in quality and 17 behind the scenes segmentsthat all automatically come on at their specific times and i dont believe you can view any of these 23all of which last between 30 seconds and several minutes without also seeing the film this brought graphic novels back onto the silver screen and proved toreminded us that they can be excellent after joel schumacher took unsuspecting theatergoers back to some of the worst of the 60sthe colors man taking a note from burtons two batman entries singer who is by the way clearly very talented and completely made this thing come together chose to make the costumes less showy in general he made it a lot more realistic and whilst keeping the point as sharp the theme as poignant as it should be made this accessible to a much larger audience those who have never opened a comic book while they wont quite get everything will still be able to understand and enjoy this the biggest issue in this honestly the whole series of movies is the amount of people there are too many and most of them get so little time and development their personalities are as twodimensional as the drawings instead of as layered as they are at their best on those same pages this probably should have been a tv series or at least a mini but maybe there arent enough out there whod sit down for that meanwhile superman gets one yet the heroes where the message is one of accepting those that are different i digress the abundance of superpowerwielding ones also means that efforts have to be taken to continually explain why they arent using them in that situation and even that doesnt always work out perfectly the abilities are depicted rather nicely however and theyre written in well this and the second one contain some of the best shapeshifting stuff in motion pictures there are fantastic and effective reveals in this the effects are very welldone and it isnt that evident that the budget is slightly lower than the typical summer blockbuster amount the casting is almost entirely spoton jackman is wolverine mane could barely be a better sabretoothhes got the physique and he didnt have to do much acting mckellan as magneto heck even romijn whos really a model does well and fits there are good strong women in this the pacing is perhaps uneven it should be known that this is a science fiction piece with action sequencesthey are marvelous though dont get me wrong not the other way around there are fun injokes and references in this all of the humor is great really the attention to detail is incredible there is mild violence and language and neither are excessive this comes with a commentary by the director well worth listening to the second disc has extras including five featurettes interviews tests galleries trailers and other material i recommend this to any fan and anyone who likes scifi andor thrillers 810,fantasy
the reason that this film is one of the best comic movies yet is simply because of the characters especially wolverine played by hugh jackman is a very interesting character hes rather funny cool and has an interesting past and if you have some interesting characters youll need some interesting actors that was the case in this film we have hugh jackman patrick stewart our own famke janssen and ian mckellen who all brought their characters alivebut i think this film is too busy it was like having a spectacular climax in every five minutes of the film there were just too many visual effects sometimes it just became too much i think it had been better if the filmmakers took a little more time to tell the story what about a running time of 120 minutes instead of 104 fortunately they solved that in x2 which has a running time of 133 minutesthe plot was rather good actually it was renovating it differed from normal superhero movies from which the normal structure is normal man  something weird happens to him  he gets special powers  he uses them for the good  another man gets powers too but uses them for the bad  fight between the superhero and the villain this film wasnt a film in which the good fight against the bad there was just no clear line between good and bad and i thought that worked out very well it isnt a clich story about simple superheroes this is a more realistic story where superpowers are seen as some kind of diseaseand i finish my review with a little minus point that is the music i love to see superhero movies which have beautiful themes in it think of spiderman and batman those films have very well composed music i missed that in this film there was no concrete theme in it and the rest of the music wasnt rather special eitherso is a very nice story about people who have gifts not about superheroes who save people but something much more interesting there were good characters in it which were portrayed great by the actors they only had to take more time to tell the story it seemed a bit overstuffed to me,fantasy
 and its sequels have always been notable for standing out from other superhero films the reason for this distinction probably lies in the universe the films portray a pseudoscience fictional take on a near future reality where a conflict is brewing between ordinary human beings and the people who are considered the next step in the evolution of man mutants the mutants are of course a metaphor for the discrimination rampant in the world on the basis of caste creed religion gender and orientation the mythos simply puts a scifi spin on a realworld problem and takes it to a whole new level discrimination on the basis of genetic makeup once you understand this to be the context of these films you will realize exactly what sets the apart from other superheroes mutants are not just people born with extraordinary and superhuman powers and abilities they are also a minority fighting for their civil rights hiding from a world which fears and often hates them and as with any other minority in the world there are two opposing factions among the mutants as well the hardliners who wish to eliminate their opposition and thus spare their brethren from persecution and the negotiators who wish to resolve the conflict by means of peaceful negotiation and cooperation founded on mutual trust and benefits in the film the former camp is represented by magneto ian mckellen and his brotherhood of mutants the latter camp is represented by proffesor charles xavier patrick stewart and his the plot of the film itself is quite simple and serves merely as an introduction to this dark world which shall be explored in greater scope in the next two films the film for the most part follows the stories of two characters rogue anna paquin and wolverine hugh jackman as they are drawn into the humanmutant conflict and find themselves before long at the centre of it wolverine in particular is a character who will be greatly explored in the sequels as well as in the upcoming prequel film the other are not particularly developed much though the actors have done a pretty good job with their portrayal xavier and magneto ultimately become seen more as representatives of their respective ideologies than characters in themselves both are ultimately of the same type of personalitygreat leaders willing to spread their ideologies through the actions of their followers so while this film is certainly no where near as intricate and suspenseful as x2 or epic as the vastly underrated the last stand it is nevertheless an excellent prologue into an interesting scifi world which in many ways is a twisted reflection of our own,fantasy
 as a whole has to be one of the best things marvel have trundled out so far each of the marvel films shares a similar look which helps to realise each of these characters are in the same universe the first works well largely because it abandons any attempt to fill in a long overwrought origins story see spiderman iron man etc and just jumps right in there particular highlights of the cast include a hardened hugh jackman on growling form as wolverine ian mckellen as magento and patrick stewart who holds it all together as professor x whats great about this film is that it focuses on the team dynamic something director bryan singer made his name for in the usual suspects we have a good even spread of all the instead of being bogged down dealing with just one its also rather satisfying to see the baddie mutants magneto et all making life difficult especially for the slimy senator kelly as you would expect the graphics are spot on and there are some very memorable fight scenes a worthy superhero movie,fantasy
ive never read an comic in my life despite being a moderate fan of comics read a lot but have no clue about dc or marvel chronology and the big events going on right now and what not so i have no prior relationship to the material the movies thematic preoccupations are obvious and probably come from the comics the mutants are fighting for a world which hate them the discrimination against the mutants in the world of the is similar to racism and discrimination by sexual preference in our world nothing much is done with these concepts they are merely presented the cast is generally good but i was only really charmed by hugh jackman as wolverine i still dont see why bryan singer is so relatively highlyregarded he seems to me a basically competent director but nothing special at all i saw nothing even remotely special about the writing or direction or cinematography in this film the action scenes are only moderately entertaining overall this is on the same level as spiderman and not on par with nolans batman films iron man or the hellboy films not bad just nothing special and im kind of surprised this was such a huge hit i will still watch x2 mostly because i have heard very few negative things about it and the world is mildly intriguing,fantasy
in a world where children born with strange and dangerous powerswhether they be the ability to read minds to control the weather or even walk through walls are feared and outcast professor charles xavierpatrick stewart a mutant with the power to read and manipulate anothers mind has created an environment a school where mutants can feel safe and welcome wolverine hugh jackman and rogueanna paquin two wandering mutants find solace here for a short time but are soon thrust into the action as a powerful mutant by the name of magnetoian mckellen plans to unleash disaster on the unsuspecting publicfirst and foremost i am not a comic book fan from that you can conclude that i never read any of the comics so when i approached the film i held no bias as to what i should expect i wasnt looking for the same film a fan might of have been looking for i was looking for a good time and thats just what i gotone thing i really appreciated was that the line between super hero and super villain was blurred distinctly the mutants can act as a metaphor for all minorities that exist today and the film presents this in a way that is not subtle but not inyourface either humans hate and fear mutants who we as an audience in a slightly different universe can see as kind caring angry depressed knowledgeable moralhumane beings mutants in general are neither bad nor good but human and the title of hero or villain comes only in how certain characters react to the prejudice thrust upon them by humanity some might say that charles xavier is moronic for protecting the ones that hate and fear him is magneto right for wanting to change the state of the world in order to favor his own kind though the bad guys are usually more ugly and visually less human then their heroic counterparts the idea is still in the air that not all is as well defined as one may think the film opens with a harrowing scene that leads the audience to sympathize with the lead villainvisually is a definite treat there are just so many memorable and surprisingly well executed shots in this film i love the first time the audience witness wolverines blades pushing through his skin the first time we see jean grey exhibiting her telekinetic power perhaps my favorite shot in the entire film is when the powerful shape shifter mystique changes her appearance in the middle of performing a mid air spinning kick to her opponent the fight scenes are all very well choreographed filmed with a great eye and not too over the top or extravagant there is a great variety of locations visited in the run of the 104 minute viewing time from a vast snowy canadian landscape to the almost futuristic school facility to a mysterious island and more these mutants are always on the move and the audience is alongside them for the ride the film also sounds quite good with some impressive sound effects and a very fitting score by michael kamenthe film progresses at a very smooth fluid pace building itself up to an explosive climax atop one of the worlds grandest attractions the script written by david hayter strongly develops the mutants the world in which they live and their reactions to it the films script also has a nice sense of humor to it special effects wise is a blast visual effects such as a certain characters watery demise are meticulously crafted and designed for the audiences enjoyment the mutant effects and make up where also extraordinary most notably the beautifully and expertly crafted mystique costume consisting of air brushed dye and prosthetics that look ridiculously life life the acting for the most part is very good the only two performances here i didnt totally enjoy where halle berrys performance as storm and anna paquins performance as rogue maybe it was the accents these girls spoke with but both of their performances seemed pretty bad compared to the rest of the castanother of the films flaw that i found is the view on evolution that is so strongly held since i am not a believer in evolution this hardened view did not set well with me not to the point that i couldnt enjoy the film but just enough to make note of this is much more of a personal issue than a technical flaw with the film is a visually stunning special effects film that has some great substance to behind all the glam fans of the comic books seem to have taken kindly to the heros and antiheroes jump to the big screen and as a casual movie goer i had quite an enjoyable time810,fantasy
if theres anything 90s movies did wrong its that they botched the superhero genre namely with the slew of bad batman sequels however closes out the 20th century with hope that between special effects and renewed focus on characters the genre is on the way upwhile 2002s spiderman was the film that really transformed the genre by use of the origin story wasnt far off with its choice to tell the story with emphasis on a few of the characters a comic book like where there are multiple heroes on a team instead of one masked crusader could have been adopted horribly with too many different characters trying to share the spotlight bryan singer the usual suspects picks fan favorite wolverine hugh jackman as the focus and a vehicle by which to introduce the viewer to the world he also chooses rogue anna paquin to demonstrate that teenage feeling of being different and hiding from the world that makes such a human story lastly he develops only magneto ian mckellen of all the villains to set the stage for the greater conflict between humans and mutants that will carry over into the sequels the other mutants are used for visual fluff to further the story or to please comic fans while youd like to see all the mutants get attention this is a concession singer knows he must make to avoid his film crashing and burningthe films weak point is the general plot or evil scheme while the movie is mostly based around scenes that are revealing of character and show how each mutant deals with his or her abilities this element of the film remains takeovertheworld focused with a bill on the verge of being passed that could force all mutants to register with the government magneto and the brotherhood of mutants villains sabertooth toad and the shapeshifting mystique plot to launch a radiation attack on a un assembly in new york that would turn all the worlds leaders into mutants professor x patrick stewart and his plan to stop them believing peaceful cooperation with humans is the only way to get things donetheres not a ton of action in the film the fight scenes are short and far from exhilarating instead hopes that a few scant special effects and mutants demonstrating their powers will be enough to entertain you it does but not in an exciting way this is not a full throttle blockbuster its a movie about characters with special abilities that affect their livessinger does a great job bringing this franchise to the screen while moviegoers love great action its nice to see a superhero film handled with sensitivity and being about what makes the so likable not simply about bringing them to life and having them fight each other thats where his camerawork like when rogue notices wolverines knuckles on the steering wheel and asks him if it hurts makes an impact his goal is to get you in touch with the charactersthe stylish suits are secondary while youd like to see characters like halle berrys storm or james marsdens cyclops be more than just a suit with a special power the specific character focus is still good enough this movie essentially prioritizes characters and good storytelling over the action number of villains that hollywood once thought was the most important aspect that alone is something superhero movie fans cant ever be too thankful for,fantasy
exceptional is perhaps one of the best comic book adaptions ever made it has the style and humor the comic did plus a little more just for your entertainment is a very well made and exceptionally well acted film that will have you on the edge of your seat throughout and you will also get a good dose of humor too this film delivers what most comic book films dont a sturdy well made film that allot of recent comic book films have followed iron man the incredible hulk spider man the fantastic four they all follow the example that set up its a film that you can look back twenty years from now and still call it the best it doesnt matter how old you are or if you even read the comic books or watch the original animated show is the movie that youll want to see over and over again i very highly recommended this great film i hope my review helps cr lopez 1212009,fantasy
i have to admit i hired this movie purely as part of a hugh jackman fan phase however i think the movie delivered far more than i required of it a lovely surpriseive never read a comic strip in my life so i cant compare the film with the comic series and to be honest i wouldnt want to whatever the comic series may have or have had the film stands strong enough all on its ownthe writing of the wolverine character was brooding intriguing and totally believable and hugh jackman slipped into the part with his usual ease and extraordinary charisma anna paquin as rogue was awkward at times but seamless at others perhaps she has a great deal of natural talent as long as she can be made to relax and forget about the acting i expect she will continue to develop into an excellent actress mckellen and stewart were perfect in their roles but i would have liked more screen time with storm as i felt her character was underdeveloped on screen and halle berry is capable of great thingsas for the special effects they blended into the background just as i feel special effects should due to the powers of the mutants special effects are crucial to the basic plot and it was great to see the director and designers creating effects that served the story with complete obedience rather than dazzling and distracting the film after all is not about the powers but about the choices of the people use or abuse themthe story flowed well the pacing was just right and the plot was easy to understand but still captivating the characters were recognisable and the themes were universal in short the script had all the compulsory characteristics of a typical pop film however a fantastic collaborative effort between director writers actors and designers has ensured that x men does not feel stale instead this is an excellent film to relax to and easy to watch with friends,fantasy
thanks to the trend started by marvel comics first movie the comic bookmovie genre has become the dominant force in the cinema marvel has planned four more movies leading to the avengers spiderman 4 has been announced and a new daredevil movie is rumored to be in the works christopher nolan rocked the summer with the dark knight all of these movies are possible because of the legitimacy brought to the genrepatrick stewarts opening statement explains that new mutations are causing the evolutionary process to take a giant leap members of the new species derisively called mutants possess supernatural powers that cause some regular humans to hate them congress led by senator robert kelly bruce davison is considering a law that would require every mutant to register with the government as do sex offendersa mutant named magneto ian mckellen survived hitlers holocaust and worries that the mutant registration act will begin a new one professor charles xavier patrick stewart believes in taking every step needed to avoid violent conflict cyclops james marsden storm halle barry and jean grey famke janssen who is also a physician stand with xavier magnetos followers are sabertooth tyler mane who seems to hate wolverine mystique the lovely rebecca romijn and toad ray park who also played darth maul wolverine hugh jackman and runaway teenager rogue anna paquin are the newcomers to xaviers school for the giftedwhereas movies such as spiderman and daredevil contain two or fewer characters with supernatural powers it can be easy for a script to grow excessive with the legion of characters in the universe writer david hayter best known as the voice of solid snake in the metal gear solid video games demonstrates good selfdiscipline he and director brian singer limit the mutant count to ten although each possesses a unique look does not differentiate the characters on that trait alone only two wield similar powers and the script includes a conversation distinguishing the two the introduction of these powers provides much of the entertainment early i watched the television show as a child yet was not familiar with some characters capabilitiessome of the personalities are poorly realized but hayter and singer compensate with small details such as toads quirky attitude and mystiques sultry body language some have complained that cyclops is boring judging by what i hear from the comic book enthusiasts marsdens character is translated on target cyclops mr morality personality is much like supermans unlike in the two sequels which totally cheated him cyclops plays a pivotal role in the story magneto is the most effectively developed character his horrific childhood motivates him he does not desire power or wish to exterminate all of humanity he takes drastic action only when he cannot see better optionswith the future of comic book movies in serious trouble after batman and robin 20th century fox allotted the production team only 75 million dollars some of the visual effects look shoddy and occasionally the timing is wrong such as during the incident where wolverine is hurled backwards that said the fights utilize the mutants abilities inventively and the choreography is above average the only problem is the use of the hangtime error the hangtime error occurs when a character flies threw the air but does not fall closer to the ground thankfully it appears only twice the two outstanding scenes are magnetos answer to a police siege and the wolverine fights during the climax the display good teamwork in their missions especially at the end sadly neither of the sequels comes close to matching itactingwise halle barry drew disapproval from the nation she is not great but not bad either apparently i am not familiar enough with the drawn character to know what causes the uproar mckellen stewart jackman and paquin perform the best paquin has the most demanding role most people seemingly do not realize how tough it is to show the depth of emotion she does in the climax without being corny wolverine is an angry and independent person at times it looks like jackman is readying himself to bite somebody stewart inhabits professor x as well as he does captain picard and no other actor has the combination of appearance and acting specialty to better ian mckellens magnetomovies based on comic books had a bad name when was released in 2000 batman and superman were the two franchises to come before it both eventually jumped the shark and into unfunny wackiness had to convince the public that comic book inspired films can still take their subject matter seriously it did and i assign the most credit to david hayter although the series eventually jumped the shark itself stabilized the comic book movie with its skillful construction and sober but not somber atmosphere,fantasy
i must state in advance that this film was my introduction to the so i had no preconceived ideas about what the characters should look like or how they should behave as fans of previous versions would understandably haveset in a world where mutants with super powers exist the story opens during the second world war were a young jewish boy is being separated from his parents in a concentration camp as the guards try to pull him away from them the iron gates start to buckle and they are pulled towards them after this introduction the action moves to the present day where we are introduced to rogue a young girl who sucks the life out of anybody she touches when she runs away from home she heads to canada where she meets wolverine a man who heals from any injury and has had metal parts attached to his skeleton including long claws that he can produce at will as they drive along they are ambushed by a large man who we later learn is called sabretooth thankfully they are rescued by two other mutants who go by the names storm and cyclopsthe next time we see them they are at a strange school where mutant children are taught by professor xavier he explains that there are two factions of mutants one led by himself that wants to live peacefully with normal people and the other led by magneto the young boy from the opening scene who believes that the only way for them to survive is to prepare for a war with humanitythe rest of the film follows xaviers as the try to foil magnetos plans which seem to involve wolverine for reasons the professor cant understandi really enjoyed this film the characters were interesting and well acted and while the plot was the standard save the world type one expects in such movies it did have a few surprises and the actions scenes are fairly exciting im sure everybody will have their own favourite mutants mine are rogue played by anna paquin for the good guys and mystique who can change shape to look like anybody else for the bad guys,fantasy
in x1 there was the attempt by magneto played superbly by ian mckellan to convert humans to mutants in x2 it was a plot by a corrupt fed to kill all the mutants using xavier patrick stewart in x3 a cure is found that makes all mutants human cure indeed who said the mutants were sick such is the view of the mutant selfproclaimed leader magneto in the final chapter magneto fears that the cure will be forced upon the mutant population and wages war against the source of the cure with the aim to destroy it and anything that gets in his and his loyal followers way all three movies are suspenseful and exciting no bathroom break urges in these films new mutants are hatched in each film and some of our favorite mutants are dispatched quite early on in x3 special effects are 5stars if youve not seen any of the movies or all of the movies in the trilogy this 3pack is a great opportunity to see a classic tale in chronological order and own a classic 3part tale in the genre that belongs in any scifi fans collection hugh jackman is excellent in the toughguy roll as wolverine we like you better as a tough guy hugh halle berry storm anna paquin rogue james marsden cyclops and rebecca romijn mystique are all spoton too and famke janssen is phoenix whose character is key to the trilogy beast is in x3 too actually played by to my surprise in the rolling creditskelsey grammar now theres a real mutation all in all a very entertaining 6 hours of movies here x fans wont miss these and you shouldnt either if youre into the action scifi or fantasy genres,fantasy
while itd be impossible for any films to do justice to marvels legendary team of superpowered mutants i really feel that these films are almost as good an adaptation as we could have hoped for the casting was strong the action was solid most of the characters were portrayed memorably and the stories largely stayed true to the spirit of the the first film felt a little rushed due to the sheer number of characters introduced but all things considered it was a very enjoyable film for both the uninitiated and oldschool xfans hugh jackman was spoton as wolverine the most iconic and arguably the hardest to cast and famke jansen was a fantastic jean grey for at least the first two films patrick stewart professor x ian mckellan magneto and rebecca romjinstamos mystique also delivered outstanding performances playing their respective comic icons the story was a nice update of the comics and followed rogues induction into professor xs school for mutants and magnetos first big terrorist attack on mankind allinall a satisfying start to the series the second film really kicked the series into gear and introduced more of our favorite including nightcrawler whose opening sequence was the highlight of the film pyro and iceman the story involves wolverines past and the governments attempts to control the evergrowing mutant population the result was one of the greatest comic book films ever made that firmly cemented the developing series as one to watch for some ridiculous reason at this point the powers that be decided that the third film would be the last this was a bad choice that made no kind of sense upset the films fans and severely hurt the quality of the third film ah the third film a mixed bag to say the least the plot deals with two classic story lines involving a cure for mutants and the legendary dark phoenix my personal list of complaints is a long one but ill just hit a few in this review the last stand tries to cram two movies worth of material into one film that is too short to begin with the introduction of the phoenix was obviously forced and no care was taken in this storyline which is one of the alltime classics in comic history and the result is several pointless character deaths and gaps in logic like why an allpowerful entity is content to hang out at an aging terrorists side and just look menacing for most of the story the series former darling rogue is reduced to a brooding plotnuisance has no real influence on the story plus she never gains the fantastic powers she obtained in the comics that made her such a powerhouse of a character and a personal favorite of mine on the other hand more classic characters are given parts such as fanfavorite kitty pride and collossus both of which had cameos in x2 angel multiple man beast played nicely by kelsey grammar and the almighty juggernaut whose battle with kitty was as awesome as it was unexpected but as many characters as there were that made it into the three films there were so many great ones that were reduced to either tiny unnamed cameos in the series or forgotten altogether no gambit emma frost sinister apocalypse scarlet witch or havok to name just a few furthermore the final films resolution in extremely unsatisfying and leaves little doubt that this franchise as we know it is dead though they do leave us a glimmer of hope there are talks of wolverine and magneto spinoffs and possibly a new mutants project promising ideas but hardly a substitute for the ensemble we know and love still in the end i really did enjoy x3 as a film as it did have several great standupandcheer moments it just upset me as a fan of the comics and as a fan of the the movies because there wss so much more that could have and should have been done with this series in the end whether youre a fan of the comics the cartoons or just a fan of scifi or fun movies in general you really shouldnt miss out on these three movies the series is full of memorable characters fantastic battles sly humor references for hardcore fans and of course the classic social commentaries about discrimination and the importance of both individuality and cohesiveness there doesnt appear to be much in the way of special features from the first two films on this edition but for about 10 a flick ill let it slide since it is still a hell of a bargain highly recommended set,fantasy
the special effects are good the characters are simple and varied enough to make us like that universe of monstrous mutants that look just like us but can turn into whatever they want welcome to carrie christine firestarter the tommyknockers and many other stephen king paranormal beings and situations of course this film adds to that berserk universe a good old american wrapping but with a twist the statue of liberty standing on its nice little island as the symbol of what it is called after and yet looking like a stiletto stabbing the sky and jutting out of a flat no mans seascape the twist is in the fact that it is this very statue that is going to be the epicenter of the destruction of all the heads of states assembled at the united nations for the general assembly of this worlds forum this american wrapping is the standard bigot position of a senator against mutants against people who are different who rejects them and kills them as fast as possible and the twist is that this senator is kidnapped by the bad mutants transmuted himself by them and then discarded to die in any odd place away from them and before dying he is saved by the good mutants and he even comes to like them finally the main twist is that there are good mutants and in this film temporarily they win and save humanity from a cataclysm that would have destroyed both humanity and mutantdom then the rest is not even sentimental episodes it is pure action and mission and some fights and a lot of visual special effects that makes a nice entertaining film though on no matrix whatsoever except maybe the very very distant faraway relation to a certain quasimodo in notre dame de paris by victor hugo the ugly monster is the savior of the beautiful gypsy girl all the normal parisians want to victimize and killdr jacques coulardeau university paris dauphine university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne  university versailles saint quentin en yvelines,fantasy
although im not a big fan of i did enjoy the evolution animated series and am a fan of superhero films so decided to get the dvd of this movie today read on to find out what i thought aboutthe story can get bumpy sometimes but otherwise goes on smoothly and basically focuses on the relationship between dr xaviers magnetos brotherhood of mutants and humans relationship with mutants the movie sensibly doesnt go too deep in the origins of the characters since theres a bevy of them in the movie and all have the same tale more or less  that theyre mutants the movie revolves mostly revolves around wolverine while most other characters  except for wolverine rogue mr xavier and magneto  get little development and serve mostly to accommodate the action sequences needless to says story or characters arent very deep but considering the highly collective nature of the and the movies sequelorientation i guess that the latter is not that badthere is a lot of smashing action although the climax on the statue of liberty couldve been better defined and the choreography is also very good but the action is somewhat offset by the lengthy dialogue sequences delivered by magneto and mr xavier the acting is mediocre from the entire cast no one gives an outstandingly good or bad performance and most cast didnt really have a choice due to the tepid character development aside theres some good contextual humor here and there thanks in no small part to wolverinethe production design is also topnotch especially the sterilely hightechsion however thes costumes especially wolverines which are redesigned for the movie could have been closer to the comics and animated series while being realistic at the same time the best character design imo goes to mystique the scaly prosthetics motif on her otherwise nude body looks sexy sinister and feels just right for a cunning shapeshifter like her among the villains the character design on sabretooth and toad is also very impressive the latter even has a cocky personality to complement his repulsive appearance unfortunately both characters are reduced to disposable henchmenalthough didnt get me very excited calling it terrible would be a gross exaggeration its just a decent superhero film up there with superman the movie and spiderman 3 and should not disappoint anyone into superhero films  but frankly for someone whos not a diehard fan like me there are much better superhero movies out there rating 7510,fantasy
my take forgettble but a lot of funim not a fan of the marvel comics series suffice to say i wasnt really wild with the bigbudget bigscreen series ive seen all of them on the bigscreen and enjoyed them especially x2 and ive seen the repeatedly on television but i didnt have much to talk about them their great entertainment but little else still after seeing the original a few nights ago my original opinion has been improved while i still wont have anything to talk about it the next day im giving it more credit than the one i gave iti enjoyed the special effects and the action the first time but looking back theres actually much more going for it the characters were given enough depth and that director bryan singer wasnt exactly the biggest fanboy of the comic book series makes his job in much more impressive performances by hugh jackman patrick stewart ian mckellen and a young anna paquin are great which is much to say considering that theres a lot of things going on with the action and effects i may not be wild about it but for what its worth is still fine entertainmentrating 12 out of 5,fantasy
the first movie is bigscreen escapist fun with an allstar cast and a smrgsbord of special effectsfor me hugh jackmans wolverine is the star of the show jackmans portrayal of the character is spoton and he injects real life into the part hes joined by a very talented set of actors including patrick stewart ian mckellen as a slightly camp magneto famke janssen and halle berry berry seems underused in the role of storm but she remains as watchable as alwaysbryan singer clearly respects the original source material and directs the film in a nononsense manner8 out of 10 a proper popcorn movie,fantasy
 is my favourite comic book series i have been a fan of the comic books and the animated series in the 90s and i was excited when i found out that they were making an film i was round 1415 at the time it was released and the only bad thing about my experience seeing the film was the popcorn american cant make sweets to save their lives is a wide ranging series which tackles a lot of plots and issues it has been considered to be a metaplor for the civil rights movement in the 60s and the comics have tackled other issues like the role of the government the aids virus and the holocaust there is also the issue that powers may be a curse rather then a blessing eg rogue and cyclops there are also a number of characters and fractions which would have made the film difficult to make because there would have been no way to make the fans 100 happythe plot of the film is in the world they are mutants people with powers that can range from being psychic to changing your apparent to healing to controlling the weather they are met with fear from the general public and they are calls in the us senate for the mutant regisration act to get details of every mutant in the usa within the mutant community there are two major factors the and the brotherhood of mutants the led by charles xavier want to have harmonious relations with humanity whilst the brotherhood led by erik lehnsherrmagento believes that the human race would never accept mutants and that a war is coming in the middle of this are two mutants wolverine hugh jackman and rogue anna paqulin wolverine can not remember his past and lives a nomadic lifestyle and rogue is a teenage runaway who needly kills her boyfriend just by kissing him mangento wants rogue so he can complete his scheme to turn the worlds leaders in mutantsthis film was not particular action packed this was because the budget was 75 million which is nothing special for a summer blockbuster and the director was bryan singer whos most famous film before was the usual suspects a psychology crime thriller he chose to focus on character development which was a good move he also tackled the project as an outsider he was not a fan of the comics but i thought that was good because he was able to cut of the flak he made the film into a realistic scifi film which could appeal to the fans and normal movie goers he made a few jokes about some of the issues of the comics like the codenames and the costumers the film does tackles ideas like wolverines tortured past and his rivalry with cyclops xaviers friendship with his rival magneto the human factor wolverines need to protect children the list goes on the film also has a good international cast patrick stewart sir ian mckellon halle berry famke janssen james marsden and anna paquin the film also made hugh jackman into an overnight star because before the film he was an australian stage actor and after it he became an alister and has a strong scene of loyalty to the franchise to a lesser extent rebecca romjin has also become a major actressthe film isnt perfect i would have liked to have seen more characters like gambit and beast and the film did ignore wolverines and sabretooths hatred for each other and the fact that they have a past together was an introduce to the film franchise especially to people who do not know the comics is a very good film 2 is even better and 3 was one of my most biggest film disappointments i would love to see bryan singer back in the directors chair and ignore the third film and do it the way he wants and the fans want,fantasy
i really enjoyed this movie a lot when it first came out 8 long years ago and i decided to revisit it with my little brother tonight and enjoyed it just as much as i did back then i think its definitely one of the better marvel films and up there with the first spiderman and iron man im definitely glad i decided to check it out againthere are a lot of great elements in this film and i thought the story along with the effects were both great the acting was really good as well with great performances from james marsden and hugh jackman i thought they did a great job of adapting the comic book into this film as ive been a big fan of the comic books since i was very little kidmost marvel fans have most likely seen this film and a few times over however if you havent yet you really should do yourself the favor of checking it out you probably will enjoy it quite a bit,fantasy
i gotta give my props to brian singer man what a fantastic job he did in bringing my favorite mutant superhero team to the big screen the comics have decades of established treasured mythology and this film does it justice almost perfectly some story elements have been altered here and there but it never undermined the finished product significantly as to throw off diehard fans although i was disappointed that gambit wasnt included but the film superbly makes up for that with action special effects and what marvelous effects they are and a plot thats intellectually stimulating actually its a shame that most action films today dont have that kind of pizazz and gravitas to keep it from being mindlessly entertaining not so here as challenges its viewers to ponder the nature of acceptance  fear and prejudice my one main complaint is that the villains such as sabertooth wasnt fleshed out more and similar to his vicious comic book counterpart i will purchase the directors cut for any bells and whistles not in the theatrical cut but for the most part is an exciting and exhilarating experience with something more beneath the surface even more so than action films today and i can say with all authority it embodies the spirit of the comics nearly spot ongreat film,fantasy
based on the comics the movie while there are many important characters follows marie aka rogue and logan aka wolverine who discover professor xavier and his as logan labels them scott aka cyclops jean grey ororo aka storm who help them after an accident however they soon discover that the brotherhood led by magneto or erik plans on using them for a scheme which he tested on a senator first i think everyones good but its always hard when theres at least two oscar winners two shakespearian actors and some other awards winnersif you like action films which i do this is a definite mustsee,fantasy
i was introduced to the as a kid in the 1990s when i started seeing episodes of the cartoon show later i started playing an video game and during my comic book phase i do recall reading some ones since then the comic book series has been one of several to get the live action movie treatment at some point within the past ten years or so i didnt see too many films on the big screen back in 2000 so i didnt see this this first movie adaptation i finally watched this about a year and a half after going to see its sequel x2 but i have now seen it more than once and it is goodin the near future many mutated humans exist they are born with a special xfactor gene which gives each of them a certain superpower unfortunately these mutants are generally feared by the rest of humanity even though many of them mean no harm in thesion where many good mutants live professor charles xavier runs a school for students with the special xfactor gene where they learn how to use their gifts wisely xavier dreams of a society where mutants can live with the rest of humanity in peace however another mutant named eric lensherr aka magneto who was once xaviers friend has different plans he has a machine that can convert nonmutated humans and he plans to speed up the process of human evolution with it for some reason one unbeknownst to anyone in thesion magneto and his evil mutants are after either logan or rogue two recent arrivals at the mansion comic book movies from recent years are generally not known to be flawless so its no surprise that has some fairly weak moments after the first scene which is set in 1944 and the story skips to the near future where the rest of the movie takes place the film gets pretty shaky starting with rogue in her room with her boyfriend just before she discovers her powers i would say the story really gets good around the part when logan aka wolverine first finds himself in thesion after that it doesnt stay completely steady for the rest of the film but usually is pretty entertaining with a decent amount of action and suspense as well as good special effects some intriguing futuristic sets and occasional humour i cant say too many of the cast performances here really stand out but those of patrick stewart as xavier ian mckellen as magneto and hugh jackman as wolverine do the script isnt perfect but for the most part its better than the hulk and catwoman scripts two very disappointing comic book movies thats for sure here theres a mixture of strong and weak dialogue and actingso overall this first movie does have its cheesy moments but that certainly doesnt mean it has no entertainment value now some people strongly dislike these recent comic book movie blockbusters in general and if youre one of them im sure saying that this one has its cheesy moments is a gross understatement to you if youve seen it however if you dont like this kind of movie its simple dont watch it for those whose interest is often captured by comic book movies like this there may be some films of this kind which are best to avoid most notably the more poorly received ones but certainly isnt one of those even if its not the best adaptation of a comic book series ever made,fantasy
 rules as directed by the usual suspects helmer bryan singer this topdrawer cinematic adaptation of the popular marvel comics series sets a whole new standard for filming superhero sagas unlike the gratuitously overblown but happilyeverafter dc comics characters differs because marvel comics forged superheroes with tragic flaws not only does singer orchestrate an entertaining but intelligent yarn around titans of good and evil battling for supremacy with the fate of mankind at stake but he also tackles important cultural issues integral to the plot that enhance its subtext about intolerance ultimately qualifies as the best superhero comic book movie ever produced thanks to a stellar cast led by shakespearean heavyweights patrick star trek the next generation stewart and sir ian richard iii mckellen matrix style special effects which compliment rather than eclipse the plot and a literate script that parries childish pratfalls obviously hardcore aficionados of either the animated tv series 199298 or the comic book itself may complain about the various liberties that singer and scenarist david hayter take with the subject matterover the opening credits patrick stewart narrates that in the not too distant future genetic mutations will trigger the next stage of evolution as the next evolutionary stage of life mutantsaka homo superiorswill suffer persecution because they are not only different but also potentially dangerous the prejudice that mankind manifests toward these mutants serves as an allegory for our current climate of political racial and sexual bigotry as well as the uncertainty that older teenagers and younger twentysomethings encounter as they search for their niche in society some critics have compared the showdown between professor x stewart and magneto mckellen with the rivalry between martin luther king and malcolm x during the turbulent 1960s while others have recognized mutants as symbols for any oppressed group forced to identify themselves whether they be classified as homosexuals communists jewish or firearms owners like the famous star wars prologue stewarts voiceover neatly encapsulates the origins of the and the inherent conflicts confronting themwhile superman and batman unfolded in linear fashion starting from the beginning singer picks up somewhere in the middle the setting is poland in 1944 and the nazis are parading helpless jews into the gas chambers for extermination when young erik lensherr brett morris bearing an uncanny resemblance to the older ian mckellen finds himself separated from his parents as the nazis are about to gas them he experiences such heretofore unknown terror that he emanates an invisible force field with his fingertips he destroys the high iron barbwired gates while several soldiers struggle to restrain him finally smashing lensherr in the face with his rifle butt one nazi sentry knocks him unconscious nevertheless his supernatural powers stun the guards this grim scene in auschwitz hearkens back to schindlers list 1193 while the show of paranormal power recalls brian de palmas carrie as introductions go the concentration camp scene grips with its

of willard believes mutants with their extraordinary physical and mental prowess endanger humanity the fanatical kelly demands all mutants be required to identify themselves moreover he campaigns for registering them since they cannot be trusted to supervise their powers responsibly some mutants he argues can eavesdrop on your mind and read your thoughts while kelly drums up support for his proposed legislation dr charles xavier patrick stewart watches quietly from the balcony although confined to a wheelchair xavier is a supertelepath that can do what kelly fears the most not only can xavier read your innermost thoughts but he also can exert control of another persons body and speak through them with the ease of a ventriloquistunlike the cynical erik lensherr aka magneto who insists war between humans and mutants is inevitable xavier contends that mutants and humans can coexist in harmony as far as xavier is concerned people like kelly are wellmeaning but misinformed xavier has established a school for gifted youth in westchester new york where he teaches young mutants to curb their potentially destructive urges some of his longtime students cyclops james marsden of 27 dresses who sports special sunglasses to shield his lethal laser beam eyes storm halle berry of die another day who controls weather and deploys lightning bots and dr jean grey serve as instructors when they arent running errands for xavier concisely in a model of economy singer establishes the characters and creates the overall conflict between them while broaching questions about the enormity of segregation moreover he inserts several amusing tidbits of humor that flesh out the characters without detracting from the storylinethe conflict in david hayters screenplay that prompts magneto and xavier to clash again concerns tow mutants thrown together by fate a teenage girl in meridian mississippi marie anna paquin of the piano discovers her touch can kill also known as rogue she can drain the life out of people horrified by her inexplicable power she hits the road and eventually meets logan hugh jackman a roughhewn cage fighter nicknamed wolverine an antisocial amnesiastricken loner searching for his pastdirector bryan singer toils throughout to dispel any notions that it is just another disposable comic book epic he triumphs in every department from superb casting to thoughtful plotting stewart and mckellen embellish and provide it with the kind of dignity that alec guinness brought to star wars when magneto and xavier speak their conversations sound like the oral equivalent of a chess match hits the mark because singer and hayter fuse superior dramatic elements in the best aristotelian fashion its heroes experience a tough time winning,fantasy
its not very often you get an action movie that has exciting action scenes a strong story and explanations of stuff without bogging down the entire movie is one of those movies this movie had me engaged from the beginning of a young magneto going to a concentration camp and discovering his powers of bending metal and rogue discovering the hard way of her ability to take another mutants powersor the life from a nonmutant the action scenes were extremely exciting and engaging from the small skirmish wolverine and magneto had on board a train to cyclops and storms fight with sabretooth and toad inside the train station to the huge climatic dukeout inside the statue of liberty the battle scenes kept me on the edge of my seat wanting more even when professor x was explaining to wolverine about his school and mutantism it didnt bog down the story at all but kept it going as we got a better understanding of what was to happen the end was great and left it open for more as magneto sat in his plastic prison cell telling professor x on his way out that the cell cant hold him forever leaving it open for the sequelif you enjoy action movies marvel comics or superheroes in general this is a mustsee movie and an xcellent kickoff to one of my favorite movie trilogies,fantasy
two years before stan lees greatest creation spiderman hits the silver screen the are brought to life this is a great film the acting especially hugh jackman who plays loganwolverine and patrick stuart who plays charles xavier is great the special effects are good but not breathtaking like spiderman 2002 the storyline is good easy to follow i did not read i am a die hard spiderman fanatic comics the whole nine yards this film is sure to please movie goers the second and third films are just as good but even though bryan singer did a great job on he did a horrible job on suoperman returns i nothing good to say about superman returns there is nothing good about superman returns anyway is great stands proudly next to marvel comics leader spiderman spiderman is the first character ever created for marvel and the best,fantasy
 2000 dir bryan singer in a world where both mutants and humans fear each other marie dancanto better known as rogue run away from home and hitches a ride with another mutant known as logan aka wolverine charles xavier who owns a school for young mutants sends storm and cyclops to bring them back before it is too late magneto who believes a war is approaching has an evil plan in mind and needs young rogue to help himbefore 2000 there were not many comic book adaptations out was the first movie in years which featured superheroes everyone could enjoy bryan singer really shows that hes a fan of the as the film is made in such high quality the special effects locations and costumes are beautifully made the mutants featured in the film have the perfects actors cast in the roles and even minor mutants such as toad and iceman are a joy to watch the story is well written too with the film focused as a science fiction movie with the added aspect of action and great oneliners is the start of the new breed of comic book adaptations which continued with two successful sequels fantastic 4 spiderman and the return of batman and superman definitely one of the major points in the history of comic book filmsdont touch me  rogue anna paquin,fantasy
this film is remarkable for its straightforward narration its well managed actionand its sense of adventure the cast numbers several nice women  halle berryrebecca romijnfamke janssenthe atmosphere is interesting and the film avoids the useless jokes and parody stuff the general air of intelligence makes it a respectable movie anyway the script is certainly not the best and the need is felt for more information about stewarts past and about his school for gifted youngsters etc the action needed to be broadened more things about the world existing outside the mutants milieu were necessary the characters arent particularly interesting and the plot itself is average the bad mutants want to take over the world by turning the politicians reunited for a summit into mutants and thus securing a privileged position for the mutants it didnt seem to me a very thrilling idea maybe the film didnt serve it very well the best thing about 2000 is its approachnot looking like a spoof its constructive aimi started with a most favorable disposition towards this film after reading a comment here on imdb the comment called the best superhero movie ever a good superhero film that comment also exquisitely touched on the three most important things about that the two leading characters are the only interesting characters also that the plot is crap  that the action demands a knowledge of the comics  i was a little disappointed with the i didnt find the film worthy of any superlative but its quite well made,fantasy
i am a little cautious about the comment above as i have not seen batman begins but this movie certainly beat all of the earlier superhero movies i have seen and several that came after the success of this movie came from the focus on human relationships and in particular on the story of rogue as she comes to terms with her rather scary power her place in society and her relationships with others because singer took the time to build up our rapport for rogue the later events where she comes into danger and the rest of the team come together to support her have much more emotional resonance than i found in any of the supermanspiderman moviesof course it also delivers all of the action and effects that we expect in a superhero movie along with an engaging villain or two and a devious plot that only becomes clear as the movie progressesa very solid opening round for the franchise that unfortunately was not followed up on with the same flair,fantasy
 is the first good comic book movie in a long time it began the marvel age of movies and was a precursor to other marvel movies such as spiderman hulk daredevil etc bryan singer brought a fresh and original style to this film which made it a great movie and a great start to the marvel age of moviesthe casting of is one of the films best characteristics patrick stewart is perfect as charles xavier hugh jackman brings a ferocity and laid back attitude to his character wolverine which is fantastic rebecca romijin delivers a terrific performance as mystique and ray park is excellent as a repulsive and sick toad james marsden famke janseen anna paquin tyler mane and bruce davison all deliver great performances as well the standout actor is ian mckellan as magneto he captures the seriousness vibrancy anger and devotion of his character perfectly his portrayal of magneto is one of the best movie villain interpretations of all time and no better actor could have been picked for the rolei really like the story behind the movie the must face off against the brotherhood of evil mutants each of which is a distinct team of mutants fighting for a different goal the wish to protect humanity which of course ultimately hates and fears them the brotherhood looks to destroy mankind for the same reason each team is driven based on their own personal beliefs and experiences the thing i love about the movies is that it is more than just a battle of good and evil like spiderman it is a battle for acceptance and once you see the movie you should be able to understand exactly what i am talking about has one of the best opening scenes to a movie not only is it a great way to start the film but it is a great way to introduce magnetos character so much can be shown about magnetos character in just that 5 minute scene i love the way singer started the moviebryan singer does such a great job in bringing the to the big screen he captures the teams spirit the characters attitudes and the moral beliefs of what everyone is fighting for not just what the mutants are fighting for but also what mankind is fighting for the make such a great film in that the issues behind them make for a compelling and meaningful movie,fantasy
i have never been more excited to see a movie than when i first heard that they were going to release a film based on my favorite comic book characters the i remember i watched the trailer online twice a day for the last two weeks before its nationwide release i was there opening night with my friends and was blown away they brought these fantastic characters to the big screen and they did it well and it was this movie that opened the floodgates for more comic book movies to come forthone thing i had to overcome when watching the movie was that its not the as i know them per se theyre a bryan singerized version keep in mind thats not entirely a bad thing singer and the writers kept a majority of the comic intact when translating it to film but there are differences if you can look past some inconsistencies as with any booktomovie conversion then the movie is definitely good fun the visual effects were spectacular from wolverines claws to cyclopss optic blasts and the fight scenes were great the cast is near perfect and some seem born for the roles ie patrick stewart as professor xavier or sir ian mckellan as magnetoi dont really have too much that bothered me about the movie aside from the minor changes mentioned above i thought the majority of the movie was too dark im referring to light not subject matter there were a lot of scenes at night or in dimlylit roomscaves and i felt like it gave the movie a very heavy serious feel while i believe the movie should be serious i also think that it should have some more exuberant lighting to keep with that extraordinary comicfeel note i said extraordinary not overthetop or campy the may tackle some serious subject matter at times but they still had their lighter momentsmy only other problem was that it felt the movie tended to drag on despite its short running time barely 100 minutes it seemed at times as if the story was slowing down to a crawl another action sequence may have given it the kick it needs to keep its pace but the movie never fully stalls it stills keeps you engaged until the finaleoverall bryan singer did a good job this is an awesome way to kick off the franchise and open the doors for future comic bookbased films i was completely satisfied when i walked out of the theater in 2000 and im still satisfied when i watch it today now that singer has a feel for the characters and actors things will only get better as the continue into the future,fantasy
rated pg13 for scifi action violencei think was the film that brought back the popularity of superhero filmsbatman and robin was a big disappointment and it seemed to stop people from making superhero filmswhen this came out it was a box office hit and them the superhero trend of films started againi have this film on vhs and i havent seen it in a whilewhat i remember however is that it had great action scenes which is all you really need for a superhero filmi was never really a big fan of but i enjoyed this movieif you are a fan of or superhero films in general i suggest checking this one out,fantasy
ok so blade came slightly before it but this was the first in the current wave of comic book movies to really hit the mark it also remains one of the best despite being almost 7 years old now improvements in technology a big budget a willingness to splash out on star names and a decision to take the source material seriously all contribute to the success of bryan singers blockbuster the decision to focus on the more iconic from the 70s rather than the original lineup from the 60s was definitely the right one comic movies are as dependant on the villains as they are the heroes and again bryan singer has made a good selection along with magneto we see sabretooth mystique and rather less impressively the lesser known but older foe toad hugh jackman made his name as wolverine a mutant with little memory of his past who seems to be at the centre of a devilish scheme hatched by the evil terrorist mutant magnetoian mckellenand his brotherhoor of mutants he is rescued from an attempted kidnapping by charles xaviers patrick stuart a group dedicated to protecting mankind despite its fear and loathing of mutants such as themselves the stellar cast is rounded up by halle berry who plays storm in a role that isnt quite what it could be as the character remains largely undeveloped this is a bit of problem with the film as there are so many super powered characters for the viewer to get to know several of them go under nourished in back story and characterisation this could be a blessing however as if we had to get to know the ins and outs of each of them wed never get started on the actual story to keep fans of the comic series happy there is a smattering of lesser known that we see in small roles and in the background throughout including iceman and shadowcat a big blockbuster such as this relies on special fx to get noticed and shock and awe the audience ands do not disappoint particularly of note is mystique and her transformations as well as some mild body horror involving a liquifying senator these fx were incedible at the time and still stand up today another crucial ingredient of the comic book film is the action sequence and has them in bulk the fighting itself is a bit wire fu for my tastes and has a strong matrix influence people tend to fly up the air for quite a distance with minimal provocation and it all looks a bit silly in places this contrasts with the sequel which was rougher and harder hitting that said there are some impressive set pieces such as the final battle inside the statue of liberty and a scene involving magneto the police and lots of guns a big hit and deservedly so caters to the tastes of the comic book fans but alters the story enough to make it enjoyable for the wider audience this would be enjoyable for fans who are a notoriously difficult group to please whilst not being alien to people whove never heard of the before a triumph,fantasy
i liked and x2x3 in my mind isnt part of the series anyway my comment is why does hugh jackman play the biggest pussywolverine i mean seriously he has the look ok but wheres the growl in his voice wear is the black and yellow and the mask i think this movies were close but not as true to the characters like batman begins or superman was i think these movies would have been much better as well if characters were introduced as early as gambit the beast etcand whats with killing off sabertooth oh well i hope that they get the character right in the wolverine movie coming up in 08,fantasy
once upon a time director brian singer the usual suspects pitched a very ambitious to the studio a 175 million extravaganza including all of the characters from the comic book some to be entirely computergenerated but the studio quickly clipped singers wings demanding he keep production costs down i suppose you get what you pay forfor instance the filmmakers wanted the plot to revolve around wolverine  a musclebound mutant with razorsharp metal claws instead the studio gave them an actual wolverine a small but ferocious woodchucktype creature to make it worse they werent able to pay for a professional wolverine handler so throughout the film you see one of the other carrying wolverine around in a small cage during the few scenes when wolverine actually gets into the action they just use a stuffed wolverine and clever editing and dont jump on me for nitpicking  its pretty noticeable the animal in the cage is brown with dark eyes when its out all the sudden its bright red and makes a giggling sound when somebody touches it there are rumors they used a tickle me elmo doll for the partsinger also wanted the popular character cyclops who in the comic has a visor that unleashes a devastating beam to play a major role in the film the studio replaced that character with staremaster a featureless man with the superhuman ability to stare motionlessly at an object for days at a time staremaster is played by a department store mannequinthere are other complaints more than i can get into here the character of storm halle berry no longer has the ability to control the weather as she does in the comic but can now only observe the weather theres one scene at the beginning where she displays her power and it goes something like thisrain slowly begins to fall on the group of storm steps away from the group and gazes into the sky a look of intense concentration washes over her facestorm wait i think its rainingdr x shes right i hope this doesnt interfere with staremasters staring powersstaremaster wolverine that tickles ha ha ha ha haget the picture the inxplicable budget limits the studio set on the are also the reason why the film has a grade c cast for the part of dr x the filmmakers wanted patrick stewart star trek the next generation but instead got patrick swayze road house for super badguy magneto they wanted classical actor ian mckellan apt pupil but got dom deluise cannon ball run 2well i say from now on if youre gonna do a bigtime comic book movie do it right hopefully the upcoming fantastic four film starring john ritter mickey rourke jim j bullock and dennis rodman will have more to offer than this worthless piece of xcrementi give one star,fantasy
after hating the comics and hating everything marvel had made movie wise i wasnt really gonna go and see it and then i realised it had hallie berry in so i changed my mine instantly and i was glad i did this  despite not being as good as number 2  is amazing its suspenseful breathtaking filmmaking by the one and only brian singer i recently saw x3 and think some people are being harsh about it its really quite good despite being the worse in the saga so yeah if your a fan of the comics go and see itif your not go and see it anyway you will be blown awayx1  810x2  1010 x3  710,fantasy
 2000 is an entertaining flick this is not you typical comic book flick is an energy romp that also sends a message the led by charles xavier stand to fight against the brotherhood led by magneto to save mankind despite being oppressed by normal humans the want to allow humans to understand that this is mere evolution and that mutants despite the obvious powers are no different than humans and were born humans the brotherhood wish to wipe out the humans who believe that humans will never understand and will always oppress mutantsthe performances are nearly great hugh jackman nailed wolverine from the look all the way down to the personality as logan who has no idea who he is has a rough personality hiding the fact that he is alone another great performance is patrick stewart as professor x he acts with great conviction solid casting herethere are drawbacks also halle berry camps it up not the best performance here not terrible but campy another drawback is the lack of character development for storm and cyclops cyclops is the leader with storm in second in command a little back story would be nicea few more drawbacks the brotherhood the only one who actually has a character is magneto toad has no lines sabertooth barely says anything same with mystique as if all except magneto are just pawns a little background would be greatdespite that the movie is entertaining a group of heroes who fight for the world despite being oppressed humans fear what they do not understandthe last word a fun movie is filled with a solid plot lots of energy and stylish battles lack of character development brought that rating down a few notches i would like to know more about the heroes and villains makes them interesting otherwise they seem like nothing more than pawns,fantasy
this movie is the achievement all comicbook movies should look up to the casting is perfect none of the performances are forced or cheesy every character is treated respectfully by singer and their respective actor hugh jackman brings a unique and different aspect to the character of wolverine but he still holds true to the original essence of the character certain aspects could use touchups halle berrys wig just makes her character comical and distracts from what was a good performance and the story leaves cyclops scott summers out in the dust as far as things to do as the leader of the team his role needed to be bigger more action and drama length and timing are perfect and the writing is to die for in this film despite its length only an hour and forty some minutes everything is taken to its conclusion without rushing singer brought the to film in the best way possible kudos,fantasy
i knew about the graphic novels but never read them although i did find the movie fairly interesting mainly because it shows how sen kelly bruce davison tries to create a mccarthystyle fear of mutants i guess that for the most part this movie is not much different from other superhero movies but worth seeing as a cultural reference it was surprising to see ian mckellen go from gods and monsters to this a particularly funny scene is when cyclops james marsden has to verify wolverines hugh jackman identity this movie does make one grow to respect mutantsso why do you ask questions to which you already know the answer,fantasy
a world of mutants collide as there are the good guys led by patrick stewart famke janssen and halle berry the bad guys led by ian mckellen tyler mane and rebecca romijnstamos and those trying to figure out their place in society hugh jackman and anna paquin a us politician bruce davison tries to make mutants outcasts but his plan goes awry when mckellen has a deviant scheme to turn the entire planet into a diverse mutant race will be difficult to follow for those not highly versed with the popular dc comics the movie feels like it starts in the middle of its story and the lacking background is a huge minus none of the characters are very well developed and the potentially fascinating premise takes a backseat to loads of special effects and crazed action sequences stylish and somewhat interesting but poorly developed and only minimally realized director bryan singers picture does not mark the spot for cinematic greatness 25 out of 5 stars,fantasy
if you are a fan of the popular comics about the mutant super heroes then youll love this movie it is mainly focused on loganwolverine hugh jackman who meets outcast mutant roguemarie dancanto the pianos anna paquin and they both go to a secret place which has all young and old mutants studying and of course the headquarters of the patrick stewart plays professor charles xavier the commander of the he believes that rogue and wolverine can be part of the team along with jean grey goldeneyes famke janssen scott summerscyclops james marsden ororo munroestorm halle berry meanwhile the evil magneto sir ian mckellen along with toad ray park sabretooth tyler mane and the gorgeous mystique rebecca romijn want to find wolverine and make him part of his team personally the second films better good,fantasy
there are certain types of movies that catch peoples attentions they dont always have the biggest stars or the best known director of course some people havent heard of any directors other than spielberg for example who before had heard of brian singer i know i hadnt his films before directing the movies with the mutants range from the usual suspects to lions den since then of course he went on to direct x2 and is currently working on another comic book movie in superman returns actor wise does offer a lot of big names patrick star trek stewart ian mckellan and halle berry add to the list that is mainly led by the story of hugh jackmans wolverine characterafter the little tale of magnetos past starts off in a nice quiet town where very little happens teens fall in love and have their first kiss and put there would be boyfriends into comasat least that is what happens on the day a young girl finds shes a mutant runs away from home and calls herself rogue meeting up with a man in a bar isnt always a good thing especially for a young girl but never the less thats just what she does when she meets the hulking logan commonly referred as wolverine bring in the remaining and mutants who dont take the same hero look as them and you get an action packed movie that has not only spawned a sequel but a second and possible spin offs tooin all this movie was probably more along the lines to the comics than some of the latest superhero outings although i admit i never read most but im going off what others have said however i was impressed by this movie immensely and cannot wait to see the third instalment and although jackman plays wolverine amazingly i would like to see the story revolve a little around another character than the previous two,fantasy
 out of i first watched this movie on theaters in 2000 but only now i have rented it and im ready to make a review i never was that fan of comic books or super heroes never even read those books or watched the animated series so this review is based on a writer who is making a review of the movie alone with no references at all to the comic books or animated series well maybe just a bitwhen came out to the theaters i remember people were really excited there was a boy who was almost dying in his chair before the movie even began because of the excitement he was having and he even said this movie is gonna explode well the movie began in the first movie we see characters like wolwerine cyclops storm prof xavier magneto and some others just to name the most famous ones i really liked the cast of the movie halle berry is not that bad as storm as she is in other movies but even so storm was a very easy role she took special effects add a lot to her performance as she stroked toad ray park with a thunder while her face was built on glowing white eyes and wind blowing through her hair in this movie we may say that berry is not that bad but its not that great the others are much greater starting with prof xavier patrick stewart and magneto ian mckellen these two really perform seriously like they were the same characters from the novel magneto may not be looking physically the same way as in the comic books or the animated series but still the performance was what count the most and the special effects and costumes a lot also oh i almost forgot about rogue anna panquin the screams she was known for to win the oscar for best actress in a supporting role in the piano 1993 are here in this movie too in the beginning of it when she first meet with her special powers wolwerine hugh jackman is great also but i still think that his hair in the movie is horrible it was a great hair for the animated series but for the movie it just seems a little weird and ugly the only time his hair is actually good or as we may say natural is when he wakes up from the bed in the scene where jean grey fanke janssen is about to give him a shot shes also great in the movie and beautiful the same way she is in goldeneye 1995well all performances were great special effects and all too so what am i complaining about well i liked the plot and the school introduction too even so the plot seems to have been a little simple and the action is not that great maybe it was but i really guess that the second movie was much greater there are many more action sequences the movie is longer and more characters are introduced it was a nice start for a marvel movie but you should really watch maybe if you are an fan or maybe if you just want to see the movie but the main reason in my opinion is that you should watch it just to watch x2 later on,fantasy
first of all i dont read comics but knew some other favorite characters like spiderman hulk from its company marvel when i heard something about this movie that based on some fire popping sunglass man and some other superheroes team like gijoe i thought to miss that hollywood chink but years later when i saw this movie i was blown away spoilers directed by bryan singer tells the first silver screen adaptation of marvel comics flick after millions and millions of years evolution has gone up so far that it created a new race called mutants a type of species superior than ours homo sapiens humans hates and fears such paranormal super powered individuals making a new discrimination among peoples while the us government going on a thick discussion on this matter a powerful mutant called magneto decides to end the discrimination among the people by following his dream project his idea is to transform all humans into mutants by a machine he invented with the help of an energy absorbing power sourcefor that he has to go through his former friend professor xavier a superpsychic mutant who believes that humans and mutants can live together in a peaceful world he formed a mutant group called who helps for the goodwill of the world for a good future of the both races finds magneto and his evil mutants as their enemies but things went wrong when a strange man named logan and a girl called rouge came between themscripted by david hayter for the story of tom desanto and bryan singer himself tells the cinematic version of stan lees creation they really work hard to bring up the scifi universe with the backdrop of present world i like the way they take on wolverines storyline blended with the main story and actor hugh jackman is so perfect for the part he really looked as the human version of sean chens comics sketched wolverinealso the soul created for was from legendary music genius michael kamen making the immerse of real world in futuristic tones the other people who steal the show were rebecca romijn as shape shifting mystique bruce davison as senator kelly and darth maulray park as toad all other were just ok or not perfect for the part including old man ian mckellen teenage girl anna paquin the biggest loss occurred was sabertooth the movie reduced him to an angry monster even though tyler mane was perfect in the role but the comic book version portrayed the character as a smart villain with animal instinct or someone like the wwe wrestler triple h personai will give this movie 8 out of 10a great movie that makes a nonfan to read comics,fantasy
hugh jackman is wolverine i have loved the character ever since i watched the animated series as a kid even though nobody else in the gets anywhere near the same amount of attention i dont really mind but i am biased james marsden is not cyclops he cant match wolverines presence it makes you wonder why jean stays with him patrick stewart is professor x which is good because yul brenner is dead and billy zane is all wrong for the role few men can pull off the no hair look the rest of the cast is not bad although we need back stories the one thing that disturbs me about this movie is how neat and shiny everything is it looks fake it feels cold the simple silver metal the plain black costumes and the drab colors make the movie almost depressing the fight between wolverine is and mystique is my favorite scene i think this is a good start to a series,fantasy
die hard fans will probably be disappointed with some of the changes those new to the will probably not appreciate it as much but all in all bryan singer did a great job it couldnt have been easy to adapt 40 years of character and environment development into 104 minutes but singer rose to the challenge people who dont read comic books dont understand that it is so much more than childish amusement my english teacher referred to it as all spectacle and no depth flash boom crash but if that were true any comic book would do however the various books have held on to spots in the top ten sellers for many years this is because they speak to the human condition sure its exaggerated but thats how they get their point across any good story is first and foremost about people and how they deal with their situation movie book comic scifi drama action they are merely the vehicle by which the human condition is explored and no one genre is inferior to the other only the storyteller is inferior is about family through friendship loyalty betrayal being an outcast and finding your place death overcoming sorrow happiness anger bitterness love and how our experiences shape us it is about human beings when bryan singer set out to make the movie he might have changed some superficial things i was not a fan a halle barrys storm but he kept the core the same and that is what makes this a great movie and adaptation too truly enjoy this movie look not to the action which is great or the special effects which are superb they are only window dressing look to the interaction between the characters listen to the words they say watch their emotions they are human and humans can relate to them,fantasy
this 2000 film directed and written by bryan singer packs a wallop  its all about mutants and mutant terrorists who finally fight their battle on and around the statue of liberty  terrific photography here and quite impressive stuntslet me start off by saying that hugh jackman shines in his incredible playing of wolverine a mutant  his agility looks and characterization was flawless  i loved watching him when he was stalking his prey  heard him in an interview saying he based this on early acting exercizes relating to animals  in this it was a wolf have seen this actor in several films as well as the broadway musical the boy from oz and he never ceases to amaze me with his talent  go hugh then theres the distinguished ian mckellen as magento the arch vilain of villains  hes so good  patrick stewart who plays on the opposite side as professor x doesnt fare as well  stewart i felt a bit flat in his performance  also on the good guys side are the handsome james marsden as cyclops who has the ability of wiping out people and such just by looking at them halle berry as storm in long platinum hair who has the ability to fly and flash lightening bolts at her prey  another distinguished actor bruce davison plays a senator who is sacrificed for the cause  the three evil accomplices to magento are tyler mane as a wolfmancaveman type bully ray park as a toad like guy who can jump to ceilings and making use of his extended tongue to grab hold of objects buildings and people and finally the lovely rebecca romijnstamos all in blue nude who is able to transfer herself into any other character in the filmthe one disappointing feature in this is anna paquin who plays rogue a young girl who seems to have the ability to kill people by her touch i got annoyed with her and kept wishing shed fade away  fortunately we dont see that much of paquin  see this flick and watch for jackmans career to rise  this guy is stupendous,fantasy
i thought this movie was great  i grew up watching the cartoons on saturday mornings and playing on sega and i was happy to see that the movie stayed fairly true to the comic book characters there is plenty of action in the movie and lots of cool special effects  i had to buy it has soon as it came out on dvd  if you have not seen it yet what are you waiting for,fantasy
spoilers ive read some of the comments about this movie and ive had plenty of discussions with my movie friends about it  i think this movie was very good but it did have one major problemthe budgetsince this movie was filmed in toronto i know some of the people who worked on it  they told me of scenes that were supposed to be in the movie that were cut out for budget reasons  it seemed to me that most of the scenes where the mutants would use their powers seemed staged  like this is going to be the magneto lifting car scene  and this is going to be the storm using lighting scene  storm flew only once in the whole moviewhen i saw spiderman last summer i noticed that he used his powers in a very natural way  he used them all the time  and i said to myself that is what was missingwhat makes the second so much better is that the budget was huge the mutants used their powers in a much more natural way  hence more action scenes  also bigger budget means more mutantswhat i loved about this movie was the script  the dialogue between professor x and magneto were amazing especially there first exchange the acting was excellent stewart mckellan  on the whole except for halle and anna and the fact that the two leaders of the mutants are friends and yet they fight for different ideologiesif you like x2 go back and take another look at  the same people were involved with both so how could one be so much better than the otherbudget,fantasy
most of the comments ive read are ludicrous some say too many characters some say not enough some ask ridiculous questions why isnt collosus viewed more which i believe colossus is misspelledmy question leave the movie alone and what do you have the answer one of the best sequels everthe characters have been introduced the way they need to be phoenix is developing properly colossus pyro iceman and many others are growing into their characters theres no need to rush themas only a novice the comic fan i was amazed to hear what some of my friends picked up on maybe those of you who are so critical of the movie should do some research or go watch it again but my point you dont need to know everything about the comic to enjoy and think this movie is awesome,fantasy
after several years of low life minor comic book movies x men came along and made a huge splash two years later spider man came out also making a huge deal x men sparked the comic book movie generation and is probably the best one to date its much more character driven and focused on plot then any other comic book movie ive seen so far david hayters script is quite good covering all the characters extensively and not really paving the way for a sequel as openly as movies such as spider man bryan singers direction is focused and hard making the camera constantly focused on the characters and the conflicts they face each day as the mutants are feared and hated more and more the cast is led by hugh jackman in his superb performance by wolverine and is mainly supported by ann paquin ian mckellen and patrick stewart they all turn in refined and believable performances especially for a comic book movie also in support though with much minor roles are famke jansens james marsden halle berry and ray park theyre all solid except for marsden and berry who turn in some very cliche and weak lines with poor acting the sequel to x men came out earlier this month and i have to say its on par with the first one unfortunately this movie lacks enough action to drive it to be fully enjoyable some of the lines as mentioned above are too weak to be fully believable do you know what happens when a toad gets struck by lightening for example 810,fantasy
592003please note this review contains spoilers do not read if you havent seen the filmstill with me goodi decided to review this film now because even though its been three years since it was released it seemed appropriate with the recent release of its current sequel now in theaters x2x2 was big on effects but its predecessor the 2000 film is better because it was big on character development and an easiertofollow plot people will say x2 is better dont believe them theres no forced humor theres a better representation of its cast not as cluttered as it was in x2 and the music done by michael kamen in this film is better than the music john ottman did for x2kamens music in particular is underappreciated it has action and heroic tones but also softer and emotional ones as well just hear logan and rogue aka the song heard when wolverine revives rogue on the torch of the statue of liberty  its arguably one of the best samples of musical score i have ever heardanyway the plot is simple enough the team of consisting of patrick stewart as the telepathic wheelchairbound founder professor xavier the underused james marsden as scott summerscyclops the teams visorclad field leader who fires heatless energy beams from his eyes famke janssen as cyclops fiancee the telepathic and telekinetic dr jean grey and the underused halle berry as the weathercontrolling ororo munroestorm come to the aid of two fellow mutantsthe two mutants the meet mind you are a 17yearold runaway named marierogue the underused but lovely and talented anna paquin who drains the memories and powers of others by skintoskin contact and the fasthealing but gruff canadian named loganwolverine hugh jackman who pulls off the lead role perfectly the encounter the duo after a mutant named victor creedsabretooth tyler mane attacks them in canada so they bring rogue and logan to their mansionsized school to keep them safeyou see sabretooth works for the brotherhood of mutants led by xaviers former friend and current enemy erik lehnsherrmagneto sir ian mckellen who is one of the best performers in this film the blueskinned shapeshifting raven darkholmemystique the very underused rebecca romijnstamos complete with only one line of dialogue in the whole film and the greenskinned slimy longtongued toad ray park bouncing around with evil glee round out the brotherhood rosteryou see magneto has a machine he uses to mutate humans into mutants to test it out he mutates the mutanthating senator robert kelly bruce davison the man who wants to administrate the mutant registration act that would identify mutants names and powers to the public but the machine also drains the powers and lifeforce from its occupant re magneto so the brotherhood abduct rogue and plan to use her to power the machine from the torch of the statue of liberty thus mutating every human in new york into mutants but when the learn the machine kills humans several hours after it mutates them kelly dies by dissolving into a watery glob the must save rogue and stop the brotherhoodgot all that good now comes the praisestewart paquin mckellen janssen marsden and especially jackman are the reasons for watching this film for their performances alone aside from their cool moments demonstrating their mutant powers the film also incorporates the famed rivalry of cyclops and wolverine over jean greys affections from the comics perfectly and the onscreen time between mckellen and stewart is just wonderful but the bond between jackmans wolverine and paquins rogue is arguably the best part of the film which is handled very nicely something x2 sadly neglects to do their onscreen time makes the film work better showing a perfect relationship between two very different individualsand keep your eyes out for a special cameo no not cocreator stan lee as a hot dog vendor but good guess look at the statue of libertys head to see a certain blurred but visible webspinner swinging away while wolverine is seen being blown up by storms hurricane to the liberty torch i guess 20th century fox not columbia pictures actually had the first liveaction silverscreen appearance of spiderman in a movie if you slowmotion it youll see it betterbut there are cons tosome characters  like storm cyclops and even xavier  are underused they dont even have backstories the only ones with any real backstories are rogue a young magneto at a nazi concentration camp in the 1940s and logan getting the metal alloy called adamantium surgically bonded to his skeleton and the nineinchlong claws that emerge from the knuckles of his handsthe film never explains how magneto knew of rogue or of her powers or even how he knew she and logan were even in canada then again it doesnt explain how sabretooth knew of logan eitherthe film also isnt suitable for kids because of the violence language and sensuality just because the kids can see the cartoon series or comics it doesnt mean the film version or x2 is appropriate for kids to see it is rated pg13 after alland at 1 hour 35 minutes not including the nearly 10minutes worth of end credits the film is too short for such a cool action movieregardless is still the second best film ive ever seen comic book based or otherwise 2002s spiderman is the current best film ive ever seen  evernow go on and see this film youll be glad you didexcelsior,fantasy
 is an all right movie pretty weirdand cheesybut i enjoyed it the plot is okaypretty good i liked the cast a whole lot they really enjoy their roles the villain magneto is perfect ian mckeallan rocks as him hugh jackman is also perfect i loved itbut it isnt great a lot of fun bryan singer is a great director as good as burton was with batman see it for some good fun34,fantasy
this ranks up there among the greatest comic book movies ever made thank you bryan singer thank you david hayter thank you patrick stewart ian mckellan and hugh jackman and most of all thank you ray park in my eyes you guys have done a fair bit to redeem the genre fans of the comic will probably find this a lot more satisfying than nonreaders though its a pretty enjoyable movie regardless  hugh jackman is incredible he simply is wolverine im so glad they chose not to cast an established movie star in the role patrick stewart and ian mckellan are great as always though the fanboy in me wants to have words with the wardrobe department about how silly magnetos helmet looks the biggest surprise by far is toad ray park breathes life into the pathetic little troll turning him into an exciting dangerous and formidable xvillain even paying homage to his darth maul role for a moment magnetos lackey no more he was beyond a doubt my favorite character in the movie id only venture some minor critiques firstly we all know how  that one line of storms is you know the one i mean its not halles fault entirely i guess but it still makes me cringe every time i hear it and storms character wasnt nearly developed enough in the first place then theres magnetos plan though it does make sense and provides an interesting plot its just not his style geneticengineering and dna manipulation is mr sinisters bag other than that its all good 810,fantasy
the movie didnt live up to my expectations no it far succeeded them and we can thank this wonderful movie for giving the superhero genre a shot in the armthis movie has been adapted extremely well for the big screen and the characters playing the parts are totally perfect for example patrick stewart is professor x and hugh jackman is totally wolverine and what can i say about ian mckellan as magnetothe costumes for the changed for this movie but i think when adapting superheroes to the big screen it can be corny if you use the comic book costume black suited these characters far betterthe storyline was very good as the good mutants battled the bad mutants to try and save a world which didnt care if every mutant on the planet diedi think a lot of comic book characters can teach us a thing or two the is about bigotry and in a way i guess it is asking us to put aside our prejudices and to look inside a person the are distrusted and hated because they have been born different the world forgets that they are unique human beings with feelings and emotions they have an illogical hatred of the mutants simply because of how they were bornin a way the is indicative of the world we live in where people kill each other on a daily basis simply because the other person has a different colour skin or follows a different faith there are people out there who do judge other people on skin colour or religious faith and form an illogical hatred of said people without thinking that each person is different that each person has their own dreams and ambitions and hopes and fearsthis is what i believe the teaches us but all things aside the is an action packed movie that did well and gave the studios the green light to make more superhero movies,fantasy
im not a true fan of the comic books but i did happen to like this movie i thought that this movie is a really cool movie i enjoyed the performances of hugh jackman halle berry anna paquin famke janssen ian mckellan and patrick stewart they all did really good as the characters they had to playoverall the movie is a great movie from beginning to end and it is very enjoyable rating 10 out of 10,fantasy
i thought that was an extremely great moviethe acting was greatit delivered a high level of entertainmentand the story was pretty good despite the fact that they toyed around with it a little bitthere was one thing that i didnt like aboutand thats anna paquinwhat in living crap where they thinking casting her as rougeshe doesnt look like rouge or anythingbut that small flaw doesnt bring the movie downsome of the comedy stuff they put it this movie was kinda funny but not really all that muchbut reallyeverything about this movie is greatthe actingthe plotand the entertainmenthopefullyin 2they change magnetos suit because it didnt look all that great in this oneeither way is a good movieone of my favorites10 out of 10,fantasy
this is the way a comic book movie should be  sympathetic characters with believable motives great action and a villian worthy of celluloid representation  this transcends the boundaries of movie and worthy of being known as a film  spiderman could take notes from these guys 51702,fantasy
in my opinion this is the best comic book adaption ever made onto film it is cinematic with great acting and directing  ive always been an fan and this film truly captures the essence that makes the  the film gave the comic book heroes a sense of reality and shows a good messagethat we should treat everyone without discrimination  all in all this is my favorite film so farprobably till 2  d,fantasy
as a fan of the comic book for years i was skeptical about how the movie would turn out once it was made  the thing i kept in mind was that they would stay somewhat faithful to the book  for the most part bryan singer did this for with some small exceptions  the costumes were changed to all black leather  ala matrix but it was all good  wolverine was about a foot taller than what he was supposed to be and jean grey was much older than what she was supposed to be but the thing is singer made this work  i guess my only real complaint is that the movie was cut way too short  this movie could have easily been two hours and i probably would have enjoyed it just as much if not more than what i had for what i saw all i can remember is that my only thought was i cant wait for the sequel  christmas 2002 baby,fantasy
 is a fun fantastic and futuristic look at what life might be like if human beings were surrounded with mutantspeople that possess special powers  created from the famous marvel comics bryan singer directs this material with a golden hand turning what many might consider comic fodder into screen magic  the special effects are wonderful and play a large part in the film but what really sets this film off from others of its like is its very humanistic approach to different philosophical viewpoints with regard to evil and good  lots of grey here as the primary villain is a man that has seen evil in his own life and has grown to be distrustful of mankind in general ian mckellen plays the complex magneto with a rich aplomb for finesse  his scenes are probably the most entertaining yet he is ably assisted by all the actors concerned  patrick stewart does an equally good job as professor xavier  stewart and mckellen are two reasons why this film rises above the material  class acts  wolverine is played by relative unknown hugh jackman who has a kinetic screen presence  he does a wonderful job with his role as do anna paquin and all others concerned this is a great way to spend ninety minutes,fantasy
after watching the tv series  reading some of the comics i was eager to see this film i was not disappointed they had simplified it of course but the characters were recognisable logan  magneto are my favourites they and the other mutants were brilliantly cast the special effects were amazing i couldnt get enough of wolverines claws the plot was well worked out but as usual i wanted to side with magneto i respect him much more than xavier his attitude towards humans is understandable and he really does want to aid his fellow mutants perhaps some of his methods are a little extreme but i dont think hes evil as such xavier on the other hand is just too nice but its the fact that he and magneto are such opposites that makes the relationship between them so interesting their scenes together send chills up the spine   of course its logan who drives the plot forward his affection for rogue his hatred for cyclops  his lust for jean grey provide many memorable moments his claws do the rest i cant wait for the sequel 910,fantasy
welli cant really say i was expecting much from this movie  and id like to say i wasnt surprised or let down  it was such a cliched film filled with unnecessary one liners and mediocre acting  i also really didnt see much of a plotbut i must give it creditit did have lots of pretty shiny things that made me go ooh and aah  although i havent really taken much stock in special effectswellever  im probably among a minority here but im really really sick of computer animation  im ready for the next stepalthough i must saythe main thing that made me even remotely like this movie was the little easter eggs left for fans of the comic,fantasy
the premise of the is this  natural slow mutation is what causes evolution and is responsible for the human race being here however every few hundred thousand years accelerated mutation happens and humans with certain superhuman abilities come to be it manifests itself during puberty and is triggered by an emotionallycharged eventthe film opens in 1944 poland a concentration camp where the protagonist who will become magneto is an adolescent and his power is first manifest as his mother and father are being dragged away from him next the not too distant future in mississippi where the girl known as rogue anna paquinkisses her boyfriend and almost kills himthere is activity in congress to legally require mutants to be registered this concerns magneto who hatches a plan to convert large numbers into mutants to thwart that effortthe good mutants become known as the under their guru xavier patrick stewart they become the group that tries to prevent magneto and his guys from achieving their havocthe final scenes at ellis island and the statue of liberty are very inventive and actionfilled  in fact the whole film is an action movie with great costumes and special effects i rate the movie a strong 8 of 10 and is one that i will watch a number of timesi have the dvd picture and surround sound are fine as would be expected with a thx release there are not a lot of extras but one of them a pseudodocumentary on mutants includes comments by the various main actors and some behind the scenes shots that shows how some of the filming was donei have never read the comics but as a 54year old am still able to appreciate and enjoy this film it is everything that mystery men is not,fantasy
 does have its own integrity as a bryan singer film showing continuity with the usual suspects  bleak subversion of a popular genre the vision of an america tainted by the decadance of europe a world run by tired old men the creation of the world by a dubiously motivated powerbroker verbal creates his films world by words professor x by his mind  the sets are nice and austere  there are moments of pleasant surrealism and my instinct applauds the opening concentration camp sequence even if my head says no  but acting action plot character dialogue inspiration fantasy awe  movies are too cool to bother with that kind of thing any more,fantasy
i love science fiction and fantasy films because they are the most escapist of movies and best differentiate the cinema from other art forms like the theatre so i really looked forward to the and hoped that it would come close to the brilliance of the matrix but sadly while there are some excellent special effects and a few thrills it is not in the same class certainly it is a visual treat with no less than ten superb looking mutant characters with a variety of spectacular powers newcomer australian hugh jackman is particularly convincing as the metalliclyenhanced wolverine but overall the casting is fascinating and includes once child star anna pacquin from the piano the british shakespearean actors patrick stewart and ian mckellen and three former models halle berry the flintstones famke janssen goldeneye and rebecca romijnstamos however the film lacks effective pacing and compelling narrative with the damsel in distress ending being particularly weak at least the message is more meaningful and liberal than most sf movies mutants  like ethnic minorities or all groups who are perceived as different  can be good or bad and we should not be too quick to judge,fantasy
and i loved it  this was everything i have been dreaming about since i was 10 years old and read my first uncanny comic book  for those of you who went to see this movie without knowing a single thing about the and were confused all i can say is this movie was not made for you  the diehard fan was clearly the target for this movie and they scored a direct hit  i loved the opening scene showing magnetos first use of his powers as an adolescent  and why didnt they explain all the others origins  thats what the sequels will be for  this movie clearly focused on magnetos hatred and fear of humanity and humanity at larges hatred and fear of mutants in general  the side stories of jean greycyclopswolverine and wolverinerogue were well handled and really brought the characters to life for me  ive seen some comments complaining there were inside jokes that only fans of the comic books would get huh excuse me inside jokes are meant to only be understood by true fans of the comics and tv series anyway im sure there are lots who disagree with me and  thats great but i loved this movie and i am positive that anyone who has seen the tv series or read the comics whether in the last year or 30 years ago will love it as well   10 out of 10 in case you couldnt figure that out from my review,fantasy
not a complete dissapointment like many other scifi films that have come out the last 2 to 3 years is loaded with impressive special effects set designs and for once some good acting however like many other scifi films that have come out the last 2 to 3 years relies more on effects than plot and charecterazation and thatin my opinionhurts the film both pacing wise and style wise you guys already know the plot so ill just say what i liked and what i didnt like good stuff great effects sets good acting and some good action sequences bad stuff mediocre plot little to no charecterazation a somewhat disspointing finale and slow at times great effects and good acting but a mediocre plot and slow at times 12 out of  btw im not too thrilled about the sequels but maybe theyll suprize memaybe,fantasy
i can hardly wait for the sequel to this action packed thriller it seems more and more to me that there still are people out there that want to produce quality  i am so very glad that we have finally seen this long talked about film come to life  i was on the edge of my seat you can be sure of that  everyone else that i spoke to also enjoyed it from beginning to end  i really did like it it is worth seeing a second time and when it comes out on video you can bet that i will be there to buy my copy,fantasy
 the movie is true to the original cartoon series the characters were classic and the plot was creative and engrossing the visual effects and the onscreen chemistry between the actors brings the xcharacters to life i especially enjoyed famke janssens portrayal of the redheaded jean grey there was action with intelligence which sets this movie aside from other action films i never wouldve expected depth history and origins from a movie that originated as a comic but the movie did just that seeing once just isnt enough i give it two enthusiastic thumbs up,fantasy
i think is a good movie is a movie for a kid to enjoy unless youre a loser who likes scary movie which is the stupidest movie i have ever seenor mi2 which is not that good ether is the best movie i have seen so far this summer,fantasy
i admit i was skeptical going into  i feared the plot and acting would be too melodramatic the characters would be too onedimensional and the action sequences would be too overthetop as is usually the case with marvel comics movie adaptations  in short i went into the theater expecting batman  robin a true travesty of the film industry instead what i got was a pleasant cinematic surprise equaled only by last years the matrixmy wife an newbie and i a 20year veteran of the comic books both loved  with its perfect blend of plot characterization acting and action takes its place as the best comicbooktobigscreen adaptation ive seen  gone are the campy moronics of the batman franchise the cheesy special effects of the superman films and the myriad things that made all previous marvel comics films except blade so heinously unwatchable   doesnt just hit a home run for comic book movies it hits a grand slamin my opinion is the summer movie of 2000  my only complaint is that i have to wait who know how long for a sequel,fantasy
after waiting 15 years ever since the comic book became a monthly must read i am pleasantly surprised at how satisfied i am with the new moviethe actions scenes are well directed and the special effects stand up to postmatrix expectations  but the movies strongest asset is its actors  particularly hugh jackman wolverine and anna paquin rogue   who knew that an unknown aussie and the girl from the piano would be able to steal the show from patrick stewart and ian mckellan  jackman and paquin have an amazing chemistry  sometimes sexual other times fraternal  stewart and mckellan bring dignity to their roles as always and you leave the film wishing the two had more scenes togethercheers to bryan singer and everyone else involved  i look forward to the sequels hopefully storm and jean greys characters will be explored  sorry cyclops your character wasnt interesting in the comics and you continue to be a bit boring,fantasy
minor spoilers followi know many people prefer x2 because it boasts superior production values and more action but in all the important respects  character development measured pacing intellectual stimulation etc  this film buries its successor  whereas x2 collapses under the weight of a huge cast and contents itself with running helterskelter from one battle to the next concentrates on a few characters and takes its time setting up a fascinating universebelieve it or not senator kelly is the most important character he establishes the essential moral conflict that faces mutants and society and while hes clearly supposed to be wrong the film allows him to have a point  the brotherhood is after all a sinister bunch these are the mutants hes worried about and we are clearly supposed to feel sympathy for kelly after he is tortured and killed by them  ultimately the film does have a powerful and liberal message of tolerance but it treats its messages opponent with respect and i admire that sense of fairnessaside from all the deep stuff the movie is also a rockin good time stylish direction nifty effects that are not overused as in the sequel and a few good action sequences keep the proceedings from becoming too pompous and preachy  magnetos origin segment is effective if a tad thoughtless im not quite sure if it trivializes the holocaust or not and poor rogues isolation is wellconveyed  jackman is a cool wolverine im glad he was basically unknown and even cyclops and jean grey arent bad the only real loss is halle berry as storm who cant act to save her life i havent seen monsters ball but i can hardly believe that such a wooden performer won an oscar for another film  perhaps she thinks that shes too good for this material in that case she shouldnt have been castthat bump aside this movie is all good  kamens score is overthetop but it fits and is certainly more engaging than ottmans annoying orchestral blasts in x2  production values are solid if already dating the rapid advance of computer technology is such a nuisance  there are some great set pieces especially magnetos confrontation with the cops  you know theres really nothing to complain about except that they hacked out some good scenes that are available for viewing on the dvd releasesi dont even like the comic but i love this movie  thats a testament to how good it is  after the dramatic final scene with professor x and magneto i was jazzed for the sequel i wanted to cheer as the closing theme music started  too bad i was letdown in a big way,fantasy
watching spiderman i found myself asking certain questions like what went wrong  to answer some of these i find myself turning to the surprisingly pleasing  is superior to spiderman for a number of reasons first i like the way bryan singer was able to take super heros and villains and place them into the real world  looks and feels very authentic to me and i like that  spiderman never seemed like anything but a a cartoon that magically came to life  does the whole origin deal quickly you get what you need to know and you get to see a mutant trying to come to terms with her powers rogue  doesnt waste time though it quickly introduces its villains and their reasons and quickly introduces us to the heros that must stop them  is about 25 minutes shorter then spiderman but it seems much longer because they are able to get more valuable things done in the running time  i was never bored in unlike spiderman  was made for much less but the cgi is much more convincing and the action scenes play out much stronger then they do in spiderman  to final things off has a strong cast but it benefits mostly from a standout performance by hugh jackmanin closing stands alone as a great film  watching spiderman i found myself wondering why cant this be more like,fantasy
peoples main problem with was that it didnt follow the comic well in my mind it hit the nail on the head tolerance was the original theme in stan lees and was played out beautifully here the movie is about the next step of human evolution mutants or homo superior are born with special powers and are therefore feared and hated by regular humans professor charles xaiver patrick stewart wants to look past their differences and look toward a peaceful coexsistance but magneto ian mckellen another mutant wants to wipe out humans to make way for his kind he can only see the evil of homo sapiens and will stop at nothing to destroy them like malcolm x and dr martin luther king they both had the same agenda the same goal but could not see eye to eye about how to do so and thats where the recruitment comes in the brotherhoodmagnetos team and thexaivers team go head to head with each other one set on destroying man and the other protecting those that hate and fear them it doesnt matter if characters were left out or if their wasnt enough fighting in it the message was perfect and thats really all that mattersrating12 out of ,fantasy
this movie did get me out to the theatre simply because it was i rented it on dvd and enjoyed it again because it was i bought it well you get the picture the are simply cool i collected them when i was a kid so i have the origins of many of these charactersas a fan of the comic book i was disappointed with how they handled intros and rearranged history note the lack of nightcrwaler and colossus bobby drake iceman being younger and not in the while rogue starts out completely different this list goes on and on i should have hated it but i realize in a 2 hour film you cant pack in 200  comic books so with that as a given and i forgave director bryan singer a bitif you can get past that you have incredible special effects  except where wolverine spins around the statue of liberty spike shown in the trailers that was pathetically rendered the special effects nailed cyclops ruby red optic blasts wolverines regenerative ability and storms elemental power even kitty prydes ability while a relatively simple effect is pulled off just like an fan would expect they did screw up with mystique but thats because she cant imitate inanimate objects apart from clothing  we blame that on a lazy script writerthe movie has some pretty good action scenes but not the all out multimutant brawls in the same area we came to expect from the comic the danger room is missing too though hopefully well find nightcrawler in there practicing in 2the plot is pretty simple evil mutant a magneto has a pinky and the brain type of scheme the the find out about and must stop the only character development and backgrounds that are explored are for wolverine rogue magneto and professor xavier  in that order all the other characters come off as filler and window decoration that just happens to fight again hopefully rectified in 2as far as the acting and casting goes halle berry was a bad casting job storm should have been played by angela basset  no one else berry just wasnt convincing as a strong willed very independent person though she didnt have much to do a simple 20 second scene of storm freaking out in the elevator shes supposed to be clausterphobic and have a flashback to being trapped inside a collapsed house would have done it for her character instead she comes off with 2 lines that even sound like a hack script writer wrote them famke jannsen looks great as jean grey but we didnt get to see enough of her acting to tell if shed be any good as the phoenix lets hope for that in movie 3 or 4 cyclops was ok but also an underdeveloped character the real acting is done by patrick stewart xavier hugh jackman loganwolverine ian mckellen magneto and anna paquin rogue stewart and mckellen deliver both great acting as always and play the characters in line with the comics their lines were idealistic morality plays but a bit interesting jackman and paquin come off as the confused and messed up people that the comic characters are so they both get nods as doing good jobsall in all this is an enjoyable picture even to those new to the theres just enough action to keep it interesting with a bit of dialog here and there to keep it from being all flash i gave it 8 would have given it a 75 if available out of 10 because of the lack of things in it and the lack of polish on some of the scenes the movie could have ran 2 hours and been much better singer could have developed the others with that time but i suspect singer was aiming it towards people who have a hard time sitting still for over 90 minutes it weighs in at the compromise time of 104 minutesid recommend a rental before purchase for anything this film is no exception watch it a few times if you like it buy it,fantasy
i love this film its a great film incredible effects and wonderful characters this film brings back to life the comic adventures bryan singer is advancing with this film hugh jackman is very good in this film ian mckellen its very good tooi know this film is the best superhero film i have ever seen 1010,fantasy
first they didnt use all the characters  after that mystque lives  of course there is going to e a sequel  its already in production  the movie is awesome  if you like action then you are going to like this  heck if this movie sucked then there wouldnt be a sequel being made,fantasy
without giving away anything of the film i feel that will still appeal hugely to fans of scifi action films and the more specific superhero genre for both readers of old and people coming in to watch with little foreknowledge the film does its best to make itself worthwhile what i can say is the film is pretty fast paced uses excellent special effects and boasts a cast who have done their homework on the characters if you like movies like i do with plenty to keep you occupied then this is well worth watching renting or buying happy viewing,fantasy
im quite a big fan of and i think this film did justice to the comics unlike other films the mutants were great looking the action was fast and exciting and the special effects were fantastic the cast fitted their characters perfectly especially hugh jackman as wolverine plus halle berry and famke janssen looked hot in those tight black leather costumes,fantasy
 deserved more credit than it got from the critics it took the task of introducing ten different characters and creating an interesting story a very difficult thing to do if this film were done by any other director or with any other cast it would of easily bombed the cast hits every mark by taking their roles seriously the movie belongs to patrick stewart ian mckellen anna paquin and the terrific newcomer hugh jackmanthe plot is basically the same as the comic book in the near future where mutant humans are outcasted one mutant leader with an optimistic view of the future is at war with another and his superhero team of mutants at his private academy must fight to protect those that hate and fear them the movie works because of the good performances the suprising specialeffects and the fact that its not just an action film that is why is possibly the best comic book to film adaptation ever,fantasy
 is a great movie from marvel comics my favorite character from this movie is wolverine because he is awesome this is my favorite patrick stewart and hugh jackman movie if you have not seen this movie go rent or buy see this movie you wont be very disappointed  out of  stars and 10 out of 10 stars,fantasy
comparing it to other comic book adaption movies this one rises high above them all i mean batman and its 3 sequels and superman and its 4 sequels  there were very corny movies that completely abandoned their original comics though superman was close but now has come in that category and blows the other all away it has excellent directing and cast of characters though some of the acting was weak but for the most part ignorable the special effects werent by far the best but were not horrible either and the storyline was also good ,fantasy
i give this film a 10 it had everything  most of the characters were developed enough for you to understand what was going on even if you have never read the comics or watched the animated series  the best parts for me were the funny exchanges between the characters cyclops and wolverine  i also thought it was wonderful that characters were chosen that looked somewhat like the comic book characters eg hugh jackman as wolverine halle berry as storm etcmost of all the special effects were out of this world  i enjoyed watching special effects that did not look totally fake  the performances were outstanding the effects were great what more can one ask for,fantasy
if you are a fan of the comic and cartoon series you should defintely see it if you havent the special effects are great and the casting for most of the actors and actresses are great patrick stewart was definitely born to be professor xavier ian mckellen was nearly as a perfect as magneto hugh jackman made a very good wolverine despite the height differencesfamke jensen was also a good jean grey i heard people said she was a bit to old but she was really perfect its just that jean grey has such a mature character that she appears that way clyclops was ok james marsden did appear a bit young in comparison to famke but they had potential halle berry as a storm was a bit empty i was not able to tell if was halle berry not acting well in the storm part or maybe the storm part having such few lines that halle berry couldnt shine despite that she was ok anna paquin however was the worst dissapoint to me in the whole movie she is a wonderful actress but just not for the part of rogue she was a bit too weak and childlish even for a teenage rogue she was also a lot shorter and she just couldnt portray the southern belle who everyone grew to love rogue even as a teen when portrayed in the comics and cartoons series was much taller vibrant and stronger despite not having her powers yet on the villan side it was ok tylar mane couldnt do much as sabretooth so there wasnt much to improve on rebecca stamos has a much potential and she was great as mystique along with ray parker as toad besides the casting which was for the most part ok there was also the plot which focused to much on wolverine its very hard for book to screen adaptations to focus on one plot but superman and batman did it successfully so should have but it didnt despite that just seeing the use their powers was great enough so i would give this movie a 75 go see it but dont be too excited hopefully they will do better in the sequel unfourtunately they cant get rid of anna paquin wonderful actress but just doesnt portray a teen rogue get natalie portman or even better jamie lunar a bit older but as the southern accent going,fantasy
its a great movie with great action scenes fx characters with some depth cute chicks and everything else that turns it to be one of the best few action flicks well done the only problem may be that its sometimes predictable and too short also it may leave you waiting for more but soon well have a sequel pretty obvious there was going to be one above everything its an incredible movie where you wont waste youre time,fantasy
i thought this movie was really good  the only problem i had with it is as a fan of mystique i didnt like the way she was portrayed in the film  she was more beastial than i thought she should have been and i thought was she was or was not wearing did not fit the character the way she was done in the comic books  but overall the film was a really good one and i would recommend it to anyone who likes the comics or cartoons,fantasy
i cant quite explain what attracts me to but when i was 13 i became an xfreak i watched the cartoon religiously i read the comics when i could find them and even now i still like to catch an episode if evolution naturally i went to see the day it came out and i love it so much comics are touch to adapt to the big screen especially comics with 30 years of history and a cast that make the cast of a soap opera look like a small ensemble not every xfan got to see all their favorite mutants on the big screen i still pray gambit at least gets a cameo in the sequel but they did do a good job of narrowing the cast down so that everyone had a good portion of screen timethe casting was great all the actors portrayed their characters perfectly the goody twoshoes cyclops the brilliant jean grey the alienated rogue the most perfect casting of all is hugh jackman as resident badass wolverine considering he wasnt the first choice and got the part out of pure luck hugh turns out to be the best character of all not to mention extremely yummythis movie is great for fans but for nonfans as well you dont know a thing about to enjoy this movie which is the best kind of adaption the kind that pleases both fans and newcomers great flick,fantasy
since the age of about 8 ive been a fan of the when the film was released i eagerly awaited it then i saw it and thought it was good but it needed more action hugh jackman is bad ass as wolive and his performance makes up for the lack of action,fantasy
this movie has a very good character development the action scenes are very well done the scenario is just complex enough to keep you attentive but not too complex so the film is distracting some scenes are fantastic the one with all the guns redirected on the cops is great for examplei really liked this one,fantasy
from the off this is a good movie and im a fan of the comics but this was still disappointing anyone who has read the tommorow people arc in ultimate x men will know what i mean when i say that is what the movie should have been quick introductions fr the characters and then a rollercoaster action pic all the way what we get is a fairly slow movie with only a few action scenes it has a distinct lack of bite senator kelly is underused and should have been accompanied by sentinals but thats all my complaints except why toad why not gambit colossus beast iceman in a real role or angel there arent nearly enough mutants used however the film is the best comic book movie yet it does have lots of good features and the special effects are nice but itll do it isnt bad but it could have been brilliant,fantasy
i have never been a fan of but when i saw the movie all that changed i have watched it start to finish at least 20 times although it is a bit gross in places it sure makes up for that perhaps i am just easily entertained but is the most re watchable movie i have ever seen if you havent seen it yet you should,fantasy
what do i think of this moviewhy do you ask the questions of answers you already knowin 1963 stan lee wrote and jack kirby illustrated a team of heroes who not only fought crime but also the prejudices of being born with their powers they claimed that too many radioactive spiders cosmic ray trips and gamma bombs would spoil marvel so they made the mutants in 1975 len wein chris claremont and dave cockrum made a new team of since then the were the greatest heroes on the greatest comics ever made the cartoon series featuring cal dodd as wolverine chris potter as gambit iona morris as storm and ed buza as beast was the best cartoon made by marvelnext to gijoe transformers and spiderman and his amazing friends now the movie patrick stewart professor xavier sir ian mckellen erik magnus lensherr hugh jackman jonathan logan wolfe anna paquin maria dacanto james marsden scott summers halle berry ororo munroe famke jansen jean grey rebecca stamos raven darkholme tyler mane victor graydon creed reg park mortimer toynbeethese actors bought the to life in spectacular manner especially patrick halle and sir ian who were the best of the cast the chemistry between the teacher and the brotherhoods misunderstood leader was oscar material the action of the movie was well done with no one team dominating the other in the climax my problem was the dialogue the writing staff should have read more of the comics to understand that this film had no place for hollywood pg13 salty language james cyclops was a royal jerk and if sir ian had my personality when hughs logan told him that he was full of youknowwhat wolvies neck would be full of puncture wounds from six adamantium claws if you know what i mean conclusively the film earned a b from me 8 out of 10 uncanny but could have been uncannier if you loved this movie watchevolution on kids wb great cartoon featuring scott mcneil as wolverinenote if there is an sequel dont forget ed buza as beast roland kickinger as colossus yuji okumoto as sunfire lori petty as boom boom russel crowe as mister sinister lou diamond phillips as forge and chris potter as gambit,fantasy

 should have one best picture at the oscars it had a great plot and storyline and it was full of actioni cannot fault this movie one bit it amazingif you like action or sci fi movies you will love thisi think that it was a little underrated thoughit should be a classicthe acting is great and hugh jackman is superb1010if you like this try 2 2002supermanstar trek,fantasy
this peace of emptiness would have been alright if i simply went to the movie theater happened to see its poster and went to see it mind you it would not be great but would feel alright as it was i waited for it for three months i read all about it and when i finally went it failed to satisfy for one thing the characters were no good where may i ask was gambit for example since when is rogue a confused little girl what happened to the voluptuous back talking woman i would have preferred more concentration on mystique since she was just about the only interesting character in this washed out rag i sincerely hope spiderman will be better i do not have any hopes for the future23,fantasy
i dont think x men was done very well especially when i think about how good it could have been there wasnt that much i liked about it im pretty familiar with all the characters and most of the storylines instead of using a good plot such as days of future past pheonix saga etc etc they went ahead and made up their own a mutant ray that will turn everyone in ny into mutants puh leasehowever though i didnt like most of it some of it was alright like the scene with mystique and senator kelly in the helicopter when shes telling him about her childhood while flash kicking him in the face if only the rest of the movie had the kind of deep seeded tension that this scene had instead of breaking down into less than exhilirating action sequences filled with lazy cgi i mean damn,fantasy
personally i thought the movie did the justice ian mckellen and patrick stewart did a great job bringing class and intelligence to a great film im glad as i am sure most of the world is that the movie companies didnt go for top hollywood actors to play these rolls but wanted the movie to stand on its own two feet and not on the backs of superstarsonly one complaint is to be heard from me where are beast gambit and for that matter jubilee they left out three great and i hope that they will include them in the next movie to have all of the in one movie would be one thing i think would make a sequel even better lets just hope,fantasy
the four lead actors give wonderful performances patrick stewart and ian mckellen give the film an intelligence that you wouldnt expect from a comic book film and hugh jackman and anna paquin give the film real emotion its their relationship that defines the concept that the are tragic superheroes hes a man who chooses to be a loner shes a girl whos forced to be a loner and though jackman gave the most entertaining performance it is paquin who gives the best performance in terms of pure acting she has to make you care about rogue if youre going to care about the movie and she does an excellent job of it paquin plays rogue as a real teenage girl with a horrible affliction you care about her because you believe her character you feel for herdirector bryan singer should be applauded for casting these four excellent actors instead of big name stars or hollywood bimbos by going with quality singer tried to give the comic book genre intellectual and emotional weight he succeededgreat special effects action humor and a great performance from the cast makes the one of the best comic book films ranking alongside batman and superman lets just hope the sequels are better than the sequels to those films,fantasy
mr singer did an awesome job  while the movie isnt great it kept the flavor of the comic i love  first you have to understand the universe is extremely complicated  he tried to pare it down into understandable characters  no one is going to be happy with that since we all have different favorites what he did do was instead of going for the action adventure and totally ignoring what made the favorite it is he kept the humanity of it  we lost out on some slambang action and kept what made the the beloved comic of our time  the fact that these are people who are different  who are tormented because of the fact that they arent like everyone else  god knows weve all experienced that bigotry in one form or another  the stand for all of us thank you mr singer  i went to the movie expecting to be disappointed its not the great movie i wanted but it told the tale like it was supposed to be told oh and jackman didnt almost steal the movie  he stole it and ran away with it  the wolverine character is the one i really expected to be disappointed in  instead he was absolutely perfect  cmon people wolvie has never been a nice guy  hes short cranky stubborn and a warrior hes also the kind of guy a person could bet their life on and win  we dont like him cause hes nice  we like him because of his faults,fantasy
firstly let me state i am not a big fan of thesure ive read one or two of the comicbooks ahd a marvel annual when i was a kid and seen a few episodes fo the animated series on tv but i have to confess that i never really got intohowever i did like what i had seen and it interested me enough to go see the movie at a preview screening in australia  the fact that patrick stewart was cast as professor xavier was a big plus as i generally enjoy any acting work he doesthe movie was a pleasant surprisethe overall acting was done well and hugh jackman did very well as wolverine  what special effects there were werent overdone and the storyline hung together very wellin a way i felt that the movie was more about wolverine than anything else but i suspect that if they make any sequels theyll probably concentrate on other members of thesure the movie is a little short but i came out of it satisfied that i had gotten my moneys worthtalking to people about the movie afterwards i heard the following comments it didnt suck  always a plus as someone who has been reading the comics since the 60s i thoguht the movie was goodand the most often heard comment from a lot of people was i dont know anything about but i really enjoyed itoverall id give the movie 810,fantasy
